H. Early termination. A DROP participant may withdraw from the DROP
program at any time and effectuate a complete retirement from service.
No penalty shall be imposed for early termination of DROP
participation. However, the DROP participant shall not be permitted to
make any withdrawals from the DROP account until DROP participation
has ended.
I. Payout.
(1) Upon the termination date set forth in the DROP election form or
on such date as the DROP participant withdraws or is terminated
from the DROP program, if earlier, the retirement benefits payable
to the participant shall be paid directly to the participant and shall
no longer be credited to the DROP account. Within a period not to
exceed 45 days following the actual termination of a participant's
employment with the Borough of Economy, the DROP participant or
the DROP participant's designated beneficiary, where applicable,
shall elect one of the following options: 1) the accumulated balance
in the DROP account, less any withholding taxes required to be
remitted to the Internal Revenue Service, shall be paid to the DROP
participant or his designated surviving beneficiary in a single lumpsum
payment; or 2) the balance of the DROP participant's DROP
account shall be paid within 45 days directly to the custodian of an
eligible retirement fund as defined in § 402(c)(8)(b) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986 (IRC) or in the case of an eligible rollover
distribution to the surviving spouse of a deceased DROP
participant, an eligible retirement fund that is an individual
retirement account or an individual retirement annuity as
described in IRC § 402(c)(9). If the DROP participant or designated
beneficiary fails to elect a method of payment within 60 days after
the DROP participant's termination date, the DROP participant's
DROP account shall be paid in a lump-sum as provided above. All
distributions of the DROP account shall comply with IRC
§ 401(a)(9).
(2) Under this Subsection I, a distributee may elect to have an eligible
rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible rollover retirement
fund by way of a direct rollover. For purposes of this section a
"distributee" includes a DROP participant, a DROP participant's
survivor as provided by Act 600 of 1956, 53 P.S. § 767 et seq., or in
lieu thereof, the DROP participant's designated beneficiary and a
DROP participant's former spouse who is an alternate payee under
a qualified domestic relations order. For purposes of this section,
"eligible rollover distribution" has the meaning given the term by
IRC § 402(f)(2)(A) except that a qualified trust shall be considered
an eligible fund only if it accepts the distributee's eligible rollover
distribution and, in the case of an eligible rollover distribution to a
surviving spouse, an eligible retirement fund is an "individual
retirement account" or an "individual retirement annuity" as those
terms are defined in IRC § 408(a) and (b).

J. Death.
(1) A DROP participant's eligibility to participate in the DROP
terminates upon the death of the DROP participant. If a DROP
participant dies on or after the effective date of participation in the
DROP but before the first monthly retirement benefit due the DROP
participant for that month has been credited to his DROP account,
the fund shall pay the monthly retirement benefit as though the
DROP participant had not elected DROP participation and had died
after the DROP participant's effective date of retirement but before
receipt of the DROP participant's first regular retirement benefit. If
a DROP participant dies while participating in the DROP and after
his monthly retirement benefits have begun to have been credited
to his DROP account, the monthly retirement benefit credited to
the DROP participant's DROP account during the month of the
DROP participant's death shall be the final monthly retirement
benefit from the fund credited to his DROP account.
(2) Except for those benefits specifically payable as a result of death
incurred in the course of performing a hazardous public duty, the
survivors of the DROP participant who dies shall not be eligible to
receive retirement system death benefits payable in the event of
the death of an active member. The DROP participant's survivor(s)
shall be eligible to receive survivor benefits normally payable in the
event of the death of a retired participant.
K. Disability. If a DROP participant becomes eligible for a disability benefit
from the fund and terminates employment, the monthly nondisability
retirement benefit of the DROP participant shall terminate.
L. Eligibility for other benefits. Except for benefits specifically foregone by
the DROP participant pursuant to Subsection D, a DROP participant
shall be eligible for the employee benefits provided to active employees
that is appended to this section as Appendix A.34
M. Eligibility for statutory benefits. A DROP participant shall be eligible for
all preretirement benefits for employees otherwise provided by law
including, but not limited to the following:

N. Designation of beneficiary. A DROP participant may designate a DROP
beneficiary who shall be entitled to apply for and receive the DROP
participant's DROP account in the event of the DROP participant's
death while participating in the DROP. In the event that a DROP
participant does not designate a beneficiary and dies while
participating in the DROP, his DROP account will be paid to his
survivor(s) as determined under Act 600 of 1956 and if no such
survivors exist, then to his estate.
O. Amendment. Any amendments to the DROP ordinance shall be
consistent with the provisions covering deferred retirement option
plans set forth in any applicable collective bargaining agreement or
state or federal law, and shall be binding upon all future participants
and upon all DROP participants who have balances in their DROP
accounts.
P. Taxation, attachment and assignment. Except as provided in this
section, the right of a DROP participant to any benefit or right accrued
or accruing under the provisions of this § 31-18 and moneys in the
DROP participant's DROP account are exempt from any state or
municipal tax, levy and sale, garnishment, attachment, spouse's
election or any other process whatsoever. Rights and benefits under
this § 31-18 shall be subject to forfeiture as provided by the Public
Employees Forfeiture Act [the Act of July 8, 1978 (P.L. 752, No. 140)].
Forfeitures under this section or under any other provision of law may
not be applied to increase the benefits that any DROP participant
otherwise would receive under this § 31-18. Rights under this § 31-18
shall be subject to attachment in favor of an alternate payee as set forth
in a qualified domestic relations order.

trust for the exclusive benefit of fund participants who are or were
DROP participants and for their beneficiaries.

of its provisions shall be held to be unconstitutional or illegal, the
validity of any of the remaining provisions of this § 31-18 shall not be
affected thereby. It is hereby expressly declared as the intent of the

A. Definitions. Unless otherwise specifically set forth in this § 31-20, the
defined terms used herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in
the remainder of Chapter 31.
DROP  The DROP is created as an optional form of benefit under the
existing Borough of Economy Police Pension Fund ("fund)". The DROP
shall be for a maximum two-year term.
DROP ACCOUNT  A separate ledger account created to accumulate
the DROP pension benefit for a DROP participant.
DROP PARTICIPANT  An employee and participant in the fund who
attains the later of age 54 and 25 years of service, and who has elected
to participate in the DROP program.
QUALIFYING OFFICER  Any full-time active police officer of Economy
Borough who has attained age 54 with 25 years of service and thus is
eligible for normal retirement under the fund prior to entry into the
DROP program.
B. Eligibility. Qualifying officers who so elect between July 1 and
December 31 of the year in which they become a qualifying officer may
enter into the DROP during this period but no earlier than the first day
of any month following the attainment of the later of age 54 and 25
years of service.
C. Written election. A qualifying officer in the fund electing to participate
in the DROP program must complete and execute a "DROP election
form" which shall evidence the DROP participant's participation in the
DROP program and the DROP participant's election to forego active
membership in the fund and document the DROP participant's rights
and obligations under the DROP. The form must be signed by the DROP
participant and the chief administrative officer of the fund and
submitted to the employer prior to the date on which the DROP
participant elects to enter the DROP ("election date"). The DROP
election form shall include an irrevocable notice to the employer by the
DROP participant that the DROP participant shall terminate from
employment with the employer effective on a specific date not more
than two years from the effective date of the DROP participant's entry
into the DROP. In addition, all retirement documents required by the
Borough must be filed and presented to Council for approval of
retirement and commencement of the monthly pension benefit. Once
the retirement application has been approved by Council, it shall
§ 31-18 ECONOMY CODE § 31-20
29:60
become irrevocable. A DROP participant's participation shall become
effective the day following his election date.
(1) After a DROP participant enters the DROP program, contributions
to the fund by the participant will cease, and the amount of the
monthly benefits will be frozen except for any applicable cost-ofliving
adjustment (COLA) increases, if any, awarded to all pension
recipients.
(2) Participants should consult a tax advisor of their choice prior to
considering the DROP program, as there may be serious tax
implications and/or consequences to participating in the DROP.
D. Limitation on pension accrual. After the effective date of the DROP
election, the participant shall no longer earn or accrue additional years
of service for pension purposes, including the calculation of any service
increment should such a service increment become available to active
participants in the fund. The DROP participant shall also forego any
growth in salary after the election date for the purpose of calculating
retirement benefits under the fund.
E. Ineligibility for reenrollment in DROP. Once a DROP participant's DROP
participation terminates, he shall be ineligible to reenroll in the DROP
even if the former DROP participant is reemployed by the local
government with renewed active membership in the fund.
F. Benefit calculation. For all fund purposes, service of a DROP participant
shall remain as it existed on the effective date of commencement of
participation in the DROP program. Service thereafter shall not be
recognized or used for the calculation or determination of any benefits
payable by the fund, including any service increments that may be
available. The average monthly earnings of the DROP participant for
pension calculation purposes shall remain as it existed on the effective
date of commencement of participation in the DROP program. Earnings
or increases in earnings thereafter shall not be recognized or used for
the calculation or determination of any benefits payable by the fund.
The pension benefit payable to the participant shall increase only as a
result of cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs), if any, effective on or after
the date of the DROP participant's participation in the DROP.
G. Payments to DROP account.
(1) The monthly retirement benefits that would have been payable had
the DROP participant elected to cease employment and receive a
retirement benefit shall, upon the DROP participant commencing
participation in the DROP program, be credited on the first day of
each month into a separate ledger account established by the fund
administrator to track and accumulate the participant's monthly
pension benefits. This account shall be designated the "DROP
account." The DROP account shall not contain a guaranteed
interest rate but shall be credited with interest at the actual rate
earned by the DROP account, but shall not be less than 0% nor
§ 31-20 POLICE DEPARTMENT § 31-20
29:61
greater than 4.5%, and shall be compounded monthly. The DROP
account shall be a segregated account into which each DROP
participant's monthly retirement benefit shall be deposited. All
earnings or losses credited to the DROP account will be included
in the final cash settlement. The DROP account shall be invested
in an insured savings account, money market account or a mutual
fund invested in ultra-short-term treasuries as may be selected by
the fund administrator. All earnings or losses credited to the DROP
account will be included in the final cash settlement.
(2) The DROP shall at all times comply with the annual benefit
limitations of IRC § 415 and the regulations thereto.
H. Early termination. A DROP participant may withdraw from the DROP
program at any time and effectuate a complete retirement from service.
No penalty shall be imposed for early termination of DROP
participation. However, the DROP participant shall not be permitted to
make any withdrawals from the DROP account until DROP participation
has ended.
I. Payout.
(1) Upon the termination date set forth on the DROP election form or
on such date as the DROP participant withdraws or is terminated
from the DROP program, if earlier, the retirement benefits payable
to the participant shall be paid directly to the participant and shall
no longer be credited to the DROP account. Within a period not to
exceed 45 days following the actual termination of a participant's
employment with the Borough of Economy, the DROP participant or
the DROP participant's designated beneficiary, where applicable,
shall elect one of the following options: the accumulated balance in
the DROP account, less any withholding taxes required to be
remitted to the Internal Revenue Service, shall be paid to the DROP
participant or his designated surviving beneficiary in a single lumpsum
payment; or the balance of the DROP participant's DROP
account shall be paid within 45 days directly to the custodian of an
eligible retirement fund as defined in Section 402(c)(8)(b) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (IRC) or, in the case of an eligible
rollover distribution to the surviving spouse of a deceased DROP
participant, an eligible retirement fund that is an individual
retirement account or an individual retirement annuity as
described in IRC § 402(c)(9). If the DROP participant or designated
beneficiary fails to elect a method of payment within 60 days after
the DROP participant's termination date, the DROP participant's
DROP account shall be paid in a lump sum as provided above. All
distributions of the DROP account shall comply with IRC
§ 401(a)(9).
(2) Under this Subsection I, a distributee may elect to have an eligible
rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement fund by
way of a direct rollover. For purposes of this section, a "distributee"
§ 31-20 ECONOMY CODE § 31-20
29:62
includes a DROP participant, a DROP participant's survivor as
provided by Act 600 of 1956, 53 P.S. § 767 et. seq., or, in lieu
thereof, the DROP participant's designated beneficiary, and a
DROP participant's former spouse who is an alternate payee under
the qualified domestic relations order. For purposes of this section,
"eligible rollover distribution" has the meaning given the term by
IRC § 402(f)(2)(A), except that a qualified trust shall be considered
an eligible fund only if it accepts the distributee's eligible rollover
distribution; and, in the case of an eligible rollover distribution to
a surviving spouse, an eligible retirement fund is an "individual
retirement account" or an "individual retirement annuity," as those
terms are defined in IRC § 408(a) and (b).
J. Death.
(1) A DROP participant's eligibility to participate in the DROP
terminates upon the death of the DROP participant. If a DROP
participant dies on or after the effective date of participation in the
DROP but before the first monthly retirement benefit due the DROP
participant for that month has been credited to his DROP account,
the fund shall pay the monthly retirement benefit as though the
DROP participant had not elected DROP participation and had died
after the DROP participant's effective date of retirement but before
receipt of the DROP participant's first regular retirement benefit. If
a DROP participant dies while participating in the DROP and after
his monthly retirement benefits have begun to have been credited
to his DROP account, the monthly retirement benefit credited to
the DROP participant's DROP account during the month of the
DROP participant's death shall be the final monthly retirement
benefit from the fund credited to his DROP account.
(2) Except for those benefits specifically payable as a result of death
incurred in the course of performing a hazardous public duty, the
survivors of the DROP participant who dies shall not be eligible to
receive retirement system death benefits payable in the event of
the death of an active member. The DROP participant's survivor(s)
shall be eligible to receive survivor benefits normally payable in the
event of the death of a retired participant.
K. Disability. If a DROP participant becomes eligible for a disability benefit
from the fund and terminates employment, the monthly nondisability
retirement benefit of the DROP participant shall terminate.
L. Eligibility for other benefits. Except for benefits specifically foregone by
the DROP participant pursuant to Subsection D, a DROP participant
shall be eligible for the employee benefits provided to active officers.
M. Eligibility for statutory benefits. A DROP participant shall be eligible for
all preretirement benefits for employees otherwise provided by law,
including, but not limited to, the following:

beneficiary who shall be entitled to apply for and receive the DROP
participant's DROP account in the event of the DROP participant's
death while participating in the DROP. In the event that a DROP
participant does not designate a beneficiary and dies while
participating in the DROP, his DROP account will be paid to his
survivor(s) as determined under Act 600 of 1956, and if no such
survivors exist, then to his estate.
O. Amendment. Any amendments to the DROP Ordinance shall be
consistent with the provisions covering deferred retirement option
plans set forth in any applicable collective bargaining agreement or
state or federal law and shall be binding upon all future participants
and upon all DROP participants who have balances in their DROP
accounts; provided, however, that the provisions of this § 31-20 shall
apply exclusively to those DROP participants electing to participate in
the DROP program on or after January 1, 2014.
P. Taxation, attachment and assignment. Except as provided in this
section, the right of a DROP participant to any benefit or right accrued
or accruing under the provisions of this § 31-20 and moneys in the
DROP participant's DROP account are exempt from a state or municipal
tax, levy and sale, garnishment, attachment, spouse's election or any
other process whatsoever. Rights and benefits under this § 31-20 shall
be subject to forfeiture as provided by the Public Employees Forfeiture

section or under any other provision of law may not be applied to
increase the benefits that any DROP participant otherwise would

attachment in favor of an alternate payee as set forth in a qualified

or Fire Department may, in its sole discretion, not credit such false
alarms to the subscribers or users if, in their judgment, such false
alarms were caused by unusual phenomena, such as an intense
electrical storm or a nearby explosion, that would activate even a
properly adjusted alarm.
C. Automatic dialers, where a recorded voice message is received, shall
transmit a message approved by the Chief of Police. Said equipment
shall not make more than two telephone calls to the Police Department.
The message shall be no longer than 30 seconds in duration and shall

ARTICLE IV
Identification of Floodplain Areas
§ 92-18. Identification of areas.
§ 92-19. Description and special requirements of identified
floodplain areas.
The identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific areas:
A. Any areas of the Borough of Economy classified as special flood hazard
areas (SFHAs) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and the
accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs), dated August 17,
2015, and issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA), or the most-recent revision thereof, including all digital data
developed as part of the Flood Insurance Study.
B. The above-referenced FIS and FIRMs, and any subsequent revisions
and amendments, are hereby adopted by the Borough of Economy and
declared to be a part of this chapter.
A. The Floodway Area shall be those areas identified in the FIS and the
FIRM as floodways and which represent the channel of a watercourse
and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge
the base flood without increasing the water surface elevation by more
than one foot at any point. This term shall also include floodway areas
which have been identified in other available studies or sources of
information for those special flood hazard areas where no floodway has
been identified in the FIS or FIRM.
(1) Within any Floodway Area, no encroachments, including fill, new
construction, substantial improvements, or other development,
shall be permitted unless it has been demonstrated through
hydrologic and hydraulic analysis performed in accordance with
standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment
would not result in any increase in flood levels within the
community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
(2) Within any Floodway Area, no new construction or development
shall be allowed, unless the appropriate permit is obtained from the
Department of Environmental Protection's regional office.
B. The AE Area/District shall be those areas identified as an AE Zone on
the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base flood
elevations have been provided.
(1) The AE Area adjacent to the floodway shall be those areas
identified as an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared
by FEMA for which base flood elevation have been provided and a
floodway has been delineated.
§ 92-18 (RESERVED) § 92-19
88:111
§ 92-20. Changes in identification of area.
The identified floodplain area may be revised or modified by the Council
where studies or information provided by a qualified agency or person
documents the need for such revision. However, prior to any such change
to the special flood hazard area, approval must be obtained from FEMA.
Additionally, as soon as practicable, but not later than six months after the
date such information becomes available, a community shall notify FEMA
of the changes to the special flood hazard area by submitting technical
or scientific data. See § 92-23B for situations where FEMA notification is
required.
§ 92-21. Boundary disputes.
Should a dispute concerning any identified floodplain boundary arise, an
initial determination shall be made by the Borough of Economy, and any
party aggrieved by this decision or determination may appeal to the
Council. The burden of proof shall be on the appellant.
§ 92-22. Jurisdictional boundary changes.
Prior to development occurring in areas where annexation or other
corporate boundary changes are proposed or have occurred, the community
shall review flood hazard data affecting the lands subject to boundary
changes. The community shall adopt and enforce floodplain regulations in
areas subject to annexation or corporate boundary changes which meet or
exceed those in 44 CFR 60.3.
C. The A Area/District shall be those areas identified as an A Zone on the
FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no base
flood elevations have been provided. For these areas, elevation and
floodway information from other federal, state, or other acceptable
sources shall be used when available. Where other acceptable
information is not available, the base flood elevation shall be
determined by using the elevation of a point on the boundary of the
identified floodplain area which is nearest the construction site. In lieu
of the above, the municipality may require the applicant to determine
the elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering techniques.
Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by
professional engineers or others of demonstrated qualifications, who
shall certify that the technical methods used correctly reflect currently
accepted technical concepts. Studies, analyses, computations, etc.,
shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical
review by the municipality. [Amended 10-13-2015 by Ord. No. 450]

and Economic Development shall be notified prior to any alteration
or relocation of any watercourse.
B. When a community proposes to permit the following encroachments:
any development that causes a rise in the base flood elevations within
the floodway; or any development occurring in Zones A1-30 and Zone
AE without a designated floodway, which will cause a rise of more than
one foot in the base flood elevations; or alteration or relocation of a
stream (including, but not limited to, installing culverts and bridges),
the applicant shall (as per 44 CFR Part 65.12):
(1) Apply to FEMA for conditional approval of such action prior to
permitting the encroachments to occur.
(2) Upon receipt of the Administrator's conditional approval of map
change and prior to approving the proposed encroachments, a
community shall provide evidence to FEMA of the adoption of
floodplain management ordinances incorporating the increased
base flood elevations and/or revised floodway reflecting the postproject
condition.

ARTICLE I
General Provisions
§ 155-1. Short title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Economy Borough
Stormwater Management Ordinance."
§ 155-2. Statement of findings.
The governing body of the municipality finds that:
A. Stormwater runoff from lands modified by human activities threatens
public health and safety by causing decreased infiltration of rainwater
and increased runoff flows and velocities, which overtax the carrying
capacity of existing streams and storm sewers, and greatly increases
the cost to the public to manage stormwater.
B. Inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting
from land development and redevelopment throughout a watershed can
also harm surface water resources by changing the natural hydrologic
patterns, accelerating stream flows (which increase scour and erosion
of streambeds and streambanks thereby elevating sedimentation),
destroying aquatic habitat and elevating aquatic pollutant
concentrations and loadings such as sediments, nutrients, heavy metals
and pathogens. Groundwater resources are also impacted through loss
of recharge.
C. A program of stormwater management, including reasonable regulation
of land development and redevelopment causing loss of natural
infiltration, is fundamental to the public health, safety, welfare, and the
protection of the people of the municipality and all the people of the
commonwealth, their resources, and the environment.
D. Stormwater can be an important water resource by providing
groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams,
which also protects and maintains surface water quality.
E. Public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an
essential component in successfully addressing stormwater.
F. Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to
implement a program of stormwater controls. These municipalities are
required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their
separate storm sewer systems under the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES).
G. Nonstormwater discharges to municipal separate storm sewer systems
can contribute to pollution of waters of the commonwealth by the
municipality.
§ 155-1 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT § 155-3
155:227
§ 155-3. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to promote health, safety, and welfare within
the municipality and its watershed by minimizing the harms and maximizing
the benefits described in § 155-2 of this chapter, through provisions
designed to:
§ 155-4. Statutory authority.
The municipality is empowered to regulate land use activities that affect
stormwater impacts by the authority of the Municipalities Planning Code.51
§ 155-5. Applicability.
A. Manage stormwater runoff impacts at their source by regulating
activities that cause the problems.
B. Provide review procedures and performance standards for stormwater
planning and management.
C. Utilize and preserve the existing natural drainage systems as much as
possible.
D. Manage stormwater impacts close to the runoff source, which requires
a minimum of structures and relies on natural processes.
E. Focus on infiltration of stormwater, to maintain groundwater recharge,
to prevent degradation of surface water and groundwater quality and to
otherwise protect water resources.
F. Maintain existing flows and quality of streams and watercourses.
G. Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including
regulations at 235 Pa. Code Chapter 93.4a to protect and maintain
existing uses and maintain the level of water quality to support those
uses in all streams, and to protect and maintain water quality in special
protection streams.
H. Prevent scour and erosion of stream banks and streambeds.
I. Provide for proper operations and maintenance of all permanent
stormwater management BMP's that are implemented in the
municipality.
J. Provide a mechanism to identify controls necessary to meet the NPDES
permit requirements.
K. Implement an illegal discharge detection and elimination program to
address nonstormwater discharges into the municipality's separate
storm sewer system.

§ 155-3 ECONOMY CODE § 155-5
155:228
§ 155-6. Repealer.
Any other ordinance provision(s) or regulation of the municipality
inconsistent with any of the provisions of this chapter is hereby repealed to
the extent of the inconsistency only.
§ 155-7. Severability.
In the event that any section or provision of this chapter is declared invalid
by a court of competent jurisdiction, such decision shall not affect the
validity of the remaining provisions of this chapter.
§ 155-8. Compatibility with other requirements.
A. This chapter applies to any regulated earth disturbance activities
within the municipality and all stormwater runoff entering into the
municipality's separate storm sewer system from lands within the
boundaries of the municipality.
B. Earth disturbance activities and associated stormwater management
controls are also regulated under existing state law and implementing
regulations. This chapter shall operate in coordination with those
parallel requirements; the requirements of this chapter shall be no less
restrictive in meeting the purposes of this chapter than state law.
A. Approvals issued and actions taken under this chapter do not relieve
the applicant of the responsibility to secure required permits or
approvals for activities regulated by any other code, law, regulation or
ordinance. To the extent that this chapter imposes more rigorous or
stringent requirements for stormwater management, the specific
requirements contained in this chapter shall be followed.
B. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to affect any of the
municipality's requirements regarding stormwater matters which do
not conflict with the provisions of this chapter, such as local stormwater
management design criteria (e.g., inlet spacing, inlet type, collection
system design and details, outlet structure design, etc.). Conflicting
provisions in other municipal ordinances or regulations shall be
construed to retain the requirements of this chapter addressing state
water quality requirements.

Water quality involves the chemical, biological and physical
characteristics of surface water bodies. After regulated earth
disturbance activities are complete, these characteristics can be
impacted by addition of pollutants such as sediment and changes
in habitat through increased flow volumes and/or rates as a result
of changes in land surface area from those activities. Therefore,
permanent discharges to surface waters must be managed to
protect the stream bank, streambed and structural integrity of the
waterway to prevent these impacts.

Stormwater Management for Water Quality
§ 155-10. General requirements for stormwater management.
§ 155-11. Permit requirements by other government entities.
The following permit requirements may apply to certain regulated earth
disturbance activities, and must be met prior to commencement of
regulated earth disturbance activities, as applicable:
A. All regulated earth disturbance activities within the municipality shall
be designed, implemented, operated and maintained to meet the
purposes of this chapter, through these two elements:
(1) Erosion and sediment control during the earth disturbance
activities (e.g., during construction), and
(2) Water quality protection measures after completion of earth
disturbance activities (e.g., after construction), including
operations and maintenance.
B. No regulated earth disturbance activities within the municipality shall
commence until the requirements of this chapter are met.
C. Erosion and sediment control during regulated earth disturbance
activities shall be addressed as required by § 155-12.
D. Postconstruction water quality protection shall be addressed as
required by § 155-13. Operations and maintenance of permanent
stormwater BMP's shall be addressed as required by Article IV.
E. All best management practices (BMPs) used to meet the requirements
of this chapter shall conform to the state water quality requirements
and any more stringent requirements as determined by the
municipality.
F. Techniques described in Appendix A (Low-Impact Development)52 of
this chapter are encouraged, because they reduce the costs of
complying with the requirements of this chapter and the state water
quality requirements.
A. All regulated earth disturbance activities subject to permit
requirements by DEP under regulations at 25 Pa. Code Chapter 102.
B. Work within natural drainage ways subject to permit by DEP under 25
Pa. Code Chapter 105.
C. Any stormwater management facility that would be located in or
adjacent to surface waters of the commonwealth, including wetlands,
subject to permit by DEP under 25 Pa. Code Chapter 105.
52.Editor's Note: Appendix A is included at the end of this chapter.
§ 155-10 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT § 155-11
155:235
§ 155-12. Erosion and sediment control during regulated earth
disturbance activities.
§ 155-13. Water quality requirements after regulated earth
disturbance activities are complete.
D. Any stormwater management facility that would be located on a state
highway right-of-way, or require access from a state highway, shall be
subject to approval by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation
(PENNDOT).
E. Culverts, bridges, storm sewers or any other facilities which must pass
or convey flows from the tributary area and any facility which may
constitute a dam subject to permit by DEP under 25 Pa. Code Chapter
105.
A. No regulated earth disturbance activities within the municipality shall
commence until approval by the municipality of an erosion and
sediment control plan for construction activities.
B. DEP has regulations that require an erosion and sediment control plan
for any earth disturbance activity of 5,000 square feet or more under 25
Pa. Code § 102.4(b).
C. In addition, under 25 Pa. Code Chapter 92, a DEP NPDES construction
activities permit is required for regulated earth disturbance activities.
D. Evidence of any necessary permit(s) for regulated earth disturbance
activities from the appropriate DEP regional office or County
Conservation District must be provided to the municipality. The
issuance of a NPDES construction permit [or permit coverage under the
state-wide general permit (PAG-2)] satisfies the requirements of
§ 155-12A.
E. A copy of the erosion and sediment control plan and any required
permit, as required by DEP regulations, shall be available at the project
site at all times.
A. No regulated earth disturbance activities within the municipality shall
commence until approval by the municipality of a plan which
demonstrates compliance with state water quality requirements after
construction is complete.
B. The BMP's must be designed, implemented and maintained to meet
state water quality requirements and any other more stringent
requirements as determined by the municipality.
C. To control postconstruction stormwater impacts from regulated earth
disturbance activities, state water quality requirements can be met by
BMPs, including site design, which provide for replication of
preconstruction stormwater infiltration and runoff conditions, so that
postconstruction stormwater discharges do not degrade the physical,
§ 155-11 ECONOMY CODE § 155-13
155:236
chemical or biological characteristics of the receiving waters. As
described in the DEP Comprehensive Stormwater Management Policy
(392-0300-002, September 28, 2002), this may be achieved by the
following:
(1) Infiltration: replication of preconstruction stormwater infiltration
conditions.
(2) Treatment: use of water quality treatment BMP's to ensure filtering
out of the chemical and physical pollutants from the stormwater
runoff.
(3) Stream bank and streambed protection: management of volume
and rate of postconstruction stormwater discharges to prevent
physical degradation of receiving waters (e.g., from scouring).
D. DEP has regulations that require municipalities to ensure design,
implementation and maintenance of best management practices
(BMPs) that control runoff from new development and redevelopment
after regulated earth disturbance activities are complete. These
requirements include the need to implement postconstruction
stormwater BMP's with assurance of long-term operations and
maintenance of those BMP's.
E. Evidence of any necessary permit(s) for regulated earth disturbance
activities from the appropriated DEP regional office must be provided
to the municipality. The issuance of an NPDES construction permit [or
permit coverage under the statewide general permit (PAG-2)] satisfies
the requirements of § 155-13A.
F. BMP operations and maintenance requirements are described in Article
IV of this chapter.

ARTICLE IV
Storm Water BMP Operations and Maintenance Plan Requirements
§ 155-14. General requirements.
A. No regulated earth disturbance activities within the municipality shall
commence until approval by the municipality of a BMP operations and
maintenance plan which describes how the permanent (e.g.,
postconstruction) stormwater BMPs will be properly operated and
maintained.
B. The following items shall be included in the BMP operations and

§ 160-3. Applicability; permit required; applications; fees.
§ 160-4. Location, design and construction.
§ 160-5. Sight distance.
A. These regulations shall apply to all access driveways that enter
Borough highways.
B. Any person desiring to construct or lay out such driveway shall make
application to the department office having jurisdiction over the
highway to be intersected for approval of the location, design and mode
of construction of such driveway, and for permission to proceed.
Application forms will be available at Borough offices to any applicant
upon request. The construction or layout of a proposed driveway will
not be started prior to receipt of a written permit approving the
location, design and mode of construction thereof, signed by either the
Borough Engineer, Road Department Foreman or the authorized
representative of the Department of Roads and containing such
reasonable terms and conditions as the Department may deem
necessary to impose. The fee for said permit and inspection shall be set
by the Borough Council.
A. All driveways shall be located, designed and constructed in such a
manner as not to interfere or be inconsistent with the design,
maintenance and drainage of the Borough highway.
B. Access driveways should be located in such manner that they will not
cause the following:
(1) Interference with the traveling public;
(2) A hazard to the free movement of normal highway traffic; or
(3) Areas of undue traffic congestion on the highway.
C. Access driveways should not be located at locations that would
interfere with the placement and proper functioning of highway signs,
signals, detectors, lighting or other devices that affect traffic control.
D. Where highway curbs exist, driveway approaches shall be installed one
and one-half (1 1/2) inches above the adjacent highway or gutter grade
to maintain the proper drainage.
A. Access driveways shall be located at a point of optimum sight distance
along the highway within the property frontage limits. The profile of the
driveway and the grading of the right-of-way area shall provide a
maximum sight distance so that the operator of a vehicle departing
from such a driveway will have optimum visibility in either direction
along the highway.

§ 160-6. Slope of access driveway.
§ 160-7. Maintenance.
All driveways, adjacent areas and areas between such driveways, including
channelization, paving, drainage, etc., installed by the permittee shall be
maintained by the property owner in such a manner as not to interfere or
be inconsistent with the design, maintenance and drainage of the Borough
highway or the safe and convenient passage of traffic upon the Borough
highway. The term "adjacent area" shall apply only to that area within the
permittee's property or property line extended.
§ 160-8. Inspections.
B. Where adequate sight distances cannot be attained, the location of the
driveway will be at the discretion of the authorized Borough
representative.
A. All driveways shall be constructed in such a manner as not to impair
drainage within the highway right-of-way, alter the stability of the
roadway subgrade or materially change the drainage of adjacent areas.
Where open shoulders or berms exist, the grade of a paved access
driveway(s) shall slope away from the highway pavement at the same
rate as the existing shoulder (unless advised to the contrary by the
authorized Borough representative) for the prevailing width of the
shoulder. The gradient of a driveway beyond this point (within the
highway right-of-way) shall be not less than 1/2 inch per foot.
B. Driveway ramps may extend from the face of the curb up to the outer
edge of the sidewalk area in those cases where a planted area occurs
between multiple driveways. The rate of slope for such driveway ramps
preferably should not exceed one inch per foot. Where conditions are
such that the slope of one inch per foot is not obtainable, the sidewalk

dangers will be made safe for its proposed use or be set aside for uses
that will not precipitate dangerous conditions.
E. Protection of the soil, water and other natural environmental resources
of the area from the effects of uncontrolled development practices.
F. The coordination of continuing community growth with respect to
overall development considerations, such as sewage disposal, water

ARTICLE VIII
Design Standards
§ 163-17. Application of standards by Borough officials.
The following minimum subdivision principles, standards and requirements
will be applied by Borough officials in evaluating the plans for a proposed
subdivision.
§ 163-18. Land requirements.
§ 163-19. Street requirements.
A. Land shall be suited for the purpose for which it is to be subdivided.
B. Land subject to hazards to life, health and safety, such as strip-mined
land, quarry land, open ditches and land subject to flooding or
subsidence, shall not be subdivided for residential purposes. All such
hazards shall be identified and eliminated by the owner or developer,
and guaranties shall be provided to the Borough that adequate
safeguards against such hazards have been provided.
C. No land shall be subdivided in a manner that landlocks or compromises
the use or future development of contiguous or adjacent land areas.
A. Proposed streets shall be properly related to Borough, county and state
road and highway plans that have been prepared and officially adopted
and/or filed as prescribed by law.
B. Streets shall be logically related to the topography to achieve usable
lots and reasonable grades.
C. Internal subdivision streets shall be laid out to discourage unnecessary
through traffic, but provisions to coordinate adjacent area streets will
be generally required.
D. Where a subdivision plan abuts or contains an existing or proposed
arterial street, the governing body may require local access streets,
reverse frontage lots or such other treatment that will provide
protection for abutting properties, reduction in the number of
intersections with arterial streets and separation of local and through
traffic.
E. New half or partial streets will not be permitted, except where essential
to reasonable subdivision of a tract in conformance with the other
requirements and standards of this chapter and where, in addition,
satisfactory assurances for dedication of the remaining part of the
street is secured.
F. Wherever a tract to be subdivided borders an existing half or partial
street, the other part of the street shall be plotted within such tract.
§ 163-17 STREETS AND SIDEWALKS § 163-19
160:307
G. Dead-end streets shall be prohibited except as stubs to permit future
street extensions or when designed as culs-de-sac. Permanent cul-desac
streets may be permitted when it is clear that through traffic at
such a street end is not essential to the existing or future street system
in that district or to the development of adjacent properties in the area.
(1) Such streets, where permitted, shall not exceed 1,000 feet,
including the turnaround at the closed end. The Planning
Commission may recommend a cul-de-sac longer than 1,000 feet if
it is determined by the Planning Commission that such additional
length improves the subdivision design, results in a better
relationship of the proposed development to the existing
topography and does not create any hardships for the subdivision's
residents or the Borough. Temporary dead-end street stubs shall
terminate with culs-de-sac if said street extensions are not made
within six months.
(2) The turnaround shall have an outside pavement radius of not less
than 40 feet and a right-of-way radius of not less than 50 feet.
(3) The minimum grade of the turnaround portion of the cul-de-sac
shall be 1%.
(4) The maximum grade of the turnaround portion of the cul-de-sac
shall be 5%.
(5) An easement area providing for snow removal and storage area
shall be created adjacent to the road right-of-way at the dead end of
each new street. The snow removal and storage area shall be

Protection and the governing body.
(1) In areas of the Borough not presently served by public sewers but
in which they are to be installed within a reasonable time, in the
opinion of the Planning Commission based on studies of the area,
the Commission may require that capped sewer mains and house

Conditions of Acceptance
§ 163-45. Performance requirements.
Before approving any final subdivision plan, the governing body shall
require a written agreement and appropriate financial surety, as specified
in § 163-46 hereinbelow, that necessary grading, paving and street
improvements, sidewalks, streetlights, fire hydrants, water mains, storm
sewers and sanitary sewers, as may be required by the Borough, shall be
installed by the developer in strict accordance with the design standards
and specifications of the Borough within a specified time period.
§ 163-46. Performance guaranty.
The governing body shall ensure, through receipt of certificates of
compliance submitted and attested by the Borough Engineer, that the
required improvements have been installed according to the specifications
of the final plan or, alternately, require the posting of adequate surety to
cover the cost for such improvements. The governing body may also ensure,
through the posting of bonds or other surety acceptable to the Borough, the
maintenance of exiting public rights-of-way and road surfaces which are in
any manner utilized for transport or related purposes during development
and construction associated with subdivision development. The governing
body shall specify one of the following alternatives, or such other alternative
as may be acceptable, for guaranteeing compliance with the requirements
of this section. The decision of which alternative shall be required is that
of the governing body. Final approval of a plan may not be granted by the
Planning Commission or the governing body until the surety required is
fully provided. In any event, the required surety shall be secured along with
the written agreement prior to any construction or related activity.
A. Completion of improvements prior to final approval. Prior to final plan
approval, the developer shall complete, in a manner satisfactory to the
governing body and the Borough Engineer, all improvements required
in these regulations as specified in the final subdivision plan and as
approved by the governing body and shall dedicate the same to the
Borough in accordance with these regulations.
B. Guaranty of future performance.
(1) In lieu of requiring the completion of all improvements prior to final
plan approval, the Borough may, at its discretion, enter into a
contract with the developer whereby the developer shall guarantee
to complete all improvements required by this chapter or otherwise
specified by the governing body in a manner satisfactory to the
governing body.
(2) When requested by the developer in order to facilitate financing,
the governing body shall furnish the developer with a signed copy
of a resolution indicating approval of the final plat contingent upon
§ 163-45 STREETS AND SIDEWALKS § 163-46
160:327
the developer obtaining a satisfactory financial security. The final
plat or record plan shall not be signed nor recorded until the
financial improvements agreement is executed. The resolution or
letter of contingent approval shall expire and be deemed to be
revoked if the financial security agreement is not executed within
90 days, unless a written extension is granted by the governing
body; such extension shall not be unreasonably withheld and shall
be placed in writing at the request of the developer.
(3) To secure this contract, the developer shall provide, subject to the
approval of the governing body, one of the following guaranties:
(a) Surety bond. The developer shall obtain a security bond from a
surety bonding company authorized to do business in the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The bond shall be payable to
the Borough. The amount of financial security shall be equal to
110% of the cost of the required improvements as estimated by
the developer and approved by the Borough Engineer. The
duration of the bond shall be until such time as the
improvements are accepted by the Borough in accordance with
the requirements of this chapter.
(b) Escrow account.
[1] The developer shall deposit cash or other instrument
readily convertible into cash at face value, either with the
Borough or in escrow with a bank. The use of any
instrument other than cash and, in the case of an escrow
account, the bank with which the funds are to be deposited
shall be subject to the approval of the governing body. The
amount of financial security shall be equal to 110% of the
cost of the required improvements as estimated by the
developer and approved by the Borough Engineer.
[2] In case of an escrow account, the developer shall file with
the governing body an agreement between the financial
bank and himself, guaranteeing the following:
[a] That the funds of said escrow account shall be held in
trust until released by the governing body and may not
be used or pledged by the developer as security in any
other matter during the period.
[b] That in the case of a failure on the part of the
developer to complete said improvements, the bank
shall immediately make the funds in said account
available to the Borough for use in the completion of
those improvements.
(c) Property escrow.
§ 163-46 ECONOMY CODE § 163-46
160:328
[1] The developer shall offer as a guaranty land or other
property, including corporate stocks or bonds. The value of
any such property shall be at least equal to 110% of the
cost, as estimated by the developer and approved by the
Borough Engineer, of the installation of all contracted
improvements. Property value shall be determined by
means acceptable to the Borough and shall take into
account the likelihood of a decline in the value of said
property during the guaranty period. The governing body
shall retain the right to eject the use of any property when
it believes that the property will be unusually difficult to
sell or for other reasons such as will inhibit the Borough
from exchanging the property for a sufficient amount of
money to complete the required improvements.
[2] When property is offered as an improvement guaranty, the
developer shall:
[a] Execute an agreement with the trustee, when it is not
the governing body, instructing the trust to release the
property to the Borough in the case of default. The
agreement shall also state that the property may be
released only upon consent of the governing body. The
agreement shall be placed on file with the Borough
Secretary.
[b] File with the governing body an affidavit affirming
that the property to be used as a guaranty is free and
clear of any encumbrances or liens at the time it is to
be put in trust.
[c] Execute and file with the governing body an
agreement stating that the property to be placed in
trust as an improvement guaranty will not be used for
any other purpose or pledged as a security in any
other matter until it is released by the governing body.
(d) Extension of guaranties. If the developer requires more than
one year from the date of posting financial security to complete
the required improvements, the amount of security may be
increased to assure that financial security equals 110%. Any
additional security shall be posted by the developer in
accordance with this § 163-46.
C. Determining amount of financial security. [Added 4-10-2012 by Ord.
No. 434]
(1) The amount of the financial security to be posted for the completion
of the required improvements shall be equal to 110% of the cost of
completion estimated as of 90 days following the date scheduled for
completion by the developer. Annually, the Borough may adjust the
§ 163-46 STREETS AND SIDEWALKS § 163-46
160:329
amount of the financial security by comparing the actual cost of
the improvements which have been completed and the estimated
cost for the completion of the remaining improvements as of the
expiration of the 90th day after the original date scheduled for
completion or a rescheduled date of completion. Subsequent to
said adjustment, the Borough may require the developer to post
additional security in order to assure that the financial security
equals said 110%. Any additional security shall be posted by the
developer in accordance with this Subsection C.
(2) The amount of financial security required shall be based on an
estimate of the cost of completion of the required improvements
submitted by an applicant or developer and prepared by a
professional engineer licensed as such in the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania and certified by such engineer to be a fair and
reasonable estimate of such cost. The Borough, upon
recommendation of the Borough Engineer, may refuse to accept
such estimate for good cause shown.
(3) If the applicant or developer and the Borough are unable to agree
upon an estimate, then the estimate shall be recalculated and
recertified by another professional engineer licensed as such in the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and chosen mutually by the
Borough and the applicant or developer. The estimate certified by
the third engineer shall be presumed fair and reasonable and shall
be the final estimate. In the event that a third engineer is so
chosen, fees for the services of said engineer shall be paid equally
by the Borough and the applicant or developer.
D. Phased development. In the case where development is projected over
a period of years, Borough Council authorizes submission of final plats
by sections or stages of development subject to such requirements or
guarantees as to improvements in future sections or stages of
development as it finds essential for the protection of the finally
approved section of the development. [Added 4-10-2012 by Ord. No.
434]
E. Facilities bonded by public utilities or municipal authorities. If water
mains or sanitary sewer lines, or both, along with the apparatus or
facilities related thereto, are to be installed under the jurisdiction and
pursuant to the rules and regulations of a public utility or municipal
authority separate and distinct from the Borough, financial security to
assure proper completion and maintenance thereof shall be posted in
accordance with the regulations of the controlling public utility or
municipal authority and shall not be included within the financial
security as otherwise required by this section. [Added 4-10-2012 by
Ord. No. 434]
F. Partial release of security as work progresses. As the work of installing
the required improvements proceeds, the party posting the financial
security may request Borough Council to authorize release, from time
§ 163-46 ECONOMY CODE § 163-46
160:330
§ 163-47. Release from improvement bond.
to time, of such portions of the financial security necessary for payment
of the contractor or contractors performing the work. Any such
requests shall be in writing addressed to Borough Council. Borough
Council shall have 45 days from receipt of such request to allow the
Borough Engineer to certify, in writing, to Borough Council that such
portion of the work upon the improvements has been completed in
accordance with the approved plan. Upon such certification, Borough
Council shall authorize release by the bonding company or lending
institution of an amount as estimated by the Borough Engineer fairly
representing the value of the improvements completed, or, if Borough
Council fails to act within the said forty-five-day period, Borough
Council shall be deemed to have approved the release of the funds as
requested. [Added 4-10-2012 by Ord. No. 434]
G. Retention upon completion. Borough Council may, prior to final release
at the time of completion and certification by the Borough Engineer,
require retention of 10% of the estimated cost of the aforesaid
improvements. [Added 4-10-2012 by Ord. No. 434]
A. Procedure.
(1) When the developer has completed all of the required
improvements, the developer shall notify the governing body, in
writing, by certified or registered mail, of the collection of the
required improvements and shall send a copy thereof to the
Borough Engineer.
(2) The governing body shall, at the next scheduled meeting after
receipt of such notice, direct and authorize the Borough Engineer
to inspect all of the aforesaid improvements. The Borough Engineer
shall thereupon file a report, in writing, with the governing body
and shall mail a copy of the same to the developer by certified or
registered mail. The report shall be made and mailed within 45
days after receipt by the Borough Engineer of the aforesaid
authorization from the governing body. Said report shall be
detailed and shall indicate approval or rejection of said
improvements. If any portion thereof shall be rejected, the report
shall contain a statement of reasons for such nonapproval or
rejection.
(3) After receipt of the Engineer's report and maintenance bond, the
governing body shall notify the developer within 15 days, in
writing, by certified or registered mail, of the action of the
governing body with relation thereto.

or shall be rejected by the governing body, the developer shall
proceed to complete the same, and upon completion the same
procedure of notification as outlined herein shall be followed.

constructed and installed as provided for in the written agreement, this
chapter or the requirements of the governing body or in accordance
with the approved final plan, the governing body shall enforce any
corporate bond or other security by appropriate legal and equitable
remedies.
B. If the proceeds of such bond or other security are insufficient to pay the
cost of installing or making repairs or corrections to all the
improvements covered by said security, the governing body may, at its
option, install part of such improvements and may institute appropriate
legal or equitable action to recover the moneys necessary to complete
the remainder of the improvements.
C. All of the proceeds, whether resulting from the security or from any
legal or equitable action brought against the developer, or both, shall be
used solely for the installation of the improvements covered by such
security and not for any other municipal purpose.

written certification that all improvements specified and required have
been satisfactorily completed in accordance with the agreement and
requirements relative to the land development and in compliance with
the specifications, standards, ordinances and requirements of the
Borough, the subdivider or developer shall be required to deposit with
the Borough a corporate maintenance bond in such amount, under such
conditions, in such form and with approved surety as shall be required
by the governing body. Said maintenance bond is to guarantee the
repairs and maintenance by the subdivider or developer of the streets,
roads, pavements, sidewalks, curbs, gutters, storm drains and facilities,
sanitary sewer and facilities, sewage treatment plant and facilities and
any other improvements constructed and installed in the subdivision or
development for a period of two years from the date of final and official

appurtenances as designated herein are considered as minimum, and
the governing body may, as it deems advisable, revise said
specifications and requirements to secure a higher standard of
improvements and community development.
B. No stormwater drainage facilities, sanitary sewer and sewage
treatment facilities, water supply and water distribution system and
facilities or any other facilities or improvements will be accepted as a

Recorder of Deeds, the applicant shall deliver to the Borough Secretary
or his/her authorized designee, one reproducible mylar and two paper
prints of the final plat, as recorded, containing all required signatures

constructed or dedicated for public use or travel, except in strict
accordance with plans approved and recorded as herein provided, neither
the governing body nor any public authority shall place, construct or
operate any sewer, drain, water pipe or other facility or do any work of
any kind in or upon such road, and neither the governing body nor any
other public authority shall have responsibility of any kind with respect to

be so considered to be a part of the Official Plan of the Borough.
D. Streets, parks and other public improvements shown on a subdivision
plan to be recorded shall be offered for dedication to the Borough by

plan that any improvements have not been offered for dedication to the
Borough.
E. Every street, park or other improvement shown on a subdivision plan
shall be deemed to be a private street, park or improvement until such
time as the same shall have been offered for dedication to the Borough
and accepted, by ordinance or resolution, or until it shall have been
condemned for use as a public street, park or other improvement.
F. In the event that an approved subdivision plan is not recorded within
the time period required by Subsection A, above, said approval shall be
deemed voided and rescinded, and the plan must be resubmitted if
approval is sought by the developer. [Amended 4-10-2012 by Ord.

applicant's request over disputed engineer expenses.
(4) If within 20 days from the date of billing, the Borough and the
applicant cannot agree on the amount of expenses which are

nor any professional engineer who has been retained by, or
performed services for, the Borough or the applicant within the
preceding five years.

reasonable and necessary expenses shall be paid by the applicant if
the amount of payment required in the decision is equal to or
greater than the original bill. If the amount of payment required in
the decision is less than the original bill by $1,000 or more, the

fee of the appointed professional engineer.

charges for such submittals.

shall be deemed to have been only one such violation until the fifth day
following the date of the determination of a violation by the District
Justice, and thereafter each day that a violation continues shall
constitute a separate violation.

The United States, the commonwealth or any of their instrumentalities,

executed, delivered, accepted or presented for recording shall be
subject to pay for and in respect to the transaction or any part thereof a

person or transfer, then the tax levied by the Borough under the
authority of that Act shall, during the time such duplication of the tax
exists, except as hereinafter otherwise provided, be 1/2 of the rate, and
such 1/2 rate shall become effective without any action on the part of
the Borough; provided, however, that the Borough and any, other
political subdivision which imposes such tax on the same person or
transfer may agree that, instead of limiting their respective rates to 1/2
of the rate herein provided, they will impose respectively different
rates, the total of which shall not exceed the maximum rate permitted
under the Local Tax Enabling Act.
D. If for any reason the tax is not paid when due, interest at the rate in
effect at the time the tax is due shall be added and collected.

confirms a transfer previously recorded, but which does not extend
or limit existing record legal title or interest.
(5) A transfer of division in kind for no or nominal actual consideration

cotenants; however, if any of the parties take shares greater in

previously husband and wife who have since been divorced,
provided that the property or interest therein subject to such

Planned Residential Development
§ 180-54. Purpose.
§ 180-55. Applicability and relationship to other ordinances.
The provisions of this article for approval of a planned residential
development (PRD) shall be a modification to and in lieu of procedures and
criteria for approvals otherwise required in this chapter and Chapter 163,
Subdivision and Land Development, of the Borough Code. Failure to comply
with the provisions of this article with respect to a recorded development
plan shall be deemed to constitute a violation of this chapter.
§ 180-56. Site area, ownership, use and density requirements.
A. The purpose of these planned residential development (PRD)
regulations is to permit residential development that is more creative
and imaginative than is generally possible under conventional zoning
district controls and subdivision requirements. Further, these
regulations are intended to promote more economical and efficient use
of the land while providing a compatible blend of housing types,
amenities and community facilities of high quality, oriented to the
specific development site and preserving the natural scenic qualities of
open space.
B. Each planned residential development (PRD) should be designed to
accomplish the following:
(1) A maximum choice in the types of living environments.
(2) Open space and recreation areas directly related to the intended
users.
(3) A pattern of development that preserves trees, outstanding natural
topography and geological features and prevents soil erosion.
(4) A creative approach to the use of land and related physical
development.
(5) An efficient use of land, resulting in smaller networks of utilities
and streets and lower housing costs.
(6) An environment of stable character in harmony with surrounding
development.
(7) A more desirable environment than would be possible through the
strict application of other articles of this Chapter 180, Zoning.
A. Site area. In all cases, the minimum site required for a planned
residential development (PRD) shall be 25 contiguous acres. Public
easements or rights-of-way and public or private streets shall not be
§ 180-54 WATER § 180-56
178:507
construed as an interruption or division of a site for the purposes of a
planned residential development (PRD).
B. Site ownership. The site proposed for a planned residential
development (PRD) shall be under single ownership and control. Prior
to submitting an application for tentative approval, the applicant shall
demonstrate that he is the landowner, as defined by this chapter. Legal,
as well as equitable, ownership shall be demonstrated coincident with
approval of the final development plan.
C. Dwelling units authorized.
(1) R-2 District.
(a) In the R-2 District, the following dwelling types may be
included in a planned residential development (PRD):
[1] Single-family detached dwellings.
[2] Two-family dwellings.
[3] Triplexes.
[4] Fourplexes.
[5] Townhouses.
(b) In the R-2 Zoning District, a minimum of 30% of the total
number of dwelling units in the planned residential
development (PRD) shall be single-family detached dwellings.
In the case where a planned residential development (PRD)
adjoins an established neighborhood of existing single-family
detached dwellings, the single-family detached dwellings
proposed in the planned residential development (PRD) shall
be located along all common property lines with the
established neighborhood.
(2) C-1 District.
(a) In the C-1 District, the following dwelling types may be
included in a planned residential development (PRD):
[1] Single-family detached dwellings.
[2] Duplex dwellings.
[3] Triplexes.
[4] Fourplexes.
[5] Townhouses.
[6] Garden apartments.
§ 180-56 ECONOMY CODE § 180-56
178:508
(b) The planned residential development (PRD) may include one or
more of the above-listed dwelling types and there shall be no
minimum percentage of single-family dwellings required.
D. Recreational and other common facilities for the residents. In addition
to the residential uses permitted in a planned residential development
(PRD), recreation facilities designed for the use of the residents of the
planned residential development (PRD) shall be required but shall not
be limited to hiking, biking or exercise trails; tennis, paddle tennis,
basketball, volleyball or other playing courts; swimming pool and
related facilities; golf course or putting greens; community building for
meetings and social activities; picnic pavilions; other passive and lowimpact
active recreational uses. Borough Council shall determine
whether the proposed facilities are appropriate to the leisure and
recreational needs and interests of the proposed residents of the
planned residential development (PRD) based on the types of dwelling
units proposed.
E. Maximum dwelling unit density. Regardless of whether a planned
residential development (PRD) is comprised of a mix of dwelling unit
types or a single type of dwelling unit, the maximum dwelling unit
density authorized in the R-2 District shall be four units per acre, and in
the C-1 District, the maximum dwelling unit density authorized shall be
six units per acre.
F. Minimum lot area. There shall be no minimum lot area required for
individual dwelling units, provided the dwelling unit density for the
planned residential development (PRD) site does not exceed the
maximum dwelling unit density authorized by this article and all other
applicable requirements of this article are met.
G. Minimum building setback on the perimeter of the planned residential
development (PRD) site. All principal and accessory structures and offstreet
parking shall be located at least 50 feet from the perimeter
boundary of the planned residential development (PRD) site.

§ 180-57. Access and availability of public services.
(1) The Design and Construction Standards of Chapter 163,
Subdivision and Land Development, shall apply to all public
improvements proposed in a planned residential development
(PRD) unless a waiver or modification is granted by Borough
Council in accordance with the procedure for granting waivers and
modifications specified in Chapter 163, Subdivision and Land
Development.
(2) Except for maximum dwelling unit density, perimeter setback and
maximum building height, any of the other requirements of this
article and the underlying zoning district classification may be
modified by Borough Council in granting tentative approval to a
planned residential development (PRD), if Borough Council
determines that the requested modification or modifications will
contribute to a more beneficial use of the site, will not be contrary
to the public interest and are warranted owing to physical
circumstances or conditions unique to the particular property.
(3) All requests for modification shall be in writing and shall
accompany and be a part of the application for tentative and/or
final approval. Such written request shall specify the ordinance
section from which a modification is requested and shall state the
grounds for the request, the justification for the request and
whether it is the minimum modification necessary to carry out the
proposed plan.
(4) Whenever a request for modification is granted or denied, the
reasons for such grant or denial shall be stated within the official
written communication to the landowner. The grant of a
modification request may be subject to reasonable conditions
designed to protect the public interest and to promote the purposes
set forth in this article.
A. Access and traffic control.
(1) The principal entrance to the site of a planned residential
development (PRD) shall connect directly to an arterial or collector
street, as defined by this chapter. In every planned residential
development (PRD), a secondary means of access shall be provided
that may connect to a local street.
(2) The projected traffic volumes associated with the proposed planned
residential development (PRD) shall be capable of being
accommodated by the adjacent street network. The developer shall
demonstrate, by submission of a traffic impact study, as defined
herein, that the projected traffic from the planned residential
development (PRD) shall not materially increase congestion and
impair safety on adjacent public streets.
§ 180-56 ECONOMY CODE § 180-57
178:510
§ 180-58. Common open space.
(3) Ingress and egress to and from the site shall be designed to comply
with the minimum requirements of Chapter 163, Subdivision and
Land Development, of the Borough Code. Private streets within the
planned residential development (PRD) site shall be constructed to
Borough specifications for public streets. Internal access driveways
serving the dwelling units shall not be considered private streets
and shall not be subject to Borough construction specifications.
B. Public water and sewer service. All dwelling units and other principal
structures in a planned residential development (PRD) shall be
connected to a public water supply and public sanitary sewer service.
C. Sidewalks and streetlighting.
(1) The developer shall provide sidewalks on at least one side of every
street, whether public or private, within the planned residential
development (PRD) site. Sidewalks shall be constructed in
accordance with the Borough construction specifications in
Chapter 163, Subdivision and Land Development, of the Borough
Code.
(2) The developer shall provide streetlights at all public street
intersections and at other locations deemed necessary by the
Borough Engineer for public safety. Streetlights shall be installed
in accordance with the requirements specified in Chapter 163,
Subdivision and Land Development, of the Borough Code.
D. Storm drainage.
(1) The developer shall provide a storm drainage system within a
planned residential development (PRD) that shall be of sufficient
size and design to collect, carry off and dispose of all predictable
surface water runoff within the planned residential development
(PRD) and shall be so constructed to conform with the statutes,
ordinances and regulations of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
and the stormwater management regulations contained in Chapter
163, Subdivision and Land Development, of the Borough Code.
(2) All stormwater management facilities shall be owned and
maintained by the homeowners' association or similar organization
created to own and maintain the common open space within the
planned residential development (PRD). The homeowners'
association documents shall contain provisions assigning the
maintenance schedule that is reviewed and approved by the
Borough Engineer.
A. Areas required.
(1) Common open space shall comprise at least 20% of the total gross
site area of the planned residential development (PRD).
§ 180-57 WATER § 180-58
178:511
(2) Of the required open space area, not more than 50% may be
covered by water.
(3) Recreational facilities or structures and their accessory uses
located in common open space areas shall be considered improved
open space as long as the total impervious surface area constitutes
no more than 5% of the total common open space.
(4) To the extent feasible, steep slopes, streams, lakes, ponds,
woodlands and other environmentally sensitive areas shall be
incorporated into the common open space; however, no more than
50% of the open space area provided shall be in excess of a twentyfive-
percent slope.
(5) Required buffer areas shall be included in the common open space
and shall be maintained in perpetuity by the organization created
to own and maintain the common open space. Restrictive
covenants and/or provisions in the organization's bylaws shall
specify this responsibility.
(6) In the case of three or more dwelling units on a single lot, the open
area surrounding the dwelling units, excluding any open space
within 15 feet of the building walls, may be included in the
calculation of common open space, provided the lot is not proposed
to be further subdivided for fee simple ownership of the individual
units.
B. Protection of common open space. Common open space in a planned
residential development (PRD) shall be protected by adequate
covenants running with the land or by conveyances or dedications. Said
covenants shall restrict the further subdivision of the common open
space. A planned residential development (PRD) shall be approved
subject to the submission of a legal instrument or instruments setting
forth a plan for the permanent preservation, care and maintenance of
such common open space, recreational areas and other facilities owned
in common by an organization established for such purposes. No such
instrument shall be acceptable until approved by Borough Council,
upon recommendation of the Township Solicitor, as to legal form and
effect. In cases where the Borough will not be accepting dedications of
streets, recreation areas or common open spaces, the developer shall
create an organization or trust for ownership and maintenance of the
common open space and common facilities.
C. Common open space maintenance. In the event that the organization
established to own and maintain the common open space, or any
successor thereto, shall at any time after establishment of the final
development plan fail to maintain the common open space, including all
streets, driveways and recreational facilities, in reasonable order and
condition in accordance with the development plan granted final
approval, the Borough may take remedial action to cause the common
open space and common facilities to be properly maintained, as
§ 180-58 ECONOMY CODE § 180-58

provided for in Section 705(f) of the Pennsylvania Municipalities
Planning Code.107
A. Along any perimeter property line separating triplexes, fourplexes,
townhouses or garden apartments in a planned residential development
(PRD) from single-family lots or undeveloped property outside the
planned residential development (PRD) site located in the R-A, R-1, R-2
or R-3 District, a buffer area at least 25 feet in depth as measured from
the property line shall be provided. Within this buffer area, one row of
planting shall be established consisting of a mixture of 70% evergreen
and 30% deciduous trees spaced within a row a minimum of 15 feet
apart measured from the vertical center lines of adjacent trees.
B. Along any perimeter property line of the planned residential
development (PRD) site adjoining property in the C-1 or I-1 District, a
buffer area at least 35 feet in depth as measured from the property line
shall be provided. Within this buffer area, two rows of planting shall be
established consisting of a mixture of 70% evergreen and 30%
deciduous trees spaced within a row a minimum of 15 feet apart
measured from the vertical center lines of adjacent trees. The two rows
shall be staggered in a manner that results in adjacent trees in two
different rows being no more than 10 feet apart measured from the
vertical center lines of the trees.
C. Buffer areas shall not be required along public street rights-of-way.
D. No structures or uses, including but not limited to buildings, accessory
structures, parking spaces, access driveways and lighting devices, shall
be located in the required buffer area, except that fences, active or
passive recreation facilities and stormwater management facilities may
be located in the required buffer area, provided these structures or
uses do not interfere with the spacing of plantings required in the
buffer area and further provided that all plantings are located outside
any stormwater management facility.
E. In the event that existing vegetation and/or existing topography
provides screening that is adequate to meet the intent of the required
buffer area, Borough Council, upon recommendation by the Planning
Commission, may determine that the existing topography and/or
vegetation constitutes all or part of the required buffer area. If such a
determination is made, the applicant may be required to record a
conservation easement of the depth, specified by Borough Council to
guarantee that the existing topography and/or vegetation will not be
disturbed or removed from the approved buffer area.

(1) Prior to filing an application for tentative approval, the applicant or
his representative may meet with Borough staff to obtain
application forms and to discuss application procedures and
applicable ordinance requirements.
(2) In addition, the developer may request a preapplication conference
with the Planning Commission to discuss the conceptual design for
the development of the property and the feasibility and timing of
the application. The applicant shall contact the Borough Zoning
Officer or his or her designated representative at least five
calendar days prior to the regular meeting of the Planning
Commission to request a preapplication conference with the
Planning Commission.
(3) The preapplication conference with the Planning Commission is
voluntary, and no formal application or fee is required. This
opportunity is afforded to the developer to obtain information and
guidance before entering into binding commitments or incurring
substantial expenses for plan preparation.
(4) While no formal application is required for a preapplication
conference, the applicant should provide one copy of readily
available information with the request for a preapplication
conference, which information shows the location of the property
and any special features such as streams, floodplains or other
conditions that may affect the development of the property. Readily
available resources that may be used include the deed for the
property, a property survey, the Tax Parcel Maps prepared by the
Beaver County Assessor's Office, USGS Quadrangle Map showing
natural features and topography, the National Flood Insurance
Administration (NFIA) Flood Hazard Boundary Maps, Natural
Resources Conservation Service Maps of soil types and the U.S.
Bureau of Mines coal mine maps.
(5) A preapplication conference shall not constitute formal filing of any
application for approval of a planned residential development
(PRD), shall not bind the Planning Commission to approve any
concept presented in the preapplication conference and shall not
108. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10101 et seq.

application that are not the result of Planning Commission
comments and that are not mandated to demonstrate compliance
with this chapter, the applicant shall withdraw the application and
submit a new application that shall be subject to the payment of the
required application filing fee and application review fee.
(4) In the event that the Planning Commission tables the application to
allow the applicant to address comments or demonstrate
compliance with this chapter, the Planning Commission may
request that the applicant grant Borough Council an extension of
the sixty-day deadline required by § 180-60D to hold the public
hearing, if necessary. If the applicant fails to grant such an
§ 180-60 WATER § 180-60
178:517
extension, the Planning Commission may recommend disapproval
of the application based on the deficiencies identified. In the case of
a recommendation for disapproval, the Planning Commission shall
cite the specific requirements of this chapter that have not been
met.
(5) The Planning Commission shall forward a written recommendation
on the application for tentative approval to Borough Council in time

provide the names and addresses of said residents and/or
landowners with the application for tentative approval.
(3) The public hearing shall be conducted in the manner prescribed in
Article IX of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code,109 and

proceedings, provided that, in exercising such an option, the
Borough and the mediating parties shall meet the stipulations and
follow the procedures set forth in § 180-104 of this chapter.
E. Tentative approval.
(1) Within 60 days following the conclusion of the public hearing, or
within one 180 days after the official date of filing, whichever
occurs first, Borough Council shall, by official written
communication, either:
(a) Grant tentative approval of the development plan, as
submitted;
109. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. §§ 10901 through 10918.
§ 180-60 ECONOMY CODE § 180-60
178:518
§ 180-61. Criteria for tentative approval.
Borough Council shall grant tentative approval if, and only if, all applicable
requirements of this article are met and all of the following criteria are met:
(b) Grant tentative approval of the development plan, subject to
specified conditions not included in the development plan as
submitted; or
(c) Deny tentative approval.
(2) Failure to act within said period shall be deemed to be a grant of
tentative approval of the development plan as submitted. In the
event, however, that tentative approval is granted subject to
conditions, the landowner may, within 30 days after receiving a
copy of the official written communication of Borough Council,
notify Borough Council of his refusal to accept all said conditions,
in which case Borough Council shall be deemed to have denied
tentative approval of the development plan. In the event that the
landowner does not, within said period, notify Borough Council of
his refusal to accept all said conditions, tentative approval of the
development plan, with all said conditions, shall stand as granted.
A. Compatibility. The proposed application for tentative approval complies
with all standards, restrictions, criteria, requirements, regulations and
procedures of this article; preserves the community development
objectives of this chapter; and is found by Borough Council to be
compatible with the public interest and consistent with the Borough's
Comprehensive Plan.
B. Modifications proposed. Where the proposed application for tentative
approval provides standards that vary from this chapter and Chapter
163, Subdivision and Land Development, otherwise applicable to the
subject property, such departure shall promote protection of the
environment and public health, safety and welfare and shall be in the
public interest.
C. Common open space. The proposals for the maintenance and
conservation of any proposed common open space are reliable and
meet the standards of this chapter and the amount and extent of
improvements within the common open space are appropriate with
respect to the purpose, use and type of the residential development
proposed.
D. Physical design. The physical design of the proposed development plan
adequately provides for public services, traffic facilities and parking,
light, air, recreation and visual enjoyment.
E. Relationship to surrounding area. The proposed development plan is
beneficially related to the immediate area in which it is proposed to be
located.
§ 180-60 WATER § 180-61
178:519
§ 180-62. Application for final approval.
Unless extended by Borough Council for good cause shown, the developer
shall submit 13 copies of the application for final approval within one
year after the development plan is granted tentative approval by Borough
Council. The final application shall consist of detailed plans for any phase
or section of the development plan. No building permit shall be issued
until final approval has been granted by Borough Council for the phase or
section in which the proposed development is located. final approval for any
phase or section shall expire if construction is not initiated for the phase or
section within one year of the date of final approval of the phase or section
by Borough Council, unless extended by Borough Council for good cause
shown.
F. Environmental protection. The proposed development plan will afford
adequate protection of natural watercourses, wetlands, topsoil,
woodlands, steep slopes and other natural features and will prevent
erosion, landslides, siltation and flooding.
G. Phasing. In the case of a development plan that proposes development
over a period of years, the terms and conditions thereof are sufficient to
protect the interests of the public and of the residents of the planned
residential development (PRD) in the integrity of the final development
plan.
A. Review of application by planning consultant and Planning Commission.
(1) The planning consultant shall review the application to determine
whether it is complete and properly filed in accordance with all
requirements of this chapter. If the planning consultant determines
that the application is not complete and properly filed, written
notice shall be provided to the applicant within 10 days of the date
of submission specifying the defects in the application and
returning the application to the applicant for resubmission.
(2) If the planning consultant determines that the application is
complete and properly filed, the date that the application is
received by the Borough shall constitute the official date of filing.
Within 15 days of receipt of a complete and properly filed
application, the Borough Secretary shall refer the application to
the Borough Planning Commission for review and recommendation
and to the Beaver County Planning Commission for review and
comment subject to payment of the required fee.
(3) Within 30 days of receipt of a complete and properly filed
application for final approval, the Planning Commission shall
forward a written recommendation to Borough Council.

required, provided the development plan is in compliance with the
§ 180-61 ECONOMY CODE § 180-62
178:520
development plan given tentative approval and with any specified
conditions attached thereto.
B. Action by Borough Council. In the event that an application for final
approval has been filed, together with all drawings, specifications and
other documentation in support thereof, in accordance with the
requirements of this chapter and the official written communication
granting tentative approval, Borough Council shall, within 45 days of
the official date of filing, grant final approval to the development plan.
C. Variations from the plan granted tentative approval.
(1) In the event that the development plan submitted contains
variations from the development plan granted tentative approval,
Borough Council may refuse to grant final approval and may, within
45 days of the official date of filing of the application for final
approval, advise the applicant, in writing, of said refusal, setting
forth in said notice the reasons why one or more of the variations
are not in the public interest. In the event of such refusal, the
landowner may either:
(a) Refile the application for final approval without the variations
objected; or
(b) File a written request with Borough Council that it hold a
public hearing on the application for final approval.
(2) If the landowner wishes to take either alternate action, he may do
so at any time within which he shall be entitled to apply for final
approval or within 30 additional days, if the time for applying for
final approval shall have already passed at the time when the
landowner was advised that the development plan was not in
substantial compliance.
(3) If the landowner fails to take either of these alternate actions
within said time, he shall be deemed to have abandoned the
development plan.

Council shall, by official written communication, either grant or
deny final approval. The grant or denial of final approval of the
development plan shall, in cases where a public hearing is

178:521
required, be in the form and contain the findings required for an
application for tentative approval.
E. Changes in the approved plan. Changes in the location and siting of
buildings and structures deemed minor by Borough Council may be
authorized without additional public hearings, if required by
engineering or other circumstances not foreseen at the time of
tentative approval. However, gross density and/or any increase in the

performance standards and, subject to the approval of Borough
Council, may employ qualified technical experts to assist in the
determination of a violation. Costs of the services of such experts
shall be paid by the owner or operator of the facility or use accused
of the violation if the facility or use is found to be in violation. If the
facility or use is found to be in compliance with the performance
standards, said costs shall be borne by the Borough.
(2) If the facility or use is found to be in violation, the owner or
operator shall be given written notice of violation in accordance
with § 180-109 of this chapter and a reasonable length of time to
correct the violation. Failure to correct the violation shall be
subject to the penalty provisions of this chapter and shall result in
the revocation of the certificate of occupancy for the facility or use.
A. Buffer areas described. Buffer areas, as defined by this chapter and
required by § 180-69B, shall meet all of the following criteria. (See
Appendix C115 for illustrations of buffer areas.)
(1) Buffer Area A shall contain two rows of plantings. Each row shall
consist of a mixture of thirty-percent deciduous and seventypercent
evergreen plantings spaced within the row a minimum of
15 feet apart, measured from the vertical center lines of adjacent
trees. The two rows shall be staggered in a manner which shall
result in adjacent trees on two different rows being no more than
10 feet apart, measured from the vertical center lines of the trees.
The depth of Buffer Area A shall be 35 feet as measured from the
property line.
115. Editor's Note: Appendix C is included at the end of this chapter.

178:583
(2) Buffer Area B shall contain one row of plantings that shall consist of
a mixture of thirty-percent deciduous and seventy-percent
evergreen spaced within the row a minimum of 10 feet apart,
measured from the vertical center lines of adjacent trees. The
depth of Buffer Area B shall be 25 feet as measured from the
property line.
(3) Buffer Area C shall be comprised of a continuous, compact
evergreen hedge or line of evergreen trees that will grow together
when mature and that are a minimum of six feet in height at the
time of planting. The depth of Buffer Area C shall be 15 feet as
measured from the property line.
(4) None of the required plantings shall encroach across any property
line. All plantings shall be located so that, at maturity, all parts of
the tree shall be a minimum of 2 1/2 feet from any public street
right-of-way or any property line that constitutes the exterior
boundary of the buffer area.
(5) In the event that existing vegetation and/or existing topography
provides screening that is adequate to meet the intent of the
required buffer area to screen the buildings, activities and parking
areas from adjoining residential properties, Borough Council, upon
recommendation by the Planning Commission, may determine that
the existing topography and/or vegetation constitutes all or part of
the required buffer area. If such a determination is made, the
applicant may be required to record a conservation easement of the
depth specified by Borough Council to guarantee that the existing
topography and/or vegetation will not be disturbed or removed
from the approved buffer area.
(6) When there are substantial differences in elevation between the
first-floor elevation of the proposed construction and the elevation
of the property line along which the buffer area is required, the
buffer area may be relocated to the top of the slope or the toe of the
slope, whichever provides the more effective visual screen.
(7) In the event that a public street right-of-way, dedicated and
accepted by the Borough, separates the two dissimilar uses
specified, the buffer area shall not be required.
(8) In the case of a lot that is deeper than 400 feet, the requirement to
provide the buffer area along the entire perimeter of the lot may be
waived by Borough Council, provided the required buffer area is
installed along the side property lines and across the rear yard for a
distance sufficient to screen the buildings and parking areas from
adjacent properties.
(9) Openings for driveways shall be permitted to cross a required
buffer area. Plantings in required buffer areas shall be located so as
to not obstruct visibility for traffic entering or leaving the site and
§ 180-69 ECONOMY CODE § 180-69
178:584
shall be subject to the clear sight triangle requirements of
§ 180-70D of this chapter.
(10)No structures or uses shall be permitted in the required buffer
area, other than fences, active or passive recreation facilities and
stormwater management facilities, provided the structures or uses
do not interfere with the required plantings in the buffer area and
provided all plantings are located outside any stormwater
management structure. Structures or uses not permitted within the
required buffer area include, but are not limited to, buildings,
accessory structures, parking spaces, access drives and lighting
devices.
(11) When common open space is provided on a development site, the
required buffer area shall be located within the common open
space and shall not be located on any individual residential lot.
B. Buffer areas required. Buffer Areas A, B and C listed in § 180-69A above
shall be required under the following circumstances:
(1) Buffer Area A. Buffer Area A shall be required:
(a) Along all property lines where any development in the I-1
District adjoins property in an R-A, R-1, R-2 or R-3 District.
(b) Where the express standards and criteria for a conditional use
or use by special exception in § 180-66 of this chapter specify
that Buffer Area A is required.
(c) Along all property lines where a planned residential
development (PRD) adjoins property in an R-A, R-1, R-2 or R-3
District.
(d) Along all property lines where multifamily dwellings adjoin
property in an R-A, R-1, R-2 or R-3 District.

nonconforming use in any C-1, I-1 or R-A, R-1, R-2 or R-3
District adjoins property in an R-A, R-1, R-2 or R-3 District.
(c) Where the express standards and criteria for a conditional use
or use by special exception in § 180-66 of this chapter specify
that Buffer Area B is required.
(3) Buffer area C. Buffer Area C shall be required:
(a) Where the express standards and criteria for a conditional use
or use by special exception in § 180-66 of this chapter specify
that Buffer Area C is required.
§ 180-69 WATER § 180-69
178:585
(b) On developed nonresidential properties in the C-1 District
where existing conditions such as building location and
existing paving of the parking lot make it impossible to meet
the requirements for Buffer Area B along a property line that
adjoins property in the R-A, R-1, R-2 or R-3 District.
(c) On developed nonresidential properties in the I-1 District
where existing conditions such as building location and
existing paving of the parking lot make it impossible to meet
the requirements for Buffer Area A along a property line that
adjoins property in the R-A, R-1, R-2 or R-3 District.
C. Conflict between buffer area and yard requirements. When the width of
a required buffer area is in conflict with the minimum yard
requirements of Articles IV through IX, the greater distance shall apply.
The buffer area planting requirement shall be adhered to regardless of
the yard requirement.
D. Existing structures in buffer areas. In instances where an existing
structure is located within any required buffer area, the buffer area may
be reduced, provided the buffer area is not less than the minimum
distance between the existing structure and the property line. This
reduced buffer area width shall apply only to the side of the existing
structure that encroaches on the required buffer area. The required
buffer area, as determined by § 180-69B, shall apply on all other sides
of the existing structure.
E. Existing trees in buffer areas.
(1) Where trees already exist within the required buffer area, these
trees shall remain undisturbed, except that diseased or dead
material may be removed. If it is determined that some healthy
trees must be removed in conjunction with development, a written
request to remove such trees must be submitted to the Borough,
along with an explanation detailing the rationale for the request.
These trees shall not be removed until the Borough has given
written authorization permitting said removal. This permission will
not be unreasonably denied; however, those who violate this
section shall be subject to the maximum penalties authorized by
this chapter.
(2) When any trees, regardless of their physical condition, are
removed, they shall be replaced by trees suitable to the
environment. (See Appendix D for a suggested list of plant
materials.116) All such replacement planting shall be in accordance

covenant on the land guaranteeing perpetual maintenance and
preservation of the required buffer area. Upon inspection by the
Borough and issuance of an enforcement notice in accordance with
§ 180-109B of this chapter, the landowner or lessee shall replace
required landscaping materials with like type and size if the required
plant materials do not survive for any reason at any time after
occupancy of the property.
H. Stormwater management facilities in buffer areas. Stormwater
management facilities and structures may be maintained within a
buffer area, but the existence of such facilities or structures shall not be
a basis for a failure to meet the planting requirements.
I. Landscaping of open areas. All yard areas not utilized for parking
facilities, driveways, gardens, the planting of trees or shrubs, flower,
vegetable or herb beds or similar uses shall be seeded, sodded or
landscaped within a reasonable period of time. The phrase "a
reasonable period of time" shall be interpreted to be within two weeks
after construction activities are completed, unless those activities are
completed between a November 1 through April 1 time period. In such

ARTICLE XV
Nonconforming Uses, Structures and Lots
§ 180-90. Applicability.
This article shall apply to all nonconforming uses, structures and lots, as
defined by this chapter. Nothing contained herein shall require any change
in the overall layout, plans, construction, size or designated use of any
development, building, structure or part thereof for which official approval
and required permits have been granted prior to the effective date of this
chapter or any amendment thereto.
§ 180-91. Nonconforming uses.
These regulations shall apply to any use of a structure or lot in any zoning
district that is a nonconforming use as defined by this chapter. Whenever
the boundaries of a zoning district are changed so as to transfer an area
from one zoning district to another zoning district of a different
classification, these regulations shall apply to any uses that thereby become
nonconforming.
A. Continuation and sale. Where, at the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this chapter, a lawful use of a lot or structure exists that
is made no longer permissible under the terms of this chapter as
enacted or amended, such use may be sold or otherwise transferred to
other owners and may be continued as long as it remains otherwise
lawful in accordance with the provisions of this article.
B. Enlargement or expansion.
(1) Single-family dwellings that are nonconforming uses in any
nonresidential zoning district classification may be enlarged or
expanded to occupy a greater area of the lot or to increase the
height of the dwelling, provided all applicable area and bulk
regulations of the zoning district in which the property is located
are met.
(2) No other nonconforming use of a lot or nonconforming use of a
structure shall be enlarged or increased or extended to occupy a
greater area of the lot or structure than was occupied at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter, unless the
Zoning Hearing Board, after public hearing, shall interpret that the
enlargement or extension is necessitated by the natural expansion
and growth of the nonconforming use. Any such enlargement or
expansion shall conform to the area, height and yard requirements
of the zoning district in which it is located.
(3) No nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any
other portion of the lot occupied by such use at the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this chapter, unless authorized by the
Zoning Hearing Board.
§ 180-90 WATER § 180-91
178:641
(4) Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any part of a
structure that was designed for such use at the time the use
became nonconforming; however, a nonconforming use shall not be
extended to occupy any structure, lot or portion of a lot that was
not owned by the owner of the nonconforming use at the time the
use became nonconforming.
C. Change of use.
(1) A nonconforming use shall not be changed to any use other than a
conforming use, except as permitted as a use by special exception
by the Zoning Hearing Board in accordance with the following
standards:
(a) The new nonconforming use will more closely correspond to
the uses authorized in the district as permitted uses,
conditional uses or uses by special exception.
(b) The new nonconforming use will be in keeping with the
character of the neighborhood in which it is located and will
have an equal or lesser impact on the neighborhood than the
existing nonconforming use.
(c) Any change from one nonconforming use to another shall
comply with the parking requirements of Article XIII for the
new use and shall be subject to the area, bulk and buffer area
regulations for such use in the zoning district where such use
is authorized as a permitted use, conditional use or use by
special exception.
(2) When a nonconforming use is changed to a conforming use, the use
thereafter shall not be changed to a nonconforming use.
(3) Where a nonconforming use exists on a lot, a conforming use shall
not be established on the same lot unless the nonconforming use is
discontinued.
D. Abandonment. When a nonconforming use of a structure and/or lot is
discontinued or abandoned for 12 consecutive months, the structure
and/or lot shall not thereafter be used, except in conformance with the
regulations of the zoning district in which it is located.
E. Damage or destruction.
(1) Residential dwellings that are nonconforming uses in the C-1 or I-1
District may be rebuilt on the existing foundation in the event of
damage or destruction, provided the reconstruction is started
within 18 months of the date of destruction.
(2) In the case of nonconforming uses, other than dwellings, in any
district, when damage or destruction of a structure in which the
nonconforming use is conducted involves 50% or less of the gross
floor area of the structure, repairs or reconstruction may be

These regulations shall apply to all nonconforming structures, as defined by
this chapter, in all zoning districts.
undertaken, provided that such restoration is started within 18
months of the date of destruction. No enlargement or expansion of
the structure in which the nonconforming use is located shall be
undertaken unless the provisions of § 180-91B are met.
(3) In the case of nonconforming uses, other than dwellings, in any
district, when the structure in which the nonconforming use is
conducted is damaged or destroyed by fire or other means to an
extent of more than 50% of its gross floor area, the structure shall
be reconstructed only to house a conforming use.
A. Structural alteration or enlargement. A nonconforming structure may
be enlarged or structurally altered, provided the enlargement or
alteration does not encroach any further into a required yard setback
than the existing nonconforming structure does and further provided
that no new nonconformities are created. All other alterations or
enlargements shall require review by the Zoning Hearing Board, and
after public hearing, the Zoning Hearing Board may determine undue
hardship and may authorize a variance for the reasonable alteration or
enlargement of such structure.
B. Damage or destruction. Any nonconforming structure that has been
partially or completely damaged or destroyed by fire or other means
may be rebuilt or repaired on its existing foundation even though such
foundation may violate the setback requirements for the zoning district
in which the structure is located, provided that the repair or
reconstruction and reoccupancy of the structure occurs within 18
months of the date that the original structure was damaged or
destroyed. No enlargement or expansion of the nonconforming
structure shall be undertaken unless the provisions of § 180-92A are
met.
C. Moving. Should a nonconforming structure be moved for any reason for
any distance whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the requirements
of the zoning district in which it is located.
D. Signs.
(1) Nonconforming signs may be repaired or reconstructed, provided
that no structural alterations are made that increase the gross
surface area of the sign; however, nonconforming signs that are
damaged or destroyed to an extent of more than 51% of their
replacement cost at the time of destruction shall not be
reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this
chapter. Replacement cost shall be determined by the Borough
Engineer upon request by the Borough. The Borough Engineer

within five working days of the Borough's request. The cost of the
services of the Borough Engineer shall be borne by the applicant.
Said cost shall not exceed the amount established from time to time
by resolution of Borough Council.
(2) Nonconforming signs shall not be enlarged, added to or replaced
by another nonconforming sign, use or structure, except that the
interchange of advertising panels shall be permitted, subject to
obtaining the sign permit required by § 180-114.
E. Repair or maintenance. Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to
prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any
structure or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any official charged
with protecting the safety of the public, provided all other requirements
of this section are met.
A. Lot area or lot width. Any lot of record existing at the effective date of
this chapter may be used for the erection of a structure conforming to
the use regulations of the zoning district in which it is located, without a
lot area or lot width variance, even though its lot area and width are
less than the minimum required by this chapter; however, such lot must
comply with the front, rear and side yards, height and lot coverage
standards of the zoning district wherein it is located.
B. Front yard setback. Where structures exist on adjacent nonconforming
lots of record that have front yards that are less than the minimum
depth required, the minimum front yard for an adjacent vacant
nonconforming lot of record proposed to be built upon shall be the
average depth of the nonconforming front yards for the existing
structures on the adjacent nonconforming lots in the same block on the
same side of the street.
A. The owner of a nonconforming use shall make an application for
registration of the nonconforming use, and upon presentation of
documentation acceptable to the Zoning Officer that the use was
lawfully in existence prior to the effective date of this chapter or any
amendment that created the nonconformity, the Zoning Officer shall
register the same on a map and by the Beaver County Assessor's tax
parcel number as a legal nonconforming use.
B. In the course of administering this chapter and reviewing applications
for zoning certificates, certificates of occupancy or variances, the
Zoning Officer shall register all nonconforming structures and
§ 180-92 ECONOMY CODE § 180-94
178:644
nonconforming lots as they become known through the application
process.

§ 180-104. Mediation.
§ 180-105. Fees and expenditures.
A. Parties to proceedings authorized in this article may utilize mediation
as an aid in completing such proceedings. In proceedings before the

supplement, not replace, those procedures in this article once they have
been formally initiated. Nothing in this subsection shall be interpreted
as expanding or limiting municipal police powers or as modifying any
principles of substantive law.
B. Participation in mediation shall be wholly voluntary. The
appropriateness of mediation shall be determined by the particulars of
each case and the willingness of the parties to negotiate. The Borough,
in offering the mediation option, shall assure that in each case, the
mediating parties, assisted by the mediator as appropriate, develop
terms and conditions for:
(1) Funding mediation.
(2) Selecting a mediator who, at a minimum, shall have a working
knowledge of municipal zoning and subdivision procedures and
demonstrated skills in mediation.

amended),124 provided there is written consent by the mediating
parties, and by an applicant or Borough decisionmaking body, if
either is not a party to the mediation.
(5) Identifying all parties and affording them the opportunity to
participate.
(6) Subject to legal restraints, determining whether some or all of the
mediation sessions shall be open or closed to the public.
(7) Assuring that mediated solutions are in writing and signed by the
parties, and become subject to review and approval by the
appropriate decisionmaking body pursuant to the authorized
procedures set forth in this chapter.
C. No offers or statements made in the mediation sessions, excluding the
final written mediated agreement, shall be admissible as evidence in
any subsequent judicial or administrative proceedings.

Hearing Board, notice and advertising costs and necessary
administrative overhead connected with the hearing. The costs,
however, shall not include legal expenses of the Zoning Hearing Board,
expenses for engineering, architectural or other technical consultants
or expert witness costs.
B. Stenographer's appearance fee and transcripts. The appearance fee for
a stenographer shall be shared equally by the applicant and the Zoning
Hearing Board. The cost of the original transcript shall be paid by the
Zoning Hearing Board if the transcript is ordered by the Zoning
Hearing Board or Hearing Officer or shall be paid by the person
appealing from the decision of the Zoning Hearing Board if such appeal
is made, and in either event the cost of additional copies shall be paid
by the person requesting such copy or copies. In other cases, the party
requesting the original transcript shall bear the cost thereof.
C. Expenditures. Members of the Zoning Hearing Board may receive
compensation for the performance of their duties as may be fixed by
Borough Council, but in no case shall it exceed the rate of compensation
authorized to be paid to the members of Borough Council. Within the
limits of funds appropriated by Borough Council, the Zoning Hearing
Board may employ or contract for secretaries, clerks, legal counsel,
consultants and other technical services.
A. No person shall file any proceeding before the Zoning Hearing Board
later than 30 days after a preliminary or final application for
development has been approved by an appropriate Borough officer,
agency or body, if such proceeding is designed to secure reversal or to
limit the approval in any manner, unless such person alleges and proves
that he had no notice, knowledge or reason to believe that such
approval had been given. If such person has succeeded to his interest
after such approval, he shall be bound by the knowledge of his
predecessor in interest.
B. The failure of anyone, other than the landowner, to appeal from an
adverse decision on an application for tentative approval of a planned
residential development (PRD) or from an adverse decision by the
Zoning Officer on a challenge to the validity of an ordinance or map
filed pursuant to Section 916.2 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities
Planning Code125 shall preclude an appeal from a final approval, except
in the case where the final submission substantially deviates from the
approved tentative approval.

by the landowner within 30 days after notice of the determination is

A. Upon the filing of any proceeding and during its pendency before the
Zoning Hearing Board, all land development pursuant to any
challenged ordinance, order or approval of the Zoning Officer or of any
agency or body, and all official action thereunder, shall be stayed unless
the Zoning Officer or any other appropriate agency or body certifies to
the Zoning Hearing Board facts indicating that such stay would cause
imminent peril to life or property, in which case the development or
official action shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order,
that may be granted by the Zoning Hearing Board or by the court
having jurisdiction of zoning appeals on petition after notice to the
Zoning Officer or other appropriate agency or body. When an
application for development, preliminary or final, has been duly
approved and proceedings designed to reverse or limit the approval are
filed with the Zoning Hearing Board by persons other than the
applicant, the applicant may petition the Court having jurisdiction of
the zoning appeals to order such persons to post bond as a condition to
continuing the proceedings before the Zoning Hearing Board. The
question whether or not such petition should be granted and the
amount of the bond shall be within the sound discretion of the Court.
B. All appeals from decisions rendered by the Zoning Hearing Board shall
be taken to the Beaver County Court of Common Pleas and shall be filed
within 30 days after the entry of the decision or, in the case of a deemed
decision, within 30 days after the date upon which notice of said
deemed decision is given as required by Subsection 908(9) of the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code (Act 247, as amended).126

hearing is conducted by Borough Council. Public notice shall be given
in accordance with Sections 610, 1004 and other applicable provisions
of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code.129 The hearings shall
be conducted in accordance with the provisions of Subdivisions (4)
through (8) of Section 908 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning
128. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. §§ 10609.1 and 10916.1, respectively. Section 1004 of the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code (53 P.S. § 11004; see now 53 P.S. § 10916.1)

B. Evaluation of merits of curative amendment. If Borough Council
determines that a validity challenge has merit, Borough Council may
accept a landowner's curative amendment, with or without revision, or
may adopt an alternative amendment that will cure the alleged defects.
Borough Council shall consider the curative amendments, plans and
explanatory material submitted by the landowner and shall also
consider:
(1) The impact of the proposal upon roads, sewer facilities, water
supplies, schools and other public service facilities;
(2) If the proposal is for a residential use, the impact of the proposal
upon regional housing needs and the effectiveness of the proposal
in providing housing units of a type actually available to and
affordable by classes of persons otherwise unlawfully excluded by
the challenged provisions of this chapter or Zoning District Map;
(3) The suitability of the site for the intensity of the use proposed by
the site's soils, slopes, woodlands, wetlands, floodplains, aquifers,
natural resources and other natural features;
(4) The impact of the proposed use on the site's soils, slopes,
woodlands, wetlands, floodplains, natural resources and natural
features, the degree to which these are protected or destroyed, the
tolerance of the resources to development and any adverse
environmental impacts; and
(5) The impact of the proposal on the preservation of agriculture and
other land uses that are essential to public health and welfare.
C. Declaration of invalidity by court. If the Borough does not accept a
landowner's curative amendment brought in accordance with this
section and a court subsequently rules the challenge has merit, the
court's decision shall not result in a declaration of invalidity for this
entire ordinance but only for those provisions that specifically relate to
the landowner's curative amendment challenge.

§ A190-3. Term of franchise.
The franchise granted pursuant to this agreement shall be for an initial term
of 10 years from the effective date of the franchise as set forth in § A190-4.
§ A190-4. Acceptance by grantee; effective date.
The grantee shall accept the franchise granted pursuant hereto by signing

Borough action.
§ A190-5. Franchise to be nonexclusive.
The right to use and occupy said public ways, as defined above, for the
purpose herein set forth shall not be exclusive to the grantee. However,
the franchise authority shall require a franchise agreement for any other
person or entity, as defined above, engaging in the cable service business
within any portion of the Borough. The grantee shall receive the benefits
of any more favorable terms or conditions enjoyed by another person or
entity and otherwise, this agreement and any enabling legislation shall only
be amended through mutual consent. In cases of future conflict between
the provisions of this agreement and any ordinance, resolution, rule or

All transmission and distribution structures, poles, other lines and
equipment installed or erected by the grantee pursuant to the terms hereof
shall be located so as to cause a minimum of interference with the proper

If during the course of the grantee's construction, operation or maintenance
of the cable system there occurs a disturbance of any public way by the

abandonment, freeway and street construction, change or establishment of
street grade, installation of sewers, drains, gas or water pipes or any other
type of structures or improvements by the franchising authority, but the
grantee shall in all cases have the right of abandonment of its property. If
public funds are available to any company using such street, easement or
right-of-way for the purpose of defraying the cost of any of the foregoing,
the franchising authority shall make application for the same on behalf of
the grantee, and such funds shall also be made available to the grantee.
Should said public fund reimbursement request to fully compensate the
grantee be denied, and should the franchising authority and the grantee be
unable to agree on an acceptable method and amount of reimbursement,
then the grantee shall be released from any obligation to provide cable
service to the affected street or area.

to arrange for such temporary wire changes.
§ A190-10. Authority of grantee to trim trees.
The grantee shall have the authority to trim trees or other natural growth
overhanging any of its cable system in the service area so as to prevent
branches from coming in contact with the grantee's wires, cables or other
equipment. The grantee shall be permitted to charge persons who own
or are responsible for such trees or natural growth for the cost of such
trimming, provided that similar charges are assessed by and paid to the
utilities or the franchising authority for tree trimming. The grantee shall
reasonably compensate the franchising authority or property owner for any
damages caused by such trimming or shall, in its sole discretion and at its
own cost and expense, reasonably replace all trees or shrubs damaged as
a result of any construction of the cable system undertaken by the grantee.
Such replacement shall satisfy any and all obligations the grantee may have
to the franchise authority or property owner pursuant to the terms of this
section.
§ A190-11. Use of grantee's equipment by franchising authority.
Subject to any applicable state or federal regulations or tariffs, the
franchising authority shall have the right to make additional use, for any
public purpose, of any poles or conduits controlled or maintained
exclusively by or for the grantee in any public way, provided that such use
§ A190-8 ECONOMY CODE § A190-11
A190:674
by the franchising authority does not interfere with a current or future use
by the grantee, and the franchising authority holds the grantee harmless
against any and from all claims, demands, costs or liabilities of every kind
and nature whatsoever arising out of such use of said poles or conduits,
including but not limited to reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, and, at
the grantee's sole discretion, the franchising authority may be required
either to pay a reasonable rental fee or otherwise reasonably compensate
the grantee for the use of such poles, conduits or equipment; provided,
however, that the grantee agrees that such compensation or charge shall
not exceed those paid by it to public utilities pursuant to the applicable pole
attachment agreement or other authorization relating to the service area.
§ A190-12. Safety and technical requirements.
Construction, installation and maintenance of the cable system shall be
performed in an orderly and workmanlike manner. All such work shall
be performed in substantial accordance with applicable safety code or
technical requirements, including but not limited to the National Electrical
Safety Code (National Bureau of Standards); the National Electrical Code
(National Bureau of Fire Underwriters); and applicable FCC or other federal
and state regulations. The cable system shall not unreasonably endanger
or interfere with the safety of persons or property in the service area.
In particular, the grantee shall comply with all state or federal laws or
regulations which govern cable plant signal leakage or interference with
communications media. Any antenna structure used in the cable system
shall comply with all construction, marking and lighting of antenna
structure requirements of the United States Department of Transportation
(Federal Aviation Administration) and the FCC.
§ A190-13. Aerial and underground construction.
In those areas of the service area where all of the transmission or
distribution facilities of the respective public utilities providing telephone
communications and electric services are underground, the grantee
likewise shall construct, operate and maintain all of its transmission and
distribution facilities underground, provided that such facilities are actually
capable of receiving the grantee's cable and other equipment without
technical degradation of the cable system's signal quality. In those areas
of the service area where the transmission or distribution facilities of the
respective public utilities providing telephone communications and electric
services are both aerial and underground, the grantee shall have the sole
discretion to construct, operate and maintain all of its transmission and
distribution facilities, or any part thereof, aerially or underground. Nothing
contained in this section shall require the grantee to construct, operate
and maintain underground any ground-mounted appurtenances, such as
subscriber taps, line extenders, system passive devices (splitters and
directional couplers), amplifiers, power supplies, pedestals or other related
equipment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
section, in the event that all of the transmission or distribution facilities
of the respective public utilities providing telephone communications and
§ A190-11 CABLE TELEVISION FRANCHISE § A190-13
A190:675
electric services are placed underground after the effective date of this
agreement, the grantee shall only be required to construct, operate and
maintain all of its transmission and distribution facilities underground if it
is given reasonable notice and access to the public utilities facilities at the
time that such are placed underground.
§ A190-14. Extension of service.
The cable system as presently constructed is hereby approved as to extent
of the service area. The grantee is hereby authorized to extend the cable
system as necessary, as desirable or as required pursuant to the terms
hereof within the service area. Whenever the grantee shall receive a written
request for service from at least 15 potential subscribers within 1,320
cable-bearing stand feet [one-fourth (1/4) cable mile] of its aerial trunk
cable or from 25 potential subscribers in underground construction areas,
it shall extend its cable system to such subscribers at no cost to said
subscribers for system extension, other than the usual connection fees for
all subscribers, provided that such extension is technically feasible and
if it will not adversely affect the operation, financial condition or market
development of the cable system. Written requests shall be numbered at a
rate of one head of household per individual address.
§ A190-15. Arbitrary refusal of service prohibited; fees for unusual
circumstances.
No subscriber or potential subscriber shall be refused service arbitrarily.
However, for unusual circumstances, such as requests for underground
cable where aerial installation is the standard, or where there is more than
150 feet of distance from distribution cable to connection of service to
subscribers or a density of less than that stated in § A190-14, the grantee
may establish a special fee. Existing subscribers who request replacement
of aerial line with underground installation may also be subject to this
special fee. Service may be made available on the basis of cost of material,
labor and easements, as a special fee, in order that existing subscribers
shall not be unfairly burdened.
§ A190-16. Service to public buildings.
The grantee shall provide without charge one outlet of basic cable service to
each of the franchise authority's office buildings, fire station, police station
and public elementary and secondary school building that is passed by its
cable system. The outlets of basic service shall not be used to distribute or
sell cable services in or throughout such buildings, nor shall such outlets be
located in common or public areas open to the public. Users of such outlets
shall hold the grantee harmless from any and all liability or claims arising
out of their use of such outlets, including but not limited to those arising
from copyright liability. Not withstanding anything to the contrary set forth
in this section, the grantee shall not be required to provide an outlet to
such buildings where the drop line from the feeder cable to said buildings
or premises exceeds 150 cable feet unless it is feasible and if it will not
§ A190-13 ECONOMY CODE § A190-16
A190:676
adversely affect the operation, financial condition or market development
of the cable system to do so or unless the appropriate governmental entity
agrees to pay the incremental cost of such drop line in excess of 150 cable
feet. In the event that additional outlet(s) of basic service are provided
to such buildings, the building owner shall pay the usual installation and
service fees associated therewith.
§ A190-17. Emergency usage.
In the case of any emergency or disaster, the grantee shall, upon request
of the franchising authority, make available its facilities for the franchising
authority to provide emergency information and instructions during the
emergency or disaster period. The franchising authority shall hold the
grantee, and its agents, employees, officers and assigns hereunder,
harmless from any claims arising out of the emergency use of its facilities by
the franchising authority, including but not limited to reasonable attorneys'
fees and costs.
§ A190-18. Technical and performance standards.
All performance and technical standards governing construction,
reconstruction, installation, operation, testing, maintenance and
dismantling of the cable system provided herein shall be in accordance with
all applicable FCC and other federal, state and local laws and regulations.
§ A190-19. Franchise fee.
The grantee shall pay to the franchising authority a franchise fee equal
to 5% of gross revenues, as defined by "gross subscriber revenue" in
§ A190-1A, received by the grantee from the operation of the cable system.
Franchise fee payments due the franchising authority under this section
shall be computed quarterly. The quarterly franchise fee payments shall be
due and payable 60 days after the close of the preceding calendar quarter.
For the purpose of franchise fee accounting, the applicable period shall be
a calendar year, and, within 60 days of the close of each calendar year,
a representative of the grantee shall prepare and deliver a brief report
showing the basis for computation of franchise fees. In no event shall the
franchise fee payments required to be paid by the grantee exceed 5% of
gross revenues received by the grantee in any twelve-month period. The
franchise fee payment shall be the sole compensation due, and no other fee,
charge, tax or other consideration shall be paid by the grantee. Sales tax
or other tax levied on a per-subscription basis and collected by the grantee
shall be deducted from gross revenues in computing any sum due.
§ A190-20. Rates and charges.
The franchising authority may not regulate the rates for the provision of
cable service and other services, including but not limited to ancillary
charges relating thereto, except as authorized pursuant to federal law,
including but not limited to the Cable Act and FCC rules and regulations
§ A190-16 CABLE TELEVISION FRANCHISE § A190-20
A190:677
relating thereto. The grantee shall have the right to modify rates from time
to time and to implement additional charges and rates.
§ A190-21. Renewal of franchise.
§ A190-22. Conditions of sale.
A. The franchising authority and the grantee agree that any proceedings
undertaken by the franchising authority that relate to the renewal of
the grantee's franchise shall be governed by and comply with the
provisions of Section 626 of the Cable Act (as such existed as of the
effective date of the Cable Act), unless the procedures and substantive
protections set forth therein shall be deemed to be preempted and
superseded by the provisions of any subsequent provisions of federal or
state law.
B. In addition to the procedures set forth in said Section 626(a), the
franchising authority agrees to notify the grantee of its preliminary
assessments regarding the identity of future cable-related community
needs and interests, as well as the past performance of the grantee
under the then-current franchise term. The franchising authority
further agrees that such a preliminary assessment shall be provided to
the grantee prior to the time that the four-month period referred to in
Subsection (c) of Section 626 is considered to begin. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this section, the grantee and
franchising authority agree that at any time during the term of the thencurrent
franchise, while affording the public appropriate notice and
opportunity to comment, the franchising authority and grantee may
agree to undertake and finalize negotiations regarding renewal of the
then-current franchise, and the franchising authority may grant a
renewal thereof. The Grantee and the Franchising Authority consider
the terms set forth in this section to be consistent with the express
provisions of Section 626 of the Cable Act. A reproduction of Section
626 of the Cable Act as such existed as of the effective date of the Cable
Act is attached hereto as Exhibit A and incorporated herein by this
reference.131
A. Except to the extent expressly required by federal or state law, if a
renewal or extension of the grantee's franchise is denied or if the
franchise is lawfully terminated, and the franchising authority either
lawfully acquires ownership of the cable system or by its actions
lawfully effects a transfer of ownership of the cable system to another
party, any such acquisition or transfer shall be at a fair market value,
determined on the basis of the cable system valued as an ongoing
concern.
B. The grantee and franchising authority agree that in the case of a lawful
revocation of the franchise, at the grantee's request, which shall be
made in its sole discretion, the grantee shall be given a reasonable
131. Editor's Note: Said Exhibit A is currently on file in the office of the Borough Secretary.
§ A190-20 ECONOMY CODE § A190-22
A190:678
§ A190-23. Transfer.
The grantee's right, title or interest in the franchise shall not be sold,
transferred, assigned or otherwise encumbered, other than to an affiliate,
without the prior consent of the franchising authority, such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld. In cases where consent of the franchising
authority is requested, in this or other matters, the grantee shall be given
notice of the decision of the franchising authority, in writing and by
registered or certified mail, within 45 days of franchising authority receipt
of such request. Absence of notice within the specified time shall mean
that the request is automatically granted without official action by the
franchising authority. No such consent shall be required, however, for a
transfer in trust, by mortgage, by other hypothecation or by assignment of
any rights, title or interest of the grantee in the franchise or cable system in
order to secure indebtedness.
§ A190-24. Testing for compliance.
The franchising authority may perform technical tests of the cable system
during reasonable times and in a manner which does not unreasonably
interfere with the normal business operations of the grantee or the cable
system in order to determine whether or not the grantee is in compliance
with the terms hereof and applicable state or federal laws. Except in
emergency circumstances, such tests may be undertaken only after giving
the grantee reasonable notice thereof, not to be less than two business
days, and providing a representative of the grantee an opportunity to be
present during such tests. In the event that such testing demonstrates that
the grantee has substantially failed to comply with a material requirement
hereof, the reasonable costs of such tests shall be borne by the grantee. In
the event that such testing demonstrates that the grantee has substantially
complied with such material provisions hereof, the cost of such testing shall
be borne by the franchising authority. Except in emergency circumstances,
the franchising authority agrees that such testing shall be undertaken no
opportunity to effectuate a transfer of its cable system to a qualified
third party. The franchising authority further agrees that during such
a period of time, it shall authorize the grantee to continue to operate
pursuant to the terms of its prior franchise; however, in no event shall
such authorization exceed a period of time greater than six months
from the effective date of such revocation. If, at the end of that time, the
grantee is unsuccessful in procuring a qualified transferee or assignee
of its cable system which is reasonably acceptable to the franchising
authority, the grantee and franchising authority may avail themselves
of any rights they may have pursuant to federal or state law, it being
further agreed that the grantee's continued operation of its cable
system during the six-month period shall not be deemed to be a waiver
nor an extinguishment of any rights of either the franchising authority
or the grantee. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this section, neither the franchise authority nor the grantee shall be
required to violate federal or state law.
§ A190-22 CABLE TELEVISION FRANCHISE § A190-24
A190:679
more than two times a year in the aggregate and that the results thereof
shall be made available to the grantee upon the grantee's request.
§ A190-25. Review of books and records.
The grantee agrees that the franchising authority may review such of its
books and records, during normal business hours and on a nondisruptive
basis, as is reasonably necessary to monitor compliance with the terms
hereof. Such records shall include, but shall not be limited to, any public
records required to be kept by the grantee pursuant to the rules and
regulations of the FCC. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
herein, the grantee shall not be required to disclose information which
it reasonably deems to be proprietary or confidential in nature. The
franchising authority agrees to treat any information disclosed by the
grantee to it as confidential and only to disclose it to employees,
representatives and agents thereof that have a need to know or in order
to enforce the provisions hereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
stated herein, the grantee shall not be required to violate the provisions of
Section 631 of the Cable Act, Protection of Subscriber Privacy.
§ A190-26. Insurance requirements.
The grantee shall maintain in full force and effect, at its own cost and
expense, during the term of the franchise, comprehensive general liability
insurance in the amount of $1,000,000 combined single limit for bodily
injury and property damage. The insurance carrier for the grantee shall
be solvent and authorized to conduct business in the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania. Any insurance policy issued in connection with this franchise
shall designate the franchising authority as an additional insured. The
grantee shall provide the franchising authority with a certificate of
insurance to show compliance with the provisions of this section. Such
insurance shall be noncancelable except upon 30 days prior written notice
to the franchising authority.
§ A190-27. Indemnification of franchising authority.
The grantee agrees to indemnify, save and hold harmless and defend the
franchising authority, its officers, boards and employees, from and against
any liability for damages and for any liability or claims resulting from
property damage or bodily injury (including accidental death), which arise
out of the grantee's construction, operation or maintenance of its cable
system, including but not limited to reasonable attorney's fees and costs.
§ A190-28. Bonds and other surety.
The grantee shall not be required to obtain or maintain bonds or other
surety as a condition of being awarded the franchise or continuing its
existence. The franchising authority acknowledges that the legal, financial
and technical qualifications of the grantee are sufficient to afford
compliance with the terms of the franchise and enforcement thereof.
§ A190-24 ECONOMY CODE § A190-29
A190:680
§ A190-29. Notice of violation.
In the event that the franchising authority believes that the grantee has
not complied with the terms of the franchise, it shall notify the grantee, in
writing, by certified or registered mail, of the exact nature of the alleged
noncompliance.
§ A190-30. Time limit for grantee to respond to notice.
The grantee shall have 30 days from receipt of the notice described in
§ A190-29 to respond to the franchising authority contesting the assertion
of noncompliance or to cure such default or, in the event that by the nature
of default, such default cannot be cured within the thirty-day period, initiate
reasonable steps to remedy such default and notify the franchising authority
of the steps being taken and the projected date that they will be completed.
§ A190-31. Public hearing.
In the event that the grantee fails to respond to the notice described in
§ A190-29 pursuant to the procedures set forth in § A190-30 or in the event
that the alleged default is not remedied within 60 days after the grantee
is notified of the alleged default pursuant to § A190-29, the franchising
authority shall schedule a public hearing to investigate the default. Such
public hearing shall be held at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the
franchising authority which is scheduled at a time which is no less than five
business days therefrom. The franchising authority shall notify the grantee
of the time and place of such hearing and provide the grantee with an
opportunity to be heard.
§ A190-32. Enforcement.
A. Subject to applicable federal and state law, in the event that the
franchising authority, after such hearing, determines that the grantee is
in default of any provision of the franchise, the franchising authority
may:
(1) Seek specific performance of any provision, which reasonably lends
itself to such remedy, as an alternative to damages;
(2) Commence an action at law for monetary damages or seek other
equitable relief; or
(3) In the case of a substantial default of a material provision of the
franchise, declare the franchise agreement to be revoked.
B. The grantee shall not be relieved of any of its obligations to comply
promptly with any provision of the franchise by reason of any failure of
the franchising authority to enforce prompt compliance.
§ A190-29 CABLE TELEVISION FRANCHISE § A190-33
A190:681
§ A190-33. Events beyond grantee's control.
The grantee shall not be held in default or noncompliance with the
provisions of the franchise, nor suffer any enforcement or penalty relating
thereto, where such noncompliance or alleged defaults are caused by
strikes, acts of God, power outages or other events reasonably beyond its
ability to control.
§ A190-34. Incorporated documents.
The following documents shall be incorporated herein:132
§ A190-35. Preemption by state and federal bodies.
If the FCC or any other federal or state body or agency shall now or
hereafter exercise any paramount jurisdiction over the subject matter of the
franchise, then to the extent such jurisdiction shall preempt and supersede
or preclude the exercise of the like jurisdiction by the franchising authority,
the jurisdiction of the franchising authority shall cease and no longer exist.
§ A190-36. Actions of grantee and franchising authority.
In any action by the grantee and the franchising authority or representative
thereof mandated or permitted under the terms hereof, such party shall
act in a reasonable, expeditious and timely manner. Furthermore, in any
instance where approval or consent is required under the terms hereof,
such approval or consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.
§ A190-37. Form of notices.
Unless expressly otherwise agreed between the parties, every notice or
response to be served upon the franchising authority or grantee shall be
in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given to the required
