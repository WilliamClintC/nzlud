PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the Town of Bristol, Rhode Island. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1972 Code, as supplemented through June 21, 1995, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the town council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1972 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as chapter 12.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
GRAND DEED GD:1 CHARTER CHT:1 SPECIAL ACTS SA:1 CHARTER COMPARATIVE TABLE CHTCT:1 CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CHARTER INDEX CHTi:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Jan Shekitka, Supervising Editor, and Robert MacNaughton, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Diane Mederos, Town Clerk, Michael Ursillo, Town Solicitor, and other members of the town government for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the town readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the town's affairs.

(e)  Sound variances shall be granted by notice to the applicant containing all conditions necessary to minimize adverse effects upon the community or the surrounding neighborhood, including a time limit on the permitted activity. The sound variance shall not become effective until all conditions are agreed to by the applicant. Noncompliance with any condition of the sound variance shall terminate it and subject that person to those provisions of this article regulating the source of sound or activity for which the sound variance was granted. 
(f)  Determination of modification of a granted variance shall also be made in accordance with the rules and procedures set forth in this section.

Sec. 14-4.2. - Duties and powers of the commission. 
    Duties and powers of the historic district commission are as follows: 
(1)  Review boundaries and list of structures. Review of historic district boundaries and lists of historic structures. 
a.  It shall be the duty of the commission to review the map of historic districts and its attachment described in section 14-3 at least once every three years, and to make recommendations to the town council for: 
1.  Modifications of historic district boundaries; and 
2.  Additions and deletions to the lists of structures of historic or architectural value. 
b.  It is the intent of this chapter that all such recommendations shall be made only after careful study by the historic district commission, shall be based on documented facts, and shall be in keeping with the purposes set forth in section 14-2. 
(2)  Review of applications. Review of applications by the historic district commission shall be done as follows: 
a.  It shall be the duty of the historic district commission to review applications for the construction of any structure within an historic district; or for the alteration, repair, moving or demolition of any existing structure within an historic district or designated as having historic or architectural value in accordance with section 14-3, when such alteration, repair, moving or demolition in any manner affects the structure's exterior appearance or location; or the construction, alteration, repair, moving or demolition of site appurtenances that affect the appearance of the surrounding area. The historic district commission shall have the power to pass upon such applications before a permit for such activity is granted or before such activity receives final approval by any other town government entity including but not limited to, the zoning board and planning board or before the issuance of a building permit. 
b.  In reviewing applications, the historic district commission shall give consideration to the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation or similar standards adopted by the U.S. Department of the Interior or the Rhode Island Historic Preservation and Heritage Commission. In rendering its decision the commission shall make findings of fact which may include, but are not limited to, the following: 
1.  The historic or architectural value and significance of the structure and its appurtenances and their relationship to the historic value of the surrounding area; 
2.  The relationship of the exterior architectural features of such structure to the rest of the structure and the surrounding area; 
3.  The general compatibility of exterior arrangement, design, texture, and materials proposed to be used; and 
4.  Any other factor affecting the structure or site, including aesthetics, which it deems to be pertinent. 
c.  The historic district commission shall pass only on exterior features of the structure and its appurtenances and shall not consider interior arrangement, nor shall it disapprove applications except in regard to the standards and considerations set forth in this section. Provided however, that with regard to applications for formula businesses, as defined in section 28-1 of the Code, the historic district commission may review and regulate any interior features, including without limitation signs, which are visible to passers-by through any window, opening, or open door; may review and regulate any exterior facade or sign colors so as to prevent the use of a "corporate color scheme" to defeat the purposes of the formula business regulations; and may (independently of the zoning board) give consideration to the standards set forth in subsection 28-150(h) of the Code. 
d.  It is the intent of this chapter that the historic district commission be strict in its judgment of plans for structures deemed to be valuable in section 14-3. It is also the intent of this chapter that the historic district commission be lenient in its judgments of plans for structures of little historic value or for plans for new construction except where such plans would seriously impair the historic or architectural value of surrounding structures or the surrounding area. It is not the intent of this chapter to limit new construction, alteration, or repairs to any one period of architectural style. 
e.  In the case of an application for repair or alteration affecting the appearance of a structure or for the moving or demolition of a structure which the historic district commission deems so valuable to the town, state or nation that the loss thereof will be a great loss to the town, state or nation, the historic district commission shall endeavor to work out with the owner an economically feasible plan for the preservation of such a structure. Unless the commission is satisfied that retention of such structure constitutes a hazard to the public safety, which hazard cannot be eliminated by economic means available to the owner or unless such proposed construction, alteration and repair will not, in the opinion of the historic district commission, materially impair the historic value of such structure, the commission shall file with the building official or other responsible town government entity its rejection of such application. In the absence of change in such structure arising from casualty, no new application for the same or similar work shall be filed within one year after such rejection. 
f.  In the case of any structure deemed to be valuable for the period of architecture it represents and important to the neighborhood within which it exists, the historic district commission may file with the building official or other responsible town government entity its approval of such application if any of the circumstances under which approval might have been given under this section are in existence or if: 
1.  Such structure is a deterrent to a major improvement program which will be of substantial benefit to the community; 
2.  Retention of such structure would cause undue financial hardship on the owner; or 
3.  The retention of such structure would not be in the interest of the majority of the community. 
g.  Moving or demolishing of structures of historic or architectural value may be allowed only if there is no other way to retain the structure on its present site. 
(3)  Provide advice to the zoning board of review; variances. Due to the peculiar conditions of design and construction in historic neighborhoods where structures were often built close to the lot lines, it is in the public interest to retain a neighborhood's historic appearance by granting variances or exceptions to normal yard requirements. Upon receipt of a completed application for relief from the dimensional requirements of the zoning ordinance, the zoning board shall send a copy of the application to the commission. Where it is deemed that such variance or exception will not adversely affect neighboring properties, the historic district commission may recommend to the zoning board of review that such variance or exception to the standard requirements be made. Such recommendation shall be submitted to the zoning board prior to the close of the public hearing on the application and shall be advisory.

Sec. 14-5. - Procedure for review of applications. 
(a)  Certificate of appropriateness required. Before a property owner and/or applicant may authorize or commence construction, alteration, repair, removal or demolition affecting the exterior appearance of a structure or its appurtenances within the historic district or an existing structure designated to be of historic or architectural value in accordance with section 14-3, the owner must apply for and receive a certificate of appropriateness from the commission. The owner of the property must obtain a certificate of appropriateness for the project whether or not state law requires that he or she also obtain a permit from the local building official. The building official shall not issue a permit until the commission has granted a certificate of appropriateness. 
(b)  Submittal of applications. Submittal of applications shall proceed in accordance with the guidelines and procedures pursuant to section 14-4.1. and as follows: 
(1)  Upon receipt of any application for a building permit, the building official shall independently verify whether the property is in an historic district or whether the structure has been designated as being of historic or architectural value. In making this independent verification, the building official shall consult the map of historic districts and its attachments as described in section 14-3. 
(2)  Any application determined by the building official to pertain to a property or structure covered by section 14-3, must be submitted, along with all plans and other information received by the building official, to the historic district commission for review within ten working days of the filing of such application. Incomplete applications shall be returned to the applicant, and notice shall be sent to the building official within seven working days of receipt by the historic district commission of a completed application. 
(3)  Town government entities proposing any activity described in subsection (a)(1) of this section for individuals, even though no building permit is required for such government entity, shall submit application and plans directly to the historic district commission before such activity is authorized. Town government entities submitting applications shall use the same forms and meet the same requirements as specified for individuals applying for certification. 
(b)  Requirements for historic district commission review. 
(1)  The historic district commission shall review all completed applications it receives at its next regular meeting, providing such completed applications are received by the commission at least ten working days before such meeting. 
(2)  When reviewing applications, the historic district commission may confer with the applicant and may suggest what it thinks is proper for approval. If the applicant makes the suggested modifications, the historic district commission will consider the revised application at the next regular meeting. 
(3)  The commission shall render a written decision either approving or denying, in whole or in part, the scope of work proposed and stating the reasons for such action. Those aspects of a project which are denied by the commission cannot be resubmitted for one calendar year from the date of first receipt by the commission. A denial by the commission shall be binding upon the building official and no permit shall be issued or work authorized in such case. 
(c)  Certificate of appropriateness. The historic district commission shall, transmit a copy of the decision of approval, to the building official. No permit shall be issued or work begun until such certificate shall be signed by the chairperson or vice-chairperson and attached to the building permit application. The chairperson or vice-chairperson shall also stamp and sign all plans or prints submitted to the historic district commission, signifying its approval. Approvals are good for one year from the date of their issuance, providing work has commenced during that year. Extensions for the same approved plans for one year may be requested without a new complete application providing such request is made during the year of the initial approval. 
(d)  Failure of the historic district commission to act. The failure of the historic district commission to act within 45 days of the certification of an application as complete, shall be deemed to constitute approval, unless an extension is agreed upon mutually by the applicant and the commission. If, however, the commission shall make a finding that circumstances of a particular application require further study and information than can be obtained within such period of 45 days, then, the historic district commission shall have a period of up to 90 days within which to act upon such application.

(a)  The normal form of pension payable to a pensioner will be an annuity payable for the remaining lifetime of such pensioner; provided that if such pensioner shall not live to receive such monthly payments for at least 60 months, such monthly payments shall be continued to the beneficiary designated by such pensioner until the aggregate of the number of monthly payments made to the pensioner and his beneficiary totals 60. 
(b)  Subject to the conditions hereinafter set forth, a participant may elect one of the following optional forms of pension in lieu of the normal form set forth within this subsection: 
(1)  A contingent annuitant form under which he shall receive, commencing on the same date as that on which his normal pension would otherwise commence, and ceasing with the payment due on the first day of the month in which his death occurs, a reduced amount of pension, and after his death a person designated by him as his contingent annuitant (if such person shall survive him) shall receive for life either the same reduced amount of pension, or, subject to the approval of the trustees, such percentage thereof as is specified by the participant in his election; provided, however, that if the spouse of such participant is named as contingent annuitant, the election of this optional form shall not be permitted if the aggregate of the survivor benefit to which such spouse is entitled under subsection (8), below, and the amount payable to her under this option would be a monthly payment greater than the pension to which the participant himself would be entitled under the option during his lifetime. 
(2)  A form of pension under which the participant shall receive, commencing on the same date as that on which his pension would otherwise commence, and ceasing with the payment due on the first day of the month in which his death occurs, a reduced amount of pension, and after his death, if death occurs before he shall have received monthly payments for a period of ten years, or 15 years, whichever period the participant shall elect, the beneficiary designated by him shall receive the same reduced monthly pension for the remainder of such period. 
(3)  The conditions under which such an option may be elected are: 
a.  Election must be in writing and filed at least two years prior to the earlier of his actual retirement date or normal retirement date, except that in the case of a participant whose normal retirement date will occur within two years following the effective date, such participant shall have the right to make such election at any time prior to June 1, 1965. If a participant does not elect an option in accordance with the foregoing, any election subsequently made shall not become effective unless evidence of such participant's good health, satisfactory to the trustees, is furnished. 
b.  An option elected will become effective on the earlier of the participant's actual or normal retirement date. 
After the effective date of an option, such option may not be rescinded, nor may a contingent annuitant be changed. 
c.  If the contingent annuitant dies before the effective date of the option, the election shall cease to be effective. If a beneficiary dies before the effective date of the option, the participant may rescind his election by filing a written request therefor with the trustees. 
d.  The death of a contingent annuitant, or of a beneficiary, as the case may be, after the effective date of an option and while a pensioner is still living, shall not affect the amount of pension payable to such pensioner pursuant to an option elected. 
e.  If a participant for whom an option is in effect continues in active employment after his normal retirement date and dies before he retires, his contingent annuitant, or beneficiary, as the case may be, shall be entitled to benefit payments in accordance with the option elected commencing on the first day of the month following the death of the participant, in the amount which would have been payable had the participant retired as of such first day of the month and immediately died. 
f.  If a participant retires prior to his normal retirement date, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the option elected shall not become effective unless evidence of the participant's good health satisfactory to the trustees is furnished. 
g.  The amount of monthly pension payable under an option shall be of equivalent value, actuarially determined, to the amount of normal pension otherwise payable to the member as set forth in section 21-146. 
(Code 1972, § 16-58) 
Sec. 21-146. - Amount of normal pension. 
(a)  Participants benefits prior to 1986 shall remain as is. For participants retiring after April 1, 1986, the monthly pension payable to a participant, provided such monthly pension commences on a date which coincides with or is subsequent to his normal retirement date, shall be equal to 60 percent of the average monthly rate of his earnings for any period of 24 consecutive months which produces the highest average monthly rate, plus an additional one percent of such average rate of earnings for each completed year of service with the police department in excess of 20 years, (30 years or more will pay a maximum of 70 percent of the average monthly rate). Fractional periods of years shall be computed using 15 days and over as a month, under 15 days as not worked. As of July 1, 1998, such pension shall be compounded annually at the rate of three percent. 
(b)  A participant who voluntarily terminates employment prior to his normal retirement date shall be eligible for either: 
(1)  An amount of normal pension commencing on his normal retirement date which is in the ratio to that to which he would be entitled had he continued in active service to such normal retirement date at the same rate of earnings he was receiving on the date of his termination, as the number of his completed years of service to the date of his termination bears to the number of completed years of service he would have on his normal retirement date had he remained in active service until such normal retirement date; or 
(2)  A reduced amount of normal pension commencing on the first day of the month coinciding with or next following the date of his termination, which reduced amount shall be of equivalent value, actuarially determined, to the amount of normal pension to which he would be entitled commencing on his normal retirement date as set forth in the foregoing subsection (1), above, had it been deferred accordance with such section 21-101 the reduction to reflect the number of months commencement of pension payments precedes such participant's normal retirement date. 
(Code 1972, § 16-58; Ord. No. 1998-08, 4-22-98) 
Sec. 21-147. - Total and permanent disability pension. 
(a)  Accidental disability: Work-related injury/illness. In the event that a participant becomes totally and permanently disabled as a natural and proximate result of injuries or illness sustained while in the performance of duty and such disability is not the result of willful negligence or wanton misconduct on the part of the participant, who has been examined by a physician appointed by the town and remained away from regular employment with the police department for a period of 18 months, such participant shall be entitled to receive disability benefits upon being found physically unfit for duty. The town shall direct the trustees to place such participant on a disability pension as of the first of the month following the participant's retirement date. In the event that a participant shall apply for a disability pension prior to the expiration of the 18-month period described above, the trustees shall cause the participant to submit to a medical examination as set forth in subsection (e) below. Such participant shall be considered to be totally and permanently disabled for purposes of this section if the third physician concludes that the said participant is physically or mentally disabled for the performance of duty and such disability is not due to age or length of service. 
(b)  Ordinary disability: Non-work-related injury/illness. A participant who has not reached his normal retirement date and who has completed at least ten years of service with the police department of the town and who has become so disabled by any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to be either of indefinite duration or result in death, which disability is not incurred in the performance of his duties for the police department, and which renders the participant unfit for duty as a police officer, may be retired on a disability pension. 
(c)  The monthly disability benefit payable to a participant who becomes entitled thereto pursuant to subsection (a) shall be an amount equal to 72 percent of the participant's annual earnings at the time of the participant's retirement date. The benefit shall be payable monthly for the period of disability and shall be adjusted annually on July 1 of each year by a three percent compounded COLA. For the purposes of this section, "annual earnings" shall include annual salary, longevity and holiday pay. 
    The monthly disability benefit payable to a participant who becomes entitled thereto pursuant to subsection (b) shall be equal to 50 percent of the participant's average monthly rate of earnings over any period of two consecutive years which produces the highest average monthly rate. The benefit shall be payable monthly for the period of disability and shall be adjusted annually on July 1 of each year by a three percent compounded COLA. 
(d)  The trustees may, from time to time, cause a participant who is receiving a disability pension to be examined by a qualified physician selected by the trustees; provided, however, that there may not be more than one annual examination after the first year of the participant's retirement date. If, in such physician's opinion, the participant's condition warrants him returning to police duty with the police department, and the participant meets the departments written and physical requirements for new employees, he shall be regarded as having recovered from such disability, he shall be reinstated to police duty forthwith, and further payment of a disability pension to him shall cease. The failure of the participant to submit to such examination, when so requested by the trustees, shall result in discontinuance of the payment of the disability pension to such participant until he shall comply to such request. 
(e)  In the event a dispute shall arise as to whether a participant is, or continues to be disabled as provided by this subsection prior to cessation of benefits, he shall be examined by a qualified physician selected by the trustees and a qualified physician selected by such participant. The findings of such physicians shall be binding on the trustees, the participant and all others concerned. If such physicians shall not agree, the participant shall be examined by a third physician selected by the two other physicians, and the findings of such third physician shall be final and binding on the trustees, the participant and all others concerned. The trustees shall assume all expenses related to these examinations. 
(f)  Any amounts paid or payable under the provisions of subsection (a) shall be deemed workers' compensation. 
(Code 1972, § 16-58; Ord. No. 2001-20, 8-22-01; Ord. No. 2001-34, 10-24-01; Ord. No. 2001-42, 2-13-02) 
Sec. 21-148. - Terminations of employment. 
(a)  If a participant voluntarily terminates his employment with the police department, or his employment is terminated by the department for nondisciplinary reasons prior to such participant having completed ten years of service with the police department, he shall be paid a severance benefit equal to two weeks' pay for each year of service; provided, that if his contributions to the fund, with interest at three percent compounded annually shall aggregate an amount greater than such severance benefit, his contributions, with interest, shall be paid in lieu of such severance benefit; provided, however, that if the participant's services with the police department are terminated while he is a probationer, the foregoing to the contrary notwithstanding, he shall be paid an amount equal to the amounts paid into the fund from his salary with three percent interest. Such payment of a severance benefit or return of the participant's contributions with interest shall be in lieu of any rights to other benefits under the plan. 
(b)  If a participant voluntarily terminates employment, or his employment is terminated by the police department for nondisciplinary reasons, after such participant has completed ten years of service, he may elect either: 
(1)  A pension commencing on his normal retirement date, the amount of which shall be equal to the pension he would expect to receive upon attaining such normal retirement date had he continued in active service with the police department until such normal retirement date at his rate of earnings on the date of termination, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is his completed years of service to the date of his termination, and the denominator of which is the completed years of service he would have at normal retirement date if he had continued in active employment until such normal retirement date; or 
(2)  To be paid as a severance benefit (in lieu of such pension as provided under subsection (1)), an amount equal to the greater of three weeks' pay for each year of service or the aggregate of his contributions to the fund with interest at three percent. 
(c)  If a participant's employment with the police department is terminated for disciplinary reasons, irrespective of the foregoing provisions of this subsection, his contributions to the fund will be returned to him without interest and he shall have no further rights to benefits of any kind under the plan. 
(d)  Interest, as provided in this subsection, shall be compounded annually from the April 1 next following the date on which each amount is paid into the fund from the participant's salary to the first of the month in which his employment is terminated. 
(Code 1972, § 16-58) 
Sec. 21-149. - Survivor benefits of eligible spouse. 
(a)  An eligible spouse is one who is legally married to the participant, or pensioner, as the case may be, and who, on the date of death of such participant or pensioner, is not divorced or legally separated from him. 
(b)  Upon the death of the participant after attainment of his normal retirement date, the eligible surviving spouse of such participant shall be paid as a survivor's benefit, subject to the limitations hereafter set forth, a monthly pension the amount of which, provided such spouse is not more than three years younger than such participant, shall equal 671/2 percent of the normal pension to which the participant is entitled in accordance with the first paragraph of section 21-146. 
(c)  Upon the death of a participant who dies before attainment of his normal retirement date, and whose death occurs either as the result of injuries sustained in the performance of his duties for the police department, or after he has completed five years of service with the police department, the eligible surviving spouse of such deceased participant shall be paid as a survivor's benefit, subject to the limitations hereafter set forth, a monthly pension the amount of which, provided such spouse is not more than three years younger than such participant, shall be equal to 671/2 percent of the amount of normal pension the participant would be expected to receive had he lived and continued in active service with the police department to his normal retirement date (with earnings at the same rate he was receiving on the date of his death, or retirement, if such precedes his death, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the participant's completed years of service on the date of his death, and the denominator of which is the number of completed years of service he would have had upon his normal retirement date had he continued in active service and survived to that date. 
(d)  If the eligible surviving spouse is more than three years younger than the deceased pensioner or participant, as the case may be, the amount of survivor's benefit to which such eligible surviving spouse is entitled shall be a reduced amount which has the same value, actuarially determined, as the amount of survivor's benefit to which she would be entitled were she not more than three years younger than such pensioner or participant. 
(e)  The survivor's benefit payable to an eligible surviving spouse shall be a pension payable monthly, commencing as of the first of the month next following the death of the participant, or pensioner, as the case may be, and ceasing with the payment due on the first day of the month next preceding the earlier of the date of death or remarriage of such eligible spouse; provided that if the death of a pensioner occurs during the period when pension payments are guaranteed under the normal form of pension or guaranteed under the option as provided by subsection 21-145(a), the survivor's benefit, if any, payable for any month during the period in which such pension payments are so guaranteed shall be the excess, if any, of the amount of the survivor's benefit over the amount of pension payment so continue to the beneficiary. 
(Code 1972, § 16-58) 
Sec. 21-150. - Survivor benefits of eligible children. 
(a)  An eligible surviving child is a natural child born in lawful wedlock of a participant not later than nine months subsequent to the earliest of the retirement date, normal retirement date, or death of such participant; a child adopted by the participant prior to the earliest of the retirement date, normal retirement date or death of such participant; or a stepchild of a participant by a marriage taking place not less than two years prior to the earliest of the retirement date, normal retirement date or death of such participant, which child was receiving his principal support from the participant at the death of such participant, is not married, and has either not attained his 18th birthday or is attending school or college and has not attained his 22nd birthday.

(c)  Upon the death of a participant after attainment of his normal retirement date, there shall be paid on behalf of each eligible surviving child of such participant as a surviving child's benefit, subject to the limitations hereafter set forth, a monthly benefit equal to 33 1/3 percent of the monthly survivor's benefit payable to an eligible surviving spouse of such deceased participant as provided by the first paragraph of section 21-149, (without the actuarial reduction if such spouse is more than three years younger than the participant and irrespective of whether or not there is a surviving spouse); provided that such surviving child's benefits shall not be paid in any month on behalf of more than three such eligible children. 
(d)  Upon the death of a participant who dies before attainment of his normal retirement date, and whose death occurs either as the result of injuries sustained in the performance of his duties for the police department, or after he has completed five years of service with the police department, there shall be paid on behalf of each eligible surviving child of such participant as a surviving child's benefit, subject to the limitations hereafter set forth, a monthly benefit equal to 33 1/3 percent of the monthly survivor's benefit payable to an eligible surviving spouse of such deceased participant as provided by the second paragraph of section 21-149, (without the actuarial reduction if such spouse is more than three years younger than the participant and irrespective of whether or not there is a surviving spouse); provided that such surviving child's benefits shall not be paid in any month on behalf of more than three such eligible children.

Sec. 21-151. - Death benefits. 
(a)  Upon the death of a participant who dies prior to the earlier of his normal retirement date, or the date of his voluntary termination (except when termination prior to normal retirement date is by reason of disability), and provided a survivor's benefit is not payable to a spouse of such participant under section 21-149, above, or to surviving children under section 21-150, above, there shall be paid to the participant's beneficiary as a death benefit, the amount paid from his salary into the retirement plan fund with interest thereon compounded at three and one-half percent from the April 1 next following the date on which each such amount is paid from his salary to the first of the month in which his death occurs.

DIVISION 2. - ONSITE WASTEWATER MANAGEMENT 

Sec. 22-130. - Authority. 
    This division has been drafted in accordance with and under the authority of the G.L. Tit. 45, Ch. 24.5 entitled "Towns and Cities; Wastewater Management Districts". The authorizing state chapter shall be known and cited as the "Rhode Island OWTS Maintenance Act of 1987". 
(Ord. No. 2009-05, 6-3-09) 
Sec. 22-131. - Findings. 
    The Bristol Town Council hereby finds the following evidence in support of the establishment of an onsite wastewater management program and ordinance. 
(1)  The town council finds that without proper operation and maintenance, individual sewage disposal systems or septic systems are prone to failure. Failure poses a risk to public health and a potential source of contamination to town surface waters and groundwaters. 
(2)  RIDEM's Rules and Regulations Establishing Minimum Standards Relating to Location, Design, Construction and Maintenance of Onsite Wastewater Treatment Systems (OWTS) provide minimum standards for the location, design, construction and maintenance of individual sewage disposal systems. Undersized, grandfathered, nonconforming lots present a problem in terms of increased nutrient and pathogen levels associated with high-density residential development. 
(3)  Septic systems located in sandy soils with fast percolation rates, particularly in areas of high water tables pose a significant threat to groundwater and receiving surface water. 
(4)  Cesspools, according to RIDEM Regulations, are not an approved method of wastewater disposal and are considered substandard. 
(5)  When properly designed, installed, used and maintained, septic systems provide a viable and cost-effective alternative to municipal sewers. Furthermore, within groundwater recharge areas, septic systems help maintain the hydrological balance by reducing the transport of water out of recharge areas. 
(Ord. No. 2009-05, 6-3-09) 
Sec. 22-132. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this division is to establish the Bristol On-Site Wastewater Management Program (BOWMP). This program will ensure that all OWTS in Bristol are properly operated, regularly inspected, and routinely maintained to prevent system malfunction and insure maximum system longevity. It establishes a framework for the efficient inspection, repair and maintenance of septic systems in Bristol and recognizes the homeowner's responsibility to ensure that their system is well maintained and properly functioning. 
(Ord. No. 2009-05, 6-3-09) 
Sec. 22-133. - Definitions. 
    Any term not defined herein, and pertaining to septic systems shall be governed by the definition as it appears in the current Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management Rules and Regulations Establishing Minimum Standards Relating to Location, Design, Construction and Maintenance of Individual Sewage Disposal Systems.

(Ord. No. 2009-05, 6-3-09) 
Sec. 22-135. - OWTS inspection and maintenance. 
(a)  Purpose of OWTS inspections. The purpose of septic system inspections is to assess its current condition to determine: 
(1)  Maintenance that is required; 
(2)  When the maintenance should be undertaken; 
(3)  The date of the next inspection; and 
(4)  The need for system repair or replacement. 
    Maintenance requirements shall be based upon inspection results. Information from the inspections will also be used to complete a town-wide septic inventory and to track system inspections, maintenance and upgrades. 
(b)  Who may inspect. All septic systems shall be subject to first maintenance (baseline) inspections by a qualified, town-approved inspector. When appropriate, an inspector may also be a designee of the WPCD. Town-approved inspector(s) shall determine the maintenance and pumping requirements for each septic system based upon criteria outlined in The Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management's Septic System Check-Up: The Rhode Island Handbook for Inspection (hereinafter referred to as the handbook). 
(1)  To be approved by the town to inspect conventional systems, an inspector must satisfactorily complete the training course in the complete use of the handbook and conventional septic system inspection offered through the University of Rhode Island's Onsite Wastewater Training (OWT) Center or similar program approved by the town. A property owner who completes the homeowner maintenance workshop offered through the University of Rhode Island's Onsite Wastewater Training Center or other program approved by the town may conduct routine maintenance inspections on their own conventional OWTS. 
(2)  To inspect alternative and innovative systems an inspector, in addition to the above, must also have demonstrated knowledge in alternative and innovative technology and must satisfactorily complete the course in alternative and innovative system operation and maintenance offered through the University of Rhode Island's Onsite Wastewater Training (OWT) Center or similar program approved by the town. 
(3)  The WPCD shall maintain a list of town-approved inspectors and make such list available to property owners for the purpose of arranging the inspection of their OWTS. The town reserves the right to remove an inspector from the list if the inspections and subsequent reports are not performed in accordance with the criteria outlined in the handbook and this division. 
(c)  Type of inspections. At a minimum, all inspections shall follow the criteria outlined in the handbook. This division shall require two types of OWTS inspections: a) First maintenance inspection (baseline) and, b) Routine maintenance inspection. 
(1)  A first maintenance inspection of each OWTS shall be conducted in order to obtain baseline information and to determine maintenance requirements and the condition of the system. The septic tank is usually pumped as part of this inspection to better evaluate the condition of the system. First maintenance inspections involve some data gathering and location of system components that is not usually necessary for subsequent routine inspections. 
(2)  Routine maintenance inspections are generally conducted after the first maintenance inspection and may occur between pump-outs. 
(d)  Inspection frequency and notification. In general, inspection frequency shall be based on the procedures outlined in the handbook and shall consider, but not be limited to, system age, household occupancy, tank size, sludge and scum measurements and when the system was last pumped. The WPCD or its designee, shall send written notice to septic system owners of the need to schedule an inspection of their OWTS. The first maintenance (baseline) inspection will be conducted by the WPCD, or its designated inspector. Subsequent inspections for which the property owner is responsible will generally be routine maintenance inspections unless there is a system failure. Routine maintenance inspections must be scheduled within 45 days of the date of notice. After a system has been inspected the owner will receive a report from the Inspector detailing the maintenance requirements and the timeframe for the next inspection. 
    The WPCD, or its designee, will conduct first maintenance inspections for each septic system within the wastewater management district over a seven-year period. As such, one-seventh of the total number of septic systems in town will be inspected each year for the first five years of program implementation. Owners will be responsible for fees associated with these inspections and related administrative costs, as discussed in section 22-138. 
(e)  Inspection reports. Standard inspection forms shall be those used in the handbook, which may be modified by the WPCD, as needed. The property owner shall provide the OWTS inspector with all available, pertinent information, including but not limited to, the use, age, location, maintenance history and design of the OWTS. The completed inspection report shall detail the results of the inspection, pumping or other maintenance requirements, the timeframe for the next inspection and/or upgrade requirements for the OWTS. The inspector shall provide the WPCD and the property owner with a written copy of the inspection report. The WPCD shall be responsible for maintaining inspection, maintenance and upgrade records. 
(f)  OWTS maintenance schedule and OWTS owner's responsibility. The schedule and activities for OWTS maintenance shall be described on the inspection report that inspector gives to the property owner and the town. Such maintenance requirements shall complement and may supersede any town imposed, preexisting, lot specific maintenance agreements due to such things as the granting of variances or special use permits. The OWTS owner(s) shall assume all responsibility for hiring a septage hauler or maintenance contractor to complete the maintenance and inspection requirements contained in the OWTS inspection report within the time frame required. As proof of compliance, the property owner shall submit a receipt for pumping and other system maintenance to WPCD within 45 days of the date stipulated in the OWTS inspection report. 
(g)  Change in inspection or maintenance schedule. The WPCD, upon written notification to the property owner and the appropriate OWTS inspector, shall have the power to change the inspection schedule and/or maintenance requirements of an OWTS, where such a change is deemed necessary for the proper functioning of the OWTS. This may occur due to circumstances including, but not limited to, change in household occupancy, seasonal use, rental status, water consumption, system functioning, site characteristics and proximity to a critical resource. Likewise, the property owner may petition WPCD to alter the inspection and/or maintenance schedule. The owner must demonstrate, through the use of appropriate site data and household information, that such a change in the requirements would still ensure the proper operation of the septic system and fulfill the intent of this division. 
(h)  Immediate need to pump. If an inspection reveals that a septic system needs immediate pumping, the inspector shall immediately notify the property owner and the WPCD, or its designee. The WPCD will attempt to contact the owner by phone and will send the owner a written notice by certified mail informing the owner that he/she has five working days to pump the system and to present evidence of such pumping to the town. Such evidence may be in the form of a receipt from an approved septage hauler. When a system failure poses an immediate public health and/or environmental hazard, and where the WPCD has been unable to contact the owner by phone, the WPCD may arrange for the system to be pumped immediately and at the owner's expense. 
(Ord. No. 2009-05, 6-3-09) 
Sec. 22-136. - Miscellaneous regulations-OWTS operation and siting. 
(a)  Septage disposal. Septage or contents pumped from an OWTS shall be discharged at the town's water pollution control facility or other state-approved septage handling facility. 
(b)  Septic tank additives and improper discharges to OWTS. The use of septic tank additives shall follow RIDEM's policy, which prohibits the use of chemical additives. The use of biological additives does not alleviate the owner from the obligations of this division. The disposal of hazardous wastes, to an OWTS is prohibited. Backwash from a water filtration system into a septic tank is harmful to the operation of the OWTS and is best discharged to a separate infiltration line. There shall be no discharge to an OWTS from rainspouts, basement sumps, floor drains, or any other drains, other than those carrying household wastewater. 
(c)  Garbage disposal. Garbage disposal discharges to a new OWTS shall be permitted only on systems that are equipped with an oversized tank, capable of handling the excess solids, and with an effluent filter located on the tank's outlet. Existing septic systems that are linked to garbage disposals may require more frequent maintenance. 
(d)  Location, setbacks and use of innovative and alternative systems. Location of OWTS, setbacks from critical resource areas, treatment goals and standards for various resource areas and requirements for enhanced onsite wastewater treatment are governed by the RIDEM Rules and Regulations Establishing Minimum Standards Relating to Location, Design, Construction and Maintenance of Individual Sewage Disposal Systems. 
(e)  Accessibility, effluent filters, inspection ports and tipping d-box. To help facilitate the inspection and pumping of a septic tank and ultimately the longevity of the system, OWTS and septic tanks installed after the effective date of this division, shall be equipped with effluent filters and access risers to grade. Access risers shall be watertight and a minimum of 22 inches in diameter. They shall be located at the inlet and outlet ends of the septic tank. The effluent filter shall be located at the outlet end of the tank. Center access tanks shall not be used for new OWTS or for systems where the septic tank is being replaced. New OWTS installations must also include a tipping d-box or similar device approved by RIDEM for the purpose of equalizing flow distribution to all lines of the leachfield. Where technically feasible, all OWTS constructed prior to the effective date of this division should also be retrofitted with these devices. 
(f)  Watertight septic tanks. Any existing tank that leaks may be declared a failed system. All septic tanks installed after the effective date of this division shall be certified watertight in accordance with RIDEM minimum standards or those developed by the WPCD with approval by the town council. Tank installation must be done in accordance with manufacturer's requirements. In addition, tanks must be site tested or vacuum tested to ensure that they are watertight. 
(Ord. No. 2009-05, 6-3-09) 
Sec. 22-137. - Enforcement. 
(a)  Failure to pump, maintain or inspect. If proof of system pumping, maintenance or inspection is not received by the WPCD, or its designee, within 30 days of the time frame within which the required activity was to occur, the WPCD may, after written notice to the owner and after no response or appeal within two weeks on the part of the property owner, hire a private septic system maintenance contractor or inspector to complete the required activity and the owner will be billed by the town. The owner will be notified by certified mail, return receipt requested, of the intended date and time of such actions. The bill will include the actual cost of pumping, maintenance or inspection as well as associated administrative costs. 
(b)  Failure to pay bill. Failure to pay a bill incurred by the WPCD for the pumping, inspection, or maintenance of the septic system or any annual fee for program administration assessed by the town, shall constitute a lien on the owner's property. The owner shall be responsible for any associated interest, administrative and court costs. 
(c)  Notice of violation. If upon inspection, any owner of a septic system is determined to be in violation of these regulations, a written notice shall be issued by the WPCD explaining the nature of the violation, required actions, any assistance that is available from the town, a reasonable time frame for compliance, and the possible consequences for noncompliance. If an inspection reveals a malfunctioning or failed septic system, the town-approved inspector shall immediately notify the owner and the WPCD and send a copy of the inspection report to both parties. In the event that pumping records might indicate a failed system, the WPCD shall notify the owner in writing. A copy of said notice shall also be sent to RIDEM. The owner shall be given 30 days to apply to RIDEM for a permit to repair or replace the system as necessary. A copy of the application to RIDEM shall be provided to the WPCD. The homeowner shall notify the town as to the expected timetable for repairs to be completed. 
(d)  Failure to repair. If the owner of a failed OWTS does not accomplish the repairs within the time schedule established, the WPCD superintendent will take the enforcement action provided for in this division and/or the building official will take the enforcement action provided for in the RI State Building Code. 
(e)  Administrative conference. A person is encouraged to resolve issues at an informal administrative level before appealing a decision of the WPCD.

d.  Information showing the measured average daily and maximum daily flows, in gallons, per day to the POTW from regulated process streams and other streams as necessary to allow use of combined waste stream formulas set out in 40 CFR 403.6(e). 
e.  The measurement of pollutants including: 
1.  The categorical pretreatment standards applicable to each regulated process; and 
2.  The results of sampling and analysis identifying the nature and concentration and/or a mass where required by the standard or by the pretreatment coordinator, of regulated pollutants in the discharge from each regulated process. 
Instantaneous, daily maximum and longterm average concentrations or mass, where required, shall be reported. The sample shall be representative of the daily operations and shall be analyzed in accordance with the procedures set out in section 22-243(b); sampling must be performed in accordance with the procedures set out in section 22-243(c). 
f.  A statement reviewed by the industrial user's authorized representative and certified by a qualified profes sional, indicating whether pre treatment standards are being met on a consistent basis, and if not, what additional operation and maintenance (O&M) or additional pretreatment is required to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements. If additional pretreatment and/or O&M will be required to meet the pretreatment standards, the shortest schedule by which the user will provide such additional pretreatment and/or O&M must be met. The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established for applicable pretreatment standards. A compliance schedule pursuant to this section must meet the requirements set out in subsection (b) of this section. All baseline monitoring reports must be signed and certified in accordance with section 22-277. 
(b)  Compliance schedule progress reports. The following conditions shall apply to the compliance schedule required by subsection (a) of this section: The schedule shall contain process increments in the form of dates for commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the industrial user to meet the applicable pretreatment standards. Such events include, but are not limited to, hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts for major components, commencing and completing construction, beginning and conducting routine operations. No increment referred to in this subsection shall exceed nine months. The industrial user shall submit a progress report to the pretreatment coordinator no later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the final date of compliance including, at a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if appropriate, the steps being taken by the industrial user to return to the established schedule; and in no event shall more than nine months elapse between each such progress report to the pretreatment coordinator. 
(c)  Report on compliance with categorical pretreatment standards deadline. Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any industrial user, subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements, shall submit to the pretreatment coordinator a report containing the information described in subsections (a)(1)d-(a)(1)f of this section. For industrial users, subject to equivalent mass concentration limits established in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR 403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the industrial user's longterm production rate. For all other users subject to categorical pretreatment standards, expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production or other measure of operation, this report shall include the industrial user's actual production during the appropriate sampling. All compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with section 22-277. 
(d)  Periodic compliance reports. Periodic compliance reports shall be submitted by industrial users as follows: 
(1)  All SIUs shall submit to the pretreatment coordinator during the month of June and December, unless required more frequently in the pretreatment standard or by the pretreatment coordinator, a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the effluent which are limited by such pretreatment standards. In addition, this report shall include a record of the measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with section 22-277. 
(2)  All wastewater samples must be representative of the industrial user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean and maintained in good working order at all times. Failure of an industrial user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the industrial user to claim that sample is unrepresentative of its discharge. 
(3)  The pretreatment coordinator may impose mass limitations on industrial users which are using dilution to meet the applicable pretreatment standards or requirements or on other cases where the imposition of mass limitations are appropriate. In such cases the report required by subsection (d)(1) of this section should indicate the mass of pollutants regulated by pretreatment standards in the effluent of the industrial user. These reports shall contain the results of sampling and analysis of the discharge, including the flow and nature, and concentration or production and mass where requested by the pretreatment coordinator, of pollutants contained therein which are limited by the applicable pretreatment standards. The frequency of monitoring shall be prescribed in the applicable pretreatment standard. All analysis shall be performed in accordance with the procedures established by the director pursuant to section 304(G) of the act and contained in 40 CFR 136 and amendments thereto, or with any other tests or procedures approved by the administrator. Sampling shall be performed in accordance with the techniques in accordance with section 22-243(c). 
(e)  Report of changed conditions. Each industrial user must notify the pretreatment coordinator of any planned significant changes to user's operations or system which might alter the nature, quality or volume of its wastewater at least 90 days before the change. The pretreatment coordinator may require the user to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including a submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under section 22-277. The pretreatment coordinator may issue a wastewater discharge permit under section 22-278 or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit under section 22-277 in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions. For purposes of this requirement, significant changes include, but are not limited to, flow increases of 20 percent or greater, and a discharge of any previously unreported pollutants. 
(f)  Reports of potential problems. In the case of any discharge including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine and episodic nature, noncustomary batch discharges, or slug loads that may cause potential problems for the POTW, the industrial user shall immediately telephone and notify the pretreatment coordinator of the incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume (if known) and corrective actions taken by the industrial user. Within five days following such discharge, the industrial user shall, unless waived by the pretreatment coordinator, submit a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the industrial user to prevent such similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the industrial user of any expense, loss, damage or other liability which may be incurred as a result of the damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to personal property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties or other liabilities which may be imposed pursuant to this chapter. A notice shall be permanently posted on the industrial user's bulletin board or other permanent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a discharge described in above. Employers shall ensure that all employees who may cause such a discharge to occur are advised of the emergency notification procedure. 
(g)  Reports of unpermitted users. All users now required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the pretreatment coordinator as may be required. 
(h)  Notice of violation; repeat sampling and analysis report. If sampling performed by an industrial user indicates a violation, the industrial user must notify the pretreatment coordinator within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The industrial user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the pretreatment coordinator within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation. The industrial user is not required to resample if the pretreatment coordinator monitors at user's facility at least once a month. 
(i)  Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste. Any industrial user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify in writing the POTW, the EPA regional waste management division director and any state hazardous waste authorities of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be hazardous waste under 40 CFR 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth at 40 CFR 261, EPA hazardous waste number and the type of discharge (continuous batch or other). If the user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall include the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available: Identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the waste; an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the waste stream discharged during the calendar month; and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the waste stream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months, to the extent this information is known and readily available. All notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this subsection need to be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under subsection (e) of this section. In the case of any notification made under this section the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous waste generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practicable. This subsection does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this chapter or permit issued under this chapter, or any applicable federal or state law.

(6)  Petroleum oil, nonbiodegradable cutting oil, or products of mineral oil origin, in amounts that will cause interference or pass through; 
(7)  Pollutants which result in the presence of toxic gases, vapors or fumes within the POTW in a quantity that may cause acute worker health and safety problems; 
(8)  Trucked or hauled pollutants except at discharge points designated by the pretreatment coordinator in accordance with section 22-242; and 
(9)  Noxious or malodorous liquids, gases, solids or other wastewater which, either singularly or by interaction with other wastes, are sufficient to create a public nuisance or hazard to life, or to prevent entry into the sewers for maintenance or repairs. 
Sec. 22-235. - National categorical pretreatment standards. 
(a)  Upon promulgation the national categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 CFR chapter I, subchapter N, parts 405-471 are hereby incorporated, if subject to the following: 
(1)  When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the director shall impose an alternative limit using the combined wastestream formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e). 
(2)  An industrial user may obtain a variance from the categorical pretreatment standard if the user can prove as required in 40 CFR 401.13 that factors relating to the discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by EPA when developing the categorical pretreatment standard. 
(b)  National categorical pretreatment standard for a particular industrial subcategory shall immediately supercede the applicable limitation imposed under sections 22-236 and 22-237 if more stringent than the limitation imposed under these sections. 
Sec. 22-236. - Local limits. 
(a)  No user shall discharge or cause or allow to be discharged, either directly or indirectly POTW any substance, water or wastewater in excess of the following daily maximum limit: 
Constituent Milligrams 
per liter Biological oxygen demands 4,000 Total suspended solids 4,000 Chromium (total) 2.77 Copper (total) 3.38 Cyanide (total) 1.20 Lead (total) 0.69 Nickel (total) 3.98 Silver (total) 0.43 Zinc (total) 1.05 Total toxic organics (TTO) summation of all quantifiable values greater than 1.00 milligram per liter for any single toxic organic listed in EPA methods 608, 624 and 625. 2.13 Total toxic organics (TTO) any single parameter 1.00  
(b)  Persons subject to state or federal categorical pretreatment standards may, as a condition of their wastewater discharge permit, be required to meet more stringent standards than those listed in subsection (a) of this section. 
(c)  When the pretreatment coordinator finds that a user has exceeded a daily maximum limit of 1,250 milligrams per liter of either biological oxygen demand (BOD) or total suspended solids (TSS) the pretreatment coordinator shall fine such user a surcharge of $1.35 per pound of BOD or TSS, up to the total daily maximum limit as specified in subsection (a) above. Such fines shall be assessed on a per violation, per day basis. In the case of monthly or other long term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation. 
(Ord. No. 1999-12, 6-23-99; Ord. No. 2016-12, 8-24-16) 
Sec. 22-237. - State requirements and best management practices. 
(a)  State requirements and limitations on discharges shall apply in any case where they are more stringent than the federal requirements and local limitations. 
(b)  Best management practices required by any pretreatment standard, any local limit, or state or local law shall apply where appropriate. 
(Ord. No. 2008-11, 7-9-08) 
Sec. 22-238. - Right of revision. 
    The town reserves the right to establish further rules and regulations and more stringent limitations or requirements on discharges to the POTW if deemed necessary to comply with the objectives presented in this chapter. 
Sec. 22-239. - Pretreatment of wastewater. 
    Industrial users shall provide wastewater treatment as is necessary to comply with this chapter and shall achieve compliance with all national categorical pretreatment standards, local limits and the prohibition set out in sections 22-234-22-236 within the time limit specified by EPA, the state or the pretreatment coordinator, whichever is more stringent. Any facilities necessary for compliance shall be provided, operated and maintained at the industrial user's expense. Detailed plans describing such facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the pretreatment coordinator for review and shall be acceptable to the pretreatment coordinator before such facilities are constructed. Review of such plans and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the industrial user from the responsibility of modifying such facilities as necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to the town under the provisions of this chapter. 
Sec. 22-240. - Dilution. 
    No industrial user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any other way attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a national pretreatment standard or requirement. The pretreatment coordinator may impose mass limitations on users for using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standard or requirements or in other cases where the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate. 
Sec. 22-241. - Accidental discharge. 
(a)  Each user shall provide protection from accidental discharges of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this chapter. Equipment to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the industrial user's own cost and expense. Detailed plans showing equipment and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the town for review and shall be approved by the town before construction. All existing industrial users shall complete such a plan within 90 days of the effective date of the ordinance from which this program derives. No industrial user who commences contribution into the POTW after the effective date of the ordinance from which this program derives shall be permitted to introduce pollutants into the POTW until accidental discharge procedures have been approved by the town. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the industrial user from the responsibility to modify equipment as necessary to meet the requirements of this chapter. 
(b)  In the case of an accidental discharge it is the responsibility of the industrial user to immediately telephone and notify the town of the incident. A notification must include the following: 
(1)  Location of discharge; 
(2)  Type of waste; 
(3)  Concentration/volume; and 
(4)  Corrective action taken to remedy release. 
(c)  Within five days following an accidental discharge, the industrial user shall submit to the director a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the industrial user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this chapter. 
(d)  A notice shall be permanently posted on industrial user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a dangerous discharge. Employers shall ensure that all employees who may cause a discharge to occur are advised of the emergency notification procedures. 
Sec. 22-242. - Hauled wastewater. 
    Septic tank waste may be introduced into the POTW only at locations designated by the pretreatment coordinator and at such times as are established by the pretreatment coordinator. Such waste shall not violate sections 22-234-22-236 or any other requirement established by the town. The pretreatment coordinator may require septic tank wastehaulers to obtain wastewater discharge permits. 
(Ord. No. 1999-12, 6-23-99) 
Sec. 22-243. - Self-monitoring. 
(a)  The permit holder shall make measurements including, but not limited to, flow rates, flow volumes, BOD and suspended solids concentrations, as well as concentrations of other particular constituents of their wastewater discharges, at their own expense, as frequently as necessary to comply with the terms and conditions of each permit issued under this article. 
(b)  All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by the EPA. 
(c)  Collection of samples shall proceed as follows: 
(1)  Except as indicated in subsection (c)(2) of this section, the industrial user must collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection techniques. If flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the pretreatment coordinator may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits. 
(2)  Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulphites and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques. 
Sec. 22-244. - Compliance monitoring. 
(a)  The pretreatment coordinator shall have the right to enter the premises of any user whether the industrial user is complying with all requirements of this chapter and any wastewater discharge permit or orders issued under this chapter. Industrial users shall allow the pretreatment coordinator ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, record examination and copying, and the fulfillment of any additional duties. The user shall make any and all arrangements to permit the pretreatment coordinator or his aide ready access. 
(b)  The pretreatment coordinator shall have the right to set up on the user's property, or require installation of such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the industrial user's operations. 
(c)  The pretreatment coordinator may require the industrial user to install monitoring equipment as necessary. A facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the user at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated regularly in accordance with procedures acceptable to the town to ensure their accuracy. 
(d)  Unreasonable delays in allowing the pretreatment coordinator access to the user's premises shall be deemed a violation of the chapter. 
Sec. 22-245. - Right to inspection. 
    All industrial users subject to the reporting requirements set forth in this chapter must maintain, for a minimum of three years, any records of monitoring activities and results, and shall make such records available for inspection and copying by the pretreatment coordinator. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or the town. 
Sec. 22-246. - Confidential information. 
    Information and data on an industrial user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater discharge permit applications and monitoring programs, and from the pretreatment coordinator's inspection and sampling activities, shall be available to the public without restriction, unless the industrial user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the pretreatment coordinator, that the release of such information would divulge information, processes or methods of reduction entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable state law. Any such request must be asserted at the time of submission of the information or data. When requested and demonstrated by the industrial user furnishing a report that such information should be held confidential, portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to the RIPDES program or pretreatment program and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other effluent data as defined by 40 CFR 302 will not be recognized as confidential information and will be available to the public without restriction. 
Sec. 22-247. - Publication of users in significant noncompliance. 
    The pretreatment coordinator shall publish annually in the largest daily newspaper published in the municipality where the POTW is located, a list of the users which, during the previous 12 months, were in significant noncompliance, as defined in section 22-2, with the applicable standards and requirements. 
(Ord. No. 2008-11, 7-9-08) 
Sec. 22-248. - Notices. 
    Unless otherwise provided in this section, any notice required to be given by the town under this chapter shall be in writing and served in person or by certified mail or telegram to the last address of the discharger shown in the records of the town. 
Sec. 22-249. - Timing. 
    Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, and to mail facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern. 
Sec. 22-250. - Recordkeeping. 
    Industrial users subject to the reporting requirements of this article shall retain and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this chapter, and any and all additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements. Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the person taking the sample; the date analyses were performed; who performed the analysis; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. 
Sec. 22-251. - Administrative enforcement remedies. 
(a)  Authority. These enforcement provisions are adopted under the authority of G.L. 1956, § 45-6-2.3. 
(b)  Notification of violation. When the pretreatment coordinator finds that an industrial user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued under this article, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the pretreatment coordinator may serve upon that user a written notice of violation. Within ten days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the pretreatment coordinator. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the pretreatment coordinator to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation. 
(c)  Consent orders. The pretreatment coordinator may enter into consent orders, assurances or voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to be taken by the industrial user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. Consent orders have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to this chapter and shall be judicially enforceable. 
(d)  Compliance orders. Compliance orders may be issued under the following circumstances and manner: 
(1)  When the pretreatment coordinator finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued under this article, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, he may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. 
(2)  Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(e)  Cease and desist orders. Cease and desist orders may be issued under the following circumstances and manner: 
(1)  When the pretreatment coordinator finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued under this article, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or when the pretreatment coordinator finds that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the pretreatment coordinator may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to: 
a.  Immediately comply with all appropriate requirements; and 
b.  Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. 
(2)  Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(f)  Administrative fines. Administrative fines shall be charged as follows: 
(1)  When the pretreatment coordinator finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued under this article, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the pretreatment coordinator may fine such user in an amount not to exceed $25,000.00 per violation. Such fines shall be assessed on a per violation, per day basis. In the case of monthly or other longterm average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation. 
(2)  Unpaid charges, fines, penalties and costs shall constitute a lien against the user's property. 
(3)  Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for the pretreatment coordinator to reconsider the fine within ten days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has merit, the pretreatment coordinator may convene a show cause hearing in accordance with section 22-253 on the matter. The pretreatment coordinator may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine. 
(4)  Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(g)  Emergency suspensions. Emergency suspensions shall take place as follows: 
(1)  The pretreatment coordinator may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The pretreatment coordinator may so immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment. 
(2)  Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the pretreatment coordinator may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The pretreatment coordinator may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the pretreatment coordinator that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in subsection (h) of this section are initiated against the user. 
(3)  A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the pretreatment coordinator prior to the date of any hearing as described under subsection (g)(2) of this section. 
(4)  Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section. 
(h)  Termination of discharge. Discharge privileges shall be terminated upon the following: 
(1)  Any user who violates the following conditions is subject to discharge permit termination: 
a.  Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions; 
b.  Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge; 
c.  Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents and characteristics prior to discharge; 
d.  Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring or sampling; 
e.  Violation of the pretreatment standards in section 22-234; or 
f.  Failure to pay penalties, fees, costs and surcharges. 
(2)  Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under section 22-253 why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the pretreatment coordinator shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(Ord. No. 1999-12, 6-23-99) 
Sec. 22-252. - Costs. 
    In addition to such administrative, civil or criminal fines as may be imposed under this article, any user who violates any provision of this chapter, or any condition or limitation of a permit, or plan approval related thereto, shall be financially responsible and liable to the town in addition to normal service charges and surcharges for industrial investigation and monitoring of compliance with this chapter including, but not limited to the following: 
(1)  Costs of mileage and labor incurred in detecting and correcting the violation; 
(2)  Laboratory analysis costs associated with detecting or correcting the violation; 
(3)  Additional treatment costs caused by the violation or associated with detecting and correcting the violation; 
(4)  Costs of any additional equipment acquired or expended by the town for detecting or correcting the violation; 
(5)  Repair and/or replacement of any part of the facility damaged by the violation; 
(6)  Any liability, damage, fine, or penalty incurred by the town as a result of the violation; and 
(7)  Other costs as are associated with detecting or correcting the violation. 
Sec. 22-253. - Show cause proceedings. 
(a)  Right to request a hearing. Any compliance order or assessment of penalty shall inform the user that a written request for a hearing on the alleged violation, order and/or penalty may be filed with the pretreatment coordinator within ten days after service of the notice. The notice will be deemed properly served upon a user if a copy thereof is served personally or sent by registered or certified mail to the user's last known address, or if the user is served with a notice by any other method of service now or hereafter authorized in a civil action under the laws of the state. If no written request for a hearing is made to the pretreatment coordinator within ten days of the service of notice, the notice and its provisions and any penalties assessed will automatically take effect, and such failure to request a hearing will constitute an admission of facts alleged in such notice and a waiver of the user's right to a hearing on the factual allegations and provisions in the compliance order and assessment of penalty. 
(b)  Conduct of hearing. If a user upon whom a compliance order and/or assessment of fine has been served under the provisions of this section request a hearing before the pretreatment coordinator within ten days of the service of the compliance order and/or assessment of a fine, the pretreatment coordinator shall set a time and place for the hearing, and shall give the user requesting the hearing at least five days' written notice thereof. 
(1)  After the hearing the pretreatment coordinator may make findings of fact that shall sustain, modify, or withdraw the compliance order and/or assessment of fine. If the pretreatment coordinator sustains or modifies the compliance order or assessment, that decision shall be deemed an order and shall be served upon the person responsible in any manner provided for the service of the compliance order or assessment. The order shall state a time within which the violation shall be remedied, and the original time specified in the notice of violation shall be extended to the time set in the order. 
(2)  Whenever an order has become effective, whether automatically where no hearing has been requested or upon a decision following the hearing, the director or pretreatment coordinator may institute injunction proceedings in the Superior Court of Providence County for the enforcement of the order and appropriate temporary relief. The remedy provided for in this section shall be cumulative and not exclusive, and shall be in addition to remedies relating to the removal or abatement of nuisances or any other remedies provided by law. 
(3)  The pretreatment coordinator may designate an individual not involved in the investigation or preparation of the town's case to act as a hearing officer in his place. 
(4)  All hearing costs shall be paid by the user requesting the hearing. 
Sec. 22-254. - Judicial enforcement remedies. 
(a)  Injunctive relief. When the pretreatment coordinator finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued under this article, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the pretreatment coordinator may petition the Superior Court of Providence County through the town's attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order or other requirement imposed by this chapter on activities of the user. The pretreatment coordinator may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. 
(b)  Civil penalties. Civil penalties may be imposed as follows: 
(1)  A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued under this article, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to the town for a maximum civil penalty of $25,000.00 per violation, per day, plus actual damages incurred by the POTW per violation, per day, for as long as the violation continues. In the case of a monthly or other longterm average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation. 
(2)  The pretreatment coordinator may also recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the town. The pretreatment coordinator shall petition the court to impose, assess and recover such costs. 
(3)  In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take into account all relevant circumstances including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the violation, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice requires. 
(4)  Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. 
(c)  Criminal prosecution. Criminal prosecution shall be executed as follows: 
(1)  Any user who willfully or with criminal negligence violates any provision of this article or any order or permits issued under this article, shall, upon conviction, be punished by fine not to exceed $25,000.00 per day. 
(2)  Any user who knowingly makes false statements, representations or certifications in any applications, record, report, plan or other document acquired to be maintained pursuant to this article, or wastewater discharge permit, or who falsifies, tampers with or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this article shall, upon conviction, be punished by fine of not more than $25,000.00 per day, per violation. 
(Ord. No. 1999-12, 6-23-99; Ord. No. 2017-13, 10-4-17) 
Sec. 22-255. - Affirmative defenses to discharge violations. 
(a)  Upset. For the purposes of this section, the term "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance or careless or improper operation. 
(1)  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection (a)(2) of this section are met. 
(2)  A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
a.  An upset occurred and the user can identify the causes of the upset; 
b.  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and 
c.  The user has submitted the following information to the pretreatment coordinator within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset. If this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days: 
1.  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
2.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
3.  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
(3)  In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
(4)  Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
(5)  Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails. 
(b)  Bypass. For the purposes of this section, bypass shall mean the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a user's treatment facility; severe property damage shall mean substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
(1)  A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated; but only if it also is for essential maintenance to ensure efficient operation. If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the pretreatment coordinator, at least ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible. A user shall submit oral notice to the pretreatment coordinator of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The pretreatment coordinator may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours. 
(2)  Bypass is prohibited, and the pretreatment coordinator may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless the bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury or severe property damage; and there were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and the user submitted notices as required under subsection (b)(1) of this section. 
(3)  The pretreatment coordinator may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the pretreatment coordinator determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsection (b)(2) of this section. 
Secs. 22-256-22-275. - Reserved. 
DIVISION 2. - WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMIT 

Sec. 22-276. - Requirements. 
(a)  Notification of pretreatment coordinator of wastewater characteristics. All industrial users must notify the pretreatment coordinator of the nature and characteristics of their wastewater prior to commencing indirect discharge in accordance with requirements of this article. The pretreatment coordinator is authorized to prepare a form for this purpose. 
(b)  SIUs. No significant industrial user shall discharge wastewater into the POTW without first obtaining a wastewater discharge permit from the pretreatment coordinator, except that a significant industrial user that has filed a timely application pursuant to subsection (e) of this section may continue to discharge for the time period specified therein. 
(c)  Other industrial users. The pretreatment coordinator may require other industrial users to obtain wastewater discharge permits as necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter. 
(d)  Violations. Any violation of the terms and conditions of a wastewater discharge permit shall be deemed a violation of this chapter and subjects the wastewater discharge permittee to the sanctions set out in section 22-251. Obtaining a wastewater discharge permit does not relieve a permittee of his obligation to comply with all federal and state pretreatment standards or requirements or with any other requirements of federal, state and local law. 
(e)  Existing connections. Any industrial user required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit who was discharging wastewater into the POTW prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this article derives and who wishes to continue such discharges in the future, shall, within 90 days after such date, apply to the pretreatment coordinator for a wastewater discharge permit in accordance with section 22-277, and shall not cause or allow discharges to the POTW to continue after 180 days of the effective date of this ordinance from which this article is derived, except in accordance with a wastewater discharge permit issued by the pretreatment coordinator. 
(f)  New connections. Any industrial user required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit who proposes to begin or recommence discharging into the POTW must obtain such permit prior to the beginning or recommencing of such discharge.

Sec. 22-355. - Collection of assessment and lien. 
(a)  From the date of delivery to the town clerk of the sewer assessment roll, the amount of such assessment, including any interest that may accrue thereon, shall constitute a debt payable to the town by the owner of the sewer assessment structure, or homesite so assessed, and further constitutes a lien upon each sewer assessment structure or homesite so assessed, on a parity with the lien for town taxes, until paid in full. Such lien shall not be subject to termination under G.L. 1956, § 44-9-1. 
(b)  The tax collector shall have the same power to collect such assessments and interest from the owners of the estates so assessed, whether or not residents of this state, and to enforce such lien against the sewer assessment structure or homesite so assessed as he has in the case of town taxes assessed against residents of this state. 
Sec. 22-356. - Notice.

(e)  Any person aggrieved by any such assessment may, within 30 days after the mailing or publication of notice to him, file a petition for relief to the sewer assessment review board. If the board finds such assessment invalid, in whole or in part, it shall give judgment reducing the amount thereof or for a refund accordingly. The filing of such a petition shall not relieve the estate involved from the lien provided for in section 22-355 or prevent the assessment becoming due as provided in this section, but the final judgment of the board reducing such assessment, in whole or in part, shall reduce such lien and the amount due accordingly. 
Sec. 22-358. - Board of sewer assessment review-Generally. 
    There shall be a board of sewer assessment review whose members shall be the members of the board of tax assessment review appointed by the town council pursuant to section 27-41 et seq. The board of sewer assessment review shall elect one of their number as chairman and one as secretary.

(b)  Any landowner aggrieved by an adjusted assessment may, within 90 days after the mailing or publication of notice of such assessment, file a petition for relief against the town in the superior court, and such petition shall be subject to the provisions of G.L. 1956, § 44-5-29. If the court finds such assessment invalid, in whole or in part, it shall give judgment reducing the amount thereof or for a refund accordingly. The filing of such a petition shall not relieve the landowner of record from the lien against the subject property provided for in section 22-355 or prevent the assessment from becoming due as provided in this chapter, but the final judgment of the court reducing such assessment, in whole or in part, shall reduce such lien and the amount due accordingly. The remedy provided in this subsection shall be exclusive, and no action or proceeding questioning the validity of any adjusted assessment shall be begun after the expiration of the 90-day period.

(b)  Measurement of water from other sources; types of meters. Where a property uses water from a source other than a public water supply system, the property shall be assessed a sewer user fee based upon the actual quantity of wastewater discharged directly or indirectly into the town's facilities. Such quantity of wastewater may be measured by either inflow water meters or a wastewater discharge meter as determined by the director. No meter shall be installed or be used for such purpose without the approval of the director. Such meters shall be installed and maintained at the expense of the property owner and shall be read by the town. If repairs are made by the town, bills for such repairs shall be collected in the same manner, and be subject to the same penalties, as are bills for sewer user fees. 
(c)  Estimated discharge. Where a property uses water from a public water supply system or a source other than a public water supply system, but a portion or all of such water is consumed, evaporated or otherwise not discharged directly or indirectly into the town's facilities, the wastewater discharged shall either be metered at the expense of the property owner or an estimate shall be made based upon an engineering analysis approved by the director. Where a discharge has been estimated, bills will be rendered based upon the approved analyses and estimates. 
(d)  Meter failure. In case a meter fails to register or has been removed for repairs, testing or other purposes during the billing period, the bill shall be issued based on the average daily rate of water consumption or sewage discharged as shown by the meter after it has been returned to service and is in proper working order. 
(e)  Basis of bill for temporarily unmetered service. If the meter has not been returned to service, the bill shall be issued based on the average daily rate of water consumption or sewage discharged for the previous two-year period.

This zoning district is intended for commercial areas that serve town-wide and regional commercial needs for retail services, and professional office establishments. D Zone Downtown. This zoning district is intended for the preservation of downtown commercial areas. MMU Zone Metacom mixed use. This zoning district is intended for designating key areas along the Metacom Avenue (Rt. 136) corridor for focused development or redevelopment in dense mixed-use zones to help create a sense of place and order and encourage the expansion of business use areas while creating vibrant, walkable neighborhoods well served with appropriately scaled retail, services, and other commercial development.  
(3)  Industrial zoning districts. Industrial zoning districts shall be as follows: 
M Zone Manufacturing. This zone is intended for general industrial uses that accommodate a variety of manufacturing, assembly, storage of durable goods and related activities, provided that they do not pose toxic, explosive or environmental hazard in the town.

(e)  Notice of a public hearing shall be sent to the governing body of any state or municipal water department agency, special water district, or private water company that has riparian rights to a surface water resource and/or surface watershed that is used or is suitable for use, as a public water source and that is within 2,000 feet of any real property which is the subject of a proposed zoning change, provided, however, that the governing body of any state or municipal water company has filed with the director in the town a map survey, which shall be kept as a public record, showing areas of surface water resources and/or watersheds and parcels of land within 2,000 feet thereof. 
(f)  No defect in the form of any notice under this section shall render an ordinance or amendment invalid, unless such defect is found to be intentional or misleading. 
(g)  Costs of any notice required under this section shall be borne by the applicant. 
Sec. 28-53. - Conditional zoning amendments. 
(a)  In granting an amendment to this chapter, notwithstanding the provisions of RIGL § 45-23-37, the town council may limit the change to one or more of the permitted uses in the zone to which the subject land is rezoned, and impose such limitations, conditions and restrictions, including, without limitation: 
(1)  Requiring the petitioner to obtain a permit or approval from any and all federal, state or local governmental agencies or instrumentalities having jurisdiction over the land and use which are the subject of the zoning change; 
(2)  Those relating to the effectiveness or continued effectiveness of the zoning change; and/or 
(3)  Those relating to the use of the land, as it deems necessary. 
(b)  The director of community development shall cause the limitations and conditions so imposed to be clearly noted on the zoning map and recorded in the land evidence records; provided, however, in the case of a conditional zone change, the limitations, restrictions and conditions shall not be noted on the zoning map until the zone change has become effective. 
(c)  If the permitted use for which the land has been rezoned is abandoned or if the land is not used for the requested purpose for a period of two years or more after the zone change becomes effective, the town council may, after notice and a public hearing as herein before set forth, change the land back to its original zoning use before the petition was filed. 
Sec. 28-54. - Appeal of enactment of or amendment to chapter. 
    An appeal of the enactment of or an amendment to this chapter may be taken to the Superior Court for Providence and Bristol Counties by filing a complaint within 30 days after such enactment or amendment has become effective. The complaint shall set forth with specificity the area in which the enactment or amendment does not conform with the comprehensive plan and/or the manner in which it constitutes a taking of private property without just compensation. Such appeal may be taken by an aggrieved party or by any legal resident or landowner of the town, or by any association of residents or landowners of the town. This appeal shall not stay the enforcement of this chapter, as enacted or amended, but the court may, in its discretion, grant a stay on appropriate terms, which may include the filing of a bond, and make such other orders as it deems necessary for an equitable disposition of the appeal.

The planning board may allow up to a 25 percent reduction in the distance from a residential zone boundary based on the site conditions and an increase in the size of the planted buffer. For each foot reduced in the distance from the residential zone boundary, the planted buffer shall be increased by one-half foot, to compensate for the increased impact on the residential district by the manufacturing use. 
(7)  One side yard may be reduced to 20 feet, provided that the sum of both side yards is 50 feet or more. 
(8)  See plan approved with the zoning amendment dated September 20, 2001.

(j)  Special use standards for marine trade industries in W, GB and MMU zones. 
(1)  Purpose. It is the purpose of this section to promote and preserve Bristol's boat building heritage and marine trade industries, by allowing certain defined uses, "marine trade industries", in certain zones (W, GB, and MMU) outside of the traditional manufacturing (M) zone, pursuant to special use permit. Other than wooden boat building, which is a separately listed use code, actual boat building is not permitted. However, "lighter" industrial uses involving the marine trades, such as the design, fabrication, construction, maintenance, transport, and storage of other marine products, equipment, systems and parts, and the retail and wholesale sale of boats, are permitted with a special use permit. It is the further intent that marine trade industries uses in these zones shall not unreasonably interfere with existing or permitted residential uses. 
(2)  Retail sales. Retail sale only (without repair, service, storage, etc.) of marine related products and equipment is permitted as of right where other retail sales are permitted, while retail or wholesale sale of boats themselves (with or without repair, service, storage, etc.) in the W, GB and MMU zones requires a special use permit. 
(3)  Performance standards. The applicant for a special use permit shall be required to demonstrate, in advance, plans for conformance with section 28-155 (below) and the noise ordinance (chapter 10 of the Bristol Town Code), and in order to safeguard neighboring property uses, the zoning board may impose stricter standards than are set forth therein. 
(4)  Outdoor uses. The applicant shall specify on a plan the location and nature of any proposed outdoor uses, including the seasonal storage of boats and the display of boats for sale, and the zoning board may restrict such uses in area and duration, and require appropriate landscaping and buffering. 
(k)  Special use standards for compassion centers. Compassion centers by special permit use in certain zones as set forth in section 28-82, shall be subject to the requirements of subsection 28-409(c)(2), and all of the following additional requirements: 
(1)  The application for a special use permit shall provide the legal name and address of the compassion center, a copy of the articles of incorporation, and the name, address, and date of birth of each principal officer and board member of the compassion center. The application shall also include a site plan, which shall also show the distances between the proposed use and the boundary of the nearest residential zoning district and the property line of all other abutting uses as described within this section. 
(2)  The requested use at the proposed location will not adversely affect the use of any property used for a school, public or private park, playground, play field, youth center, licensed day-care center, or any other location where groups of minors regularly congregate. 
(3)  The requested use at the proposed location will be sufficiently buffered in relation to any residential area in the immediate vicinity so as not to adversely affect said area. 
(4)  The exterior appearance of the structure must be consistent with the exterior appearance of existing structures within the immediate neighborhood, so as to prevent blight or deterioration, or substantial diminishment or impairment of property values within the neighborhood. 
(5)  The compassion center must not be located within: 
a.  One thousand feet from the nearest residential zoning district; or 
b.  One thousand feet from the nearest house of worship, school, public or private park, playground, play field, youth center, licensed day-care center, or any other location where groups of minors regularly congregate; or 
c.  Two thousand feet from any other compassion center. 
(6)  The distances specified in the immediately preceding subsection (5) shall be measured by a straight line from the nearest property line of the premises on which the proposed compassion center use is to be located to the nearest boundary line of a residential district or to the nearest property line of any of the other designated uses set forth therein. 
(7)  Hours of operation for a compassion center shall be limited to 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. 
(8)  Lighting shall be required such that will illuminate the compassion center, its immediate surrounding area, any accessory uses including storage areas, the parking lot(s), its front facade, and any adjoining public sidewalk. 
(9)  The proposed compassion center shall implement the appropriate security measures to deter and prevent the unauthorized entrance into areas containing marijuana and shall ensure that each location has an operational security/alarm system. 
(10)  Development plan review shall be conducted by the planning board. 
(11)  All compassion center uses shall fully comply with all other licensing requirements of the town and the laws of the state.

(5)  Conditions. The zoning enforcement officer may apply such special conditions to the permit as may, in the opinion of the zoning enforcement officer, be required to conform to the intent and purposes of this chapter. 
(6)  Public records. The zoning enforcement officer shall keep public records of all requests for modifications, and of findings, determinations, special conditions and any objections received. 
Sec. 28-153. - Home occupations. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to: 
(1)  Protect residential areas from adverse impacts of activities associated with certain home occupations. 
(2)  Permit residents of the community a broad choice in the use of their homes as a place of livelihood and the production or supplementing of personal and family income. 
(3)  Establish criteria and development standards for home occupations conducted in dwelling units and accessory structures to residential structures. 
(b)  Definition. For the purposes of this section, "home occupation" shall include: 
(1)  An accessory use of a dwelling unit or accessory structure, involving the manufacture, provision or sale of goods and/or services, which is carried on by members of the family residing on the premises plus no more than one nonresident assistant or employee. 
(2)  Home occupations do not include occasional garage sales and yard sales nor home parties which are held for the purpose of the sale or distribution of goods or services. Provided, however, that if the collective total of all such sales and/or parties exceeds six in any calendar year such sales and/or parties shall be considered a home occupation and regulated hereby. 
(c)  Standards. All home occupations shall meet the following standards: 
(1)  Outward appearance. The exterior appearance of the residential structure shall not be changed. There shall be no outside storage or window display. Noise, dust, odors, noxious fumes, or vibrations emanating from the premises shall not exceed that which is normally produced by a single dwelling unit. Mechanical or electronic equipment which is incidental to the home occupation may be used provided it does not create visible or audible interference in radio or television receivers or cause fluctuations in line voltage off the premises. The home occupation shall not interfere with the delivery of utilities or other services to the area. 
(2)  Traffic. The home occupation should not generate significantly greater traffic volume than would normally be expected in the particular residential zone in which the home occupation is conducted. Delivery and pick-up of materials or commodities to and from the premises by a commercial vehicle should not exceed two trips per week. A commercial vehicle for the purpose of this section and chapter is any motor vehicle having a gross vehicle weight of more than 14,000 pounds. 
(3)  Parking. The parking of customers' or clients' vehicles shall not create safety hazards or congestion. At any one time only one commercial vehicle associated with the activities of the home occupation may be parked near the premises for more than four consecutive hours. One additional on-site parking space shall be required above the normal parking requirements for the residential use for any home occupation where students or clients visit the premises. One additional on-site parking space shall be required above the normal parking requirements for the residential use for any home occupation where a nonresident employee's method of transportation to and from the site of the home occupation is a motor vehicle which would normally be parked on or near the site of the new occupation. Where both subsections 28-153(c)(3) and (4) apply, there shall be two additional parking spaces required. 
(4)  Employees. The home occupation is to be conducted only by members of the family residing in the dwelling unit plus no more than one nonresidential assistant or employee. Persons engaged in building trades or similar fields, using their dwelling units or residential premises as an office for business activities conducted off the premises, may have more employees than the limitations set forth in this subsection if they are not employed on the premises. 
(5)  Signage. The intent of signage at home occupations is to identify the location of the property and not to garner or advertise additional business which would have the effect of increasing traffic in the neighborhood, therefore, only one sign, not over two square feet in area, flush-mounted to the building, shall be permitted per dwelling unit. The sign shall show only the name of the occupant and the type of occupation. The sign shall neither be internally nor externally lit. A permit for the sign is required in accordance with article X of this chapter. 
(6)  Limits on class/instruction. If the home occupation is the type in which classes are held or instruction given, there shall be no more than six students or pupils in the dwelling unit or on the premises at any one time. More than six students shall require a special use permit. These requirements limiting class size shall not be construed to prohibit occasional exceptions for events such as recitals, demonstrations, and other similar gatherings. 
(7)  Limits on clients/customers. If the home occupation is the type in which customers or clients visit the premises, there shall be no more than six clients or customers in the dwelling unit or on the premises during any period of 60 consecutive minutes. Motor vehicle traffic generated by clients or customers of a home occupation shall be prohibited from visiting the premises between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. 
(8)  Allowable number of home occupations. The total number of home occupations conducted within a dwelling unit is not limited, except that the cumulative impact of all home occupations conducted within the dwelling unit or on the premises thereof shall not be greater that the impact of one home occupation as set forth in the above subsections. 
(9)  Compliance. Home occupations shall comply with all local, state or federal requirements pertinent to the activity pursued, and the requirements of or permission granted by this chapter shall not be construed as an exemption from such regulations. 
Sec. 28-154. - Standards for bed and breakfast inns. 
    Bed and breakfast inns shall be permitted only when all of the following requirements are also met: 
(1)  The structure shall be in keeping with the surrounding neighborhood. 
(2)  The lot size shall meet the minimum lot size for the zone in which the use is located or the minimum lot size requirement per rooming unit, whichever is greater. 
(3)  Sufficient off-street parking shall be provided to meet the requirements of article VIII of this chapter. Parking shall be on the side and/or rear of the building. 
(4)  There shall be a maximum of five guest rooms. 
(5)  Where a bed and breakfast inn is located in an area that has no public sewer, the building inspector shall require approval from the state department of environmental management stating that the individual sewage disposal system is sufficient to handle the number of guestrooms. 
(6)  Where a bed and breakfast inn is located in an area that has no public water, the building inspector shall require approval from the state department of health stating that the water quality is sufficient for such use.

Sec. 28-155. - Performance standards for commercial and industrial uses in the waterfront, downtown, limited business, general business; Metacom Mixed Use; or, manufacturing zoning districts and rehab LDP overlay zone. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide performance standards in the control of commercial and industrial uses in the waterfront, downtown, limited business, general business; or, manufacturing zoning districts and rehab LDP overlay zone. These standards are designed to prevent health and safety hazards, public nuisances, and harmful effects upon the natural environment. They are also designed to permit potential industrial nuisances to be measured factually and objectively, and to ensure that all commercial and industrial uses will provide methods to protect the town from hazards which can be prevented by processes of control and elimination. 
    If any standards are established by state building or fire codes, by the State of Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management or department of health or by any federal agency, which conflict with the standards specified in this section, the more stringent or restrictive standards shall apply. 
(b)  Application of standards. The provisions of this section shall apply to any commercial or industrial use located anywhere within the waterfront (W), manufacturing (M) limited business (LB), general business (GB), Metacom Mixed Use (MMU) or downtown (D) zoning districts or rehab LDP overlay zone. If any existing use, process, building or other structure is extended, enlarged, moved, structurally altered or reconstructed, or any existing use of land is modified in any way within the W. D. LB. GB; or M zoning districts or rehab LDP overlay zone, these performance standards shall apply. Performance standards for any use or process shall be measured at the lot line; or, in a rehab LDP at a point outside the area of the building or structure, nearest the use or process being measured. 
(c)  Administration of performance standards. The administration of the performance standards herein set forth is charged to the zoning enforcement officer. Any proposed use or process, alteration or change to an existing use or process, or determination of compliance for an existing use or process, either as a permitted use or a nonconforming use, shall be reviewed by the zoning enforcement officer, who shall determine compliance or noncompliance herewith. Subsequent to a study of the use, the zoning enforcement officer may determine that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the use may violate the performance standards set herein and may initiate an investigation. See subsection 28-155(i) of this section. 
(d)  Required data. Following the initiation of an investigation, the zoning enforcement officer may require the owner or operator of any existing or proposed use to submit such data and evidence as is needed to make an objective determination. The evidence may include, but is not limited to, the following items: 
(1)  Plan of the existing or proposed construction and development. 
(2)  A description of the existing or proposed machinery, processes and products. 
(3)  Specifications for the mechanisms and techniques used or proposed to be used in restricting the possible emission of any of the items referred to in subsections 28-155(m) through (x) of this section. 
(4)  Measurements of the amount or rate of emission of the items referred to in subsections 28-155(m) through (x) of this section. 
(5)  Certification by a registered professional engineer that the proposed use or construction would comply with the requirements and standards for the regulation of commercial and industrial processes as set forth in this section. 
Failure to submit data required by the zoning enforcement officer shall constitute grounds for denying a permit for any use of land. 
(e)  Report by expert consultants. In the investigation of the compliance with the standards set forth in this section by any existing or proposed use, the zoning enforcement officer may require the owner or operator of the existing use or the applicant for the proposed use to provide a study and report by an expert consultant as to the compliance or noncompliance with such standards of the existing or proposed use, and advise as to how such existing or proposed use, if not in compliance, can be brought into compliance with such standards. 
(f)  Zoning enforcement officer's action. Within 15 days following the receipt of the required evidence, or receipt of the reports of expert consultants, the zoning enforcement officer shall make a determination as to compliance, and shall authorize the issuance of any permits which may have been withheld pending such determination. The issuance of a permit for a proposed use shall not constitute compliance with the performance standards if, after construction and operation, there is evidence of noncompliance with such standards. 
(g)  Required alterations. The zoning enforcement officer may require modifications or alterations in the existing or proposed construction or the operational procedures to ensure that compliance with the performance standards will be maintained. The operator shall be given a reasonable length of time to effect any changes prescribed by the zoning enforcement officer for the purpose of securing compliance with the performance standards. 
(h)  Zoning board to hear appeal. Any determination of the zoning enforcement officer may be appealed to the zoning board of appeals in accordance with section 28-410. 
(i)  Continued enforcement. The zoning enforcement officer shall investigate any purported violation of performance standards; and for such investigation may employ qualified experts to make technical determinations as described in this section. If it is found that a violation occurred or exists, a copy of such findings shall be forwarded to the town solicitor. The services of any qualified experts, employed by the zoning enforcement officer to advise in establishing a violation, shall be paid by the violator if such violation is established, otherwise by the town. 
(j)  Cancellation of permits. If, after the conclusion of time granted for compliance with the performance standards, the zoning enforcement officer finds the violation is still in existence, any permits previously issued shall be void, and the operator shall be required to cease operation until the violation is remedied. 
(k)  Reference works. All reference works or standards listed in this section shall be kept on file in the office of the town clerk. 
(l)  Exemptions. The following uses and activities shall be exempt from the noise and vibration level regulations of this section: 
(1)  Noises and vibrations not under the control of the property user. 
(2)  Noises and vibrations emanating from construction activities between 7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. 
(3)  The noises of safety signals, warning devices and emergency pressure relief valves. 
(4)  Transient noises and vibrations of moving sources such as automobiles, trucks, airplanes and railroads. 
(m)  Noise. The Noise Ordinance of the Town of Bristol found in Chapter 10 of the Bristol Town Code, shall apply to all uses, processes, operations and activities regulated by this section of this chapter. 
(n)  Vibration. Vibration standards shall be as follows: 
(1)  Ground transmitted vibration shall be measured with a seismograph or complement of instruments capable of recording vibration displacement and frequency, particle velocity, or acceleration simultaneously in three mutually perpendicular directions. The maximum vector resultant shall be less than the vibration displacement permitted. Particle velocity may be measured directly or computed from the formula particle velocity (inches per second) = 6.28 times displacement (inches) times frequency (Hertz). 
(2)  Vibration shall be measured at any adjacent lot line (or adjacent building or structure in a rehab land development project), and the vibration shall not exceed the limits shown at the specified points of measurement. 
(3)  The maximum permissible particle velocity of the ground vibration shall be as follows: 
Point of Measurement Particle Velocity Steady-State 
Inches/Second Impact 
Inches/Second Lot line/building boundary 0.02 0.04  
(4)  For purposes of this section, steady-state vibrations are vibrations which are continuous, or vibrations in discrete impulses more frequent than 60 per minute. Discrete impulses which do not exceed 60 per minute, shall be considered impact vibrations. 
(5)  No vibration is permitted which is discernible to the human sense of feeling for three minutes or more duration in any one hour of the day between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m., or of 30 seconds or more duration in any one hour between the hours of 7:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. 
(o)  Smoke. No emission at any point, from any chimney or otherwise, of visible gray smoke of a shade darker than No. 1 on the Ringelmann Smoke Chart, as published by the U.S. Bureau of Mines in August, 1955, as Information Circular 7718 (Revision of i.c. 6888), except that visible gray smoke of a shade not darker than No. 2 on such chart, may be emitted for not more than four minutes in any 30 minutes. These provisions applicable to visible gray smoke, shall also apply to visible smoke of a different color, but with an equivalent apparent opacity. In no case shall visible smoke emissions exceed the standards of the division of air pollution control of the state department of health. 
(p)  Particulate matter. Emissions of particulate matter shall meet the minimum standards of the division of air pollution control state department of health and the state department of environmental management. No emission shall be permitted which can cause any damage to health, to animals or vegetation, to property, or which can cause excessive soiling at any point. 
(q)  Gas. No uses shall emit noxious, toxic or corrosive fumes or gases in concentrations or amounts causing discomfort or injury to humans or harmful to vegetation or in no case, in excess of the maximum allowable concentrations permitted of those toxic materials currently listed in threshold limited values adopted by the American Conference of Governmental Hygienists. If a toxic substance is not contained in this listing, the applicant shall satisfy the department of health of the state, that the proposed levels will be safe to the general population. The release of airborne toxic matter shall not exceed 1/30 of the threshold limit value across lot lines. 
(r)  Sewage and waste. Sewage and waste shall be deposited into the public sewage system, when available, in conformance with the provisions of chapter 22 of this Code, "Sewers and Sewage Disposal." No sewage waste shall be discharged into the public sewage system which adversely affects the efficient operation of the sewage treatment plant, or any part of the system which is dangerous to the public health and safety. Liquid effluent from any use which is discharged into the ground shall at all times comply with the standards of the state department of environmental management relating to the disposal of sanitary sewage in unsewered areas. No discharge shall raise the temperature of a receiving water body above temperatures which can support normal aquatic life in such water body. 
(s)  Odors. Emission of odorous gases or other odorous matter released from any operation or activity shall not exceed the odor threshold concentration beyond lot lines (or area of the building in a Rehab LDP) either at ground level or habitable elevation as determined by either the RIDEM or the zoning enforcement officer. 
(t)  Toxic matter. The measurement of toxic matter shall be at ground level or habitable elevation, and shall be the average of any 24-hour sampling period. The release of airborne toxic matter across lot lines (or area of the building in a rehab land development project) shall not exceed 1/30 of the threshold limit values as currently established by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists. 
(u)  Heat and glare. No use shall carry on any operation that would produce unreasonable heat beyond the property line (or area of the building in a rehab land development project). Any manufacturing operation or activity producing glare, shall be conducted so that direct or indirect light from the source shall not cause illumination in excess of 0.5 footcandles when measured on a neighboring property or public highway. 
(v)  Fire and explosive hazards. All industrial uses and storage facilities shall be approved by the town fire chief with regard to fire and explosive hazards. 
(w)  Radiation. Manufacturing operations shall cause no dangerous radiation at the property line (or area of the building in a rehab land development project), as specified by the regulations of the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 
(x)  Electromagnetic interference. No use, activity, or process shall be conducted which produces electromagnetic interference with normal radio, telephone or television reception from off the premises from where the activity is conducted.

ARTICLE VI. - DEVELOPMENT PLAN REVIEW 

Sec. 28-181. - General requirements. 
    Development plan review (DPR) shall be required for certain uses identified in this article, prior to development or expansion of such uses. Development plan review shall be required both for such uses that are permitted as of right (i.e. shown with a "Y" in Table A-Permitted Use Table) in the zone in which they are located, and for such uses that require a variance or a special use permit. 
(1)  Jurisdiction and purpose. Development plan review shall be conducted pursuant to RIGL §§ 45-23-50 and 45-24-49, as amended. The purpose of such review shall be the reasonable application of the police power of the town to protect the public from possible detrimental impacts of certain types of development and certain large scale development and maintain consistency with the Comprehensive Plan, while at the same time reasonably accommodating the goal of economic development within the town. 
(2)  Subdivision and land development projects; combined review. The review shall be conducted by either the Bristol Planning Board or the technical review committee of the planning board, as set forth in these regulations, as part of the overall approval process. There are two different development plan review processes, one for those uses that are permitted as of right (see section 28-183) and one for those uses that require a variance or special use permit (see section 28-184). The planning board or the technical review committee, as the case may be, shall have the administrative power and duty, in accordance with the requirements of this chapter and the regulations, to review all plans for the proposed development. 
Sec. 28-182. - Uses subject to development plan review. 
    The following uses shall be subject to development plan review when any action is taken that requires the issuance of a building permit or certificate of occupancy other than as excepted in section 28-185, or when requiring a variance or special use permit: 
(1)  Nonresidential uses. All nonresidential development, including, but not limited to, commercial, retail, industrial or institutional, calculated as to the entire development both existing and proposed, where any of the following apply:

(3)  DPR required in certain zones. Any use that is located in the Metacom Avenue overlay zone or Metacom Mixed Use zone. 
(4)  Referral by town officials. Any other permitted use that is specifically referred in writing to the technical review committee for development plan review by either the building inspector or, notwithstanding the determination of the building inspector, the administrative officer (pursuant to these regulations) or the zoning enforcement officer. 
(5)  Referral by the zoning board. Any other use, for which the application for a variance or special use permit is specifically referred in writing to the planning board by the zoning board. 
Sec. 28-183. - Uses permitted by right. 
    A use set forth in section 28-182, when permitted by right (as indicated by a "Y" in Table A-Permitted Use Table in section 28-82, or when permitted by right as a change to a legal nonconforming use as defined and controlled by article VII of this chapter), and meeting all of the requirements for the district in which it is located, shall be subject to development plan review when any action is taken that requires the issuance of a building permit or certificate of occupancy, other than as excepted in section 28-185. 
(1)  Review procedure. The review shall be conducted by the technical review committee, pursuant to the procedures and time periods set forth in article 3 of the regulations. 
(2)  Scope of review. The decision by the technical review committee shall be binding upon the permitting authority, being that officer responsible to issue the building permit or certificate of occupancy. Such decision shall be in writing and shall comply with all requirements of the regulations, including those for filing of records and decisions. The permitting authority may not issue a permit contrary to the decision of the technical review committee, but such decision may be considered an appealable decision, appealable to the zoning board of review, pursuant to the procedures set forth for the review of a decision of the planning board, as set forth in article XI of this chapter. 
Sec. 28-184. - Uses requiring a variance or special use permit. 
    A use set forth in section 28-182, when requiring a variance or special use permit, shall be subject to development plan review prior to and following the hearing by the zoning board (pursuant to RIGL § 45-23-61A), other than as excepted in section 28-185. 
(1)  Review procedure. The review shall be conducted by the planning board, pursuant to the procedures and time periods set forth in article 4 of the regulations. 
(2)  Scope of review. The review by the planning board shall be advisory only to the permitting authority, being the zoning board. Such advisory opinion shall be in writing and shall comply with all requirements of the regulations, including those for filing of records and decisions. The permitting authority may reject the advisory opinion of the planning board, but only by written findings and decision, specifically setting forth the reasons for rejection. 
Sec. 28-185. - Exceptions to development plan review. 
    The following actions shall be excepted from development plan review, but only upon application to and written decision by the administrative officer: 
(1)  Change of use. A use otherwise subject to development plan review is changed to another use that is permitted on the same legal basis as the prior use, and the new use is listed in the same category in Table A-Permitted Use Table (section 28-82). 
(2)  Minor changes. A use otherwise subject to development plan review is the subject of a minor change, as defined in section 8.9 of the regulations. 
Sec. 28-186. - Required guidelines, findings and improvements. 
(a)  Specific and objective guidelines. The review by the planning board shall be based upon the specific requirements set forth in Appendices E and F of the regulations. 
(b)  General findings. Prior to granting any development plan review approval, the technical review committee or the planning board, as the case may be, shall find that: 
(1)  The granting of approval will not result in conditions inimical to the public health, safety and welfare; 
(2)  The granting of such approval will not substantially or permanently injure the appropriate use of the property in the surrounding area or zoning district; 
(3)  The plans for such project comply with all the requirements of this chapter and the regulations; 
(4)  The plans for such project are consistent with the comprehensive plan; and 
(5)  Any conditions or restrictions that are necessary to ensure that these guidelines have been met have been incorporated into the written approval. 
(c)  Required improvements. As a part of the development plan review, the following improvements, among others as specified in this chapter and the regulations, may be required: 
(1)  Sidewalks or easements for future sidewalks to connect stores and buildings within the site and to adjacent sites. Where the development is in proximity to a bicycle path, adequate bicycle pathway connections and bicycle racks. 
(2)  Where the development is located along the shoreline of Bristol Harbor, a public access boardwalk along the shore to connect to adjacent properties. 
(3)  Construction of travel lanes to permit travel on the site and to and from adjacent parking areas and adjacent property or, where deemed necessary, a separation between parking areas. 
(4)  The total number of off street parking spaces requirements for industrial/manufacturing uses need not be paved (or delineated if a pervious surface is used) and marked if an applicant demonstrates that demand for a proposed use would be less than required by this chapter; providing that the applicant also demonstrates that space is available on the site should future demand or change in use necessitate additional parking. In such an event, the zoning enforcement officer shall have the authority to require the remaining parking be made available. 
(5)  Connection wherever possible of all walkways, harbor side boardwalks, travel lanes and driveways with similar facilities in adjacent developments. 
(6)  Adequate drainage system for the disposition of stormwaters and natural waters. 
(7)  Temporary and permanent erosion and sedimentation control measures. 
(8)  Screening, fences, walls, landscaped areas, planting strips and other landscaping treatment that will enhance and buffer the premises and ensure compatibility with surrounding uses. The types and methods of planting may be specified. 
(9)  The location of signs in relationship to overall plan. 
(10)  Mitigation of negative impacts and performance or maintenance guarantees as deemed necessary and appropriate in accordance with article 6 of the regulations. 
Secs. 28-187-28-210. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE VII. - NONCONFORMANCE 

Sec. 28-211. - Nonconformance generally. 
    A nonconformance is a building, structure, sign or parcel of land, or use thereof, which was lawfully existing at the time of the adoption or amendment of this chapter, and not in conformity with the provisions of this chapter or amendment. 
Sec. 28-212. - Lawfully existing or established. 
    A building, structure, sign or parcel of land, or use thereof, was lawfully existing or lawfully established if it was in existence prior to June 28, 1961, or was established in conformance with the zoning regulations in effect at the time the use was first established. For the purposes of this chapter, the placement or use of a sign, with or without any other structure or use, is considered a use of land. A lot was lawfully existing or lawfully established if it was of record or shown on a recorded plat prior to June 28, 1961 and was separately owned. Any building, structure, sign or parcel of land, or use thereof, that was not lawfully existing or established at the time of the adoption or amendment of this chapter, is not protected by this article. 
Sec. 28-213. - Nonconforming by use. 
    A lawfully established use of land, building or structure which is not a permitted use in the zoning district in which it is located, as set forth in section 28-82, is nonconforming by use. 
Sec. 28-214. - Nonconforming by dimension. 
    A lawfully established building, structure or parcel of land not in compliance with the dimensional regulations of this chapter is nonconforming by dimension. Dimensional regulations include all regulations of this chapter, other than those pertaining to the permitted uses. A lawfully established building, structure, parcel of land or use thereof, not in compliance with the parking regulations of this chapter, as set forth in article VIII of this chapter, is also nonconforming by dimension. A lawfully existing or lawfully established lot that is not in compliance with the dimensional regulations of this chapter, including, but not limited to those regulations for minimum lot size, lot width and lot frontage, (also known as a substandard lot of record) is also nonconforming by dimension. 
Sec. 28-215. - Nonconforming by dwelling units. 
    A building or structure containing more dwelling units than are permitted by the use regulations of this chapter shall be nonconforming by use. A building or structure containing a permitted number of dwelling units by the use regulations of this chapter, but not meeting the lot area per dwelling unit regulations, shall be nonconforming by dimension. 
Sec. 28-216. - Most restrictive regulations to apply. 
    A building, structure or parcel of land nonconforming by more than one factor, such as by use, dimension, area or parking, shall comply with all regulations of this article. Where the regulations conflict, the most restrictive regulations shall apply. 
Sec. 28-217. - Existence by variance or special use permit. 
    A nonconforming building, structure, sign or parcel of land or the use thereof, which exists by virtue of a variance or a special use permit (or a special use) granted by the board, shall not be considered a nonconformance for the purposes of this article, and shall not acquire the rights of this article. Rather, such building, structure, sign, parcel of land or use thereof, shall be considered a use by variance or a use by special use permit and any moving, addition, enlargement, expansion, intensification or change of such building, structure, sign, parcel of land or use thereof, to any use other than a permitted use or other than in complete conformance with this chapter, shall require a further variance or special use permit from the board. 
Sec. 28-218. - Building or structure nonconforming by use. 
    Nonconforming uses are incompatible with and detrimental to permitted uses in the zoning districts in which they are located. Nonconforming uses cause disruption of the comprehensive land use pattern of the town, inhibit present and future development of nearby properties and confer upon their owners a position of unfair advantage. It is intended that existing nonconforming uses shall not justify further departures from this chapter for themselves or for any other properties. 
(1)  Treatment in residential zones. Nonconforming uses in residential zones are to be treated in a stricter fashion than nonconforming uses located in nonresidential zones. Due to the disruption which nonconforming uses cause to the peace and tranquility of a residential zone, nonconforming uses therein should be eventually abolished or reduced to total conformity over time. 
(2)  Continuance of use. Nothing in this chapter shall prevent or be construed to prevent the continuance of a nonconforming use of any building or structure for any purpose to which such building or structure was lawfully established. 
(3)  Maintenance and repair. A building or structure containing a nonconforming use may be maintained and repaired except as otherwise provided in this article. 
(4)  Moving. A building or structure containing a nonconforming use shall not be moved in whole or in part either on or off the lot on which it is located unless the use contained within such building or structure is made to conform to the use regulations of the zone in which it is relocated. 
(5)  Addition and enlargement. A building or structure containing a nonconforming use shall not be added to or enlarged in any manner, including any addition or enlargement of floor area or volume, unless the use contained within such building or structure, including such addition and enlargement, is made to conform to the use regulations of the zone in which it is located. 
(6)  Expansion. A nonconforming use of a building or structure shall not be expanded into any other portion of the building or structure which contains a conforming use or which is unoccupied or unused. 
(7)  Intensification. A nonconforming use of a building, structure or land shall not be intensified in any manner. Intensification shall include, but not be limited to, increasing hours of operation, increasing the number of dwelling units or increasing the seating capacity of a place of assembly. 
(8)  Change of use. 
a.  Residential zones. Within any residential zone, a nonconforming use may be changed to a permitted use or to a use in the same use code listed under article III. A nonconforming use, if changed to a permitted use, may not be changed back to a nonconforming use. A nonconforming use may also be changed, by special use permit, to a use that is determined by the zoning board to be more in conformity to the permitted uses in the zoning district for which the property is located. 
b.  Nonresidential zones. Within any nonresidential zone, a nonconforming use may be changed to a permitted use, to the same use code listed under article III, or may be changed to a different nonconforming use by special use permit in accordance with section 28-409. A nonconforming use, if changed to a permitted use, may not be changed back to a nonconforming use. 
(9)  Abandonment. If a nonconforming use is abandoned, it may not be reestablished. Abandonment of a nonconforming use shall consist of some overt act, or failure to act, which would lead one to believe that the owner of the nonconforming use neither claims nor retains any interest in continuing the nonconforming use unless the owner can demonstrate an intent not to abandon the use. An involuntary interruption of nonconforming use, such as by fire and natural catastrophe, does not establish the intent to abandon the nonconforming use. However, if any nonconforming use is halted for a period of one year or more, the owner of the nonconforming use will be presumed to have abandoned the nonconforming use, unless that presumption is rebutted by the presentation of sufficient evidence of intent not to abandon the use. 
Sec. 28-219. - Building or structure nonconforming by dimension. 
    Buildings or structures that are nonconforming by dimension are likely to cause overcrowding and congestion in the neighborhoods, contribute to unhealthy conditions and are contrary to the purposes of this chapter. Buildings or structures that are nonconforming by dimension cause disruption of the overall land use pattern of the town, inhibit present and future development of nearby properties and confer upon their owners a position of unfair advantage. It is intended that existing buildings or structures that are nonconforming by dimension shall not justify further departures from this chapter for themselves or for any other property in the neighborhood. 
(1)  Continuance. Nothing in this chapter shall prevent or be construed to prevent the continuance of the use of any building or structure nonconforming by dimension for any purpose to which such building or structure was lawfully established. 
(2)  Maintenance and repair. A building or structure nonconforming by dimension may be maintained and repaired except as otherwise provided in this section. 
(3)  Moving. A building or structure which is nonconforming by dimension shall not be moved in whole or in part to any other location on the lot on which it is located unless every portion of such building or structure is made to conform to all of the dimensional requirements of the zone in which it is located. 
(4)  Addition and enlargement. A building or structure nonconforming by dimension shall not be added to or enlarged in any manner, unless such addition or enlargement conforms to all of the dimensional regulations of the zone in which the building or structure is located; provided however, that in the R-80, R-40, R-20, R-15, and R-10 zones, where 50 percent of the structures on the same side of the street within the block or within 200 feet, whichever is greater, on each side of the structure in question have less than the required minimum front yard setback, then such structure may be added to or enlarged so as to bring the front yard setback to the average distance of the front yards of such neighboring structures, but shall in no case be less than 15 feet. In the R-6 zone, the setback shall be the average setback of the residential block. (See Table B, Dimensional Table, section 28-211.) 
(5)  Expansion. A conforming use within a building or structure which is nonconforming by dimension (other than by lot area per dwelling unit) may be expanded into any other portion of the building or structure which is unoccupied or unused. 
(6)  Intensification. A conforming use within a building or structure which is nonconforming by dimension may be intensified, provided that such intensification is in conformance with the use and lot area per dwelling unit regulations, if applicable, for the zone in which it is located. 
(7)  Change in use. A conforming use within a building or structure which is nonconforming by dimension may be changed to any other conforming use. 
(8)  Demolition. A building or structure nonconforming by dimension, if voluntarily demolished, shall not be reconstructed, unless it conforms with the dimensional regulations of the zone in which it is located. Such voluntary demolition shall be considered an abandonment of the use as set forth in subsection 28-218(9). If such building or structure is involuntarily demolished, destroyed or damaged, it may be repaired or rebuilt to the same size and dimension as previously existed. 
Sec. 28-220. - Land nonconforming by use. 
(a)  Continuance. The lawfully established nonconforming use of land, where no building is involved, may be continued, provided that no such nonconforming use of land shall in any way be expanded or intensified either on the same or adjoining property. 
(b)  Change of use. The nonconforming use of land shall not be changed to a different use, unless such use conforms to the use regulations of the zone in which it is located. 
Sec. 28-221. - Land nonconforming by area. 
(a)  Single lots of record. 
(1)  In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, a single-family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any single lot which was of record on June 28, 1961. 
(2)  Notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this chapter, such lot must be in separate ownership and not adjoining any other lots in common ownership which would result in a merger under subsection 28-221(c) below and must not have been merged by use. This provision shall apply: 
a.  Even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for total lot area or width, or both, that are generally applicable in the district as set forth in article V of this chapter; and 
b.  Provided that the front and rear yard dimensions of the lot as built upon shall conform to the regulations for the district in which such lot is located as set forth in article IV of this chapter, and provided that for a lot with a lot width of 50 feet or more, each side yard shall have a minimum width of at least 20 percent of the lot width, but such yard need not exceed 25 feet in width. For any lot with a lot width of less than 50 feet, each side yard shall have a minimum width of ten feet. Lot coverage by structures shall not exceed 40 percent. Principal structures shall be compatible in size and character with the neighborhood in which they are located. The total gross floor area of a principal structure shall not exceed the average gross floor area of other principal structures within the block. Variance of building size, lot coverage or yard requirements shall be obtained only through action of the zoning board; and 
c.  Lots of 10,000 square feet or more must meet the requirements for public utilities of the zone in which it is located; and lots with less than 10,000 square feet shall either (A) be connected to both public sewer and water, or (B) shall obtain a variance from the zoning board of review to have the lot serviced by only one utility. Lots less than 5,000 square feet (A) shall be connected to public sewer and public water or (B) shall have public sewer and obtain a variance from the zoning board of review to have the lot serviced without public water. In the granting of said variance, the zoning board of review shall consider such factors as health and safety reasons and the financial feasibility of extending the utility lines to the lot. It shall be considered financially unfeasible to extend utilities to the lot if the cost of such extension would exceed 50 percent of the value of the fully developed lot (with street, utilities, etc., but without a building). Such financial infeasibility shall be verified by a certified appraisal as to the lot value and the BCWA estimate for water service or three estimates for the sewer line installation. If the lot is not serviced by water, the owner shall record an indemnity in the land evidence records to hold the town harmless against any and all future costs if a public utility must later be brought to service the lot. 
d.  Provided that appropriate landscaping, including, but not limited to, trees, hedges or fences shall be installed pursuant to the direction of the director to minimize any impact on adjacent property. 
(b)  Merger of multiple nonconforming lots of record in nonresidential zones. Adjacent lawfully established lots in the same ownership in the LB, D, W, GB, MMU and M zones which have less than the minimum area or frontage requirements shall not be merged together, and may be separately developed; provided, however, that such lots must be served by both public sewer and public water and that any such development must meet all dimensional requirements (other than minimum lot area and frontage) and density requirements of this chapter. If such lots are not served by both public sewer and water, then they shall be deemed to be merged into one lot and shall not be divided except in conformance with all requirements of this chapter. 
(c)  Merger of multiple nonconforming lots of record in residential zones. The merger of multiple nonconforming lots of record in residential zones shall be as follows: 
(1)  Adjacent lawfully established undeveloped lots, or adjacent lawfully established developed and undeveloped lots, in the same ownership in the R-80, R-40, R-20 and R-20SP zones which have less than the minimum area or frontage requirements shall be deemed to be merged together as one lot by operation of this chapter. Any such merged lot shall not be divided, except as follows: 
a.  Any such division shall be deemed to be a subdivision and subject to all requirements of the subdivision regulations of the town, including without limitation, the requirement for planning board approval; and 
b.  All such resulting lots must be served by both public sewer and public water; and 
c.  All such resulting lots must meet all dimensional requirements of this chapter, except those as to minimum area and frontage requirements; and the minimum frontage and lot width be reduced to 50 percent of that otherwise required for the zone in which the lot is located, and the lot area may be reduced as follows: 
1.  In the R-80 zone, if after subdivision into as many 80,000 square foot lots as possible, there remains a lot of 40,000 square feet or more, it may be created. 
2.  In the R-40 zone, if after subdivision into as many as 40,000 square foot lots as possible, there remains a lot of 30,000 square feet or more, it may be created. 
3.  In the R-20 and R-20SP zones, if after subdivision into as many 20,000 square foot lots as possible, there remains a lot of 15,000 square feet or more, it may be created. 
Provided however, that the planning board shall have the authority to require the subdivider to divide the merged lot into the same number of lots as would be allowed by this subsection, but with the available lot area averaged over all such lots. For example, in the R-20 zone, if someone owns three lawfully existing adjacent nonconforming lots of 12,000 square feet each, these would be merged into one lot of 36,000 square feet. Under the provisions of this subsection, such lot could be subdivided into one 20,000 square foot lot and one 16,000 square foot lot; provided, however, that the planning board could instead require two 18,000 square foot lots. 
d.  In cases where the above standards cannot be met, then a dimensional variance must be obtained from the Zoning Board of Review in order to proceed with a subdivision application. The Zoning Board may grant a dimensional variance for previously merged lots from the requirements of this merger provision wherein the zoning board may make a specific finding of fact that lots, as unmerged, will be of a size generally in conformance with the area of developed lots in the surrounding vicinity. Such lots shall further have the minimum width requirement of lots in that zone generally or at the very least shall have a lot width of not less than 80% of the lot width required for the underlying zone. 
(2)  Adjacent lawfully established undeveloped lots, or adjacent lawfully established developed and undeveloped lots, in the same ownership in the OS, EI, R-15, R-10, R-10SW, R-8 and R-6 zones which have less than the minimum area or frontage requirements shall be deemed to be merged together as one lot by operation of this chapter. Any such merged lot shall not be divided except as follows: 
a.  Any such division shall be deemed to be a subdivision and subject to all requirements of the subdivision regulations of the town, including without limitation the requirement for planning board approval; and 
b.  All resulting lots must meet all dimensional requirements of this chapter, including without limitation, the minimum lot area and frontage requirements, or obtain a dimensional variance from the zoning board of review. The zoning board may grant a dimensional variance for previously merged lots from the requirements of this merger provision wherein the zoning board may make a specific finding of fact that lots, as unmerged, will be of a size generally in conformance with the area of developed lots in the surrounding vicinity. Such lots shall further have the minimum width requirement of lots in that zone generally or at the very least shall have a lot width of not less than 80 percent of the lot width required for the underlying zone. 
(d)  Exemption from merger provision in residential zones. In any residential zone, if 70 percent of the block, on the same side of street, (block not to exceed 500 linear feet in either direction of the subject lot), or on both sides of the street if fewer than three lots, is developed and built on lots with less than the minimum area which is required in the zone in which it is located, then the remaining multiple nonconforming lots of record may be divided and developed at the same average lot area. Any such merged lot shall not be divided, except as follows: 
(1)  Any such division shall be deemed a subdivision and subject to all requirements of the subdivision regulations of the town, including without limitation the requirement for planning board approval; and 
(2)  All resulting lots must have sewer and water; and 
(3)  All resulting lots must meet the following dimensional requirements: The minimum frontage and lot width may be reduced to no less than 50 percent of that otherwise required for the zone in which the lot is located.

Sec. 28-222. - Buildings and structure nonconforming by parking. 
    A building or structure is considered nonconforming by parking if the lawfully established use of the building or structure does not meet the parking requirements of article VIII of this chapter. 
(1)  Addition, enlargement, expansion and intensification of nonresidential uses. A nonresidential building or structure, or use of land, nonconforming by parking may be added to, enlarged, expanded or intensified provided additional parking space is supplied to meet the requirements of article VIII of this chapter for such addition, enlargement, expansion or intensification. (See exception for the D zone in section 28-252.) 
(2)  Addition, enlargement, expansion and intensification of residential uses. Any residential building or structure nonconforming by parking may not be added to, enlarged, expanded or intensified, unless brought into full compliance with the parking requirements of article VIII of this chapter, such that sufficient parking is provided for the entire structure including the original portion and the addition, enlargement, expansion or intensification. (See exception for the D zone in section 28-252.) 
(3)  Change of use. A building or structure nonconforming by parking, may be changed to a different use, pursuant to all other provisions of this chapter, provided that such new use meets the following parking requirements. The number of additional parking spaces required shall be the difference between the number of spaces required for the proposed use and the number of spaces required for the previous use. In the event that the new use requires less parking spaces than the previous use, no additional parking spaces need be supplied. However, none of the existing parking spaces shall be eliminated unless the total number of spaces required by this chapter for the new use are provided. (See exception for the D zone in section 28-252.) 
Sec. 28-223. - Nonconforming by issuance of a permit or certificate of occupancy.

ARTICLE VIII. - OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING REGULATIONS[4] 

Footnotes: 
--- (4) --- 
Cross reference- Motor vehicles and traffic, ch. 16. 

Sec. 28-251. - General requirements. 
    No land shall be used or occupied and no structure shall be erected or used unless the off-street parking and loading spaces required herein are provided. Uses and structures which are nonconforming by parking are controlled by article VII of this chapter. Presently existing off-street parking or loading facilities may not be reduced below the requirements of this article. While it is the intent of this section to require minimum off-street parking and loading facilities, excessive paving of land that supplies significantly more than the minimum numbers of spaces is discouraged and prohibited. 
(1)  Location of required spaces. Except as provided for in subsection 28-251(6) of this section and section 28-255, the off-street parking spaces required by this chapter shall be on the same lot as the structure or use they are intended to serve or on an abutting lot. Off-street parking spaces for commercial or industrial uses shall not be located in any residence district where such commercial or industrial use is prohibited. All loading spaces shall be on the same lot as the use which they serve. The loading area shall be located on the side or rear of the building which it is intended to serve. 
(2)  Minimum size of spaces The minimum size of spaces shall be as follows: 
a.  Each parking space shall be marked by painted lines and contain the following minimum dimensions affecting the width and length of individual parking stalls and the width of aisles in all districts, exclusive of necessary drives and other access ways. A driveway may be considered a required parking space only for a detached single or two-family dwelling and need not contain painted lines. 
Standard parking spaces: 
Minimum width ..... 10 feet 
Minimum length ..... 18 feet 
Parallel parking spaces: 
Minimum width ..... 8 feet 
Minimum length ..... 21 feet 
Minimum aisle widths: 
90° angle ..... 24 feet 
60° angle ..... 18 feet 
45° angle ..... 13 feet 
30° angle ..... 11 feet 
0° (parallel parking) ..... 12 feet 
b.  For parking areas with more than 20 spaces, the painted lines for each parking stall shall be double-line striped, such that there is a minimum of two feet between each stall. This two-foot area shall be included in calculating the overall width of the parking space stall, provided that at least eight feet of width shall be provided between the inner edges of the stall. 
c.  For parking areas with more than 20 spaces, up to 25 percent of the spaces may be reduced in size for small cars, provided that such spaces shall be prominently signed for small cars only. For parking areas in the downtown or waterfront zones, 50 percent of the spaces may be reduced in size for small cars, provided also that such spaces shall be prominently signed for small cars only. The painted lines for each small car parking stall shall also be double-line striped, such that there is a minimum of two feet between each stall. This two foot area shall be included in calculating the overall width of the parking space stall, provided that at least seven feet of width shall be provided between the inner edges of the stall. The overall size of the small car space may be reduced to nine feet wide by 16 feet long. 
d.  Handicapped accessible spaces shall be provided as required by any other applicable law. 
e.  Each loading space shall be marked by painted lines and contain the following minimum dimensions affecting the width, length and height. 
Minimum width ..... 14 feet 
Minimum length ..... 60 feet 
Minimum vertical clearance ..... 15 feet 
(3)  Setbacks. No parking or loading space or aisle (back-up space) shall be less than ten feet from any front lot line. No parking space or aisle shall be less than five feet from any building, except where greater setbacks are required. Parking spaces less than ten feet from any building shall be separated from such building by raised curb, bumper or wheel guards. The requirements of this subsection shall not apply to detached single or two-family dwellings. 
(4)  Entrance and exit. Each parking and loading space shall be designed with adequate off-street area for approach, turning and exit without the need or ability to use any part of a street. All driveways shall be a minimum of 12 feet in width for each lane of traffic using such driveway. The width of any driveway shall not exceed 30 feet. The requirements of this subsection shall not apply to detached single or two-family dwellings. 
(5)  Combined parking. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the combined use of off-street parking or off-street loading areas by two or more buildings or uses if the total number of spaces provided is not less than the requirements for each use computed separately in accordance with this article. In no case shall off-street loading space be considered as required off-street parking space, or vice-versa. 
(6)  Shared parking. Where two different uses occur at non-simultaneous times, (e.g. a church with Sunday services and evening events together with a business that is closed evenings and on Sunday), the zoning enforcement officer may permit the shared use of parking spaces by multiple uses provided that a deed restriction is filed, indicating the specific conditions by which the parking is provided and setting forth the hours of use for each principal use. Such deed restriction may only be released by the zoning enforcement officer upon presentation of proof of compliance with this article by providing other parking. 
(7)  Credit for shared access. Where a common curb cut and driveway are provided for two or more distinct lots or parcels, the required number of parking spaces for each use may be reduced by ten percent, or where a service road is provided, the required number of parking spaces for each use may be reduced by 20 percent. 
(8)  Construction requirements. The area used for off-street parking or loading shall have a dust-free, hard surface and shall be provided with bumper or wheel guards where needed; provided, however, that the use of pervious materials such as gravel or shells, is allowed and encouraged within 200 feet of the Kickemuit River, Narragansett Bay or other water bodies and wetlands. 
(9)  Illumination. Any illumination shall be of continuous white light and shall reflect the light away from adjoining properties and adjacent streets. 
(10)  Screening. Where a loading area or an off-street parking area for four or more cars is located in or adjacent to a residential zone or use, a landscaped buffer of at least three feet in width, together with an opaque fence or a compact evergreen screen not less than five feet in height shall separate such area and the adjoining property or street. 
(11)  Landscaping. For parking areas with more than 20 spaces located in any zone, the interior of such parking areas shall be suitably landscaped with trees, shrubs, vegetation or ground cover. Such areas shall be appropriately located to prevent long, uninterrupted rows of parking spaces. landscaped areas shall be separated and protected from parking areas by curbing or other means. Where trees are required, such trees shall meet the requirements set forth in the design guidelines of the town subdivision and development review regulations at F.2.B(13). The following landscaping shall be provided: 
a.  Along the street frontage, a three-foot planted strip with one shade tree for every 40 feet of frontage. 
b.  Along interior lot lines, a three-foot planted strip with one shade tree for every 50 feet of interior lot lines. A hedge of compact evergreens or other suitable plantings may be substituted for the planted strip. 
c.  The interior of such parking areas shall have a minimum of ten square feet of landscaping for each parking space, and shall be shaded by deciduous trees. At maturity, each tree shall be presumed to shade a circular area having a radius of 15 feet with the trunk as the center. There shall be sufficient trees so that, using this standard, 20 percent of the parking area will be shaded. Trees shall be surrounded by a minimum of 180 square feet of unpaved area, which may be counted towards calculating the required landscaping. 
Sec. 28-252. - Parking; number of required spaces. 
(a)  Maximum number of spaces allowed. Except for residential uses, the maximum number of off-street parking spaces allowed for any lot or use shall not exceed ten percent, or 50 spaces, more than the required minimum number of spaces, whichever is less. 
(b)  Exemption from parking requirements in downtown zone. In order to provide incentive for existing and new uses in the downtown (D) zone, retail, office, institutional and residential uses within the D zone shall be exempt from parking requirements. 
(c)  Minimum number of spaces required. The minimum number of off-street parking spaces required for each use shall be as set forth in the following table. The requirements are expressed as number of spaces required per dwelling unit (D.U.), rooming unit (R.U.) or gross floor area (GFA) as such terms are defined in this chapter. The zoning enforcement officer shall determine the appropriate category of this table where the use is not therein specified. Where more than one type of use is located in a single building or on a single lot or parcel, the number of required spaces shall be the sum of required spaces for each use. Where the resulting number of spaces includes a fraction thereof, the required number of spaces shall be rounded up to the next highest integer.

    Application may be made to the technical review committee (TRC) of the planning board, pursuant to the TRC development plan review procedures set forth in the town subdivision and development review regulations. If the TRC determines that the construction of off-street parking facilities on the same lot as the main use is impractical and that the provision of off-site parking will be adequate to meet the parking needs of the use-and will conform to good planning practice, then the TRC may approve such off site parking. Off-site parking shall be located a reasonable distance from the use unless evidence is presented that there will be a shuttle or valet service to the use. In any such instance, appropriate deed restrictions shall be placed in the land evidence records for both the property on which the use is located and the property on which the parking is located.

ARTICLE IX. - LAND DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS AND SPECIAL ZONES 
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 28-281. - Historic district zone. 
(a)  Incorporation and cross reference. Chapter 14 of Bristol Town Code entitled historic preservation is hereby incorporated by reference. There exist in the Town of Bristol historic districts as shown on the map entitled, "Map of Historic Districts, Town of Bristol, Rhode Island", together with a list of properties within the downtown district (Attachment 1) and a list of structures of historic or architectural value not located within the boundaries of an established historic district (Attachment 2) as may be amended from time to time, and which is filed at the office of the town clerk, all of which is herein collectively referred to as the "Historic District" or the "Historic District Zone". 
(b)  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to regulate the location and operation of formula business establishments, within Bristol's Historic District Zone, in order to maintain the district's unique character and diverse blend of business offerings. 
(c)  Findings. Establishing or preserving an appropriate and balanced mix of businesses will more effectively promote the district's economic health, property values, and colonial New England ambiance. The land use element of the town's comprehensive plan provides a statement of goals and policies that is quite reflective of the town's desire to preserve the unique and historically rich environment which encompasses the historic district zone. Included are stated policies to: (1) maintain the character of Bristol and make sure that new development does not adversely impact the character of the town; (2) respect the historic resources that link Bristol's present with Bristol's past and use these resources as guidelines for managing future growth; (3) foster the local economic base. In general, the goal of the land use element is to promote the development of a well balanced and functional mix of land uses and to ensure that development in the town is consistent with the town's character and image. 
    The historic downtown district is unique not only because of its well preserved historic structures, but because of its small individualized shops and restaurants as well. Bristol's historic downtown district is recognizable nationwide. It attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors each year, a large part of whom come to enjoy and experience the unique character of the nation's most patriotic town and its numerous quaint shops and restaurants. This unique character would be adversely affected by a proliferation of "formula businesses" which are required by contractual or other arrangements to be virtually identical to businesses in other communities as a result of standardized services, merchandise, decor, uniforms and the like. The development of such businesses, if unchecked and unregulated, would conflict with the distinct atmosphere and unique character for which Bristol's historic downtown district is famous. Therefore, the town council finds that in order to preserve the character of the historic downtown district, it is reasonable and necessary to adopt this article which would monitor and regulate the establishment of formula businesses in the historic district zone through the mechanism of special use permits, in accordance with section 28-409 of this Code. 
(d)  Regulation. A formula business, as defined in section 28-1 of this Code, seeking to operate within the historic district zone, as established in section 14-3 of this Code, is required to first obtain a certificate of appropriateness from the historic district commission, and is then required to obtain a special use permit from the zoning board in accordance with section 28-409, including without limitation, the standards set forth in subsection 28-150(h). Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon agreement of both the historic district commission and the zoning board, a joint public hearing of both bodies may be held, with each body then voting separately in the order set forth above. 
Cross reference- Historic preservation, ch. 14. 
Sec. 28-282. - Land development projects-general requirements. 
(a)  Authorization and general purposes. The purpose of this section is to encourage, and in zones to require, the comprehensive development of significant parcels, in order encourage a positive mix of uses and optimize scarce resources for the benefit of both the public and the developer. The method to accomplish this purpose is by authorizing the establishment of planned land development projects. Land development projects are intended to promote attractive, convenient, efficient development through careful site planning; to preserve open space, historic sites and valuable natural features of the land; to permit the creation of such uses as multifamily residential and mixed-use communities consistent with the character of the town and the neighborhood and the comprehensive plan; and to permit the design and construction of buildings, structures, and other facilities which by virtue of their location, orientation, landscaping and other features show unusual design merit. All such land development projects shall be governed in their establishment by the procedures of the town subdivision and development review regulations for major land development review. 
(b)  Specific considerations. This authorization serves to encourage development as a single project those tracts of land that are sufficiently large to allow a site design for a group of structures. It should either promote a harmonious variety or grouping of uses, or utilize the economy of shared services and facilities. It is further the purpose of authorizing land development projects to take into account the following: 
(1)  Advances in technology and design. 
(2)  Recognition and resolution of problems created by increasing population density. 
(3)  A comprehensive development equal to or better than that resulting from traditional lot-by-lot land use development, in which the design of the overall unit permits increased freedom in the placement and uses of buildings and the location of open spaces, circulation facilities, off-street parking areas and other facilities. 
(4)  The potential of sites characterized by special features of geography, topography, size or shape. 
(5)  Compliance with this chapter as to all appropriate regulations. 
(6)  Compliance with federal and state regulations regarding energy saving. 
(c)  General standards for development. General standards for development shall be as follows: 
(1)  Relation to transportation. Principal vehicular access shall not be from arterial highways. Access points shall be designed to encourage smooth traffic flow with controlled turning movements and minimum hazards to vehicles and pedestrians. Where the development is located on an arterial highway, a service road should be utilized, together with common driveways. Merging, turnout lanes and traffic dividers shall be provided where existing or anticipated heavy flows indicate need. Streets within the development shall not be constructed so as to encourage use of minor streets or highways in adjacent residential areas. 
(2)  Relation to surrounding property. Site planning shall provide protection from potentially adverse surrounding influences, and protection of surrounding areas from potentially adverse influences from within the development. 
(3)  Buffer zone. Landscaped buffers shall be required for certain land development projects, and are set forth in the requirements for each type of land development project. The buffer shall not be paved, nor be used for parking or driveway, nor contain any structure, nor be used for leaching or absorption fields. However, underground water, sewer or drainage lines with appropriate easements thereto may be permitted in a buffer. 
(4)  Screening. Fences, walls or vegetative screening shall be provided along the perimeter of the development where needed to provide a buffer, to preserve public viewsheds and to minimize incompatibility with surroundings. In particular, the following uses and areas within the development shall be screened from adjacent residential district or public streets: 
a.  Off-street parking areas containing more than ten spaces. When nearest portions of noncontiguous parking areas are separated by less than 50 feet of landscaped space, as measured from their nearest points, they shall be considered as combined for computing the above minimum number of spaces. 
b.  Service areas for loading and unloading vehicles other than passenger; and for storage and collection of trash and garbage. 
c.  Utility areas such as pumping station, electric utility substations and the like. 
(5)  Maximum height. No structure shall exceed three stories or 35 feet above grade, as defined in this chapter. 
(6)  Procedural and design standards. Unless otherwise indicated, the procedural and design standards for improvements in a land development project shall be the same as those set forth in the town subdivision and development review regulations in effect at the time of the application insofar as such regulations are applicable. Waivers may be provided in accordance with the requirements of the town subdivision and development review regulations. 
(d)  Standards for multifamily buildings. Where multifamily buildings are otherwise allowed in a land development project, the following standards shall apply. 
(1)  Front yard. Multifamily projects, when located along any major arterial public highway (Metacom Avenue and Hope Street), shall provide a minimum front yard of 75 feet from such public highway. No building, accessory building, parking lot or utility area shall be located in any such front yard. A landscaped or natural buffer zone of 50-foot width shall be maintained along such public highway and may not be used for any recreation space, for access driveways or for primary entrance and exit facilities. 
(2)  Distance between multifamily buildings on same lot. The minimum distance between two buildings or any two rows of buildings substantially parallel to each other shall be 50 feet. The minimum distance between abutting ends of buildings in the same general plane or row shall be 25 feet, if such walls contain no windows serving habitable rooms, otherwise the minimum distance shall be 50 feet. The minimum distances between multifamily buildings on the same lot shall be 10 feet in the R-6 zoning district. There shall be no minimum distances between multifamily buildings on the same lot in the Downtown or Waterfront zoning districts. 
(3)  Distance between multifamily buildings and property line. The minimum distance from side and rear property lines shall be 50 feet. The minimum distance from side and rear property lines shall be 10 feet in the R-6 zoning district. There shall be no minimum distance from side and rear property lines in the Downtown or Waterfront zoning districts. Accessory buildings shall adhere to the same side yard requirements. 
(4)  Rubbish disposal. Where a multifamily building is included in a land development project, a plan for rubbish disposal shall be submitted by the developer, and such plan shall include provision for interior or enclosed storage of all rubbish. Where enclosed storage is provided, it shall be of sufficient size to accommodate all trash and waste stored on the premises. The waste pen and all utility areas shall be properly screened and buffered from all buildings and property lines. 
(5)  Parking lots; distance from buildings. No parking area, driveway or utility area shall be located within 15 feet of any wall of a principal building (except a garage) used for residential purposes along which is located an entrance or exit generally intended for use by residents thereof or along which are located residential windows less than ten feet above ground level. All parking spaces and areas shall be suitably surfaced and not located on any access road. 
(6)  Walkways. Pedestrian walkways shall be provided for all multifamily dwellings to provide safe and convenient access. Pedestrian crossings at edges of the development shall be safely located and marked. 
(7)  Permitted accessory uses. Customary uses accessory to residential dwellings are permitted such as laundry and drying facilities, refuse collection, lounges, sales offices, etc., which are intended for the residents thereof. 
(8)  Townhouse criteria. Not more than four contiguous townhouses shall be built in a row with the same or approximately the same front line, and not more than six townhouses shall be in the same structure. Each townhouse shall have an open space containing not less than 400 square feet, reasonably secluded from view from streets or from neighboring property. Such yards shall not be used for off-street parking or for any accessory building. 
(e)  Commercial development standards. Where commercial uses are otherwise allowed as part of a land development project, the following standards shall apply. 
(1)  Market analysis. The amount of area and type of commercial facilities allowed in a rehab land development project shall be based on a market analysis prepared and signed by a market analyst and reviewed by the planning board. The planning board may require its own market analysis done by an analyst chosen by the board, to be paid for by the developer. The market analysis shall demonstrate that the amount of land proposed is needed for, and can realistically be supported in, commercial use. Calculations of area for commercial use shall include that land necessary for any structures, buffers, parking for and ingress/egress to commercial area. In calculating the potential market area, road travel distances (and not radii) shall be used. 
(2)  Buffer. There shall be a landscaped buffer between any commercial structure and any residential structure within a land development project. Such landscaping shall provide an effective visual and acoustical screen between the commercial and residential uses. Such a buffer can be of natural vegetation or a double row of compact evergreens at least four feet tall. 
(3)  Layout. Layout of parking areas, service areas, entrances, exits, yards, courts and landscaping, and the control of signs, lighting, noise or other potentially adverse influences shall be such as to protect any residential character within a land development project and desirable character in any adjoining neighborhood. 
(4)  Combination with recreational facilities. At the discretion of the planning board, commercial uses may be developed in combination with community recreational facilities for land development project and neighborhood residents. 
(f)  Road standards. Roads in a land development project may be private or public and shall adhere to the standards of the town subdivision and development review regulations. 
(g)  Drainage standards. An engineer engaged by the town, at the developer's expense, shall review all drainage plans and calculations to ensure that no net increase of run-off shall result. The plans shall be reviewed to ensure that the drainage in the planned development will not adversely impact adjacent properties. Drainage shall be constructed according to the state department of transportation standards. 
(h)  Walkway standards. Walkway standards shall be as follows: 
(1)  General requirements. All land development projects shall be provided with safe, convenient, durable, all-season pedestrian access of adequate width for intended use between individual buildings, the streets and all community facilities provided for residents. Sudden changes in alignment and gradient shall be avoided. 
(2)  Common walk system. A common walk system shall be provided and maintained between locations where pedestrian traffic is concentrated. Such common walks shall have a minimum width of four feet. 
(3)  Individual walks. All buildings, other than detached single-family or two-family buildings, shall be connected to common walks, to paved streets, or to paved driveways or parking spaces connecting to a paved street. Such individual walks shall have a minimum width of three feet. 
(i)  Open space. Certain land development projects require that a percentage of the land area of the total tract, exclusive of land devoted to roads, driveways, easements or drainage facilities, including detention ponds, shall be devoted to open space. 
(1)  Multiple parcels. Common open space may be in one or more parcels of a size and shape appropriate for its intended use as determined by the planning board. 
(2)  Ownership. All such open space land shall either be conveyed to the town and accepted by it for park, open space, agricultural, or other specified use or uses, or be conveyed to a nonprofit organization, the principal purpose of which is the conservation of open space, or be conveyed to a corporation or trust owned or to be owned by the owners of lots or units within the development, or owners of shares within a cooperative development. If such a corporation or trust is used, ownership shall pass with conveyances of the lots or units. In any case where the land is not conveyed to the town, a restriction enforceable by the town shall be recorded providing that the land shall be kept in the authorized condition and not be built upon or developed for accessory uses such as parking or roadway. 
(j)  Special regulations. Special regulations shall be as follows: 
(1)  Emergency access. Egress for municipal and emergency vehicles shall be approved prior to approval of the land development project. 
(2)  In-ground utilities. The planning board may require that public utilities in a land development project may be placed in roadways, subject to the granting of easements to the respective utility companies to enter upon such roadways to repair, replace and maintain appurtenances and equipment installed in connection with the use of such utilities, whether such roadways are public and private. 
(3)  Dedication or payment in lieu thereof. The planning board, pursuant to the town subdivision and development review regulations, may require the dedication of sites to the town for development of public schools, fire stations and other public services, or payment of a certain sum of money in lieu of such dedication. 
(4)  Phasing. The timing of development shall be controlled through the issuance of building permits and shall be scheduled at a rate, dwelling units per year, which would not create excessive demand on municipal facilities and services, including sewer and water facilities, roads and storm drains. The planning board may set a rate of development during the application process and require phases to be established. 
Sec. 28-283. - Land development projects-resource conservation and creative development overlay. 
(a)  Purposes. As stated in the comprehensive plan and in conformance with the RIGL §§ 45-24-30 and 45-24-47, the purposes of this section are as follows: 
(1)  To conserve open land, including those areas containing unique and sensitive natural features such as woodlands, steep slopes, streams, coastal areas, flood plains and wetlands, by setting them aside from development. 
(2)  To provide greater design flexibility and efficiency in the siting of services and infrastructure, including the opportunity to reduce length of roads, utility runs, and the amount of paving required for residential development, and to offer an alternative to conventional subdivision development. 
(3)  To reduce erosion and sedimentation by the retention of existing vegetation, and the minimization of development on steep slopes. 
(4)  To provide for a diversity of lot sizes, building densities, and housing choices to accommodate a variety of age and income groups, and residential preferences, so that the community's population diversity may be maintained. 
(5)  To implement adopted municipal policies to conserve a variety of irreplaceable cultural and historical resources and environmentally sensitive resource lands as set forth in the comprehensive plan. 
(6)  To implement adopted land use, transportation, and community policies, as identified in the comprehensive plan. 
(7)  To protect areas of the town with productive agricultural soils for continued or future agricultural use, by conserving blocks of land large enough to allow for efficient farm operations. 
(8)  To create neighborhoods with direct visual access to open land, with amenities in the form of neighborhood open space, and with a strong neighborhood identity. 
(9)  To provide for the conservation and maintenance of open land within Bristol to achieve the above-mentioned goals and for active or passive recreational use by residents. 
(10)  To provide options for landowners in order to minimize impacts on environmental resources (sensitive lands such as wetlands, floodplain, and steep slopes) and disturbance of natural or cultural features (such as mature woodlands, hedgerows and tree lines, critical wildlife habitats, historic buildings, and fieldstone walls). 
(11)  To provide standards reflecting the varying circumstances and interests of individual landowners, and the individual characteristics of their properties. 
(12)  To conserve scenic views and elements of Bristol's New England character, and to minimize perceived density, by minimizing views of new development from existing roads. 
(b)  Conservation development land development project ("CD-LDP"). CD-LDPs are intended for the purpose of promoting the conservation of open space, scenic views, unique natural, cultural and historical resources and the efficient use of land in harmony with its natural features. This is accomplished by allowing reduced lot sizes and locating lots on part of the overall parcel with the remaining area to be maintained as open space. The plans and design standards for the development shall be such as to create architecture and landscaping which are attractive and outstanding, and are in harmony with the open space. These developments may include limited commercial uses to serve the residents of the land development project and reduce the need for automobile travel. 
(c)  Zones where required and optional. 
(1)  Required. The following development options are required: 
a.  In the R-80, R-40 and in any resource conservation and creative development overlay (the RCCD overlay zone) a conservation development land development project shall be required. 
(2)  Optional. A CD-LDP shall be permitted, where not required, in only R-8, R-10, R-15 and R-20 zones, upon approval by the planning board. 
(3)  Process for review. A CD-LDP shall be reviewed in accordance with the subdivision and development review regulations under the following classifications: 
a.  Uses in accordance with subsection 28-283(f)(1) with five or less units and where a new street creation or extension is not required shall be a minor land development project and without a public hearing being required. 
b.  Uses in accordance with subsection 28-283(f)(1) with not more than five units where a new street creation or extension is required shall be a minor land development project with a public hearing. 
c.  Uses in accordance with section 28-283(f)(1) or (2) with more than five units, or where a waiver or modification is required or where phasing is proposed shall be a major land development. 
(4)  Waiver. In accordance with the provisions of the town subdivision and development review regulations, the planning board may grant a waiver from such regulations where such waiver is in the best interest of good planning practice and/or design as evidenced by consistency with the town's comprehensive plan and this chapter. Pursuant to section 8.6 of the regulations, and only with the appropriate findings as set forth therein, such waiver may include provision for a so-called "conventional" subdivision, but only in accordance with the aforementioned standards. The planning board shall make such decision no later than master plan approval. 
(d)  Minimum size of development and minimum percentage of open space. There is no minimum size of development for a CD-LDP. There shall be at least 50 percent open space. Only half of the required open space may be wetlands. 
(e)  Computation of maximum number of dwelling units. Computation of the maximum number of dwelling units shall be as follows: 
(1)  Density does NOT equate to minimum lot size. The initial maximum density shall be determined by calculating the number of dwelling units (or households) which could reasonably be expected to be developed upon the site under a plan of a conventional subdivision or land development project that depicts the number of dwelling units on a parcel of land, taking into account physical constraints to development (known as a yield plan). The maximum number of dwelling units on the yield plan, as approved by the planning board as part of master plan approval, shall be known as the "initial maximum number". 
(2)  The applicant shall have the burden of proof with regard to the reasonableness and feasibility of the design and of the engineering specifications for such yield plan. Yield plans shall be prepared as conceptual layout plans in accordance with the pre-application checklist of the regulations. Yield plans shall show proposed streets, lots, rights-of-way, stormwater management facilities, land unsuitable for development and other pertinent features. Although the yield plan must be drawn to scale, it need not be based on a field survey. However, it must be a realistic layout reflecting a development pattern that could reasonably be expected to be implemented, taking into account the presence of lands unsuitable for development and specific area required for preservation as defined in the regulations, existing easements or encumbrances and the suitability of soils for subsurface sewage disposal. 
(3)  The yield plan shall also reflect the dimensional standards for uses being proposed, as contained in the dimensional regulations of this zoning ordinance. The yield plan shall identify how conventional lots or uses could be developed having the required area, frontage and other dimensional requirements of this zoning ordinance. 
(4)  The Initial maximum number determination shall be made during the pre-application stage of review. The applicant shall use this initial determination as the basis for submission of more detailed information during subsequent stages of review. Upon further investigation and upon receipt of more detailed soils and environmental information as may be provided in subsequent stages of review, the planning board may increase or reduce the number of lots/dwelling units contained in the initial maximum number. In developments that require alterations to be made to freshwater wetlands, the board may establish an initial maximum number contingent upon confirmation by the RI Department of Environmental Management that such alterations are permitted under the provisions of the Freshwater Wetlands Act. For all developments, the final initial maximum number shall be determined as part of the master plan stage of review. 
(5)  In addition to the initial maximum number, the planning board may grant zoning incentives, pursuant to the RIGL § 45-24-47, to adjust the maximum density for the entire development; provided, however, that the maximum number of permitted new dwelling units site shall not be increased by a factor of more than 1.3 above the initial maximum number where granted multiple zoning incentives as provided below. The initial maximum number of units plus any units allowed as zoning incentives shall equal the "basic maximum number" or units. 
a.  If the planning board determines that the number of low and moderate income dwelling units exceed the minimum number otherwise required by this ordinance, the initial maximum number of permitted dwelling units in the development may be increased by a factor of 1.2. 
b.  If the planning board determines that the amount of open space area provided in the entire CD-LDP exceeds the minimum required 50 percent, the initial maximum number of permitted dwelling units in the development may be increased by a factor in accordance with the following table: 
Amount of Open 
Space Provided Increase in 
Density Factor 60%-67% 1.1 67%-75% 1.2 75% or greater 1.3  
c.  If the planning board determines that at least one-third of the provided open space area is suitable for dedication to public use (including active and passive recreation areas) and such dedication to the public is made in perpetuity, the initial maximum number of permitted dwelling units in the development may be increased by a factor of 1.2. The decision whether to accept an applicant's offer to dedicate open space land to public usage within a proposed subdivision shall be at the discretion of the planning board, which shall be guided by the comprehensive plan, particularly those sections dealing with active and passive recreational facilities. 
d.  Notwithstanding the maximum density increase factor of 1.3, the planning board may determine that an existing dwelling which is currently located on the property being developed should be preserved for any of the following purposes: maintenance of historic or traditional development patterns; preservation of streetscape features; maintenance of building placement, setback and alignment on the site; preservation of historic structures that contribute to the character of an area; design of public or common open space. In such cases, the planning board may allow the applicant to exceed the basic maximum number of permitted dwelling units in the development by this one additional dwelling unit. Any dwelling unit granted a zoning incentive under the provisions of this section shall be subject to deed restrictions prohibiting the removal or alteration of the dwelling. 
(f)  Permitted uses. Permitted uses shall be as follows: 
(1)  Underlying zone. Any uses permitted in the underlying zone shall be permitted in the CD-LDP. 
(2)  Additional uses. The following uses shall be permitted, subject to the planning board's determination that such uses as proposed form a harmonious mixture for the subject site:

Such use shall be accessible only from an interior street or driveway, and shall not be accessible from any collector or arterial street. 
e.  Recreation: Camp for boys or girls, riding stable, golf course, playground/park, open space (in addition to the mandatory open space), nonprofit community center, yacht club/marina. 
(g)  Minimum lot area. The minimum lot area shall be as follows: 
Where individual lots are created, the following minimum lot sizes shall be maintained. 
(1)  Community water and sewage service. Where a public water system or a community well, and a public sewer system or community sewage disposal system (SDS), is connected to each principal structure, the minimum area of each building lot shall be 7,500 square feet. 
(2)  Community water or sewage service. Where a public water system or a community well, or a public sewer system or community sewage disposal system (SDS), is connected to each principal structure, the minimum area of each building lot shall be 10,000 square feet. 
(3)  No community water nor sewage service. Where neither a public water system or a community well, nor a public sewer system or community sewage disposal system (SDS), is connected to each principal structure, the minimum area of each building lot shall be 40,000 square feet. 
(4)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the condominium form of ownership is utilized, no minimum lot (or unit) size need be established, provided all other health and safety requirements (such as minimum distance between wells and septic systems) and dimensional requirements (such as the dimensional requirements set forth elsewhere in this article IX) are met. 
(h)  Minimum frontage. The minimum frontage on a public road of the parcel for development proposals shall be at least 50 feet in all residential districts. Additional frontage may be required if more than one access road is deemed necessary by the planning board. 
(i)  Design standards. 
(1)  All dwellings units shall meet the following additional setback requirements: 
From the lot line of any adjoining (but not part of the LDP) residential property 50 feet From cropland or pasture land 100 feet From buildings or barnyards housing livestock 300 feet From active recreation areas such as tennis courts or playing fields (not including tot-lots) 150 feet  
(2)  Views of house lots from exterior roads and abutting properties shall be minimized by the use of changes in topography, existing vegetation, or additional landscaping. 
(3)  House Lots shall generally be accessed from interior streets, rather than from roads bordering the tract. 
(4)  Streets may be publicly or privately owned and maintained. Streets shall be designed to conform with the standards of the town where the street is or may be ultimately intended for dedication and acceptance by the town. Private streets shall be adequate for the intended use and vehicular traffic and shall be maintained by an association of unit owners or such other means or entity as may be approved by the planning board. 
(5)  At least 50 percent of the lots shall directly abut, or face unobstructed across a street open space. 
(6)  No portion of any house lot may be used for meeting the minimum required open space. However, where the open space is used for active agricultural use, a dwelling unit may be provided for a live-in caretaker/manager of such active use, and such area may still be used to meet the minimum required open space. 
(7)  Pedestrian and maintenance access, excluding those lands used for agricultural or horticultural purposes, shall be provided to open space. 
(j)  Protection, management and ownership of buffer and open space. 
(1)  The open space that is required to be reserved and created shall be subject to permanent conservation easements prohibiting future development and defining the range of permitted activities. 
(2)  The following methods may be used, either individually or in combination, to own common facilities. However, open space shall be initially offered for dedication to the Town of Bristol. Common facilities shall not be transferred to another entity except for transfer to another method of ownership permitted under this section, and then only when there is no change in the common facilities or in the Conservation Land ratio of the overall development. Ownership methods shall conform to the following: 
(3)  Fee simple dedication to Bristol. The Town of Bristol may, but shall not be required to, accept any portion of the common facilities, provided that there is no cost of acquisition to the town and the town agrees to and has access to maintain such facilities. 
(4)  Condominium association. Common facilities may be controlled through the use of condominium agreements. Such agreements shall be in accordance with relevant Rhode Island law. All open land and common facilities shall be held as "common element".

(d)  Density. The density for a urban rehab land development project shall be as follows: 
(1)  Residential density. Density shall not exceed the existing residential density of the surrounding neighborhood, if not further defined by this chapter or the comprehensive plan, including any site specific reuse plan or neighborhood plan adopted by the town for inclusion in the comprehensive plan. Residential density for projects with an underlying "W" zone shall be based on the requirements of dimensional table C in this chapter. Other factors to be considered in determining density will be the ability of infrastructure, town services and the environment to accommodate such density. Even in a predominantly residential development, the developer will be required to use at least 25 percent of the site for commercial, institutional, and/or public use. 
(2)  Residential density for historical buildings greater than 100,000 square feet in the W zone. Contributing buildings on the National Historical Register located in the W zone that are in excess of 100,000 square feet of gross floor area shall have a minimum GFA/DU (gross floor area per dwelling unit) of 2,250 square feet per dwelling unit. In such buildings, in lieu of required retail and restaurant uses on the first floor within 50 feet of the front lot line (see footnote to section 28-82 table A in the W zone), the planning board may allow the provision of otherwise allowed nonresidential uses in alternate locations within the building. The planning board may also reduce the gross floor area of such required nonresidential uses by up to 20 percent. 
(3)  Nonresidential density. Number and type of manufacturing, commercial, institutional and public uses shall be guided by the ability of the site and the surrounding area to accommodate parking, projected traffic levels, noise, sewer, water and storm drains. In a predominantly commercial development, the developer will be strongly encouraged, but not required, to use at least 25 percent of the site for residential use. 
(e)  Objectives. These land development projects are designed to encourage the rehabilitation of urban waterfront and industrial areas of historic and/or conservation concern by pursuing the following objectives: 
(1)  Minimizing traffic congestion and maximizing energy savings by reducing the number and length of automobile trips and by encouraging design friendly to pedestrians; 
(2)  Promoting greater independence for the elderly, the young and physically or mentally handicapped individuals by providing greater accessibility and by bringing needs for daily life within walking distance of neighborhoods; 
(3)  Enriching community identity by providing the opportunity for a broad range of housing types and work places consistent with traditional town character; 
(4)  Protecting aspects of the built and natural environment and character which impart a sense of place to the community while allowing beneficial new uses and rejuvenation; 
(5)  Safeguarding the physical fabric of the community from neglect and decay and preventing incongruous development and redevelopment; 
(6)  Ensuring that changes of use, where they are allowed to occur, are appropriate and compatible with the architecture of the buildings on-site and the surrounding neighborhood; 
(7)  Protecting the character of the area by encouraging development or redevelopment that does not generate excessive vehicular activity, noise or other nuisances, and which may jeopardize the continuing occupation and use of the neighboring properties. 
(8)  For those rehab land development projects within the waterfront zone, maintaining and enhancing public access to the waterfront. 
(f)  Minimum requirements. These land development projects are designed for mixed use which encourages the reuse of older structures or older areas within designated areas in town. Each rehab land development project shall be guided by the mix of uses of the surrounding area or district. The developer shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the planning board the availability and adequacy of public and/or private circulation systems, services and utilities. The planning board may approve a phasing plan for the development based upon the availability of such services. The entire tract of land may either be one lot or a series of lots. If buildings straddle lot lines, the developer shall be encouraged to reconfigure the lots so that buildings do not straddle lot lines. Each lot must have access to a public street or publicly accessible area. 
(g)  Public or institutional use. At least ten percent of the land area must be allocated for public or institutional use including, but not limited to, publicly accessible parks, squares, green spaces, waterfront access, interior spaces, public view corridors and buffer areas. The purpose for this public space is to promote and enhance the vitality of the project and the neighborhood, while also achieving public health, safety and welfare standards. 
Sec. 28-285. - Route 136 (Metacom Avenue) overlay. 
    It is a goal of the town, as stated in the comprehensive plan, to promote high quality development along the corridor of Route 136 (Metacom Avenue) that will minimize the impact of increasing traffic flows, protect residential privacy and property values, and preserve scenic resources. The overlay district is established to provide an additional set of review criteria and design standards on development projects to achieve this goal. 
(1)  Overlay zone boundaries. The overlay zone is as mapped on the official zoning map. The overlay zone applies to the parcel lot with frontage on Metacom Avenue, as well as any new lots created by the subdivision of larger parcels. Any proposed major land development project east of Metacom Avenue (regardless of frontage) shall be subject to the Metacom Avenue overlay. 
(2)  Permitted uses. Any permitted use in the underlying zone is permitted in the overlay zone, subject to the design standards below. Uses permitted by special use permit are allowed if granted by the zoning board subject to the requirements of section 28-409; and, if applicable, section 28-150. 
(3)  Review process. The review process for any development plan proposed in the overlay zone shall be as follows: 
a.  Any development plan proposed in the overlay zone shall be reviewed by either the technical review committee or the planning board as set forth in article VI of this chapter. Any land development project proposed in the overlay zone shall be reviewed by the planning board. The review process shall be in accordance with the procedures set forth in the town's subdivision and development review regulations. 
b.  The technical review committee or the planning board, as the case may be, may require a traffic impact study, prepared by a state registered professional engineer, for projects which generate new or additional parking for more than 20 cars. The purpose of the traffic study is to determine the proposed development's impact on traffic and level of service as well as specific mitigation measures for same. The scope of the traffic study shall be as required by the planning board engineer. 
c.  Not withstanding any provision of this subsection, all entrance and exit driveways onto Route 136 (Metacom Avenue), a state road, shall be in accordance with the requirements of the state department of transportation and shall require a physical alteration permit from the state department of transportation and may require that the study area for traffic impact analysis include the following: 
1.  In general, any links (streets) that would experience a directional increase of 250 ADT or 25 vehicles in a peak hour. 
2.  Extend beyond the immediate area up to a half-mile outside the development boundaries and may include any link or street that experiences a ten percent directional increase in traffic resulting from the development project and the effects of other development (cumulative impact) which may coincide with the immediate development. 
3.  Require that the traffic study completed for the RIDOT physical alteration permit for access to Metacom Avenue include, at a minimum, the study area identified by the town's planning department during the pre-application process. 
4.  Require that developers consider roundabouts as an alternative means to traffic signalization. 
5.  Require that developers provide sidewalks. 
6.  Require applicants to conduct transportation management strategies to reduce commuting by single occupant vehicles by improved multimodal transportation links (sidewalks to bus stops), incentives for bus use (RIPTA bus passes), ride sharing/transportation demand management strategies (car and vanpooling, staggered shift hours, telecommuting). There may be a reduction in parking spaces as provided in article VIII of this chapter. 
(4)  Development design standards. All development projects located within the Route 136 (Metacom Avenue) overlay zone shall be reviewed in accordance with the following standards: 
a.  Service road. Developments located on the west side of Route 136, between Gooding and Tupelo, shall provide either a 30-foot right-of-way or 30 foot easement for imminent or future construction of a service road. This alignment shall be coordinated within projects and located so that vehicular and pedestrian traffic may move to and from developments without having to re-enter Route 136. The area of such service road shall be counted to meet any minimum lot area requirements. 
b.  Commercial, mixed-use and multifamily residential developments. Development standards for commercial developments shall be as follows: 
1.  Driveway and roadway spacing. Spacing between driveways and proposed roadway intersections shall be determined based on a function of the posted street speed limit according to the following schedule: 
Posted Speed Limit Minimum Spacing 
Between Driveways 35 MPH or less 150 feet 40 to 45 MPH 230 feet  
Spacing will be measured from the centerline of each driveway. 
2.  Combined access. The sharing of driveway access points by two or more properties is recommended particularly where the driveway volumes will be low. Driveways should be located along common property lines or be established by easements over the property being served by the driveway. The technical review committee or the planning board, as the case may be, may require a shared driveway where site, traffic or development conditions warrant. In addition, an access easement to adjacent commercial sites for coordinated joint parking areas may also be required. Where combined access is provided, there may be a reduction in parking spaces as provided in article VIII of this chapter. Should one or both of the parcels with a shared driveway access point be redeveloped or change use (with an anticipated increase in volume), the technical review committee or planning board, as the case may be, may require an alternative site plan design or request the parcel owners seek a variance to maintain the existing driveway configuration. 
i.  Parcels with frontage along Metacom Avenue and a secondary/side street (i.e. corner lots) shall be prohibited from establishing curb cuts along Metacom Avenue. Access to these properties shall be via the side roads, improving the safety, capacity and visual aesthetics of Metacom Avenue within the immediate area. Curb cuts may be permitted for enter/exit only lanes that prohibit left turning movements on Metacom Avenue. 
3.  Dimensional requirements for access. All driveways shall be a minimum of 15 feet in width for every lane of traffic using such driveway. Combined entrance and exit driveways shall have a planted island with a minimum width of six feet between the lanes. 
4.  Parking location. All parking areas shall be located to the rear or side of the buildings. In no case shall it be located in the rear or side yard setbacks; however, this provision may be waived if shared parking is being provided. Where parking is located to the rear, buildings should be oriented so that there is at least one rear entrance. 
5.  Buffering. Buffering shall be as follows: 
i.  There shall be a minimum 25-foot planted buffer between any commercial use, including parking and loading areas, and any residential use. 
ii.  Mechanical equipment or other utility hardware on the roof, ground or buildings, shall be screened from public view with materials or plantings in harmony with the building, or they shall be so located as not to be visible from any public way. Refuse and waste removal areas and any exterior work areas shall also be so screened. 
6.  Setback. There shall be a maximum 50-foot setback from Route 136 which shall consist of a landscaped area and sidewalk. 
7.  Frontage. Lots created after the effective date of these provisions shall have a minimum of 200-foot frontage on Route 136 (Metacom Avenue). 
c.  Single-family residential developments. Reserved.

    Sand dunes mean naturally occurring accumulations of sand in ridges or mounds landward of the beach. 
    Sheet flow area (for community with AO, AH, or VO zones only). See definition for "area of shallow flooding". 
    Special flood hazard area (SFHA) means the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. After detailed ratemaking has been completed in preparation for publication of the flood insurance rate map, zone A usually is refined into zones A, AO, AH, A1-30, AE, A99, AR, AR/A1-30, AR/AE, AR/AO, AR/AH, AR/A, VO, or V1-30, VE or V. For purposes of these regulations, the term "special flood hazard area" is synonymous in meaning with the phrase "area of special flood hazard". 
    Start of construction means for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (P.L. 97-348), includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition placement, substantial improvement or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erections of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure.

(3)  A travel trailer without wheels, built on a chassis and affixed to a permanent foundation, that is regulated under the community's floodplain management and building ordinance or laws. 
    For the latter purposes, "structure" does not mean recreational vehicle or a park trailer or other similar vehicle, except as described in subsection (3) of this definition, or a gas or liquid storage tank. 
    Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure, whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its pre-damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Substantial improvement means any combination of repairs, reconstruction, rehabilitation, alterations, additions or other improvements to a structure, taking place during a ten-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure as determined at the beginning of such ten-year period. This term includes structures that have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. For purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however, include either: 
(1)  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 
(2)  Any alteration of a "historic" structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure". 
    Variance means a grant of relief by a community from the terms of the floodplain management ordinance that allows construction in a manner otherwise prohibited and where specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. 
    Violation means failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management ordinance. Construction or other development without required permits, lowest floor elevation documentation, floodproofing certificates or required floodway encroachment calculations is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    Water surface elevation means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas. 
    Wet floodproofing means measures designed to minimize damage to a structure or its contents by water that is allowed into a building.

The carrying capacity of the altered or relocated watercourse shall be maintained. 
(2)  In zones A1-30 and AE, along watercourses that have a regulatory floodway designated on the Bristol County FIRM encroachments are prohibited in the regulatory floodway which would result in any increase in the base flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(3)  The filling or excavation of land may be permitted only under the following conditions: 
a.  Said action will not encroach upon a watercourse. 
b.  Said action will not result in an increase in the potential flood level. Where it is determined that said action may result in an increase in the potential flood level, the building official shall require appropriate measures to offset the potential increase. Adequate drainage shall be provided so as to reduce the exposure of the site or any other land to flood hazard. 
(4)  No outdoor storage of materials or equipment which is likely to cause damage to property, create a potential obstruction to floodwaters, create a potential fire hazard or pollute the waters during flood periods shall be permitted in any special flood hazard area. Such materials or equipment shall include but not necessarily be limited to: lumber and other buoyant materials, water-soluble materials, volatile or flammable materials, acids or poisons. 
(5)  Provision shall be made for anchoring facilities, equipment or yard features which are capable of movement or flotation in floodwaters. Such items shall include but shall not necessarily be limited to: fences, sheds, animal shelters, tanks, storage boxes, planters, vehicles, boats and other items normally positioned or stored on a site outside of a structure. 
(6)  The use of flood-resistant materials for structures within an area of special flood hazard as defined in section 28-302. 
(7)  Construction methods and practices should be used that minimize flood damage. 
(8)  Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air conditioning equipment, and other service facilities designed and/or located to prevent water entry to accumulation.

(Ord. No. 2014-07, 6-25-14) 
Sec. 28-309. - Specific standards. 
(a)  Construction standards in special flood hazard areas (SFHA), zones A, A1-30, AE. 
(1)  Residential construction. All new construction, substantial improvements, and repair to structures that have sustained substantial damage shall have the bottom of the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above the base flood elevation (BFE). 
(2)  Nonresidential construction. All new construction, substantial improvements, and repair to structures that have sustained substantial damage which are commercial, industrial or nonresidential structures shall: 
a.  Have the bottom of the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above the base flood elevation (BFE); or 
b.  In lieu of being elevated, nonresidential structures may be dry floodproofed to one foot above the BFE provided that together with all attendant utilities and sanitary facilities the areas of the structure below the required elevation are watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and provided that such structures are composed of structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy. A Rhode Island registered professional engineer or architect shall review and/or develop structural design specifications and plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with acceptable standards of practice or meeting the provisions of this section. Such certification shall be provided to the building official. 
(3)  Fully enclosed areas below the base flood elevation of elevated buildings. All new construction, substantial improvements, or repair of substantial damage to residential or nonresidential structures that include fully enclosed areas formed by a foundation and other exterior walls below the base flood elevation (BFE) of an elevated building, shall be designed to preclude finished living space and be designed to allow for the entry and exit of flood waters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls (wet floodproofing). Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a Rhode Island registered professional engineer or architect, or meet the following minimum criteria listed in subsections a.-h. below: 
a.  Provide a minimum of two openings (hydraulic flood vents) having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every one square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding. These hydraulic openings must be located on at least two different walls. Only the area (square footage) that lies below the BFE can be used in the calculation of net area of vents required; 
b.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. At least one side of the structure's fully enclosed area must be at or above grade. Fill placed around the foundation walls must be graded so that the elevation inside the enclosed area is equal to or higher than the adjacent outside elevation on at least one side of the building. The foundation slab of a residential structure, including the slab of a crawlspace, must be set equal to the outside finished grade on at least one side of the building; 
c.  The openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic entry and exit of flood waters in both directions without any external influence or control such as human intervention, including the use of electrical and other nonautomatic mechanical means. Other coverings may be designed and certified by an engineer or approved by the building official; or 
d.  The area cannot be used as finished living space. Use of the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary and shall only be used for the parking of vehicles, building access or limited storage. Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for the parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator). The enclosed area shall not be used for human habitation or partitioned into separate rooms; 
e.  All interior walls, floor, and ceiling materials located below the BFE shall be unfinished and resistant to flood damage; 
f.  Electrical, plumbing, machinery or other utility equipment that service the structure (furnaces, oil or propane tanks, air conditioners, heat pumps, hot water heaters, ventilation, washers, dryers, electrical junction boxes, circuit breaker boxes and food freezers) are prohibited in the fully enclosed area below the BFE. Utilities or service equipment located in this enclosed area, even if elevated above the BFE in the space, will subject the structure to increased flood insurance rates; 
g.  The space below the lowest floor shall be: 
1.  Free of obstructions as described in FEMA Technical Bulletin 5 "Free of Obstruction Requirements for Buildings Located in Coastal High Hazard Area in Accordance with the National Flood Insurance Program," or 
2.  Constructed with open wood lattice-work, or insect screening intended to collapse under wind and water without causing collapse, displacement, or other structural damage to the elevated portion of the building or supporting piles or columns; or, 
3.  Designed with an enclosed area less than 300 square feet that is constructed with non-supporting breakaway walls that have a design safe loading resistance of not less than ten or more than 20 pounds per square foot. 
h.  A residential building with a structurally attached garage having the floor slab below the BFE is considered an enclosed area below the BFE and must meet the standards of subsection (a)(3). A garage attached to a residential structure, constructed with the garage floor slab below the BFE, must be designed to allow for the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters in both directions. Flood openings or vents are required in the exterior walls of the garage or in the garage doors. The human intervention necessary to open garage doors when flooding occurs is not an acceptable means of meeting the openings requirements. In addition to the automatic entry of floodwaters, the areas of the garage below BFE must be constructed with flood resistant materials. Garages attached to nonresidential structures must also meet the aforementioned requirements or be dry floodproofed as per the requirements of subsection (a)(2). 
(4)  Manufactured (mobile) homes and recreational vehicles (RVs). NOTE: Manufactured homes are not allowed in Bristol. Reference the use table at section 28-82. 
a.  In all special flood hazard areas (SFHA), any manufactured (mobile) homes to be newly placed, substantially improved or repaired as a result of substantial damage, shall be elevated so that the bottom of the lowest floor is at or above the base flood elevation (BFE). This includes SFHAs outside a manufactured home park or subdivision, in a new manufactured home park or subdivision, in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or on a site in an existing park which a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as a result of a flood. 
b.  All manufactured (mobile) homes within a SFHA shall be placed on a permanent foundation which itself is securely anchored and to which the structure is securely anchored so that it will resist flotation, lateral movement and hydrostatic pressures. Anchoring may include, but not be limited to, the use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. 
c.  All manufactured (mobile) homes within a SFHA shall be installed using methods and practices which minimize flood damage. Adequate access and drainage should be provided. Elevation construction standards include piling foundations placed no more than ten feet apart, and reinforcement is provided for piers more than six feet above ground level. 
d.  Recreational vehicles placed on sites within a SFHA shall either (i) be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days, and (ii) be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or (iii) be elevated and anchored. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions. Reference section 28-142 for stricter requirements. 
e.  Public utilities and facilities in manufactured (mobile) homes or subdivisions with a SFHA shall be constructed so as to minimize flood damage. 
(5)  Within zones AH and AO on the FIRM, adequate drainage paths must be provided around structures on slopes, to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures. 
(6)  Within zones AO on the FIRM, new and substantially improved residential structures shall have the top of the lowest floor at least as high as the FIRMs depth number above the highest adjacent grade and non-residential structures shall be elevated or flood-proofed above the highest adjacent grade to at least as high as the depth number on the FIRM. On FIRMs without a depth number for the AO zone, structures shall be elevated or floodproofed to at least two feet above the highest adjacent grade. 
(7)  Accessory structures. Detached accessory structures in zones A, AE, A1-30, AO, and AH (i.e., garages, sheds) do not have to meet the elevation or dry floodproofing requirement if the following standards are met: 
a.  The structure is no more than 500 square feet and has a value less than $1,000.00. 
b.  The structure has unfinished interiors and must not be used for human habitation. An apartment, office or other finished space over a detached garage is considered human habitation and would require the structure to be elevated. 
c.  The structure is used solely for parking of vehicles and/or limited storage. 
d.  The accessory structure must be wet floodproofed and designed to allow for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater. 
e.  The accessory structure shall be firmly anchored to prevent flotation, collapse and lateral movement. 
f.  Service facilities such as electrical, mechanical and heating equipment must be elevated or floodproofed to or above the base flood elevation. 
g.  The structure must not increase the flood levels in the floodway. 
h.  The structure is not used for storage of hazardous materials. 
i.  The structure is not in a floodway. 
(b)  Additional construction standards in coastal V-zones. 
(1)  Residential and nonresidential construction. In V1-30, VE, and V-zones, the elevation of the bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member of the lowers floor of all new and substantially improved structures shall be obtained and maintained. Further, all new construction, substantial improvements: 
a.  Shall be elevated and secured to anchored pilings or columns so that the bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member is at or above the base flood elevations (BFE). 
b.  Shall be certified by a registered professional engineer/architect that the design and methods of construction meet elevation and anchoring requirements. 
c.  Shall have space below the lowest floor either free of obstruction or constructed with breakaway walls. Any enclosed space shall be used solely of building, building access, or storage. 
d.  Shall not utilize fill for structural support. 
(2)  Manufactured homes. Manufactured homes placed or substantially improved within V1-V30, VE, and V-zones, which meet one of the following criteria, shall meet the V-zones standards.

DIVISION 4. - EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONAL ZONING DISTRICT (EI ZONE) 

Sec. 28-351. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of the EI zone is to permit the continued viability and expansion of higher education institutions in designated districts of the town in a planned manner, while protecting surrounding cultural, historic, and environmental resources. It is hereby recognized that a higher education institution exists in the town. In order to recognize this existing development and to permit this institution to grow and expand, an EI zone has previously been incorporated into Table A-Permitted Use Table and Table C-Dimensional Table. The standards and criteria for the EI zone are hereby created and mapped on the official zoning map. 
Sec. 28-352. - Permitted uses and dimensions. 
(a)  Use of property owned or leased by a higher education institution (hereafter "institution") and located in an EI zone shall be governed by the provisions of this division. Specific permitted principle uses are identified in Table A-Permitted Use Table. Accessory uses that are normally accessory and subordinate to such permitted uses are also permitted in the EI zone. 
(b)  Specific dimensional requirements are identified in Table C-Dimensional Table, for the EI zone, provided however that for the Campus of Roger Williams University, east of Metacom Avenue, the EI zone shall be further divided into three subdistricts, based on the permitted height. These districts shall be: EI-35 (35-foot maximum height), EI-48 (48-foot maximum height), EI-65 (65-foot maximum height). The location of such subdistricts shall be based on those certain "sectors" shown on that certain map entitled "Roger Williams University Map, for Draft Institutional Master Plan, dated September 20, 2001", (the Roger Williams Draft Map) a copy which is in the custody of the town clerk and hereby incorporated by reference. Dimensional requirements are hereby declared to be an integral part of the nature of the educational institution use and therefore any variance sought from the zoning board from dimensional requirements shall be deemed to be a use variance. 
Sec. 28-353. - Parking. 
    Specific parking and loading requirements are identified in article VIII of this chapter. 
(1)  Off-street parking spaces required for institutional uses shall be located in the EI zone or immediately adjacent thereto. 
(2)  When an institution has a noncontiguous campus, parking may be supplied on one part of the campus to meet the parking needs of the other noncontiguous part of the campus provided that a shuttle service is supplied by the institution to move students and staff between the noncontiguous campuses. This provision is applicable only if an institutional master plan, which includes a parking/shuttle plan, has been submitted and approved in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. 
(3)  Notwithstanding article VIII of this chapter, the planning board as part of its approval of the institutional master plan may: 
a.  Allow sodium vapor lights to be used provided that such lights are aimed and shaded so as not to cast glare or light onto neighboring properties. 
b.  Allow the size of certain parking spaces to be reduced to not less than nine feet in width. 
c.  Modify interior landscaping standards for parking lots, provided that in the EI 35 zone only, any reduced landscaping is replaced elsewhere on the campus in the EI 35 zone and so delineated on the institutional master plan. 
(4)  The parking requirements, as to the number of parking spaces required pursuant to subsection 28-251(3) of this chapter, are hereby declared to be an integral part of the nature of the educational institution use and therefore any variance sought from the zoning board from parking requirements shall be deemed to be a use variance. 
Sec. 28-354. - Institutional master plan requirement. 
    All higher education institutions shall file an institutional master plan with the planning board, which institutional master plan shall be in compliance with the use and dimensional requirements of this division and the town's comprehensive plan and which shall be approved by the planning board as a major land development project. 
(1)  Purpose. An institutional master plan is required to promote the orderly growth and development of institutions while preserving neighborhood character, and historic resources, and to ensure that the plans are consistent with the town's comprehensive plan. The institutional master plan shall be a statement, in text, maps, illustrations, or other media of communication that is designed to provide a basis for rational decision making regarding the long term physical development of the institution. The plan shall include an implementation element which defines and schedules for a period of five years or more, the specific public actions to be undertaken in order to achieve the goals and objectives of the plan. 
(2)  Filing requirements and changes. 
a.  Institutions shall file with the planning board an institutional master plan within six months following the adoption of this division. Said institution shall review its institutional master plan five years following the first approval, and every five years thereafter (regardless of any intervening amendments) to determine if any changes are being considered or proposed. If changes are not proposed, the institution shall notify the planning board in writing that the current institutional master plan is valid for another five years. 
b.  The institutional master plan may be amended at any time by the institution upon application to the planning board. An amendment shall be required for any of the following: 
1.  Any proposed change at all between the sight visibility line (SVL) as hereinafter defined and a street; 
2.  Any proposed change at all within Sector 1 on the Roger Williams Draft Map; 
3.  Any proposed change greater than 25 percent in the size of a building or structure in Sectors 2 or 3 on the Roger Williams Draft Map; 
4.  Any proposed change greater than 100 feet in the location of a building or structure in Sectors 2 or 3 on the Roger Williams Draft Map; 
5.  Any proposed new building or structure in Sectors 2 or 3 on the Roger Williams Draft Map; 
6.  Any proposed changes for dormitories or any increase in residential dormitory capacity; 
7.  Any proposed change to designated buffers; 
8.  Any proposed change that decreases existing landscaping by 20 percent or more. 
c.  In addition to amendment of the institutional master plan, minor changes to the institutional master plan may be made by the institution upon prior written notice to the planning board. Minor changes include, but are not limited to, the following: 
1.  The addition or cumulative addition to an existing building of less than 25 percent in the size of a building or structure, or less than 100 feet in the location of a building or structure in Sectors 2 or 3 on the Roger Williams Draft Map, 
2.  Any change in parking which does not result in a net decrease in the number of spaces available on the campus. 
d.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a mere change from one department or discipline to another shall NOT be deemed to be any change to the institutional master plan. Examples of such nonchange events include a change from English department classrooms to law school classrooms, or a change from admissions office to development office. 
(3)  Review and approval. An institutional master plan shall be subject to the procedure for review and approval set forth in the subdivision and development review regulations of the Town of Bristol for a major land development. (Note: An institutional master plan includes the entire process of a major land development, including the pre-application stage, the conceptual master plan stage and the preliminary plan stage the latter two of which may be combined by the planning board and the final plan stage.) 
(4)  Plan contents. The institutional master plan shall contain the following minimum requirements: 
a.  Mission statement of the institution, including its relationship with the neighborhoods communities and environment in which it is physically situated. 
b.  Description of existing conditions that shall include a list of all properties owned or leased by the institution within the town regardless of whether they are part of the institution's institutional master plan. The list shall be arranged by assessors plat and lot and include street address, present uses, whether single or multiple uses, including street level and all upper story uses; condition of buildings, structures, parking lots, open space and the like; and other relevant existing conditions of the campus or grounds. Use shall include the general academic function of the building or structure, and not the specific program (e.g. "classroom" and not "English Department classroom"). 
c.  A list of properties owned by the institution and on the National Register of Historic Places or designated in a local historic district and proposed exterior changes to these properties (other than ordinary maintenance), if known. 
d.  Statement of ten-year goals and five-year objectives and means and approaches through which such goals and objectives may be reached. 
e.  Proposed changes in land holdings of the institution including property to be acquired or sold, proposed street(s) to be abandoned, and new streets to be established including private rights-of-way. Property acquired by an educational institution after the approval of its institutional master plan shall automatically be referred to the planning board for a recommendation on amendment by the town council as an amendment to the zoning map, and upon submission of an application by the educational institution, the amendment to the institutional master plan shall be considered by the planning board at a public hearing simultaneously with its consideration of a recommendation to the town council regarding such amendment. 
f.  Proposed changes in land use within the institution's campus and grounds. 
g.  Proposed capital improvements including new structures, additions to existing structures, parking garages, parking lots, parks, and grounds. Major renovations that affect the building and/or campus grounds shall be included. The plan shall, at a minimum, identify the location of such improvements (on a map of the campus), the footprint and exterior dimensions of any new structure, height in stories and feet, proposed uses, including primary and accessory uses, parking and loading to support such uses, and landscaped buffers. 
h.  For the campus of Roger Williams University located east of Metacom Avenue, the institutional master plan shall include a map showing the division of said campus into four sectors including the "buffer" sector. A drawing, prepared by a licensed engineer or surveyor, shall set out all existing buildings and structures, and landscape features as well as the buildings and structures proposed for the next five years. Each sector shall correspond to one of the three subdistricts with its own maximum height. The planning board shall approve the exact location of the zoning subdistricts as referenced above, and they shall be clearly marked on the approved and recorded institutional master plan, a copy of which shall be placed in the custody of the town clerk and hereby incorporated by reference as part of the official zoning map. 
i.  For the campus of Roger Williams University located east of Metacom Avenue, the institutional master plan shall include a map showing a designated buffer along all property lines where the campus abuts a street. Said buffer shall not be less than 80 feet deep from the property line abutting Metacom Avenue and Ferry Road, extending from the northernmost part of the building currently used as a performing art center to the southern end of "Sector 1" as shown on the Roger Williams Draft Map. Said buffer may not include any permanent buildings or structures, but may be used for educational institutional purposes such as athletic fields, and may contain temporary structures such as athletic goals and spectator stands. Said map shall also include a buffer of not less than 50 feet from the property of any other land owner, which buffer shall not be used for any purpose other than landscaped buffer. Said map shall also show a "street visibility line" (hereafter "SVL"), beyond which line new buildings or structures would not be visible from a street, due either to sloping topography, existing vegetative screening provided such screening is within the designated buffer, or existing buildings and structures. The planning board shall approve a buffer and SVL, with both to be clearly marked on the approved and recorded institutional master plan. 
j.  For any new building or addition to an existing building that has building plans, including scaled plans and elevations, such plans and drawings shall be included in the institutional master plan submission. For any new building or structure, and any addition to existing buildings that is located, in whole or in part, between the SVL and a street, architectural drawings shall be submitted to the technical review committee for development plan review, pursuant to the town subdivision and development review regulations and this chapter. The development plan review shall include the location including the relationship to the public street and the impact on the view of the campus from the public street, overall design including the basic architectural style, the shape and form of the roof, the facade, the fenestration and the integration of the new structure into the campus parking and circulation system. 
k.  Proposed demolition of any building, structure, parking garage, parking lot, park, or any other campus facility. In the event of demolition for any building that has tenants other than the institution itself, the institutional master plan shall contain a tenant relocation program which shall contain, as a minimum, provisions relative to institutionally owned residential structures intended for demolition. The relocation shall contain alternatives to demolition which will accommodate the interests of said tenants, the neighborhood and the institutions and which will provide for tenant relocation assistance. 
l.  A circulation plan indicating existing and proposed vehicular access, pedestrian sidewalks and general circulation layout of the campus. The circulation plan shall be prepared by a registered professional engineer who shall have significant experience in traffic engineering. The circulation plan shall address on-site and off-site impacts on adjacent streets. In addition, the plan shall address the adequacy of on-site traffic circulation, parking and loading, sidewalk/pedestrian circulation, delivery, and emergency access and related circulation issues. 
m.  A parking plan that shows the location of all parking on and off the campus. The plan shall identify: the number of parking spaces that exist and the number that are required by this division; the location of new spaces required as a result of any proposed development; any proposed shuttle system between lots and campus facilities; and other information deemed appropriate. 
n.  Any proposed activity that would require an action by the town to implement. 
o.  Application filing fee, in the amount of $1,000.00, or as may be amended by the town council from time to time. Engineering review fees, inspections fees, and other fees (as per Article 7 of the town subdivision and development review regulations) shall be reimbursed by the applicant based on the actual costs incurred by the town, prior to final approval. 
p.  The institutional master plan shall contain text and maps to facilitate the review process.

DIVISION 5. - HISTORIC PRESERVATION AND CONSERVATION ZONING DISTRICT (HPC ZONE) 

Sec. 28-356. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of the HPC zone is to preserve and protect the existing uses of historic properties of importance to the town; and to allow them to be used in a planned manner and permit certain minimal additions to those existing uses; while protecting and preserving the cultural, historic and environmental resources of the property and the town. 
Sec. 28-357. - Permitted uses and dimensions. 
(a)  Use of property located in an HPC zone shall be governed by the provisions of Table A-Permitted Use Table. Land or structures owned or leased by a nonprofit organization or corporation, or by the State of Rhode Island or one of its instrumentalities shall also require the preparation and approval of an institutional master plan (as hereinafter defined) and shall be deemed to be an "historic institution". 
(b)  It is the intent of this section and Table A to allow a variety of uses in existing buildings for historic institutions. It is also the intent to allow certain new construction on the grounds or "campus" of such historic institutions. However, in all cases, it is the intent of this section that permitted uses such as office rental, caretaker's residences, and waterfront uses, be incidental, subordinate and accessory to the principal historic institution. 
(c)  Specific dimensional requirements shall be the same as those identified in Table C-Dimensional Table for the R-40 zone. Dimensional requirements are hereby declared to be an integral part of the nature of the historic institution use and therefore any variance sought from the zoning board from dimensional requirements shall be deemed to be a use variance. 
Sec. 28-358. - Parking. 
    Specific parking and loading requirements are identified in article VIII of this chapter and shall be provided as required for the underlying use. 
(1)  Off-street parking spaces required for historic institution uses shall be located in the HPC zone. 
(2)  When a historic institution has a noncontiguous campus, parking may be supplied on one part of the campus to meet the parking needs of the other noncontiguous part of the campus provided that a shuttle service is supplied by the historic institution to move visitors, guests and staff between the noncontiguous campuses. This provision is applicable only if an institutional master plan, which includes a parking/shuttle plan, has been submitted and approved in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. 
(3)  Notwithstanding article VIII of this chapter, the planning board as part of its approval of the institutional master plan may: 
a.  Allow sodium vapor lights to be used provided that such lights are aimed and shaded so as not to cast glare or light onto neighboring properties, including public spaces such as Mount Hope Bay. 
b.  Allow the size of certain parking spaces to be reduced to not less than nine feet in width, provided such spaces are conspicuously marked for compact cars and that provision is also made for extra large vehicles such as sport utility vehicles. 
c.  Modify interior landscaping standards for parking lots, provided that any reduced landscaping is replaced elsewhere on the campus and so delineated on the institutional master plan. 
(4)  The parking requirements are hereby declared to be an integral part of the nature of the historic institution use and therefore any variance sought from the zoning board from parking requirements shall be deemed to be a use variance. 
Sec. 28-359. - Institutional master plan requirement. 
    All historic institution uses may remain as they were as of the date of adoption of this division (September 20, 2001) without an institutional master plan. However, for any changes other than minor changes as defined below, the historic institution shall be required to file an institutional master plan with the planning board, which institutional master plan shall be in compliance with the use and dimensional requirements of this division and the town's comprehensive plan and which shall be approved by the planning board as a major land development project. Such institutional master plan shall be approved prior to the issuance of any approvals, permits or certificates of appropriateness. Nothing herein shall prevent an historic institution from filing an institutional master plan at any time. 
(1)  Purpose. An institutional master plan is required to promote the orderly and limited growth to support the historic institution while preserving neighborhood character, and historic resources, and to insure that the plans are consistent with the town's comprehensive plan. The institutional master plan shall be a statement, in text, maps, illustrations, or other media of communication that is designed to provide a basis for rational decision making regarding the long term physical development of the historic institution. The plan shall include an implementation element which defines and schedules for a period of five years or more, the specific public actions to be undertaken in order to achieve the goals and objectives of the plan. 
(2)  Filing requirements and changes. 
a.  Historic institutions shall file with the planning board an institutional master plan as set forth above. Said historic institution shall review its institutional master plan five years following the first approval, and every five years thereafter (regardless of any intervening amendments) to determine if any changes are being considered or proposed. If changes are not proposed, the historic institution shall notify the planning board in writing that the current institutional master plan is valid for another five years. 
b.  The institutional master plan may be amended at any time by the historic institution upon application to the planning board. 
c.  Minor changes to the historic institution use include, but are not limited to the following: 
1.  The addition or cumulative addition to an existing building of less than 250 square feet, 
2.  Changes to existing landscaping not located in a designated buffer; 
3.  Any change in parking which does not result in a net decrease in the number of spaces available. 
d.  Major changes to the historic institution use include, but are not limited to, changes to the use of any existing building. An example of such change of use would include the conversion of a residence or museum to a country inn. 
e.  Whether or not an institutional master plan has yet been filed by the historic institution, a minor change may be made by the institution upon prior written notice to the planning board. 
(3)  Review and approval. An institutional master plan shall be subject to the procedure for review and approval set forth in the subdivision and development review regulations of the Town of Bristol for a major land development. (Note: an institutional master plan includes the entire process of a major land development, including the pre-application stage, the conceptual master plan stage and the preliminary plan stage the latter two of which may be combined by the planning board and the final plan stage.) Where an historic institution is also subject to the jurisdiction of the Bristol Historic District Commission ("commission"), the commission's approval shall also be necessary for the institutional master plan, although changes to individual structures or new structures may receive final approval and certificate of appropriateness at a later date when detailed plans of said structure are available. 
(4)  Plan contents. The institutional master plan shall contain the following minimum requirements: 
a.  Mission statement of the historic institution, including its relationship with the neighborhoods communities and environment in which it is physically situated. 
b.  Description of existing conditions that shall include a list of all properties owned or leased by the historic institution within the town regardless of whether they are part of the institution's institutional master plan. The list shall be arranged by assessors plat and lot and include street address, present uses, whether single or multiple uses, including street level and all upper story uses; condition of buildings, structures, parking lots, open space, public space, and the like; and other relevant existing conditions of the campus or grounds. Use shall include the general function of the building or structure. 
c.  A list of properties owned by the historic institution that are on the National Register of Historic Places or designated in a local Bristol Historic District (including individually listed properties) and proposed exterior changes to these properties (other than ordinary maintenance), if known. 
d.  Statement of ten-year goals and five-year objectives and means and approaches through which such goals and objectives may be reached. 
e.  Proposed changes in land holdings of the historic institution including property to be acquired or sold, proposed street(s) to be abandoned, and new streets to be established including private rights-of-way. 
f.  Proposed changes in land use within the historic institution's campus and grounds. 
g.  Proposed capital improvements including new structures, additions to existing structures, parking garages, parking lots, parks, and grounds. Major repairs that affect the building and/or campus grounds shall be included. The plan shall, at a minimum, identify the location of such improvements (on a map of the campus), the footprint and exterior dimensions of any new structure, height in stories and feet, proposed uses, including primary and accessory uses, parking and loading to support such uses, and landscaped buffers. 
h.  For the campus of all historic institutions, the institutional master plan shall include a map showing all existing landscaped areas, and a designated buffer along all property lines where the campus abuts a street. Said buffer shall not be less than 80 feet from the property line. Said buffer may not include any permanent buildings or structures, but may be used for historic institutional purposes, including agriculture, and may contain temporary structures or structures that exist as of the date of the adoption of this section. Said map shall also include a buffer of not less than 50 feet from the property of any other land owner, which buffer shall not be used for any purpose other than landscaped buffer. The planning board shall approve a buffer to be clearly marked on the approved and recorded institutional master plan. 
i.  For any new building or addition to an existing building that has building plans, including scaled plans and elevations, such plans and drawings shall be included in the institutional master plan submission. If historic district commission review is not required, architectural drawings for new buildings and additions shall be submitted to the technical review committee for development plan review, pursuant to the town subdivision and development review regulations and this chapter. The development plan review shall include the location including the relationship to the public street and the impact on the view of the historic institution's campus from the public street, overall design including the basic architectural style, the shape and form of the roof, the facade, the fenestration and the integration of the new structure into the campus parking and circulation system. 
j.  Proposed demolition of any building, structure, parking garage, parking lot, park, or any other campus facility. In the event of demolition for any building that has tenants other than the institution itself, the institutional master plan shall contain a tenant relocation program which shall contain, as a minimum, provisions relative to institutionally owned residential structures intended for demolition. The relocation shall contain alternatives to demolition which will accommodate the interests of said tenants, the neighborhood and the institutions and which will provide for tenant relocation assistance. 
k.  A circulation plan indicating existing and proposed vehicular access, pedestrian sidewalks and general circulation layout of the campus. The circulation plan shall be prepared by a registered professional engineer who shall have significant experience in traffic engineering. The circulation plan shall address on-site and off-site impacts on adjacent streets. In addition, the plan shall address the adequacy of on-site traffic circulation, parking and loading, sidewalk/pedestrian circulation, delivery, and emergency access and related circulation issues. 
l.  A parking plan that shows the location of all parking on and off the campus. The plan shall identify: the number of parking spaces that exist and the number that are required by this chapter; the location of new spaces required as a result of any proposed development; any proposed shuttle system between lots and campus facilities; and other information deemed appropriate. 
m.  Any proposed activity that would require an action by the town to implement. 
n.  Application filing fee, in the amount of $500.00, or as may be amended by the town council from time to time. Engineering review fees, inspections fees, and other fees (as per Article 7 of the town subdivision and development review regulations) shall be reimbursed by the applicant based on the actual costs incurred by the town, prior to final approval. 
o.  The institutional master plan shall contain text and maps to facilitate the review process.

(6)  To establish an affordable housing unit or funding set-aside requirement that allows for a reasonable return for property owners and developers, while recognizing the fact that most future subdivisions will be small scale because few large parcels remain for development within Bristol. 
(b)  Authority to grant comprehensive permits. In accordance with RIGL Tit. 45, Ch. 53, the Low and Moderate Income Housing Act (as amended) the local review board shall have the power to issue a comprehensive permit for a qualifying low or moderate income housing project, which relief shall include all permits or approvals from any local board or official who would otherwise act with respect to such application including, but not limited to, the power to attach to the permit or approval conditions and requirements with respect to setbacks, height, site plan, size, shape, building materials, landscaping, and parking consistent with the terms of the Act. 
Sec. 28-362. - Designation of local review board. 
    The town planning board is hereby designated as the local review board and all references in this division to local review board shall be to the planning board. 
Sec. 28-363. - Definitions. 
    Affordable housing means residential housing that has a sales price or rental amount that is within the means of a household that is moderate income or less. In the case of dwelling units for sale, housing that is affordable means housing in which principal, interest, taxes, which may be adjusted by state and local programs for property tax relief, and insurance constitute no more than 30 percent of the gross household income for a household with less than 120 percent of area median income, adjusted for family size. In the case of dwelling units for rent, housing that is affordable means housing for which the rent, heat, and utilities other than telephone constitute no more than 30 percent of the gross annual household income for a household with 80 percent or less of area median income, adjusted for family size. Such housing shall remain affordable through a land lease and/or deed restriction for 99 years or such other period that is either agreed to by the applicant and town or prescribed by the federal, state, or municipal government subsidy program but that is not less than 30 years from initial occupancy. 
    Affordable housing plan means that component of the housing element of the town comprehensive plan designed to meet the housing needs in the town. 
    Approved affordable housing plan means the affordable housing plan that has been approved by the director of administration as meeting the guidelines for the local comprehensive plan as promulgated by the state planning council. 
    Affordable housing trust fund means a restricted fund to be established by the town council for the purposes set forth in this article per RIGL Tit. 45, Ch. 53. 
    Comprehensive plan means the comprehensive plan of the town adopted and approved by the town pursuant to RIGL Chs. 22.2 and 22.3. 
    Consistent with local needs means reasonable in view of the state need for low or moderate income housing, considered with the number of low income persons in the town affected and the need (a) to protect the health and safety of the occupants of the proposed housing or of the residents of the town, (b) to promote better site and building design in relation to the surroundings, or (c) to preserve open spaces, and if the local zoning or land use ordinances, requirements, and regulations are applied as equally as possible to both subsidized and unsubsidized housing. 
    Inclusionary housing agreement means an agreement recorded in the town's land evidence records describing how the developer will comply with the provisions of this article. 
    Inclusionary housing plan means a plan setting forth in detail the manner in which the provisions of this article will be implemented. 
    Inclusionary unit means an affordable housing unit, as defined in this article. 
    Local board means any town or city official, zoning board of review, planning board or commission, board of appeal or zoning enforcement officer, local conservation commission, historic district commission, or other municipal board having supervision of the construction of buildings or the power of enforcing land use regulations, such as subdivision, or zoning laws. 
    Low or moderate income housing means any housing whether built or operated by any public agency or any nonprofit organization or by any limited equity housing cooperative or any private developer, that is subsidized by a federal, state, or municipal government subsidy under any program to assist the construction or rehabilitation of housing affordable to low or moderate income households, as defined in the applicable federal or state statute, or local ordinance and that will remain affordable through a land lease and/or deed restriction for 99 years or such other period that is either agreed to by the applicant and town or prescribed by the federal, state, or municipal government subsidy program but that is not less than 30 years from initial occupancy. 
Sec. 28-364. - Applicability and eligibility. 
(a)  Any applicant proposing to build low or moderate income housing may submit to the local review board a single application for a comprehensive permit to build that housing in lieu of separate applications to the applicable local boards. This procedure is only available for proposals in which at least 25 percent of the housing is low or moderate income housing. 
(b)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in accordance with RIGL § 45-53-4(a)(xiii) the Bristol Town Council limits the annual total number of dwelling units in comprehensive permit applications from for-profit developers to an aggregate of one percent of the total number of year-round housing units in the town, as recognized in the affordable housing plan. 
(c)  Notwithstanding the timetables set forth elsewhere in this division, the local review board shall have the authority to consider comprehensive permit applications from for-profit developers, which are made pursuant to this paragraph, sequentially in the order in which they are submitted. 
Sec. 28-365. - Application and review procedures. 
    Application and review procedures shall be set forth in the Town of Bristol Subdivision and Development Review Regulations. 
Sec. 28-366. - Criteria for approval. 
    In approving an application for a comprehensive permit, the local review board shall make positive findings, supported by legally competent evidence on the record which discloses the nature and character of the observations upon which the fact finders acted, on each of the following standard provisions, where applicable: 
(1)  The proposed development is consistent with local needs as identified in the local comprehensive community plan with particular emphasis on the community's affordable housing plan and/or has satisfactorily addressed the issues where there may be inconsistencies. 
(2)  The proposed development is in compliance with the standards and provisions of the municipality's zoning ordinance and subdivision regulations, and/or where expressly varied or waived local concerns that have been affected by the relief granted do not outweigh the state and local need for low and moderate income housing. 
(3)  All low and moderate income housing units proposed are integrated throughout the development; are compatible in scale and architectural style to the market rate units within the project; and will be built and occupied prior to, or simultaneous with the construction and occupancy of any market rate units. 
(4)  There will be no significant negative environmental impacts from the proposed development as shown on the final plan, with all required conditions for approval. 
(5)  There will be no significant negative impacts on the health and safety of current or future residents of the community, in areas including, but not limited to, safe circulation of pedestrian and vehicular traffic, provision of emergency services, sewerage disposal, availability of potable water, adequate surface water run-off, and the preservation of natural, historical or cultural features that contribute to the attractiveness of the community. 
(6)  All proposed land developments and all subdivisions lots will have adequate and permanent physical access to a public street. Lot frontage on a public street without physical access shall not be considered compliance with this requirement. 
(7)  The proposed development will not result in the creation of individual lots with any physical constraints to development that building on those lots according to pertinent regulations and building standards would be impracticable, unless created only as permanent open space or permanently reserved for a public purpose on the approved, recorded plans. 
Sec. 28-367. - Criteria for denial. 
    The local review board may deny the request for any of the following reasons: 
(1)  The town has an approved affordable housing plan and is meeting housing needs, and the proposal is inconsistent with the affordable housing plan. In this section meeting housing needs means adoption of the implementation program of an approved affordable housing plan and the absence of unreasonable denial of applications that are made pursuant to an approved affordable housing plan in order to accomplish the purposes and expectations of the approved affordable housing plan. 
(2)  The proposal is not consistent with local needs, including, but not limited to, the needs identified in an approved comprehensive plan, and/or local zoning ordinances and procedures promulgated in conformance with the comprehensive plan. Local zoning and land use ordinances, requirements, or regulations are consistent with local needs when imposed by the town council after comprehensive hearing, and, the town either has existing low or moderate income housing units in excess of ten percent of the year-round housing units reported in the latest decennial census of the town, or the town has promulgated zoning or land use ordinances, requirements, and regulations to implement a comprehensive plan which has been adopted and approved pursuant to state law, and the housing element of the comprehensive plan provides for low and moderate income housing in excess of ten percent of the year-round housing units. 
(3)  The proposal is not in conformance with the comprehensive plan. 
(4)  The town has met or has plans to meet the goal of ten percent of the year-round units being low and moderate income housing. 
(5)  Concerns for the environment and the health and safety of current residents have not been adequately addressed. 
    In the case of a denial, if the applicant fails to meet one or more of the criteria for approval, where applicable, then the local review board shall make negative findings on those provisions as part of its decision. 
Sec. 28-368. - Voting and appeal. 
    All decisions on comprehensive permits shall be by majority vote of the membership of the local review board and may be appealed by the applicant to the state housing appeals board. Any person aggrieved by the issuance of an approval may appeal to the Rhode Island Supreme Court. 
Sec. 28-369. - Expiration of approval and construction. 
    A comprehensive permit shall expire unless construction is started within 12 months and completed within 60 months of final plan approval unless a longer and/or phased period for development is agreed to by the local review board and the applicant. Low and moderate income housing units shall be built and occupied prior to, or simultaneous with the construction and occupancy of market rate units. 
Sec. 28-370. - Inclusionary zoning. 
(a)  Applicability. This section shall apply to all subdivisions of five or more units and all land development projects including new development and redevelopment of existing buildings, with five or more dwelling units, as classified under Bristol's Zoning Ordinance and Subdivision and Development Review Regulations. 
(b)  Affordability requirement. For all applicable projects as defined in subsection 28-370(a), at least 25 percent of the units on site must qualify as Affordable Housing, as defined by this article. Fractions of a lot or dwelling unit shall be rounded up to the nearest whole number. 
(c)  Design and building requirements. 
(1)  All inclusionary units provided within a development shall: 
a.  Be reasonably dispersed throughout the development. 
b.  Be indistinguishable in appearance of quality of construction from the other units in the development. 
c.  Contain a mix of bedrooms, up to and including three bedroom units. 
d.  Be compatible in architectural style to the market rate units within the project. 
e.  Be built and occupied prior to, or simultaneous with the construction and occupancy of any market rate units. 
(2)  Any existing dwelling units proposed to be counted as inclusionary units must be in full compliance with all applicable construction and occupancy codes, and shall be sufficiently maintained or rehabilitated so that all major systems meet standards comparable to new construction. 
(d)  Incentives. 
(1)  Reduction in minimum lot area. All projects subject to this article shall be entitled to a density bonus allowing for reduction in the minimum lot area per dwelling unit in the development based upon the underlying zoning. The density bonus shall be 30 percent for developments up to and including ten dwelling units and shall be 25 percent for developments with more than ten dwelling units. 
(2)  Modification of lot dimensional requirements. The density bonus shall correspond with a 25 percent decrease in the minimum front, rear and side yard setback requirements and a 25 percent decrease in the minimum frontage and lot width requirements of the Bristol Zoning Ordinance for the zoning district in which the property is located. Except in the R-6 zoning district where the front yard setback shall not be less than the average of the block. 
(e)  In-lieu fee option. 
(1)  The applicant for development subject to this article may pay a fee in-lieu of providing the required number of affordable housing units. In so choosing to make such a payment, the applicant will not receive the density bonus described in subsection 28-370(d). 
a.  The in-lieu fee per affordable unit required shall be the difference between the median sales price of a single-family home in Bristol and the maximum affordable sales price of a single-family home for a Bristol household of four earning 80 percent of the area median income, as determined in accordance with the following: 
i.  The median sales price of a single-family home in Bristol shall be derived from statistics collected by the Statewide Multiple Listing Service for the previous calendar year as determined by the town's tax assessor. [For example, in calendar year 2006, the median sales price of a single-family home in Bristol was $320,000.00.] 
ii.  The most recent calculation of the maximum affordable sales price of a single-family home for a Bristol household of four at 80 percent of the area median income, provided by Rhode Island Housing. [For example, in July 2007 RIH calculated the maximum affordable sales price of a single-family home for a Bristol household of four earning 80 percent of the area median income to be $170,000.00.] 
iii.  As an example, based on the above variables, as of July 2007, the in-lieu fee would be $150,000.00 per inclusionary unit required. [($320,000.00 median sales price - $170,000.00 maximum affordable sales price.)] 
b.  All in-lieu fees are to be deposited into the Bristol Affordable Housing Trust Fund. Such funds may be expended or utilized only on the production of or rehabilitation of affordable housing units in Bristol. 
c.  Required in-lieu fees shall be paid prior to the issuance of building permits for the subdivision/development or in a manner directed by the planning board. For large projects developed in phases, a portion of the in-lieu fee may be deferred, at the planning board's discretion, until after the initial phase is complete, but before building permits are issued for a subsequent phase. 
(2)  In lieu of fee for a fraction of a unit. The applicant shall have the option of paying a cash-in-lieu of a fractional inclusionary unit, whereby the payment is calculated by multiplying the in-lieu fee for one unit, calculated as per subsection 28-370(e)(1)a. by the fraction resulting from applying the 25 percent requirement. This option is available when the calculation results in a fraction of less than 0.5. Fractions of 0.5 or greater shall be rounded up to the next highest whole number for the purpose of calculating the payment in lieu. [For example, an applicant proposing a five-lot subdivision would be required to provide two additional Inclusionary Units, based on rounding up the 1.25 number derived from multiplying six house lots by 0.25 to establish the 25 percent requirement. The example above estimates the per-unit in lieu fee at $150,000.00 as of January 2007. Based on that amount, an applicant would have the option of paying $150,000.00 multiplied by 1.25, or $187,500.00 in lieu of constructing the required inclusionary units. Another option would be to build one unit while also providing a payment of $150,000.00 multiplied by 0.25, or $37,500.00, for the second unit.] 
(f)  Off-site option. 
(1)  Off-site options. The planning board at its sole discretion may allow any developer of an inclusionary project to comply with the requirements of subsection 28-370(b) through one of the following off-site exactions: 
a.  Off-site rehabilitation of affordable units in existing buildings. 
b.  Off-site new construction of affordable units. 
c.  Donation of one or more parcels of land suitable for residential development to be held by the affordable housing trust fund. 
(2)  Conditions. Use of an off-site option shall be subject to the following conditions: 
a.  Any subdivision or land development project that utilizes an off-site option in place of developing the required affordable units on-site shall not be entitled to a dimensional incentive as described in subsection 28-370(d). 
b.  Off-site inclusionary units shall have a certificate of occupancy prior to, or simultaneous with the occupancy of any market rate units. 
c.  New off-site units shall be compatible in architectural style to the existing units in the surrounding neighborhood. 
d.  Renovated off-site units shall be in full compliance with all applicable construction and occupancy codes, and shall be sufficiently maintained or rehabilitated so that all major systems meet standards comparable to new construction. 
e.  The planning board in its sole discretion may further condition the use of any off-site option. 
(g)  Preference of options. 
(1)  Before considering the use of a payment in lieu or an off-site exaction, the planning board must first make a finding that it would be infeasible, as defined below, to develop the affordable units on-site because of environmental, public health, public safety, and/or regulatory reasons. 
(2)  Infeasible means any condition brought about by any single factor or combination of factors, as a result of limitations imposed on the development by conditions attached to the approval of the subdivision, to the extent that it makes it impossible for the applicant to proceed in building or operating low or moderate income housing without financial loss, within the limitations set by the subsidizing agency of government, on the size or character of the development, on the amount or nature of the subsidy, or on the tenants, rentals, and income permissible, and without substantially changing the rent levels and unit sizes proposed by applicant. 
(3)  The following is the town's preferred progression of affordable housing options: 
a.  First preference: Affordable units developed on-site. 
b.  Second preference: Payment of fee in-lieu to meet all or a portion of the inclusionary unit requirement. 
c.  Third preference: Off-site options: 
1.  Off-site rehabilitation of affordable units in existing buildings. 
2.  Off-site new construction of affordable units. 
3.  Donation of one or more parcels of land suitable for residential development to be held by the affordable housing trust fund. 
(h)  Affordability requirements. All affordable housing units constructed pursuant to this article must qualify as low- and moderate- income housing units as defined in RIGL Tit. 45, Ch. 53. To accomplish this, an applicant shall, at a minimum, make the following submission in conjunction with the final plan: 
(1)  A town approved monitoring service agreement, with a qualified organization; and, 
(2)  A town approved land lease and/or deed restriction that includes the town as a signatory, and grants to the town enforcement authority and the right to notice. 
(i)  Implementation of inclusionary unit provisions. Implementation procedures, to be developed administratively by the town and approved by the planning board as part of the town's subdivision and development review regulations, shall further describe the submission requirements and review timelines for the inclusionary housing plan and inclusionary housing agreement. 
ARTICLE X. - SIGNS[5] 

Footnotes: 
--- (5) --- 
Cross reference- Advertising, ch. 3. 

Sec. 28-371. - Purpose and intent. 
    The purpose of this article is to: 
(1)  Improve pedestrian and traffic safety; 
(2)  Encourage the effective use of signs as a means of communication and ensure that signs adequately identify uses and activities to the public; 
(3)  Preserve and enhance the town's character; protect property values; and maintain and improve the visual quality of commercial areas, which promotes the economic interests of the town, by requiring new and replacement signs which: 
a.  Are well-designed; 
b.  Are compatible with the surroundings; 
c.  Express the identity of the individual business owner; 
d.  Have a style and form which relate to the place of business; 
e.  Are of a size which is in scale with the building and the streetscape as a whole; and 
f.  Are appropriately sized in context, so as to be easily readable. 
Sec. 28-372. - Design guidelines. 
(a)  Signs are one of the most prominent visual elements of a street. Well-designed signs add interest and variety to building facades and help to attract customers. In general, the sign is the best representation of the business to the passing pedestrian or motorist. 
(b)  Before starting to design a sign, take a careful look at the building. Is there an obvious space on the building where the sign would look appropriate without covering architectural details? Some of the town's historic buildings were designed with a horizontal "sign space" stretching across the top of the storefront which should be used. If this "sign space" does not exist perhaps there is adequate wall area for a wall sign with a vertical character or a projecting sign. 
(c)  Take a look at neighboring buildings. Is there a predominant type of sign or a size precedent? In designing a sign, it is important to have an understanding not only of the building but also of the compatibility within the neighborhood. The basis for decisions on sign type, size and location should come from architectural concerns. The specific definitions and regulations governing the various types of signs in this article should be studied before actual design begins. For reference purposes, the department of community development has examples and illustrations of signs which also may be reviewed. 
(d)  To achieve the objectives of this article, the guidelines for sign details include the following: 
(1)  Simplicity. An effectively designed sign with bold, easily recognized symbols and clear crisp lettering will identify a business or activity efficiently and attractively, enhance the area in which it is located and complement the general appearance of the street and town. 
(2)  Color. Restraint should be exercised when selecting colors. On most signs, no more than three colors should be used: one for background, a contrasting color for lettering, and a third for perhaps emphasis (such as for borders, motifs, or shading letter to give it a three-dimensional look). Colors should be chosen which complement each other as well as the general tone of the building. 
(3)  Message. Messages should be simple for rapid comprehension by the public. Pictures, symbols, and logos can add individuality and character to signs, in addition to making them easier to read. 
(4)  Materials. Sign materials shall be compatible with the surrounding area. Sign materials shall be consistent with or at least complement the original construction material and architectural style of the building facade on which they are to be displayed. For these reasons, material such as wood and metal are more appropriate than plastic. Although the historic district commission encourages creativity which respects the historic surroundings, internally-lit plastic signs are usually out of context with the period and style of historic buildings and are therefore not allowed. 
(5)  Continuity of treatment. Signs on adjacent storefronts shall be coordinated in height and proportion.

The costs of such mediation shall be borne equally by both sides unless the mediator recommends otherwise. Alternate dispute resolution may occur prior to or during an appeal to court. 
(e)  Notice and order. Where a determination is made that a violation exists, the zoning enforcement officer shall immediately give written notice of the violation to the owner, said notice to be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, or hand delivered which may include posting the notice on the subject property, stating clearly what conditions violate what regulations and ordering the action necessary to correct it. All materials relating to such notice (including the underlying complaint) shall be public and shall be provided upon request, unless such public release would jeopardize an ongoing investigation.

Only five active members shall be entitled to vote on any issue. 
(2)  The concurring vote of three of the five members of the board sitting at a hearing shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision or determination of the historic district commission, the planning board, or any administrative officer or agency from whom an appeal was taken. 
(3)  The concurring vote of four of the five members of the board sitting at a hearing shall be required to decide in favor of an applicant on any matter within the discretion of the board upon which it is required to pass under this chapter, including variances and special use permits. 
(g)  Application procedure. Application procedures shall be adopted by the board for the filing of appeals, request for variances, special use permits, development plan review, site plan review and such other applications as may be specified in this chapter, and shall be prepared by the director of community development and published. 
(h)  Fees. Fees shall be required, in an amount established from time to time by the town council, to be paid by the appellant or applicant for the adequate review and hearing of applications, issuance of zoning certificates and the recording of the decisions thereon. 
(i)  Decisions and records of the zoning board of review. Following a public hearing, the board shall render a decision within 20 days. Every decision shall be based on findings of fact. The zoning board of review may not make any decisions that are inconsistent with the findings of other officials, unless the board makes their own findings, based on facts present in the record, that the findings of other officials are in clear error or clearly exceed their authority. The board shall include in its decision all findings of fact and conditions, showing the vote of each member participating thereon, and the absence of a member or his failure to vote. Decisions shall be recorded and filed in the office of the director of community development and posted in the town hall in a location visible to the public for a period of 20 days within 30 working days from the date when the decision was rendered, and shall be a public record. The board shall keep written minutes of its proceedings, showing the vote of each member upon each question, or if absent or failing to vote, indicating such fact and shall keep records of its examinations, findings of fact, and other official actions, all of which shall be recorded and filed in the office of the director of community development in an expeditious manner upon completion of the proceeding. For any proceeding in which the right of appeal lies to the superior or supreme court, the board shall have the proceedings taken by a competent stenographer. 
    Any decision by the board, including any special conditions attached thereto, shall be mailed to the applicant, to the planning board and to the associate director of the division of planning of the state department of administration. Any decision evidencing the granting of a variance, modification or special use shall also be recorded and indexed according to the affected lots in the land evidence records of the town by the zoning enforcement officer. In no case shall a building permit be issued prior to recording.

Sec. 28-409. - Variances and special use permits. 
(a)  Application. An application for relief from the literal requirements of this chapter because of hardship, or an application for a special use permit may be made by any person, group, agency or corporation, provided that the owner or owners of the subject property must join in any application by filing with the director of community development an application describing the request and supported by such data and evidence as may be required by the board and set forth in its written rules of procedure. An application from a corporation must be signed by its attorney or duly authorized officer of the corporation. The director of community development shall immediately transmit such application received to the board and shall transmit a copy of each application to the planning board. 
(b)  Hearing and notice. The zoning board shall immediately upon receipt of an application for a use variance or special use permit, request that the planning board report its findings and recommendations, including a statement on the general consistency of the application with the goals and purposes of the comprehensive plan of the town, in writing to the board. The planning board may, but need not, hold a public hearing on any such request to the zoning board not later than 30 days from receipt of the request by the planning board. The planning board may also delegate the review of such requests to its technical review committee pursuant to RIGL § 45-23-32(52). The zoning board shall hold a public hearing on any application for variance or special use permit in an expeditious manner after receipt in proper form of an application and the planning board recommendation, provided such recommendation is received within the specified 30 days. The zoning board shall give public notice thereof at least 14 days prior to the date of the hearing in a newspaper of general circulation in the town. Notice of this hearing, including at least the substance of the application and the street address of the subject property, shall be sent by first class mail to the applicant and to: 
(1)  All owners of real property whose property is located within 200 feet of the perimeter of the subject property, if any part of the subject property is located in the D, W, LB or R-6 zones; or 
(2)  All owners of real property whose property is located within 300 feet of the perimeter of the subject property, if any part of the subject property is located in any zone other than the zones set forth in subsection 28-409(b)(1) of this section; and 
(3)  To the town council of any town to which one or more of the following pertain: 
a.  Which is located within 200 or 300 feet, as set forth in subsections 28-409(b)(1) and (2) of this section, of the boundary of the subject property; or 
b.  Where there is a public or quasi-public water source, or private water source that is used or is suitable for use as a public water source, within 2,000 feet of any part of the subject property, regardless of municipal boundaries; and 
(4)  To the governing body of any state or municipal water department or agency, special water district, or private water company that has riparian rights to a surface water resource and/or surface watershed that is used, or is suitable for use, as a public water source and that is within 2,000 feet of any part of the subject property; provided, however, that the governing body of any state or municipal water company has filed with the director in the town a map survey, which shall be kept as a public record, showing areas of surface water resources and/or watersheds and parcels of land within 2,000 feet thereof. 
    Such notice as is required in subsections 28-409(b)(1) and (2) of this section shall be sent whether or not the noticed land is within the town or within an adjacent town. No defect in the form of any notice under this section shall render any variance, special use permit or decision on appeal, invalid, unless such defect is found to be intentional or misleading. 
(c)  Standards for relief. The following shall be standards for relief: 
(1)  Variance. In granting a variance, the board shall require that evidence to the satisfaction of the following standards be entered into the record of the proceedings: 
a.  That the hardship from which the applicant seeks relief is due to the unique characteristics of the subject land or structure and not to the general characteristics of the surrounding area, and not due to an economic disability of the applicant; 
b.  That such hardship is not the result of any prior action of the applicant and does not result primarily from the desire of the applicant to realize greater financial gain; 
c.  That the granting of the requested variance will not alter the general characteristic of the surrounding area or impair the intent or purpose of this chapter or the comprehensive plan of the town; 
d.  That the relief to be granted is the least relief necessary; 
e.  The board shall, in addition to the above standards, require that evidence be entered into the record of the proceedings showing that: 
1.  In granting a use variance, the subject land or structure cannot yield any beneficial use if it is required to conform to the provisions of this chapter. Nonconforming use of neighboring land or structures in the same district and permitted use of land or structures in an adjacent district shall not be considered grounds for granting a use variance; and 
2.  In granting a dimensional variance, that the hardship that will be suffered by the owner of the subject property if the dimensional variance is not granted shall amount to more than a mere inconvenience. The fact that a use may be more profitable or that a structure may be more valuable after the relief is granted shall not be grounds for relief. 
(2)  Special use permit. In granting a special use permit, the board shall require that evidence to the satisfaction of the following standards be entered into the record of the proceedings: 
a.  That the special use is specifically authorized by this chapter, and setting forth the exact section of this chapter containing the jurisdictional authorization; 
b.  That the special use meets all of the standards set forth in the subsection of this chapter (section 28-150) authorizing such special use; and 
c.  That the granting of the special use permit will not alter the general character of the surrounding area or impair the intent or purpose of this chapter or the comprehensive plan of the town. 
(d)  Special conditions. In granting a variance or special use permit, or in making any determination upon which it is required to pass after public hearing under this chapter, the board may apply such special conditions that may, in the opinion of the board, be required to promote the intent and purposes of the comprehensive plan of the town and this chapter. Failure to abide by any special conditions attached to a grant shall constitute a zoning violation. Such special conditions shall be based on competent credible evidence on the record, be incorporated into the decision and may include, but are not limited to, provisions for: 
(1)  Minimizing adverse impact of the development upon other land, including the type, intensity, design and performance of activities; 
(2)  Controlling the sequence of development, including when it must be commenced and completed; 
(3)  Controlling the duration of use or development and the time within which any temporary structure must be removed; 
(4)  Assuring satisfactory installation and maintenance of required public improvements; 
(5)  Designating the exact location and nature of development; and 
(6)  Establishing detailed records by submission of drawings, maps, plats or specifications. 
(e)  Dimensional variance in conjunction with special use permit. An applicant may apply for, and be issued, a dimensional variance in conjunction with a special use permit. If the special use could not exist without the dimensional variance, the zoning board of review shall consider the special use permit and the dimensional variance together to determine if granting the special use is appropriate based on both the special use criteria and the dimensional variance evidentiary standards. 
Sec. 28-410. - Appeals to the zoning board. 
(a)  Procedure. An appeal to the board from a decision of any other agency or officer (including the ZEO, the HDC and the planning board), may be taken by an aggrieved party. Such appeal shall be taken within 20 days of the date of the recording of the decision of the officer or agency, or within 20 days of the time when the aggrieved party knew or should have known of the action or decision of such officer or agency. The appeal shall be commenced by filing an application with the board, with a copy to the officer or agency from whom the appeal is taken, specifying the ground thereof; and, by mailing a copy of the appeal that is date stamped by the Town of Bristol to the owner and/or applicant of the premises by certified mail return receipt requested and by regular mail. The officer or agency from whom the appeal is taken shall forthwith transmit to the board all papers, including any transcript or audio tapes, constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken. Notice of the appeal shall also be transmitted to the planning board. 
(b)  Stay of proceedings. An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the officer or agency from whom the appeal is taken certifies to the board, after the appeal shall have been duly filed, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would in the officer's or agency's opinion cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed other than by a restraining order which may be granted by a court of competent jurisdiction on application thereof and upon notice to the officer or agency from whom the appeal is taken on due cause shown. 
(c)  Public hearing. The board shall hold a hearing of the appeal within 45 days of receipt of the application for an appeal, give public notice thereof in the same manner as set forth in subsection 28-409(b), as well as due notice to the parties of interest, and decide the same within 20 days of the close of the hearing. At the hearing, any party may appear in person or by agent or by attorney. In the case of an appeal, the agency or official from whom the appeal has been taken shall appear at the hearing to answer questions of the zoning board or present an argument in defense of the action appealed from, as the case may be. Where it is an agency, such as the planning board or the historic district commission, whose action is being appealed, such agency shall designate one member or staff person to represent it before the board. Other members of such agency may appear, but only in the capacity of private citizens. The cost of any notice required for the hearing shall be borne by the appellant. 
(d)  Decisions and records of the board. In exercising its powers in ruling, the board may, in conformity with the provisions of this chapter, reverse or affirm wholly or partly and may modify the order, requirement, decision or determination appealed from and may make such order, requirement, decision or determination as ought to be made, and to that end shall have the powers of the officer or agency from whom the appeal was taken. All decisions and records of the board respecting appeals shall conform to the provisions of subsection 28-407(i). 
Sec. 28-411. - Appeals to superior court. 
    An aggrieved party may appeal a decision of the board to the Superior Court for Providence and Bristol Counties by filing a complaint setting forth the reasons of appeal within 20 days after such decision has been recorded and posted in the office of the town clerk. The decision shall be posted in a location visible to the public in the town hall for a period of 20 days following the recording of the decision. The party taking the appeal shall notify all abutters in accordance with RIGL 45-24-69.1. The board shall file the original documents acted upon by it and constituting the record of the case appealed from, or certified copies thereof, together with such other facts as may be pertinent, with the clerk of the court within 30 days after being served with a copy of the complaint. When the complaint is filed by someone other than the original applicant or appellant, such original applicant or appellant and the members of the board shall be made parties to such proceedings. The appeal shall not stay proceedings upon the decision appealed from, but the court may, in its discretion, grant a stay on appropriate terms and make such other orders as it deems necessary for an equitable disposition of the appeal. 
Sec. 28-412. - Expiration of special use permit or variance and repetitive petitions. 
    Unless specifically granted by the board for a longer period of time, a special use permit or variance from the provisions of this chapter shall expire two years from the date granted by the board unless the applicant receives a building permit and commences construction, and diligently prosecutes the construction until completed or obtains a certificate of occupancy where no building permit is required. The board may extend a special use permit or variance for a period of one additional year at a time for good cause shown if a request is received in writing prior to expiration of the decision and voted on at a regular meeting of the board. No reapplication for a special use permit or variance shall be granted without a hearing as specified above. The board shall not accept a second appeal or application which is identical to an appeal or application, which has been adversely decided, for a period of two years from the date in which the decision is recorded and filed unless facts are presented to the board indicating a substantial and specific change in conditions or circumstances relating to the matter. 
Chapter 29 - SOIL EROSION, RUNOFF, AND SEDIMENT CONTROL[1] 
Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2009-14, adopted Nov. 28, 2009, amended Ch. 29 in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former Ch. 29, §§ 29-1-29-84, pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from Ord. No. 2005-60, 2-7-06. 

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 29-1. - Purpose. 
(a)  The town council hereby finds that excessive quantities of soil are eroding from certain areas that are undergoing development for nonagricultural uses, such as storage/filling, housing developments, commercial construction, industrial areas, recreational facilities, and roads. Much of this soil erosion is the result of poorly planned and implemented site grading and surface water runoff controls. This runoff and resulting erosion results in conflicts and/or damage with neighboring properties and their owners, and makes costly repairs to drainage structures, gullies, washed out fills, roads, and embankments necessary. The resulting sediment clogs the storm sewers, road ditches and muddies streams, leaves deposits of silt in ponds and reservoirs and is considered a major water pollutant. 
(b)  The purpose of this chapter is to prevent soil erosion, excessive surface water runoff, and sedimentation from occurring as a result of nonagricultural development within the town by requiring proper provisions for stormwater disposal and soil erosion during and after construction, in order to promote the safety, public health and general welfare of the town. 
(Ord. No. 2009-14, 11-28-09) 
Sec. 29-2. - Applicability. 
(a)  This chapter shall be applicable to any situation involving disturbance to the terrain (and its contours) and topsoil or vegetative ground cover upon any property within the town after determination of applicability by the building official, or his/her designee, or by the planning board when the development associated with the land disturbance is within its jurisdiction. In the cases within the planning board's jurisdiction, the planning board shall retain authority for the review and approval of all control measures associated with the land disturbing activity and the building official shall retain enforcement responsibilities based upon criteria outlined in section 29-3. 
(b)  Compliance with the requirements described herein shall not be construed to relieve the applicant of any obligations to obtain necessary state or federal permits. The building official shall notify appropriate state or federal agencies prior to issuance of a permit for a land-disturbing activity controlled by the provisions of this chapter. The failure of the building official to notify any necessary state or federal agency shall not void any permit issued hereunder. The term building official as used throughout this chapter means the building official or his/her designee. 
(Ord. No. 2009-14, 11-28-09) 
Sec. 29-3. - Determination of applicability. 
(a)  It shall be unlawful for any person to disturb any existing vegetation, grades, or contours of land in a manner which may increase the potential for soil erosion without first applying for a determination of applicability from the building official. Upon determination of applicability, the applicant shall submit a soil erosion, runoff and sediment control plan for approval to the building official or to the planning board as provided in section 29-26. The application for determination of applicability shall describe the location, nature, character, and time schedule of the proposed land-disturbing activity in sufficient detail to allow the building official to determine the potential for soil erosion, surface water runoff, and sedimentation resulting from the proposed project. In determining the applicability of this chapter to a particular land-disturbing activity, the building official or planning board shall consider site topography, drainage patterns, soils, proximity to watercourses, and other such information as deemed appropriate. A particular land-disturbing activity shall not be subject to the requirements of this chapter if the building official finds that erosion resulting from the land-disturbing activity is insignificant and represents no threat to adjacent properties or to the quality of any coastal feature, flood plain, or watercourse, as defined herein. The current Rhode Island Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook, prepared by the United States Department of Agriculture Natural Resource Conservation Service, the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management, and the Rhode Island State Conservation Committee shall be consulted in making this determination. Grading and filling on any lot shall require approval per this chapter unless exempted as listed below. 
(b)  No determination of applicability shall be required for the following: 
(1)  Construction, alteration, or use, of any additions to existing single-family or duplex homes or related accessory structures, provided the grounds coverage of such addition is less than 1,000 square feet, and such construction, alteration and use does not occur within 200 feet of any watercourse or coastal feature, and the slopes at the site of land disturbance do not exceed ten percent. 
(2)  Use of a home garden in association with onsite residential use. 
(3)  Accepted agricultural management practices such as seasonal tilling and harvest activities associated with property utilized for private and/or commercial agricultural or silvicultural purposes; 
(4)  Excavations for improvements other than those described in subsection (b)(1) above which exhibit all of the following characteristics: 
a.  Does not result in a total displacement of more than 50 cubic yards of material; 
b.  Has no slopes steeper than ten feet vertical in 100 feet horizontal or approximately ten percent; and 
c.  Has all disturbed surface areas properly and effectively protected to prevent soil erosion and sedimentation. 
(5)  Grading and filling, as a maintenance measure, or for landscaping purposes on existing developed land parcels or lots, provided that all bare surfaces are immediately seeded, sodded, or otherwise protected from erosive actions, and all of the following conditions are met: 
a.  The aggregate area of such activity does not exceed 2,000 square feet, and 
b.  The change of elevation does not exceed two feet at any point; and 
c.  Has no slopes steeper than ten feet vertical in 100 feet horizontal or approximately ten percent; and 
d.  The total grading does not involve a quantity of fill greater than 18 cubic yards. 
(6)  Grading, filling, removal or excavation activities and operations undertaken by the town under the direction and supervision of the director of public works for work on streets, roads or rights-of-way dedicated to public use, provided, however, that adequate and acceptable erosion, runoff and sediment controls are incorporated in engineering plans and specifications and employed. Appropriate erosion controls shall apply prior to and during construction as well as after completion of such activities. All such work shall be undertaken in accordance with the performance principles provided for in section 29-59 and such standards and definitions as may be adopted to implement said performance principles. 
(Ord. No. 2009-14, 11-28-09)

All work shall be performed in accordance with an inspection and construction control schedule approved by the building official, who shall maintain a permanent file of all inspections. Upon completion of the work, the applicant shall notify the building official that all grading, drainage, erosion and sediment control measures and devices, and vegetation and ground cover planting has been completed in conformance with the approved plans, specifications, conditions, and other applicable provisions of this chapter. 
(b)  Final inspection. Upon such notification of the completion by the owner, the building official shall make a final inspection of the site and shall prepare a final summary inspection report of findings, which shall be retained in the building official's files and in the department of public works permanent inspections file. The building official shall not issue a final certificate of occupancy for any building until such time that a final inspection has been made and all work has been completed in accordance with the permit and approved plans. In the event that site work cannot be completed prior to the need for a certificate of occupancy, the building official may require the posting of a guarantee deposit as outlined in section 29-81 to ensure that site work is completed in accordance with the permit and approved plans. In the instance where a performance bond has been posted with the recording of a final subdivision, the bond shall not be fully released until such time that the building official has notified the planning board administrative officer of successful completion of all permit requirements. 
(c)  Ongoing inspections shall be conducted by the town in accordance with a maintenance agreement between the town and the owner as outlined in section 29-62. 
(Ord. No. 2009-14, 11-28-09) 
Sec. 29-34. - Notification. 
    If at any stage, the work in progress and/or completed under the terms of an approved erosion, runoff and sediment control plan does not conform to such plan, a written notice from the building official, to comply, shall be transmitted by certified mail to the owner. Such notice shall set forth the nature of the temporary and permanent corrections required and the time limit within which corrections shall be completed. Failure to comply with the required corrections within the specified time limit shall be considered in violation of this chapter, in which case the performance bond or guarantee deposit shall be subject to notice of default, in accordance with section 29-82. 
(Ord. No. 2009-14, 11-28-09) 
Sec. 29-35. - Appeals. 
    If the ruling made by the building official is unsatisfactory to the applicant, the applicant may file a written appeal with the zoning board within ten days of the decision. Appeal procedures shall follow current requirements for appeal to the zoning board. During the period in which the request for appeal is filed, and until such time as a final decision is rendered on the appeal, the decision of the building official shall remain in effect. The zoning board may seek technical assistance on any soil erosion, runoff and sediment control plan. Such expert opinion must be made available in the office of the building official as a public record prior to the appeals hearing.

ARTICLE III. - SOIL EROSION, RUNOFF AND SEDIMENT CONTROL PLAN 

Sec. 29-57. - Plan preparation. 
    The soil erosion, runoff and sediment control plan shall be prepared by a registered professional engineer, a soil and water conservation society certified professional in erosion and sediment control, or a registered landscape architect as may be appropriate for the specific issues involved with the plan. Five copies of the plan and permit application shall be submitted to the building official. 
(Ord. No. 2009-14, 11-28-09) 
Sec. 29-58. - Plan contents. 
    The soil erosion, runoff and sediment control plan shall include sufficient information about the proposed activities and land parcel(s) to form a clear basis for discussion and review and to assure compliance with all applicable requirements of this chapter. The plan shall be consistent with the data collection, data analysis, land plan preparation guidelines in the current Rhode Island Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook, prepared by the United States Department of Agriculture, Natural Resource Conservation Service, Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management, Rhode Island State Conservation Committee, and at a minimum shall contain: 
(1)  A narrative describing the proposed land-disturbing activity and the soil erosion, sediment and stormwater management measures to be installed to control erosion that could result from the proposed activity. Supporting documentation, such as a drainage area, existing site, and soil maps shall be provided as required by the building official. 
(2)  Construction drawings illustrating in detail existing and proposed contours at least every two feet, drainage features, vegetation, limits of clearing and grading; the location of nearby municipal and/or private drainage structures such as catch basins and detention basins, the location of soil erosion and sediment control and stormwater management measures, stock piles and borrow areas; sequence and staging of land-disturbing activities; and other such information needed for construction. 
(3)  Other information, storm drainage computations and/or construction plans and details as deemed necessary by the building official for thorough review of the plan prior to action being taken as prescribed in this chapter. Withholding or delaying submission of such information may be reasons for the building official to judge the application incomplete and grounds for disapproval. 
(4)  Best management practices. Identify the type of BMP(s) employed both during and post construction and justification for selection, including any deviation from the Rhode Island Stormwater Design and Installation Standards Manual, as amended, and the potential effect on pollutant removal efficiency. The technical feasibility of BMP's including sizing, location, hydraulic and environmental impacts. Alternatives, which were considered but determined not to be feasible, should also be discussed. Maintenance schedule of BMP's to be used, both during and post-construction including frequency of inspection and maintenance. 
(Ord. No. 2009-14, 11-28-09) 
Sec. 29-59. - Performance principles. 
    The contents of the soil erosion, runoff and sediment control plan shall clearly demonstrate how the principles, outlined below, have been met in the design and are to be accomplished by the proposed development project. 
(1)  Due regard for natural drainage characteristics, topography and soils shall be indicated. 
(2)  To the extent possible, steep slopes (those in excess of ten percent) shall be avoided. 
(3)  The grade of slopes created shall be minimized. 
(4)  a.  Post-development runoff rates will not exceed pre-development rates for a 25-year storm. Any increase in storm runoff volume should be retained and recharged, as close as feasible, to its place of origin by means of detention ponds or basins, seepage areas, subsurface drains, porous paving, or similar low impact development techniques. 
b.  For any properties located within the watershed of the Tanyard Brook (as depicted on the plan titled Tanyard Brook Watershed prepared for the Town of Bristol by Beta Group, Inc.), all increase in stormwater runoff volume, up to and including the ten-year storm event, shall be retained on site to the maximum reasonable extent. This may be achieved through the use of infiltration systems, retention ponds, roof runoff directed to drywells, and driveway runoff directed to grassed areas as opposed to local roadways. Site conditions such as a high groundwater elevation, ledge, poor soils, or the presence of contaminants that limit or prohibit the ability to recharge runoff to the subsurface shall be considered to determine the reasonableness of the applicant's proposal. For increases in runoff volume beyond what is determined can reasonably be retained on site, the applicant may in lieu of compliance with the above requirements be permitted to perform off-site drainage improvements or contribute to a dedicated account to fund drainage improvements within the watershed. Site conditions which limit or prohibit on-site mitigation shall be verified by the town's engineering consultant. The location, scope and relative value of proposed off-site drainage improvements shall be verified by the town's engineering consultant and approved by the director of public works. Payments to the dedicated drainage account shall be calculated at a rate of $2.00 per square foot of new impervious surface created, and may be reduced by the amount of impervious areas for which runoff volumes have been retained on-site. 
(5)  Original boundaries, alignment and slope of watercourses within the project locus shall be preserved to the greatest extent feasible. 
(6)  Storm drainage (including driveways) shall be directed away from structures intended for human occupancy, municipal or utility use, or similar purposes. Where the elevation of a building lot is below that of adjacent public roadways, methods such as a bituminous asphalt berm should be employed to prevent roadway stormwater runoff from entering the lot. 
(7)  All drainage provisions shall be of such a design and capacity so as to adequately address stormwater runoff, including runoff from tributary upstream areas which may be outside the locus of the project. 
(8)  Drainage facilities shall be installed as early as feasible during construction and, if possible prior to site clearing, and must be installed and capable of being operational prior to increase in impervious area. 
(9)  Fill located adjacent to watercourses shall be adequately protected from erosion by means of rip-rap, gabions, retaining walls, sediment control fencing, vegetative stabilization, or similar measures. 
(10)  Adjacent properties and roadways shall be protected from sediment and changes to runoff rate and location during construction through the use of sediment control fencing or other appropriate barriers and dedicated construction entrances with wheel cleaning stone blankets to prevent sediment from being transported off site. Nearby drainage inlets should also be protected from silt-laden runoff through the use of filter fabric or other appropriate means to prevent silt and sediments from entering existing drainage systems. 
(11)  Silt fencing, temporary vegetation and or mulching shall be used to contain bare areas and stockpiles from erosion during construction. The smallest areas feasible shall be exposed at any one time and disturbed areas shall be protected during the non-growing months (November through March). 
(12)  Permanent stabilizing vegetation shall be planted immediately following fine grading. 
(13)  Trees and other existing vegetation shall be retained whenever feasible. The area within the drip line shall be fenced or roped off to protect trees from construction equipment. 
(14)  All areas damaged during construction shall be re-sodded, re-seeded or otherwise restored. 
(15)  Elevation of building in relation to abutting town street. The top of foundation for all new buildings will be constructed at or above the existing centerline grade of the abutting street to ensure that surface water runoff from the street will not negatively impact the property. Therefore, in all new construction, the elevation of the top of the foundation shall not be below the elevation of the centerline of the abutting road, unless, either (a) a grading and drainage plan is submitted to address the runoff from the road onto the property and ensures there are no adverse impacts to adjacent property from the proposed site grading; or (b) the property owner records a deed restriction and indemnity agreement that stormwater runoff from the street onto the property is not the responsibility of the town. 
(Ord. No. 2009-14, 11-28-09) 
Sec. 29-60. - Technical standards. 
    All applicants for qualifying development activity must develop and submit a proposed plan as outlined in section 29-58 which must meet all the requirements of this chapter. All such measures shall be consistent with the Rhode Island Stormwater Design and Installation Standards Manual and the Rhode Island Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook, as amended. The plan must include a description of proposed best management practices (BMP's), detailed site plans, and a written narrative, that when implemented, provides protection of receiving waters by reducing pollutant loadings and other negative impacts associated with changes in land use as described below. Structural BMPs are described as structural stormwater devices that temporarily detain and treat stormwater runoff in order to reduce pollutant loadings. Typical BMPs include wet ponds, extended detention ponds, infiltration trenches, created wetlands, grassed swales and the like. 
(1)  Performance standards. A plan must incorporate best management practices for water quality control, which in combination are demonstrated to reduce the average annual total suspended solids in post development runoff by 80 percent. Development in drinking water supply watersheds or watersheds where impaired waters as defined by the State's 303(d) list exists may be held to higher standards. 
(2)  Disallowed stormwater best management practices. The placement of structural BMP's and other stormwater structures within a floodplain shall be avoided. If there is no alternative, the applicant must show what effects, if any, the tail waters created by the floodplain will have on the outflow and effective storage capacity of the detention facility. 
(3)  Facilitation of maintenance. Facilities that require maintenance shall be designed to minimize the need for regular maintenance, facilitate required maintenance, and ensure accessibility of components that require maintenance. At a minimum, all Stormwater Management Plans must incorporate structural BMP's with appropriate maintenance design in accordance with the Rhode Island Stormwater Design and Installation Standards Manual, as amended; or the Rhode Island Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook, as amended. 
(Ord. No. 2009-14, 11-28-09) 
Sec. 29-61. - Maintenance requirements for best management practices. 
(a)  Routine maintenance and repair procedures. Preventative maintenance procedures are required to maintain the intended operation and safe condition of the structural BMP's by greatly reducing the occurrence of problems and malfunctions. To be effective, preventative maintenance shall be performed on a regular basis and include such routine procedures as training staff, periodic inspections, grass cutting elimination of mosquito breeding habitats, and pond maintenance. Disposal of sediment and debris must occur on a regular basis (unless otherwise specified within an approved plan), at suitable disposal sites or recycling sites and comply with applicable local, state and federal regulations. Corrective maintenance procedures are required to correct a problem or malfunction at a stormwater management facility and to restore the facility's intended operation and safe condition. Based on the severity of the problem, corrective maintenance must be performed on an as-needed or emergency basis and include such procedures as structural repairs, removal of debris, sediment and trash removal which threaten discharge capacity, erosion repair, snow and ice removal, fence repair, mosquito extermination, and restoration of vegetated and nonvegetated linings. 
(b)  General maintenance standards for stormwater best management practices. Maintenance design and maintenance procedures for all structural BMP's shall be in accordance with Rhode Island Stormwater Design and Installation Standards Manual, as amended; or the Rhode Island Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook, as amended. Maintenance plans shall demonstrate appropriate maintenance design and procedures for each proposed best management practice. A maintenance schedule for each type of structural BMP must be included in the plan. These schedules shall list the frequency and type of maintenance operations necessary along with the legally responsible party's name, address and telephone number. If the stormwater drainage system is to be deeded to the local municipality the applicant must obtain a letter from the municipality acknowledging maintenance responsibility and intent of ownership. 
(Ord. No. 2009-14, 11-28-09) 
Sec. 29-62. - Maintenance agreements. 
    Maintenance agreements between the landowners and the town shall provide written, contractual documentation, which demonstrates compliance with this article and legal arrangements for the upkeep of the structural BMP's to assure their functionality and safety in accordance with this article. Maintenance agreements shall be approved by the director of public works and the town solicitor and recorded in the land evidence records. Maintenance agreements, which describe all maintenance schedules and requirements, must be developed for each structural BMP unless the facility is dedicated to and accepted by the town. 
(1)  Recognition of municipal inspection requirements. Maintenance agreements shall require landowners to conduct on-site inspections and maintenance of the structural BMPs on a reasonable and regular schedule. Maintenance agreements shall also allow the town to conduct on-site inspections of the functionality and safety of the structural BMPs when, at the discretion of town officials, inspections are not undertaken in accordance with the schedule, inspections are incomplete, or a problem with maintenance is suspected. Inspection schedules shall be based on the complexity and frequency of maintenance needs and shall be subject to the approval of the town in conjunction with the maintenance agreement. At a minimum, maintenance frequency should be in accordance with the Rhode Island Stormwater Design and Installation Standards Manual, as amended. 
(2)  Recordkeeping for maintenance activities. Maintenance agreements shall include provisions for maintenance recordkeeping by the landowners. All activities conducted in accordance with a maintenance agreement must be recorded in a work order and inspection log. Timely updates of the log shall be the responsibility of the structural BMP's owner or other responsible party pursuant to this article. A maintenance and inspection report shall be filed annually with the director of public works. Review of the maintenance and inspection log shall be completed by the town to determine the effectiveness of the operation, maintenance and safety activities. Additional reports shall be made as deemed appropriate by the town. 
(3)  Responsibility for maintenance to assure functionality and safety. Appropriate maintenance to assure functionality and safety of the structural BMP's shall be the responsibility of the landowners or may be assumed by another party via a written contractual arrangement in accordance. Any arrangement with a third party shall be subject to the review and approval of the director of public works. 
(4)  Alterations to maintenance agreements. Any alterations in maintenance responsibility or alterations to maintenance agreements must be reviewed and approved by the director of public works. If portions of the land serviced by a structural BMP are to be sold, written contractual arrangements shall be made to pass all responsibility of the maintenance agreement to the purchaser and shall be subject to review and approval of the director of public works. All alterations to maintenance agreements shall be recorded in accordance with this article. 
(5)  Recordation of maintenance agreements. All maintenance agreements and alterations to maintenance agreements shall be recorded in the land evidence records of the town. Copies of all maintenance agreements and alterations to maintenance agreements shall be included with the maintenance plan. Recordation of maintenance agreements in accordance with this article shall be the responsibility of the landowner.

ARTICLE IV. - ENFORCEMENT 

Sec. 29-81. - Performance guarantee. 
    In the event that site work cannot be completed prior to the need for a certificate of occupancy, the building official may require the posting of a guarantee deposit to ensure that site work is completed in accordance with the permit and approved plans. The amount of such performance guarantee shall be determined by the public works director or in his/her absence, the building official and shall be sufficient to cover the cost of completing all erosion and sediment control measures shown on the plan. In the instance where a performance bond has been posted with the recording of a final subdivision, the bond shall not be fully released until such time that the building official has notified the planning board administrative officer of successful completion of all permit requirements. The posting of such bond as part of the subdivision performance bond does not, however, relieve the owner of any requirement(s) of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 2009-14, 11-28-09) 
Sec. 29-82. - Notice of default on performance guarantee. 
(a)  Whenever the building official shall find that default has occurred in the performance of any term(s) or condition(s) of the guarantee deposit or bond or in the implementation of measures secured by the bond, written notice thereof shall be made to the applicant and to the surety of the bond by the town administrator. Such notice shall state the nature of default, work to be done, the estimated cost thereof, and the period of time deemed by the building official to be reasonably necessary for the completion of such work. 
(b)  Failure of the applicant to acknowledge and comply with the provisions and deadlines outlined in such notice of default shall result in action by the town administrator, without further notice of proceedings whatsoever, to utilize the guarantee deposit or performance bond to cause the required work to be completed by the town, by contract or by other appropriate means as determined by the town administrator. 
(Ord. No. 2009-14, 11-28-09) 
Sec. 29-83. - Violations. 
    The approval of an erosion, runoff and sediment control plan under this chapter may be revoked or suspended only by the building official. All work on the project may be halted for an indefinite time period by the building official after written notification is transmitted (by the building official) to the applicant for one or more of the following reasons: 
(1)  Violation of any condition of the approved plan, conditions or specifications pertaining thereto; 
(2)  Violation of any provision of this chapter or any other applicable law, ordinance, rule or regulation related to the work or work site; and 
(3)  The existence of any condition or the performance of any act constituting or creating a nuisance, hazard, or endangerment to human life or the property of others, or contrary to the spirit or intent of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 2009-14, 11-28-09) 
Sec. 29-84. - Penalty. 
(a)  Whenever there is a failure to comply with the provisions of this chapter, the town shall have the right to notify the applicant that he/she has five days from the receipt of notice to temporarily correct the violations and 30 days from receipt of notice to permanently correct the violations. 
(b)  Should the applicant fail to take the temporary corrective measures within the five-day period and the permanent corrective measures within the 30-day period, the town shall then have the right to take whatever actions it deems necessary to correct the violations and to assert a lien on the subject property in an amount equal to the cost of remedial actions. 
(c)  The lien shall be enforced in the manner provided by law for the enforcement of common law liens on personal property. The lien shall be recorded with the records of land evidence of the town, and the lien shall incur legal interest in the amount of the prime rate plus one percent from the date of recording. 
(d)  The imposition of any penalty shall not exempt the offender from compliance with the provisions of this chapter, including revocation of the performance bond or assessment of a lien on the property by the town.
