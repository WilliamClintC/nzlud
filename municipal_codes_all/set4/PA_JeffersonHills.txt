§ 1-813. Fees Authorized. [Ord. 655, 4/10/1995, § III; as amended by
Ord. 685, 5/11/1998]
Fees shall be in an amount as established from time to time by resolution of
Borough Council.
1. The Borough Council finds that the increasing costs of providing
adequate fire prevention and protection services, and other public
safety and emergency services, including services resulting from
extraordinary and dangerous occurrences and hazardous material
incidents, seriously impairs the Borough's ability to provide all
necessary Borough services.
2. In order to better protect the public health, safety and welfare and to
protect and preserve public funds and tax dollars, the Borough hereby
adopts a policy of reimbursement of its expenses and costs incurred
while providing such services.
1. The chief of the volunteer fire company rendering the service shall
collect all fees for fire prevention and protection services and for other
public safety and emergency services. Such fees may include and
encompass all manpower, equipment, materials, maintenance and
overhead expenses and costs which shall constitute full reimbursement
to the Borough for such services actually rendered and as hereinafter
authorized.
2. Within 30 days of the date of providing fire prevention and protection
services or other public safety and emergency services as enumerated
in § 813, the chief of the volunteer fire company rendering the service
shall submit a bill for all costs, fees, charges and expenses related to
the provision of such services to the property owner or the property
owner's designated agent or representative. All such bills shall be paid
in full within 60 days of the receipt thereof, and interest shall
accumulate thereafter on any unpaid balance at the rate of 10% per
annum until paid.
3. In addition, any bills, fines or penalties including, but not limited to,
cleanup costs, fees or expenses, that are imposed upon the Borough or
its volunteer fire companies by any local, State or Federal agency and
relate to the same situation or occurrence for which the Borough or its
volunteer fire company may be included in the billing or may be billed
separately within 30 days of receipt and shall be paid as provided in
§ 1-812(2), above.

amended by Ord. 685, 5/11/1998; and by Ord. 744, 6/9/2003, § 2]
1. No insurance company, association or exchange (hereinafter "insurer")
doing business in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania shall pay a claim
of a named insured for fire damage to a structure located within the
Borough where the amount recoverable for the fire loss to the structure
under all policies exceeds $7,500, unless the insurer is furnished by the
Borough Treasurer with a certificate pursuant to 508(b) of the
Insurance Company Law of 1921, as amended by Act 98 of 1992 and Act
93 of 1994 (collectively, the "Act") and unless there is compliance with
the procedures set forth in 508(c) and (d) of the Act.
2. Where there are delinquent taxes, assessments, penalties or user
charges against the property ("municipal claims"), or there are
expenses which the Borough has incurred as a cost for the removal,
repair or securing of a building or other structure on the property
(collectively "municipal expenses"), the President of Council or
designated officer of the Borough shall immediately render a bill for
such work, if he has not already done so. Upon written request of the
named insured specifying the tax description of the property, the name
and address of the insurer and the date of receipt by the insurer of a
loss report of the claim, the Treasurer shall furnish a certificate within
14 working days after the request, to the insurer, a certificate (or at his
discretion an oral notice confirmed in writing) either:
A. Stating that there are no unpaid municipal claims or municipal
expenses against the property; or
B. Specifying the nature and amount of such claims or expenses,
accompanied by a bill for such amounts.
Taxes, assessments, penalties and user charges shall be deemed
delinquent for this purpose if a lien could have been filed for
such claims under applicable law. Upon receipt of a certificate and
bill pursuant to Subsection 2A of this section, the insurer shall
transfer to the Treasurer an amount from the insurance proceeds
sufficient to pay such sums prior to making payment to the named
insured, subject to the provisions of Subsection 3 hereof.
3. When all municipal claims and municipal expenses have been paid
pursuant to Subsection 2 of this section, or where the Treasurer has
issued a certificate described in Subsection 2A indicating that there are
no municipal claims or municipal expenses against the property, the
insurer shall pay the claim of the named insured; provided, however,
that if the loss agreed upon by the named insured and the insurer
equals or exceeds 60% of the aggregate limits of liability on all fire
§ 1-901 FOREWORD § 1-901
FWD:59
policies covering the building or structure, the following procedures
must be followed:
A. The insurer shall transfer from the insurance proceeds to the
Treasurer, in the aggregate, $2,000 for each $15,000 of such claim
or fraction thereof.
B. If at the time a loss report is submitted by the insured, such insured
has submitted to the insurer, with a copy to the Borough, a
contractor's signed estimate of the cost of removing, repairing or
securing the building or other structure in an amount less than the
amount calculated under the foregoing transfer formula, the
insurer shall transfer to the Treasurer from the insurance proceeds
the amount specified in the estimate. If there is more than one
insurer, the transfer of proceeds shall be on a pro rata basis by all
insurers insuring the building or other structure.
C. Upon receipt of the above described portion of the insurance
proceeds, the Treasurer shall do the following:
(1) Place the proceeds in a separate fund to be used solely as
security against the total municipal expenses anticipated by
the Borough to be required in removing, repairing or securing
the building or structure as required by this Part. Such costs
shall include, without limitation, any engineering, legal or
administrative costs incurred by the Borough in connection
with such removal, repair or securing or any proceedings
related thereto; and,
(2) Mail to the named insured, at the address received from the
insurer, a notice the proceeds have been received by the
Borough and that the procedures under this subsection shall
be followed.
(3) After the transfer, the named insured may submit to the
Borough a contractor's signed estimate of the cost of
removing, repairing or securing the building or other
structure, in which event the Treasurer shall, if such estimate
is deemed by the Treasurer to be reasonable, return to the
insured the amount of the funds transferred to the Borough in
excess of that required to pay the municipal expenses;
provided, the Borough has not commenced to remove, repair
or secure the building or other structure, in which case the
Borough will complete the work.
(4) Pay to the President of Council or designated officer, for
reimbursement to the Borough General Fund, the amount of
the municipal expenses paid by the Borough.
(5) Pay the remaining balance in the fund (without interest) to the
named insured upon receipt of a certificate issued by the
President of Council or designated officer that the repair,

official an insured under a policy of insurance or to create an obligation to

From and after the effective date of this Part, the Council of the Borough
of Jefferson Hills shall constitute and be the forum for the hearing and
determination of heart and lung benefits under the provisions of the Heart
and Lung Act, the Act of May 31, 1974, P.L. 309, No. 99, as amended,
53 P.S. § 637, and all claims authorized under the provisions of the Act
shall be administered and determined by the Council of the Borough of
Jefferson Hills, except that in the event that a determination shall be made
by the Council of the Borough of Jefferson Hills that a police officer shall
be terminated or dismissed because of his inability to perform his duties
in accordance with the civil service provisions of the Borough Code, and
such officer has appealed the termination to the Civil Service Commission
of the Borough and such officer has made claims under the Heart and
Lung Act because of his disability, then the Civil Service Commission of the
Borough shall be authorized and empowered to hear such heart and lung
claim, but only in that case. Nothing contained herein shall be construed
so as to authorize or impose any responsibility for the determination or
administration of Worker's Compensation claims upon the Council.
§ 1-1002. Quorum of Council Must be Present in Order to Hold
Hearing. [Ord. 656, 4/10/1995, § 1; as amended by Ord. 741, 12/30/

For purposes of the administration of this Part, a quorum of the Council
of the Borough of Jefferson Hills shall be considered a sufficient forum for
the determination of whether or not benefits should be payable under the
Heart and Lung Act, and the vote of the majority of the quorum present be
sufficient to render a decision. A stenographic record of the proceedings
shall be kept at the expense of the Borough, which record is to be sealed
and shall not be released to any member of the public or to any persons
other than the Council persons of the Borough of Jefferson Hills, the
Secretary of the Borough, the Solicitor of the Borough, or such persons
acting in the capacities of the Borough Secretary or Solicitor, unless the
police officer shall, in writing, authorize the release of such transcript to
any other person. Provided further, however, that nothing contained herein
shall restrict the right of the Borough to use such records in any court
proceedings and appeals, or to provide them to the Worker's Compensation
carrier responsible for the payment of Worker's Compensation benefits to
employees of the Borough.
§ 1-1003. Decision of Council. [Ord. 656, 4/10/1995, § 3]

Law, the Act of April 28, 1978, P.L. 202, No. 53, as amended, and all
provisions stated therein shall be observed, unless the same shall be in
direct conflict with the provisions of this Part insofar as the same relates
to the confidentiality of the stenographic record. Following the hearings,
the Council shall make its decision in writing, which shall briefly describe
its reasons for the adjudication, its findings of fact and conclusions of
law. The decision shall be rendered no later than 30 days from the date
of the hearing, and shall be forwarded by first class mail to the police
officer making any such claims. Prior to any such hearing, and upon the
presentation of a claim or demand by a police officer, such police officer
shall submit in writing a concise statement of all facts or circumstances
which the police officer deems to be relevant to his or her claim and shall
submit any medical documentation to any physicians attending such police
officer which shall detail the nature of the injury and whether or not the
same is causally connected to the injury and whether or not the same is
causally connected to the claimed disability of the police officer, and shall
specifically indicate that the disability is job related or was incurred while
on duty. To the extent that the disabilities of any police officer have been
the basis of a claim for Worker's Compensation benefits, the standards of
proof requiring causal connection between the employment and the injury
which have been developed through Worker's Compensation cases shall
apply to the Heart and Lung Act cases where the issue of whether disability
is work related is involved. The Borough may seek further evidence of
the claimant's disability, and may require the claimant to appear before a
physician of the Borough's choice for examination. The failure of refusal
of the police officer or claimant to submit such documentation or yield to
such examinations in a timely manner shall be the basis for dismissal of all
such claims. Witnesses may be subpoenaed pursuant to the subpoena power
contained in the Borough Code.

afforded reasonable opportunities, at the discretion of the custodial
officer, to contact responsible persons who can, after accepting custody
for the defendant, serve to abate the peril to the personal security of
any person or endangerment to public or private property posed by the
defendant's conduct.

hazard areas (SFHAs) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and the
accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs), dated
September 26, 2014, and issued by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA), or the most-recent revision thereof,
including all digital data developed as part of the Flood Insurance
Study.
2. The above-referenced FIS and FIRMs, and any subsequent revisions
and amendments, are hereby adopted by Borough of Jefferson Hills and
declared to be a part of this chapter.
1. The identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific
areas:
A. The Floodway Area shall be those areas identified in the FIS and
the FIRM as floodway and which represent the channel of a
watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in
order to discharge the base flood without increasing the water
surface elevation by more than one foot at any point. This term
shall also include floodway areas which have been identified in
other available studies or sources of information for those special
flood hazard areas where no floodway has been identified in the FIS
and FIRM.
(1) Within any Floodway Area, no encroachments, including fill,
new construction, substantial improvements, or other
development, shall be permitted unless it has been
demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
performed in accordance with standard engineering practice
that the proposed encroachment would not result in any
increase in flood levels within the community during the
occurrence of the base flood discharge.
(2) Within any Floodway Area, no new construction or
development shall be allowed, unless the appropriate permit is
obtained from the Department of Environmental Protection's
regional office.

§ 8-403. Changes in Identification of Area. [Ord. 843, 9/8/2014]
The identified floodplain area may be revised or modified by the Council
where studies or information provided by a qualified agency or person
documents the need for such revision. However, prior to any such change
to the special flood hazard area, approval must be obtained from FEMA.
Additionally, as soon as practicable, but not later than six months after the
date such information becomes available, a community shall notify FEMA
of the changes to the special flood hazard area by submitting technical
or scientific data. See § 8-501, Subsection 2, for situations where FEMA
notification is required.
§ 8-404. Boundary Disputes. [Ord. 843, 9/8/2014]
Should a dispute concerning any identified floodplain boundary arise, an
initial determination shall be made by the Borough of Jefferson Hills, and
any party aggrieved by this decision or determination may appeal to the
Council. The burden of proof shall be on the appellant.

Prior to development occurring in areas where annexation or other
corporate boundary changes are proposed or have occurred, the community
B. The AE Area/District shall be those areas identified as an AE Zone
on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base
flood elevations have been provided.
(1) The AE Area adjacent to the floodway shall be those areas
identified as an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS
prepared by FEMA for which base flood elevations have been
provided and a floodway has been delineated.
C. The A Area/District shall be those areas identified as an A Zone on
the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no
base flood elevations have been provided. For these areas,
elevation and floodway information from other federal, state, or
other acceptable sources shall be used when available. Where
other acceptable information is not available, the base flood
elevation shall be determined by using the elevation of a point on
the boundary of the identified floodplain area which is nearest the
construction site.
In lieu of the above, the municipality may require the applicant to
determine the elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering
techniques. Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken

hardship, the Administrator may make such special reasonable
exceptions thereto, upon recommendation from the Engineer, as
will not be contrary to the public interest, and may impose such
conditions as it deems necessary to adequately protect the public
interest.
1. Whenever the Borough Council, upon the recommendation of its
Administrator or Engineer, determines that any existing excavation,
embankment or fill has become a hazard as defined in § 9-104, the
owner of the property upon which the excavation, embankment or fill is
located, or other person or agent in control of said property, upon
receipt of notice in writing from the administrator, shall, within the
reasonable period specified therein, apply for an earth disturbance
permit that specifies the repair, reconstruction or removal of such
excavation, embankment or fill so as to eliminate the hazard.
2. If, after such notification, the property owner has not made the
necessary repairs within the time adopted, then the Borough Council
may direct government employees or an agent acting on the behalf of
the Borough to make the required repairs and the cost thereof shall be
borne by the property owner by a lien filed as provided by law.
1. The Administrator shall receive all applications and shall collect all
fees. The Administrator shall transmit all applications to the Borough
Engineer, who shall indicate approval thereon. In the event of
disapproval, the Borough Engineer shall note the reasons therefore, a
copy of which shall be sent the applicant.
2. Before issuance of any minor earth disturbance permit, the applicant

§ 9-112. Expiration of Permit; Extension. [Ord. 767, 3/14/2005,
§ 212]
Every grading permit shall expire by limitation and become null and void
if the work authorized by such permit has not been commenced within
three months or is not completed within one year from the date of issue;
provided that the Administrator, acting upon the recommendation of the
Borough Engineer, may, if the permit holder presents satisfactory evidence
that unusual difficulties have prevented work being started or completed
within the specified time limits, grant a reasonable extension of time; and,
provided further, that the application for the extension of time is made
before the date of expiration of the permit.
§ 9-113. Denial of Permit; Appeal. [Ord. 767, 3/14/2005, § 213]
slope treatment, ground cover and drainage contemplated under the
permit.
3. Before issuance of any major earth disturbance permit, the applicant
shall post a bond, with corporate surety or other approved security in
the amount of 110% of the estimated cost of the earth disturbance work
to guarantee the completion of said work, including, but not limited to,
slope treatment, ground cover and drainage contemplated under the
permit.
4. If the work is to be covered under a land development approval, the
bonding requirement outlined within the developers agreement shall
take precedence.
5. Upon the receipt of the application for an earth disturbance permit, the
Administrator shall collect an application permit fee for each site, in an
amount determined by fee schedule adopted by resolution by the
Borough Council.
6. In addition, upon the receipt of the application for an earth disturbance
permit, the Administrator shall require a cash escrow account in an
amount determined by fee schedule adopted by resolution by the
Borough Council. This cash escrow shall cover plan review and
inspection charges of the Borough Engineer. If, during the life of the
project, the cash escrow account is depleted, the permit holder shall be
responsible for all additional costs necessary to cover the Borough
Engineer fees until the project has been completed.
1. Where, in the opinion of the Borough Engineer or Administrator, the
work as proposed by the applicant is likely to endanger any property or
person or any street or alley or create hazardous conditions, the
Borough shall deny the grading permit. In determining whether the
proposed work is likely to endanger property or streets or alleys or
create hazardous conditions, the Borough Engineer shall give due
consideration to possible saturation by rains, earth movements, runoff
surface waters and subsurface conditions such as the stratification and

or rock as well as all applicable state and federal laws regarding earth
disturbance.
2. The Council of the Borough shall consider promptly appeals from the
provisions of this Part or from the determinations of the Borough
Engineer, and the Council shall make determinations of alternate
methods, standards or materials when in its opinion strict compliance
with the provisions of this Part is unnecessary. Any applicant or permit
holder shall have the right to appeal to any court of competent
jurisdiction from any decision or determination of the Council of the
Borough.
1. The Borough Engineer or Administrator shall, as required by the permit
or at the request of the permit holder, make the inspections hereinafter
required and shall either approve that portion of the work which has
been completed or notify the permit holder wherein the same fails to
comply with the provisions of this Part. Where it is found by inspection
that the soil drainage patterns or other conditions are not as stated or
shown in the application, the Borough Engineer or Administrator may
refuse to approve further work until approval is obtained for a revised
earth disturbance plan, conforming to existing conditions.
2. Plans for earth disturbance work bearing the stamp of approval of the
Borough Engineer shall be maintained at the site during the progress of
the earth disturbance activities and until the work has been approved.
3. The permit holder shall notify the Borough Engineer or Administrator in
order to obtain inspections in accordance with the following schedule
and at least 24 hours before the inspection is to be made. Before calling
for any inspection, the owner shall have the property line stakes set and
sufficient grade stakes set by a registered engineer-surveyor to enable
the Engineer to verify the grading operation.
A. Initial inspection: when work on the excavation or fill is about to be
commenced.
B. Rough grading: when all rough grading has been completed.
C. Drainage facilities: when drainage facilities are to be installed and
before such facilities are backfilled.

§ 9-115. Performance Standards. [Ord. 767, 3/14/2005, § 215]
F. If at any stage of the work the Borough Engineer or Administrator
shall determine by inspection that the nature of the formation is
such that further work as authorized by an existing permit is likely
to endanger property or streets or alleys or create hazardous
conditions, the Borough may require as a condition to allowing the
work to be done that such reasonable safety precautions be taken
as the Borough Engineer or Administrator considers advisable to
avoid such likelihood of danger. Safety precautions may include,
but shall not be limited to, specifying a flatter exposed slope,
construction of additional drainage facilities, berms, terracing,
compaction, shoring, or cribbing.
1. Standards for Excavation.
A. Maximum slope steepness of a cut shall be determined as follows:
(1) Landslide-prone soils where slopes are greater than 25% shall
have a slope no greater than four horizontal to one vertical on
its exposed face and shall be safe and stable. A written
statement, signed and sealed by a professional engineer
registered in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania specializing
in geotechnical engineering shall be submitted with the earth
disturbance plan. Soil survey map symbols are: GrE and GqF.
(2) Landslide-prone soils where slopes are less than 25% shall
have a slope no greater than three horizontal to one vertical on
its exposed face and shall be safe and stable. A written
statement, signed and sealed by a professional engineer
registered in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania specializing
in geotechnical engineering shall be submitted with the earth
disturbance plan. Soil survey map symbols are: UaB, UaC,
GqB, GpC, GpD, GvB, EvB, EvC and EvD.
(3) Soils which are not, or have a low probability of being,
landslide prone shall have a slope no greater than two
horizontal to one vertical on its exposed face and shall be safe
and stable. A written statement, signed and sealed by a
professional engineer registered in the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania specializing in geotechnical engineering shall be
submitted with the earth disturbance plan. All soil survey map
symbols except those listed above denote soils of a low
landslide probability.
B. Cut slopes which are steeper than those specified above may be
allowed under an earth disturbance permit, provided the following
is satisfied:
(1) The material in which the excavation is made is sufficiently
stable to sustain a slope steeper than the slope specified above
§ 9-114 JEFFERSON HILLS CODE § 9-115
FWD:206
for recognized soil conditions on the site. A written statement,
signed and sealed by a professional engineer registered in the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania specializing in geotechnical
engineering, stating that the steeper slope will have sufficient
stability and that the risk of creating a hazard will be
miniscule, must be submitted to the Administrator.
(2) A retaining wall or other approved support greater than four
feet in height designed by a professional engineer and
approved by the Administrator and Borough Engineer is
provided to support the surface of excavation.
(3) Before commencing any excavation which will in any way
affect an adjoining property or structures thereon, the person
making or causing the excavation to be made shall notify, in
writing, the owners of the adjacent property or buildings not
less than 30 days before such excavation is to be made that the
proposed excavation is to be started. Copies of all such notices
shall be supplied to the Administrator. All notices and copies of
such notices shall be sent registered mail.
2. Standards for Fills.
A. No fill slope shall be steeper than two horizontal to one vertical and
shall be safe and stable as certified by a professional engineer
registered in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania specializing in
geotechnical engineering shall be submitted with the earth
disturbance plan. Fill slopes that are steeper than two horizontal to
one vertical may be allowed under an earth disturbance permit,
provided the following is satisfied:
(1) The material in which the fill is created with is sufficiently
stable after proper compaction to sustain a slope steeper than
the slope specified for recognized soil conditions on the site. A
written statement, signed and sealed by a Professional
Engineer registered in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
specializing in geotechnical engineering, stating that the
steeper slope will have a sufficient stability and that risk of
creating a hazard will be slight, must be submitted to the
Borough.
(2) A retaining wall or other approved support greater than four in
height for the fill slope designed by a professional engineer
registered in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania specializing
in geotechnical engineering, and approved by the
Administrator and the Borough Engineer is provided to
support the fill installed.
(3) Before commencing any excavation which will in any way
affect an adjoining property or structures thereon, then person
making the fill slope shall notify, in writing by registered or
certified mail, the owners of the adjacent property(ies) or
§ 9-115 FOREWORD § 9-115
FWD:207
building(s) not less than 30 days before such construction is to
be started. Copies of all such notices shall be supplied to the
Administrator. All notices and copies of such notices shall be
sent registered mail.
B. Whenever a fill is to be made of materials other than clean soil or
earth, meeting the requirements of the state and federal clean fill
laws, the earth disturbance permit shall be subject to the following
additional limitations and requirements:
(1) The fill shall be completed within a reasonable length of time
as determined by the Engineer and specified on the grading
permit.
(2) Clean soil or earth shall be placed over the top and exposed
surfaces of the fill to a depth sufficient to effectively conceal all
materials used in the fill other than clean soil or earth. If the
filling operation is intermittent, the Engineer may require that
the top and exposed surfaces of the fill be so covered at the
completion of each lift.
(3) No fill of any kind shall be placed over trees, stumps or other
material which would create a nuisance or be susceptible of
attracting rodents, termites or other pests.
(4) No earth disturbance permit shall be issued for the filling of
materials other than clean soil or earth until a performance
bond in an amount at least 10% greater than the Borough
Engineer's estimated cost of adequately covering such fill with
clean soil or earth has been furnished to the Borough. Such
bond shall be executed by a corporate surety, as well as by the
principal, and shall be subject to the approval of the Borough
Solicitor as to form. The bond shall inure to the benefit of the
Borough and be conditioned upon the faithful performance of
the grading permit to the satisfaction of the Borough Engineer.
In lieu of such bond, a cash deposit or a certified check in the
same amount may be made with the Borough Treasurer.
(5) No fill of any kind shall consist of building materials, broken
concrete or asphalt; this does not include millings or air cooled
slag, or any other material that would not allow for 95%
compaction under normal fill operations.
C. Maximum slope steepness of a fill shall be determined as follows:
(1) Landslide-prone soils where slopes are greater than 25% shall
have fill slopes no steeper than four horizontal to one vertical
and shall be safe and stable. A written statement, signed and
sealed by a professional engineer registered in the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania specializing in geotechnical
engineering shall be submitted with the earth disturbance
plan. Soil survey map symbols are: GrE, GqE and GqF.
§ 9-115 JEFFERSON HILLS CODE § 9-115
FWD:208
(2) Landslide-prone soils where slopes are less than 25% shall
have fill slopes no steeper than three horizontal to one vertical
and shall be safe and stable. A written statement, signed and
sealed by a professional engineer registered in the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania specializing in geotechnical
engineering shall be submitted with the earth disturbance
plan. Soil survey map symbols are: UaB, UaC, GpB, GpC, GpD,
GvB, GvC, GvD, EvB, EvC and EvD.
D. Standards for Compaction of Fills.
(1) All fills shall be compacted to provide stability of fill material
and to prevent undesirable settlement or slippage.
(2) The fill shall be installed in a series of layers, each not
exceeding 12 inches in thickness, and each layer shall be
compacted by passing a sheep foot roller or other approved
equipment across the layer in a minimum of four passes as the
layer is spread.
(3) Pieces of rock or boulders having thickness of more than six
inches or a cross-sectioned area in any plane of more than 1 1/
2 square feet shall not be permitted in fills.
(4) No fill material that will support combustion shall be
permitted.
(5) Where fills are placed on any existing slope greater than 5%,
the toe of the fill shall be prepared by cutting a bench 10 feet
wide on a reverse slope of one vertical to 10 horizontal.
(6) For fills higher than 10 feet above the toe of the proposed
slope, there shall be constructed benches at eight-foot
intervals measured vertically from the base of the fill. Said
benches shall be six feet in width and shall have a floor cut to a
reverse slope of one vertical to six horizontal.
(7) The Borough Engineer, with the approval of the Borough
Council, may require tests or other information if, in his
opinion, the conditions or materials of fill are such that the
additional information is necessary.

§ 9-115 FOREWORD § 9-116
FWD:211
§ 9-117. Drainage. [Ord. 767, 3/14/2005, § 217]
2. Retaining walls must be constructed in accordance with sound
engineering practice. The plans submitted for approval shall bear the
seal of a professional engineer registered in the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania.
3. The backfilling of retaining walls and the insertion of subterranean
drainage facilities shall be installed in accordance with the design
engineer's recommendations and plans and provide positive drainage
away from the slope and wall.
4. In general, where a wall is replacing an exposed slope, the vertical face
of the wall shall be five feet zero inches back from the adjoining
property.
A. A waiver to this requirement may be applied for and granted by the
Administrator if it can be satisfactorily demonstrated that such a
variance is necessary to ensure normal use of the property, i.e., for
a side-line driveway.
B. The requirement of this subsection may also be waived when the
proposed retaining wall is a joint venture between adjacent
property owners and appropriate documents so stating are filed
with the application for the permit.
1. Adequate provisions shall be made to prevent any surface waters from
damaging:
A. The cut face of an excavation.
B. The sloping surface of a fill.
C. Adjacent property affected by the change in the existing natural
runoff.

deeper than 10 feet for the top of the cut shall have six-foot-wide
benches installed at ten-foot intervals measured from the top. Said
benches shall have reverse floor slopes of one vertical to six horizontal.
3. Excavation cut at slopes in excess of one vertical to 1 1/2 horizontal and
deeper than 10 feet from the top of the cut shall have similar benches
installed at eight-foot intervals measured from the top.
4. All drainage provisions shall be of such a design to carry surface waters
to the nearest practical street storm sewer or natural watercourse, as
approved by the Engineer as a safe place to deposit and receive such
waters.
5. The Borough Engineer shall require such drainage structures or pipes
to be constructed or installed as may be necessary to prevent erosion
and damage and to satisfactorily carry off accumulated surface waters.
§ 9-116 JEFFERSON HILLS CODE § 9-117
FWD:212
§ 9-118. Post-Construction Runoff Control Requirements for New
Development and Redevelopment. [Ord. 767, 3/14/2005, § 218]
6. Constructed benches in fills or cuts or at the top of slopes shall have
horizontal gradients of at least 2% for the purpose of carrying off
surface waters.
7. To prevent erosion, the planting of sod, shrubs or other vegetation shall
be required on all slopes.
1. No regulated earth disturbance activities within the Municipality shall
commence until approval by the Borough of a plan which demonstrates
compliance with state water quality requirements after construction is
complete. An operation and maintenance post-development stormwater
plan must be submitted to the municipality prior to final approval.
2. The Best Management Practices (BMPs) must be designed to protect
and maintain existing uses (e.g., drinking water use; cold water fishery
use) and maintain the level of water quality necessary to protect those
uses in all streams, and to protect and maintain water quality in special
protection streams, as required by statewide regulations at 25 Pa. Code
Chapter 93 (collectively referred to herein as "state water quality
requirements").
3. To control post-construction stormwater impacts from regulated earth
disturbance activities, state water quality requirements can be met by
BMPs, including site design, which provide for replication of
preconstruction stormwater infiltration and runoff conditions, so that
post-construction stormwater discharges do not degrade the physical,
chemical or biological characteristics of the receiving waters. As
described in the DEP Comprehensive Stormwater Management Policy
(#392-0300-002, September 28, 2002), this may be achieved by the
following:
A. Infiltration: replication of preconstruction stormwater infiltration
conditions;
B. Treatment: use of water quality treatment BMPs to ensure filtering
out of chemical and physical pollutants from the stormwater runoff;
and
C. Stream bank and streambed protection: management of volume
and rate of post-construction stormwater discharges to prevent
physical degradation of receiving waters (e.g., from scouring and
erosion).
4. PADEP has regulations that require municipalities to ensure design,

§ 15-410. Residential Permit Parking. [Ord. 685, 5/11/1998; as
amended by Ord. 741, 12/30/2002, § 1]
1. Findings and Purpose. The Borough of Jefferson Hills finds that:
A. Certain residential areas in the Borough of Jefferson Hills are
subjected to commuter vehicle parking, therefore, depriving the
residents of those areas of spaces in which to park their own
vehicles;
B. Those residential streets are also subjected to a high degree of
commuter traffic which substantially reduces the quality of the
ambient air level; and,
C. The establishment of a parking permit program for certain affected
areas should facilitate efficient movement of traffic by providing for
parking preference during certain hours of the day and days of the
week. Therefore, the Borough considers it to be in the interest of
the people of the Borough to provide for the establishment of a
residential permit parking program to insure primary access to
available parking spaces by neighborhood residents and also to
provide a cleaner ambient air level.
2. Definitions. For the purpose of this section, words and terms listed in
this subsection, as follows, shall have the following meanings:
COMMUTER VEHICLE — A motor vehicle parked in a residential area
by a person not a resident of that residential area.
PROPRIETOR — A person who owns or leases real estate within a
residential area of which he is not a resident, but who owns or manages
a business enterprise or professional office maintained at that address;
for the purpose of this section, a proprietor shall be entitled to one
parking permit for that business or professional office address.
RESIDENT — A person who owns or leases real property within a
residential area and who maintains either a voting residence, or bona
fide occupancy, or both, at that address.
RESIDENTIAL AREA — A contiguous area containing public highways
or parts of public highways primarily abutted by residential property or
residential and nonbusiness property (such as schools, parks, places of
worship, hospitals and nursing homes).
3. Criteria. The residential areas designated in Subsection 4 of this
section are those deemed impacted and hence eligible for residential
parking on the basis of the following criteria:
A. During any period between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 6:30 p.m.,
Monday through Saturday, except legal holidays, the number of
vehicles parked (or standing), legally or illegally, on the streets in
the area is equal to 70% or more of the legal, on-street parking
capacity of the area. For the purpose of this criterion, a legal
parking space shall be 20 linear feet.
§ 15-410 JEFFERSON HILLS CODE § 15-410
FWD:300
B. During the same period as specified in Subsection 3A, directly
above, 10% or more of the vehicles parked (or standing) on the
streets in the area are not registered in the name of a person
residing in the area. For the purpose of this criterion, the latest
available information from the Bureau of Motor Vehicles and
Licensing of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation
regarding registration of motor vehicles shall be used.
Provided: in determining that a specific area identified as impacted
and eligible for residential permit parking is designated as a
residential permit parking area, the following factors are taken into
consideration:
(1) The local and metropolitan needs with respect to clean air and
environment;
(2) The possibility of a reduction in total vehicle miles driven in the
Borough;
(3) The likelihood of alleviating traffic congestion, illegal parking
and related health and safety hazards;
(4) The proximity of public transportation to the residential area;
(5) The desire and need of the residents for residential permit
parking and their willingness to bear the administrative costs
in connection with it; and
(6) The need for parking in excess of the residential permit
parking program in proximity to establishments located in the
residential permit parking area and used by the general public
for religious, health or educational purposes.
4. Designation of Residential Permit Parking Areas. The following are
designated as residential permit parking areas:
Area Bounded by and Including
(Reserved)
Signs shall be erected along the streets in each residential permit
parking area, indicating the days, hours, locations and conditions
under which parking shall be by permit only.
5. Application for Permit. Application for a residential parking permit shall
be made to the Chief of Police by the person desiring the permit, who
shall be only the owner or the driver of a motor vehicle who resides on
or is a proprietor of property immediately adjacent to a street or other
location within a residential parking permit area. A separate
application shall be required for each motor vehicle, and each
application shall be accompanied by a permit fee, set pursuant to a
resolution of the Borough Council, which shall be for the use of the
Borough, to be applied to the cost of administering the residential
§ 15-410 FOREWORD § 15-410
FWD:301
permit parking program. Each application shall contain the following
information: the name of the owner or the driver, as the case may be,
of the motor vehicle; the address of the resident or the proprietor, as
the case may be; the make, model and registration number of the motor
vehicle; and the driver number as taken from the applicant's current
driver's license. At the discretion of the Chief of Police, the applicant
shall be required, at the time of making application, to present his
driver's license and the vehicle registration card.
6. Issuance of Permit. Upon receipt of the application and the permit fee,
and determination by him that the information upon the application
shows that the applicant is entitled to a residential parking permit, the
Chief of Police shall issue to the applicant a residential parking permit,
which shall be valid for the remainder of the calendar year. The permit
shall display the serial and registration numbers of the motor vehicles,
the residential parking area number, and the expiration date. The
permit shall be renewable annually before the expiration date, upon
making application for renewal and payment of the permit fee. It shall
be unlawful and a violation of this section for any person to display
other than the current and valid permit while standing or parking in a
residential permit parking area at any time when those permits are to
be displayed.
7. Temporary and Exemption Parking Permits. Temporary parking permits
may be issued by the Chief of Police, upon payment of a fee established
pursuant to a resolution, to bona fide visitors of residents of a
designated residential permit parking area, and exemption parking
permits may be issued, without payment of a fee, to handicapped
persons.
8. Responsibility of Permit Holder.
A. Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, the
holder of a residential parking permit shall be permitted to stand or
park a motor vehicle operated by him in any designated residential
parking area during those times when parking of motor vehicles is
permitted in that area. While a vehicle for which a residential
parking permit has been issued is so parked, that permit shall be
displayed so as to be clearly visible through the windshield of the
vehicle. A residential parking permit shall not guarantee or reserve
to the holder a parking space within a designated residential
permit parking area.
B. A residential parking permit shall not authorize its holder to stand
or park a motor vehicle in any place where or at any time when
stopping, standing or parking of motor vehicles is prohibited or set
aside for other specified types of vehicles, nor shall the permit
exempt its holder from the observance of any traffic or parking
regulation other than residential permit parking regulation or
restriction.

Any person who violates any provision of this Part shall, upon conviction, be
sentenced to pay a fine of not more than $15 and costs; provided: it shall be
the duty of the police officers and of parking enforcement personnel of the
Borough to report to the appropriate official all violations of any provision of
this Part, indicating, in each case: the section violated; the license number
of the vehicle involved in the violation; the location where the violation took
place; and any other facts that might be necessary in order to secure a
clear understanding of the circumstances attending the violation. The police
officer or other person making the report shall also attach to or place upon
every such vehicle a notice stating that the vehicle was parked in violation
of this Part. The notice shall contain instructions to the owner or driver of
the vehicle that if he will report to the office of the Chief of Police and pay
the sum of $10 within 48 hours after the time of the notice, or if he will
place the sum of $10, enclosed within the envelope provided, in any of the
special parking fine boxes installed at various locations within the Borough,
that act will save the violator from prosecution and from payment of the fine
and costs prescribed in the first sentence of this section.
C. No person other than the permit holder whose name appears on the
permit shall use a residential parking permit or display it on a
vehicle operated; any such use or display by a person other than
the permit holder shall constitute a violation of this section by the
permit holder and by the person who so used or displayed the
parking permit.
D. It shall constitute a violation of this section for any person falsely to
represent himself as eligible for a residential parking permit or to
furnish false information in an application to the Chief of Police in
order to obtain a residential parking permit.
(1) Revocation of Permits. The Chief of Police shall have authority
to revoke the residential parking permit of any permit holder
found to be in violation of any provision of this section. Upon
written notification to him of the revocation, the permit holder
shall surrender the permit to the Chief of Police. Failure to do
so, when so requested, shall constitute a violation of this
section; provided: any person receiving such a notice may,
within 10 days after the date of the notice, appeal to Borough
Council for a hearing on the revocation, and the decision of the
Borough Council shall be final.

adopted collection procedures.
B. Upon determination that a delinquency exists within the terms of this
Part, the Borough or its agent shall send a letter to the delinquent
account demanding payment of all delinquencies forthwith and, in the
absence of payment in full as requested, shall solicit the delinquent
consumer or consumers to appear before the designated sewage
collection agent for the Borough of Jefferson Hills for the purpose of

C. The agent of the Borough of Jefferson Hills authorized to discuss
payment arrangements on a delinquent account shall reduce to writing
the arrangements so recommended for the individual consumer which
shall be operative and binding upon the Borough of Jefferson Hills'

written recommendations by the agent of the Borough of Jefferson Hills.
It shall be the duty of the agent to transmit all such arrangements to the
Borough of Jefferson Hills' Sewer System Manager within five days of
any such written arrangement.
D. Failure to reject as above set forth by the Borough of Jefferson Hills'
Sewer Manager shall be regarded as an acceptance of the
recommended arrangement and in each instance the Borough of
Jefferson Hills shall forego exercising its right to have the consumer's
water supply terminated so long as the consumer faithfully maintains
the arrangements arrived at.
E. In the event the consumer shall fail to respond to the direction to either

public improvements in future sections or phases of the
development which are essential for the protection of the public
welfare and any existing or proposed section or phase of the plan.

resolution indicating approval of the final plat contingent upon the
developer obtaining satisfactory financial security and executing the
development agreement required by § 22-312. The resolution shall
specify any conditions of approval that have not been met at the time of
final plat approval.
2. The resolution shall specify a reasonable time within which the
developer shall post financial security, execute the development
agreement and meet outstanding conditions of approval that can be
reasonably met prior to recording of the final plat. The resolution shall
specify that final plat approval shall expire and shall be deemed to be
revoked if financial security is not posted and the development
agreement is not executed and all conditions of approval which can be
reasonably met prior to recording of the final plat are not met within
the time period specified. This time deadline shall constitute the time
deadline for the developer to deliver an approved plat for signature by
Borough Council required by § 22-314 of this chapter.
3. The proper officers of the Borough are not authorized to sign the plat
for recording until the terms of the resolution are satisfied.

FWD:431
§ 22-311. Amenities Bond. [Ord. 603, 12/30/1991, § 311]
completion bond, as defined by this chapter, in favor of the Borough, in
an amount equal to 110% of the cost of completion of the improvements
estimated as of 90 days following the date scheduled for completion
by the developer. Annually the Borough may adjust the amount of the
financial security by comparing the actual cost of the improvements
which have been completed and the estimated cost for the completion
of the remaining improvements as of the expiration of the 90th day
after either the original date scheduled for completion or a rescheduled
date of completion. Subsequent to said adjustment, the Borough may
require the developer to post additional security in order to assure that
the financial security equals said 110%. Any additional security shall be
posted by the developer in accordance with this subsection.
2. If water mains or sanitary sewer lines, or both, along with apparatus or
facilities related thereto, are to be installed under the jurisdiction and
pursuant to the rules and regulations of a public utility or municipal
authority separate and distinct from the Borough, financial security to
assure proper completion and maintenance thereof shall be posted in
accordance with the regulations of the controlling public utility or
municipal authority and shall not be included within the completion
bond required by this section.
3. The amount of financial security required shall be based upon an
estimate of the cost of completion of the required improvements,
submitted by an applicant or developer and prepared by a professional
engineer licensed as such in this Commonwealth and certified by such
engineer to be a fair and reasonable estimate of such cost. The
Borough, upon the recommendation of the Borough Engineer, may
refuse to accept such estimate for good cause shown. If the applicant or
developer and the Borough are unable to agree upon an estimate, then
the estimate shall be recalculated and recertified by another
professional engineer licensed as such in this Commonwealth and
chosen mutually by the Borough and the applicant or developer. The
estimate certified by the third engineer shall be presumed fair and
reasonable, and shall be the final estimate. In the event that a third
engineer is so chosen, fees for the services of said engineer shall be
paid equally by the Borough and the applicant or developer.
4. If the party posting the financial security requires more than one year
from the date of posting of the financial security to complete the
required improvements, the amount of financial security may be
increased by an additional 10% for each one-year period beyond the
first anniversary date from posting of financial security or to an amount
not exceeding 110% of the cost of completing the required
improvements as reestablished on or about the expiration of the
preceding one-year period by using the above procedure.

total of 25 or more dwelling units in the entire plan, at the time that
an application for preliminary approval is submitted, the applicant
shall provide a secondary means of access to and from the plan. If
the applicant or landowner on whose behalf the applicant submits
an application owns additional land immediately adjacent to or part
of a larger tract from which a subdivision is proposed, the applicant
or landowner shall not divide the property into separate subdivision
plans of 24 or fewer lots to avoid the requirement to provide a
secondary means of access. Regardless of the amount of property
included in the subdivision proposed for approval, a preliminary
layout of a street system that demonstrates compliance with this
subsection shall be required for the entire tract or tracts.
B. The secondary means of access shall meet the following standards.
(1) The secondary means of access shall be a public street for twoway

(2) The secondary means of access shall be provided by one of the
following alternatives:
(a) A direct connection shall be made to an existing public
street outside the proposed plan that is classified as an
arterial or collector street by means of a public street
right-of-way.
(b) If a direct connection to an existing arterial or collector
street is not available, a direct connection shall be made
by means of a public street right-of-way to an existing local
street outside the proposed plan, provided the existing
local street intersects with an arterial or collector street
§ 22-604 JEFFERSON HILLS CODE § 22-604
FWD:448
within 2,500 feet of the local street's intersection with the
secondary means of access.
(c) If a direct connection to an arterial or collector street or a
direct connection to an existing local street within 2,500
feet of an arterial or collector street is not available, a
direct connection shall be made by means of a public
street right-of-way to an existing local street outside the
plan. If the primary means of access to the plan is
proposed from the same existing local street, the
secondary means of access shall be located at least 1,500
feet from the point of intersection of the primary means of
access with that existing local street.
(d) If a secondary means of access as described in
Subparagraph (a), (b) or (c) is not available, a direct
connection shall be made by means of a public street rightof-
way to a proposed public street in a development that is
pending approval or under construction on immediately
adjacent property.
(e) If a secondary means of access as described in
Subparagraph (a), (b), (c) or (d) is not available, a direct
connection shall be made by means of a fifty-foot public
street right-of-way dedicated to the property line of
immediately adjacent undeveloped property for the
purpose of extending a future public street into the
undeveloped property. In this case, the applicant shall
submit a drawing analyzing the feasibility of extending a
future public street into the adjacent property at the
selected location.
(f) If a secondary means of access as described in
Subparagraph (a), (b), (c), (d) or (e) is not available, a
direct "emergency only" connection shall be made by
means of a public street right-of-way to an existing public
street to provide access to the plan by emergency vehicles.
Use of the "emergency only" access may or may not be
restricted to emergency vehicles, subject to approval by
Borough Council.
(3) In evaluating the alternative proposed by the applicant for
providing the secondary means of access, the Planning
Commission and Borough Council shall consider whether the
alternative proposed is the least disruptive to existing
neighborhoods, considering the number of homes affected by
the increased traffic, the width and condition of the existing
cartway, the availability of off-street parking, the feasibility of
on-street parking and any other relevant factors.

The following standards shall apply to all lots proposed to be subdivided or
developed in accordance with this chapter.
(4) When the primary means of access connects to an existing
public street in an established neighborhood and the
secondary means of access is not proposed to be constructed in
Phase One of a phased development plan, the construction of
the secondary means of access shall be bonded with the public
improvements in Phase One. The approved secondary means of
access shall be constructed to Borough standards within the
entire limits of the right-of-way approved in Phase Two during
the construction of Phase Two.
(5) When the primary means of access connects to an existing
public street in an established neighborhood, the secondary
means of access shall be used for all construction vehicles
entering and leaving the plan during construction and
following completion of the secondary means of access until all
subsequent phases of the plan have been completed.
1. Easements for sanitary sewers and waterlines shall be required to have
a minimum width of 20 feet. Where utilities are located behind
dwellings, in a valley or in a constricted area, easements for access
shall be provided at appropriate intervals to ensure an adequate area
for work to be performed, if required.
2. Where a subdivision is, or will be, traversed by a watercourse, a

construction and the number of lots created out of the original
approved lot is no greater than the number of dwelling units in the
building constructed on that lot.
B. Frontage. All lots created by a subdivision shall have frontage along the
right-of-way of a public street and the width of the frontage shall
conform to the requirements of the Borough Zoning Ordinance
[Chapter 27].
C. Subdivisions Along Common Walls. In the case of single-family
attached, two-family, triplex, fourplex or townhouse dwelling units, the
dwelling units may be subdivided along common walls for the purpose
of conveying the units in fee simple after construction even though the
resulting lots are less than the minimum lot area or lot width required

some of the requirements of §§ 22-303 and 22-306 regarding application
content, if warranted. Applicants desiring to obtain a waiver of certain
application requirements under the provisions of this section shall submit
a written request with the application for preliminary approval. In granting
such waiver, the Planning Commission shall rely on the recommendation of
the Borough Engineer and shall determine that the waiver is not contrary
to the public interest and is not in conflict with the requirements of any
applicable county or state law or regulation. In the event that the Planning
Commission does not grant the waiver, the application shall be considered
incomplete and the Commission shall return the application for
resubmission and compliance with all requirements of §§ 22-303 and
22-306.

as amended by Ord. 787, 10/9/2006, § 11]
In any particular case where the developer can show by plan and written
statement that, by reason of exceptional topographic or other physical
conditions, strict compliance with any requirement of this chapter would
cause practical difficulty or exceptional and undue hardship, the Borough
Council may relax such requirements to the extent deemed just and proper,
so as to relieve such difficulty or hardship, provided that such relief may
be granted without detriment to the public good and without impairing the
intent and purpose of this chapter, or the desirable general development
of the neighborhood and the community in accordance with the Borough's
Comprehensive Plan.

amended by Ord. 787, 10/9/2006, § 11]
When, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of this chapter
would result in unnecessary hardship, Borough Council may make such

be contrary to the public interest and may approve a subdivision or land
development plan subject to conditions necessary to assure adequate public
improvements.

1991, § 801; as amended by Ord. 632, 10/11/1993, § 2; by Ord. 787,
10/9/2006, § 13; and by Ord. 791, 4/9/2007, § 16]
1. Application Filing Fees.
A. Application filing fees shall be established, from time to time, by
resolution of Borough Council. The application filing fees shall
cover the administrative costs associated with processing an
application for approval of a subdivision or land development and
shall be payable to the Borough at the time of submission of the
application.
B. An escrow deposit in an amount established from time to time by
resolution of Borough Council also shall be payable at the time of
submission of the application to guarantee payment of the
estimated application review fees required by § 22-901, Subsection
2, below. The actual amount of the review fees in excess of the
escrow deposit shall be payable within 10 days of billing by the
Borough. Any monies remaining in the escrow account after all
review fees have been paid shall be returned to the applicant.
Failure to pay the required escrow deposit or any additional fees
required by § 22-901, Subsection 2, shall cause the application to
be determined to be incomplete and all application materials shall
be returned to the applicant for resubmission.
2. Application Review Fees.
A. Application review fees shall include reasonable and necessary
charges by the Borough's professional consultants for review and
report thereon to the Borough. Such review fees shall be based
upon a schedule established from time to time by resolution.24 Such
review fees shall be reasonable and in accordance with the
ordinary and customary charges for similar service in the
community, but in no event shall the fees exceed the rate or cost
charged by the professional consultant for comparable services to
the Borough for services which are not reimbursed or otherwise
imposed on applicants. Fees charged to the Borough relating to the
appeal of any decision on an application shall not be considered
review fees and may not be charged to the applicant.
B. Borough Council shall submit to the applicant an itemized bill
showing work performed, identifying the person performing the
services and the time and date spent for each task. Nothing in this
subparagraph shall prohibit interim itemized billing or Borough
escrow or other security requirements. In the event that the
24.Editor's Note: See the Fee Schedule at the front of this Code.
§ 22-901 FOREWORD § 22-901
FWD:467
applicant disputes the amount of any such review fees, the
applicant shall, no later than 45 days after the date of transmittal
of the bill to the applicant, notify the Borough and the Borough's
professional consultant that such fees are disputed and shall
explain the basis of their objections to the fees charged, in which
case the Borough shall not delay or disapprove a subdivision or
land development application due to the applicant's dispute over
fees. Failure of the applicant to dispute a bill within 45 days shall
be a waiver of the applicant's right to arbitration of that bill under
this section.
C. In the event that the Borough's professional consultant and the
applicant cannot agree on the amount of review fees which are
reasonable and necessary, then the applicant and the Borough shall
follow the procedure for dispute resolution for inspection fees set
forth in § 22-901, Subsection 3, below.
3. Inspection Fees.
A. The Borough shall require that the applicant shall reimburse the
Borough for the reasonable and necessary expense incurred in
connection with the inspection of improvements. The applicant
shall not be required to reimburse the Borough for any inspection
which is duplicative of inspections conducted by other
governmental agencies or public utilities. The burden of proving
that any inspection is duplicative shall be upon the objecting
applicant. Such reimbursement shall be based upon a schedule
established from time to time by Resolution of Borough Council.
Such expense shall be reasonable and in accordance with the
ordinary and customary fees charged by the Borough's professional
consultant for work performed for similar services in the
community, but in no event shall the fees exceed the rate or cost
charged by the professional consultant to the Borough for
comparable services when fees are not reimbursed or otherwise
imposed on applicants.
B. Borough Council shall submit to the applicant an itemized bill
showing the work performed in connection with the inspection of
improvements performed, identifying the person performing the
services and the time and date spent for each task. In the event the
applicant disputes the amount of any such expense in connection
with the inspection of improvements, the applicant shall, no later
than 30 days after the date of transmittal of a bill for inspection
services, notify the Borough and the Borough's professional
consultant that such inspection expenses are disputed as
unreasonable or unnecessary and shall explain the basis of their
objections to the fees charged, in which case the Borough shall not
delay or disapprove a request for release of financial security, a
subdivision or land development application or any approval or
permit related to development due to the applicant's dispute of
inspection expenses. Failure of the applicant to dispute a bill within
§ 22-901 JEFFERSON HILLS CODE § 22-901
FWD:468
30 days shall be a waiver of the applicant's right to arbitration of
that bill under this section.
C. Subsequent to the final release of financial security for completion
of improvements for a subdivision or land development, or any
phase thereof, the professional consultant shall submit to Borough
Council a bill for inspection services, specifically designated as a
final bill. The final bill shall include inspection fees incurred
through the release of financial security.
D. If the professional consultant and the applicant cannot agree on the
amount of the expenses which are reasonable and necessary, then
the applicant shall have the right, within 45 days of the transmittal
of the final bill or supplement to the final bill to the applicant, to
request the appointment of another professional consultant to
serve as an arbitrator. The applicant and the professional
consultant whose fees are being challenged shall by mutual
agreement appoint another professional consultant to review any
bills the applicant has disputed and which remain unresolved and
make a determination as to the amount thereof which is reasonable
and necessary. The arbitrator shall be of the same profession as the
professional consultant whose fees are being challenged.
E. The arbitrator so appointed shall hear such evidence and review
such documentation as the arbitrator in his or her sole opinion
deems necessary and shall render a decision no later than 50 days
after the date of appointment. Based on the decision of the
arbitrator, the applicant or professional consultant whose fees were
challenged shall be required to pay any amounts necessary to
implement the decision within 60 days. In the event that the
Borough has paid the professional consultant an amount in excess
of the amount determined to be reasonable and necessary, the
professional consultant shall within 60 days reimburse the excess
payment.
F. In the event that the Borough's professional consultant and the
applicant cannot agree upon the arbitrator to be appointed within
20 days of the request for appointment of an arbitrator, then, upon
application of either party, the President Judge of the Allegheny
County Court of Common Pleas (or if at the time there be no
President Judge, then the senior active judge then sitting) shall
appoint such arbitrator, who, in that case, shall be neither the
Borough's professional consultant nor any professional consultant
who has been retained by, or performed services for, the Borough
or the applicant within the preceding five years.
G. The fee of the arbitrator shall be paid by the applicant if the review
fee charge is sustained by the arbitrator, otherwise, it shall be
divided equally between the parties. If the disputed fees are found
to be excessive by more than $5,000, the arbitrator shall have the
discretion to assess the arbitration fee in whole or in part against

other than those prepared by the Borough Planning Commission,
Borough Council shall submit the proposed amendment to the Planning
Commission for recommendations at least 30 days prior to the date
fixed for the public hearing on the proposed amendment.
2. Proposed amendments shall not be enacted unless public notice of the
proposed enactment is given in the manner set forth in this chapter and
shall include the time and place of the meeting at which passage will be
considered, a reference to a place within the Borough where copies of
the proposed amendment may be examined without charge or obtained
for a charge not greater than the cost thereof. Borough Council shall
publish the proposed amendment once in one newspaper of general
circulation in the Borough not more than 60 days nor less than seven
days prior to passage. Publication of the proposed amendment shall
include either the full text thereof or the title and a brief summary
prepared by the Borough Solicitor and setting forth all the provisions in
reasonable detail. If the full text is not included:
A. A copy thereof shall be supplied to a newspaper of general
circulation in the Borough at the time the public notice is
published.
B. An attested copy of the proposed amendment shall be filed in the
county law library or other county office designated by the County
Council, who may impose a fee no greater than that necessary to
cover the actual costs of storing said ordinances.
C. In the event substantial amendments are made in the proposed
amendment, before voting upon enactment, Borough Council shall,
at least 10 days prior to enactment, readvertise in one newspaper
of general circulation in the Borough, a brief summary setting forth
all the provisions in reasonable detail together with a summary of
the amendments.
D. Subdivision and land development amendments may be
incorporated into official ordinance books by reference with the
same force and effect as if duly recorded therein.
3. The proposed amendment shall be submitted to the Allegheny County
Planning Commission for review and recommendations at least 30 days

1. In addition to other remedies, the Borough may institute and maintain
appropriate actions by law or in equity to restrain, correct or abate
violations, to prevent unlawful construction, to recover damages and to
prevent illegal occupancy of a building, structure or premises. The
description by metes and bounds in the instrument of transfer or other
documents used in the process of selling or transferring shall not
exempt the seller or transferor from such penalties or from the
remedies herein provided.
2. The Borough may refuse to issue any permit or grant any approval
necessary to further improve or develop any real property which has
been developed or which has resulted from a subdivision of real
property in violation of this chapter. The authority to deny such a permit
or approval shall apply to any of the following applicants:
A. The owner of record at the time of such violation.

to the time of violation without regard as to whether such current
owner had actual or constructive knowledge of the violation.
D. The vendee or lessee of the current owner of record who acquired
the property subsequent to the time of violation without regard as
to whether such vendee or lessee had actual or constructive
knowledge of the violation.

approval to any such owner, current owner, vendee or lessee for the
development of any such real property, the Borough may require
compliance with the conditions that would have been applicable to the
property at the time the applicant acquired an interest in such real

reasonable attorney fees incurred by the Borough as a result thereof.
No judgment shall commence or be imposed, levied or be payable until

defendant neither pays nor timely appeals the judgment, the Borough
may enforce the judgment pursuant to the applicable rules of civil

have believed that there was no such violation, in which event there
shall be deemed to have been only one such violation until the fifth day
following the date of the determination of a violation by the District
Justice and thereafter each day that a violation continues shall
constitute a separate violation.

lawfully adopted rule, regulation, ordinance, restriction or covenant,
that which imposes the most restrictive requirement shall govern.
2. Whenever there is a difference between a minimum standard or
dimension specified in this chapter and those contained in another
official regulation, resolution or ordinance of the Borough, the highest
standard shall apply. If a question of conflict arises between various
portions of this chapter, the most restrictive term shall apply.

herein on a person or transfer shall not exceed the limitations
prescribed in the Local Tax Enabling Act, Act of December 31, 1965,
P.L. 1257, 53 P.S. § 6901 et seq., so that if any other political subdivision
shall impose or hereafter shall impose such tax on the same person or
transfer, then the tax levied by the Borough of Jefferson Hills under the
authority of that act shall, during the time such duplication of the tax
exists, except as hereinafter otherwise provided, be 1/2 of the rate and
such 1/2 rate shall become effective without any action on the part of
the Borough of Jefferson Hills and any other political subdivision which
impose such tax on the same person or transfer may agree that, instead
of limiting their respective rates to 1/2 of the rate herein provided, they
will impose respectively different rates, the total of which shall not
exceed the maximum rate permitted under the Local Tax Enabling Act.
4. If for any reason the tax is not paid when due, interest at the rate in
effect at the time the tax is due shall be added and collected.

extend or limit existing recorded legal title, or interest.
E. A transfer of division in kind for no, or nominal, actual
consideration of property passed by testate or intestate succession
and held by cotenants; however, if any of the parties take shares

the trust instrument that clearly identifies the grantor, and all
possible beneficiaries.

which title is acquired by a grantee or statement of value fails to set
forth that the property was acquired by the grantee from, or for the

property is the property of the grantee in his individual capacity if
the grantee claims an exemption from taxation under this
subsection.

subdivision and with the person's employer affirming that the
person reasonably expects to receive earned income and net profits
from all sources within the political subdivision of less than
$12,000 in the calendar year for which the exemption certificate is
filed. In the event the political subdivision utilizes a tax collection
officer, it shall provide a copy of the exemption certificate to that
officer. The exemption certificate shall have attached to it a copy of
all employees' last pay stubs or W-2 forms from employment within
the political subdivision for the year prior to the fiscal year for
which the employee is requesting to be exempted from the tax.
Upon receipt of the exemption certificate and until otherwise
instructed by the political subdivision or except as required by
Subsection 2B below, the employer shall not withhold the tax from
the person during the calendar year or the remainder of the
calendar year for which the exemption certificate applies.
Employers shall ensure that the exemption certificate forms are
readily available to employees at all times and shall furnish each
new employee with a form at the time of hiring. The exemption
certificate form shall be the uniform form provided by the political
subdivision.
B. With respect to a person who claimed an exemption for a given
calendar year from the tax, upon notification to an employer by the
person or by the political subdivision that the person has received
earned income and net profits from all sources within the political
subdivision equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that calendar year or
that the person is otherwise ineligible for the tax exemption for the
calendar year, or upon and employer's payment to the person of
earned income within the Borough in an amount equal to or in
excess of $12,000 in that calendar year, an employer shall withhold
the local services tax from the person under Subsection 2C below.
C. If a person who claimed an exemption for a given calendar year
from the tax becomes subject to the tax for the calendar year under
Subsection 2B, the employer shall withhold the tax for the
remainder of that calendar year. The employer shall withhold from
the person, for the first payroll period after receipt of the
notification under Subsection 2B, a lump sum equal to the amount
of tax that was not withheld from the person due to the exemption
claimed by the person under this subsection, plus the per-payroll
amount due for that first payroll period. The amount of tax withheld
per payroll period for the remaining payroll periods in that
calendar year shall be the same amount withheld for other
employees. In the event the employment of a person subject to
withholding of the tax under this subsection is subsequently
severed in that calendar year, the person shall be liable for any
outstanding balance of tax due, and the political subdivision may
pursue collection under this Part.

determining the pro rata share, an employer shall round down the
amount of tax collected each payroll period to the nearest onehundredth

year, irrespective of the number of political subdivisions within which a
person may be employed. The political subdivision shall provide a
taxpayer a receipt of payment upon request by the taxpayer.
6. No employer shall be held liable for failure to withhold the tax or for the
payment of the withheld tax money to the political subdivision if the
failure to withhold taxes arises from incorrect information submitted by
the employee as to the employee's place or places of employment, the
employee's principal office or where the employee is principally
employed. Further, an employer shall not be liable for payment of the
local services tax in an amount exceeding the amount withheld by the
employer if the employer complies with the provisions of § 24-403,
Subsection 2, of this Part and this section and remits the amount so
withheld in accordance with this Part.

person becomes subject to the tax during each payroll period. In the
event a person is engaged in more than one occupation, that is,

working in more than one political subdivision during a payroll period,

Collector the means, facilities and opportunity for such examination.

after the due dates above set forth, the Collector may sue for the
recovery of any such tax due or unpaid under this Part, together with
interest and penalty.
2. If for any reason the tax is not paid when due, interest at the rate of 6%

therefor shall, in addition, be responsible and liable for the costs of

1998, § 5]
A. The tax exemption shall be limited to a period of three years. The threeyear
exemption period will commence with the year in which the
assessed valuation attributable to the improvements is first imposed by
the Board, whether such assessed valuation is based upon the
completed improvements or constitutes a partial assessment upon the
improvement prior to completion.

improvements to real property within the deteriorated area described
in Exhibit A of this Part shall be $500,000.

days of the date the building permit is issued or otherwise as provided
in this Part. Failure to submit such exemption request within 30 days or

exemption claimed pursuant to this Part for the initial tax year after
completion of construction, reconstruction or improvement, thereby
limiting the length of the schedule of taxes exempted to one less year.

fully constructed) in the creation of 10,000 or less square feet of
impervious surface area may be classified as a small development and is
eligible for a simplified stormwater management plan submission.
Small developments must provide safe management of stormwater
runoff in accordance with the performance standards of this Part and as
approved by the Borough Engineer. Any stormwater management
facilities constructed as part of the development shall be designed to
control the peak predevelopment stormwater runoff for the two-, ten-,
and twenty-five-year storm. The detention facility must be able to safely
pass the post development one-hundred-year storm peak discharge.
The facility must provide an emergency outlet which can discharge the
peak runoff for the post development one-hundred-year storm.
B. Applications for small developments shall include a plan which
describes, narratively and graphically, the type and location of
proposed on-site stormwater management techniques or the proposed
connection to an existing storm sewer system. The plan should show

greater than 15% slope gradient and at two foot intervals for areas with
less than 15% slope; location of watershed and/or subarea boundaries
on the site (if applicable); and any watercourses, floodplains or existing
drainage facilities or structures located on the site.
C. The Borough Engineer shall review and approve the proposed
provisions for stormwater management for a small development. Where
the applicant is proposing to connect to an existing storm sewer, the
applicant shall demonstrate that sufficient capacity exists in the storm
sewer from the point of connection to the point of outlet in the natural
drainage system. The Borough Engineer shall determine if the proposed
development site is part of a larger parcel or tract for which a
stormwater management plan was approved previously and, therefore,

increased impervious area for the land development.
B. If the land development lies within a FEMA delineated floodplain of
a blueline stream as shown on the USGS map, a copy of the
approved DEP stream encroachment permit and all supporting
calculations.
C. If the land development discharges its runoff into a floodway or
natural or man-made swale or ditch, not a blue line on the USGS
map, and is located upstream of a known area of continuous
flooding, the calculations showing that the increase in the peak
water surface elevation at the point of flooding does not increase.

in accordance with the requirements of this Part, will be submitted with
the preliminary and final subdivision or land development plan
application.
2. Review by Borough Engineer and Conservation District. Preliminary
and final stormwater management plans will be reviewed by the
Borough Engineer.
3. Notification of Affected Municipalities. If during the review of the
proposed stormwater management plan, the Borough determines that
properties in adjacent municipalities may be affected by the stormwater
runoff and proposed management system for the site, it will notify the
affected municipality(ies) and provide an opportunity to submit
comments as part of the preliminary or final plan review. Copies of the
plans will be made available to the municipalities upon request.
Comments received will be submitted to the Planning Commission and
Borough Council.
4. Borough Engineer's Review. The Borough Engineer shall approve or
disapprove the preliminary and final stormwater management plan

[Ord. 621, 2/22/1993, § 605; as amended by Ord. 685, 5/11/1998]
2. Stormwater Collection/Conveyance Facilities. For the purpose of
designing storm sewers, open swales and other stormwater runoff
collection and conveyance facilities, the Rational Method shall be
applied. Rainfall intensities for a twenty-five year design storm with a
minimum five minute duration must be used and should be obtained
from the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation's Part II Manual,
Chapter 10, Rainfall Intensity Charts. However, if the exiting Tc is
larger than five minutes, it should be used as the rainfall duration.
3. Detention/Retention Pond. The inflow hydrograph shall be routed
through the detention/retention facility by using the modified puls
method. When using the rational method for developing the inflow
hydrograph, the detention time must be a minimum of 30 minutes for a
five minute storm intensity as specified previously. The routing charts
and outflow hydrographs for each design storm must be submitted.
1. General Design Guidelines.
A. Applicants may select runoff control techniques, or combinations of
techniques, which are most suitable to the level of stormwater
runoff control required, the type of development, and the natural
features of the site. Cost of maintenance shall be one of the
considerations in the designs selected. All controls are subject to
the approval of the Borough Engineer. The Engineer may request
specific information on design and/or operating features of the
proposed stormwater controls in order to determine their
suitability and adequacy in terms of the standards of this Part.
B. In selecting and designing stormwater management systems and
controls, applicants may be guided by the following references:
(1) "Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds," Technical Release
No. 55, USDA, Soil Conservation Service, June 1986 (or most
recent edition).
(2) "Part II Design Manual," the Pennsylvania Department of
Transportation, 1990 edition (or most recent update).

Control," Maryland Water Resources Administration, 1983.
§ 26-154 FOREWORD § 26-155
FWD:569
(6) "Urban Stormwater Management," Special Report No. 49,
American Public Works Administration, 1981.
(7) "Water Resources Protection Measures in Land Development -
A Handbook," University of Delaware Water Resources Center,
April 1974.
(8) "Design and Construction of Sanitary and Storm Sewers,"
WPCF Manual of Practice No. 9, Water Pollution Control
Federation, 1970.
C. The applicant should consider the effect on the proposed
stormwater management techniques of any special soil conditions
or geological hazards which may exist on the development site. In
the event such conditions are identified on the development site,
the Borough may require in-depth studies by a competent
geotechnical engineer.
2. Criteria for Stormwater Detention Facilities.
A. If detention facility(ies) are utilized for the development site, the
facility(ies) shall be designed so that the post development peak
runoff rates from the site are controlled to those rates calculated
for the predevelopment peak runoff rate for the aforementioned
design storms as well.
B. All detention facility(ies) shall be designed and equipped to safely
pass the post-development one-hundred-year storm runoff flows
without damaging (i.e., impairing the continued function of) the
facilities. The facility(ies) must have an emergency outlet which is
able to discharge the post development one-hundred-year peak
flow.
C. Shared storage facilities, which provide detention of runoff for
more than one development site, may be considered within a single
subarea. Such facilities shall meet the design criteria contained in
this section. In addition, runoff from the development sites involved
shall be conveyed to the facility in a manner so as to avoid adverse
impacts, such as flooding or erosion, to channels and properties
located between the development site and the shared storage
facilities.
D. Where detention facilities will be utilized, multiple-use facilities,
such as lakes, ballfields or similar recreational uses, shall be
considered first as storage facilities wherever feasible, subject to
the approval of the Borough.
E. Other considerations which should be incorporated into the design
of the detention facilities include:
(1) Inflow and outflow structures should be designed and installed
to prevent erosion and bottoms of impoundment type
§ 26-155 JEFFERSON HILLS CODE § 26-155
FWD:570
structures must be protected from soil erosion. All outlet
velocities must be calculated and submitted. If riprap is used,
the sizing calculations must be submitted.
(2) Control and removal of debris both in the storage structure and
in all inlet or outlet devices must be a design consideration.
(3) Inflow and outflow structures, pumping stations, and other
structures should be protected and designed to minimize
safety hazards.
(4) The interior slope of a detention/retention pond shall be 3:1.
Restriction of access (fences, walls, etc.) may be necessary
depending on location of the facility.
(5) Detention/retention ponds with a water depth greater than 10
feet shall require a supporting report from a geotechnical
engineer and shall be constructed under the supervision of the
geotechnical engineer.
(6) Landscaping must be provided for the facility which
harmonizes with the surrounding area.
(7) Facility must be accessible for the maintenance purposes,
considering the frequency and type of equipment that will be
required. A maintenance schedule must be submitted and
approved by the Borough.
(8) Details of the facility must be shown on the plan.
(9) A riprap channel with underdrain for low flows must be sized
properly and provided within the pond.
(10) The minimum required freeboard for a detention/retention
pond is one foot and for a detention tank or sump is 1/2 of a
foot above the one-hundred year water surface elevation.
(11) If an underground facility (i.e., tank, sump) is proposed, a
cleanout manhole with steps must be provided.
(12) An emergency spillway must be provided for all detention/
retention facilities. For basins, the spillway must be sized to
pass the entire one-hundred-year post development storm with
one foot of freeboard. Underground systems must have an
emergency outlet set above the 0.5 foot of required freeboard
capable of passing the one-hundred-year post-development
storm.
(13) Outlet control structures shall be constructed of reinforced
concrete (cast-in-place, precast, or block) and provided with
debris grates approved by the Borough Engineer.
§ 26-155 FOREWORD § 26-155
FWD:571
(14) All impoundment areas shall be adequately underdrained to
prevent long term ponding of water.
(15) All detention facilities shall be provided with an access road
(with a legal easement) for maintenance purposes. Such roads
shall be a minimum of 10 feet wide, have a maximum grade of
15%, and be of a stone or impervious surface. Control and
removal of debris both in the storage facility and in all inlet or
outlet devices shall be a design consideration. Inflow and
outflow structures, pumping stations and other structures shall
be protected and designed to minimize safety hazards.
Landscaping shall be provided for the facility which
harmonizes with the surrounding area.
(16) An as-built drawing shall be required for each stormwater
detention facility constructed. The drawing shall represent an
engineering certification of the volume of the facility and its
depth vs. storage relationship. This relationship shall be shown
on the drawing in table form. The drawing shall be stamped by
a registered professional engineer and submitted to the
Borough within 60 days of the completion of the facility. No
facility will be accepted until this requirement has been
fulfilled.
3. Criteria for Collection/Conveyance Facilities.
A. All stormwater runoff collection or conveyance facilities, whether
storm sewer or other open or closed channels, shall be designed in
accordance with the following basic standards:
(1) All sites shall be graded to provide drainage away from and
around the structure in order to prevent any potential flooding
damage.
(2) Lots located on the high side of streets shall extend roof and
French drains to the storm sewer in the street or to the gutter
line of the street if no sewer exists. Lowside lots shall extend
roof and French drains to a stormwater collection/conveyance
system or natural watercourse in accordance with the
approved stormwater management plan for the development
site.
(3) Collection/conveyance facilities should not be installed parallel
and close to the top or bottom of a major embankment to avoid
the possibility of causing the embankment to fail.
(4) All collection/conveyance facilities shall be designed to convey
the twenty-five-year storm peak flow rate from the contributing
drainage area and to carry it to the nearest suitable outlet or
natural watercourse. Off-site conveyance shall be provided
with easements to an existing storm sewer system or natural
watercourse.
§ 26-155 JEFFERSON HILLS CODE § 26-155
FWD:572
(5) Where drainage swales or open channels are used, they shall
be suitably lined to prevent erosion and designed to avoid
excessive velocities. Calculations must be presented for the
velocities and it must be shown that the proposed surface for
the swale is adequate.
(6) Wherever storm sewers are proposed to be utilized, they must
comply with the following criteria:
(a) Designed to traverse under seeded and planted areas. If
constructed within 10 feet of the road paving, walks or
other surfaced areas, the drains shall have a narrow
trench, and maximum compaction of backfill to prevent
settlement of the superimposed surface or development.
(b) Installed after excavating and filling in the area to be
traversed is completed, unless the drain is installed in the
original ground with a minimum of three feet cover and/or
adequate protection during the fill construction.
(c) Designed: (1) with cradle when traversing fill areas of
indeterminate stability, (2) designed with anchors when
gradient exceeds 20%, and (3) designed with encasement
or special backfill requirements when traversing under a
paved area.
(d) Designed to handle adequately the anticipated stormwater
flow and to be constructed and maintained economically.
The minimum pipe size shall be 15 inches in diameter.
(e) Drain pipe, trenching, bedding and backfilling
requirements shall conform to the requirements of the
Borough and/or applicable requirements of the
Pennsylvania Department of Highways Specifications,
current Form 408.
(f) All corrugated metal pipe shall be polymer coated, with
bonding and paved inverts where prone to erode. Pipe
under a Borough cartway shall be reinforced concrete pipe
with a minimum diameter of 15 inches.
(g) Storm inlets and structures shall be designed to be
adequate, safe, self-cleaning and unobtrusive and shall be
consistent with the standards of the Borough.
(h) Appropriate grates shall be designed for all catch basins,
stormwater inlets and other entrance appurtenances in
accordance with Borough specifications.
(i) Manholes shall be designed so that the top shall be at
finished grade and sloped to conform to slope of finished
grade. Top castings of structures located in roads or

2/22/1993, § 606]
Proposed erosion/sedimentation measures should be submitted with the
stormwater management plan. These plans shall follow the guidelines set
forth in the Borough's Erosion and Sediment Pollution Control Ordinance
[Chapter 9].
parking areas shall be machined or installed to preclude
"rattling."
(j) Where a proposed storm sewer connects with an existing
storm sewer system, the applicant shall demonstrate that
sufficient capacity exists in the downstream system to
handle the additional stormwater flow.
(k) Storm sewer outfalls shall be equipped with energy
dissipators to prevent erosion and conform with applicable
requirements of the PA DEP for stream encroachments
(Chapter 105 of the Department's rules and regulations).

That there are unique physical circumstances ·or conditions, including irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or shape, or exceptional topographic or other physical conditions peculiar to the particular property, and that the unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions, and not to circumstances or conditions generally created by the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance in the neighborhood or district in which the property is located;

NONCONFORMING USES,STRUCTURES AND LOTS


Statement of Intent


The zoning districts established by this Ordinance are designed to guide future use of land in the Borough by encouraging the development of desirable residential, commercial and industrial areas. with appropriate groupings of compatible and related uses, to the end of promoting and protecting the public health, safety,comfort, prosperity and other aspects of the general welfare.

To achieve this end, lawful existing uses which would be prohibited or restricted under the tenns of this Ordinance, or future amendments, and which do not conform to the character and regulations of the zoning district in which they are located shall be subject to certain limitations.

Similarly, buildings or other structures which do not comply with one or more of the applicable district requirements as to lot width, minimum lot area and yard spaces, lot coverages , or building height, are deemed to be nonconfonning.

Nonconforming uses and structures will generally be permitted to remain; the purpose of

regulating  them  is  to  restrict  further  investment  in  uses  ·or  structures   which   are        inappropriate to their location, except when the Zoning Hearing Board determines that the
enlargement, expansion or extension is necessitated by the natural expansion and growth
of trade.   Further, nonconforming  s·ing·le family dwellings  on lots previously  laid out nr
recorded shall not be deemed to be inappropriate to their location by virtue of the existence
of the plan of lots in which they are located and shall have special requirements for their reconstruction or expansion.


To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this Ordinance shall be deemed to require a change in plans, construction, or intended use of any building on which actual construction was
·lawfully begun prior to the effective date , or amendment, of this Ordinance and on which
actual building construction has been diligently carried on.

No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased or e>ctended to occupy greater lot area than was occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance, unless the Zoning Hearing Board shall interpret that the enlargement or extension is necessitated by the natural expansion and growth of trade of the nonconforming use.

No such nonconformin.g use shall be moved in whole or in part to any other portion of the lot occupied by such use at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance.

Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any part of a structure which was manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any lot or portion of a lot outside such structure, except  on ·a lot or portion of a lot owned at the time the use became

BOROUGH OF JEFFERSON HILLS ALLEGHENY COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA

ORDINANCE NO 833

AN ORDINANCE OF THE BOROUGH OF JEFFERSON HILLS, ALLEGHENY COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA, PROVIDING FOR THE ZONING OF OIL AND GAS DRILLING OPERATIONS.

SECTION 1. Legislative Findings and Purpose

l.	Legislative Findings

A.	The Borough Council of Jefferson Hills finds that the proposed new provisions regarding the zoning of oil and gas operations will promote the public health, safety and welfare and practical community development in the Borough of Jefferson Hills and will provide for gas and oil drilling to take place in areas of the Borough in locations which will allow extraction of gas and oil with the least detrimental impact on residentially zoned property, historic or recreational resources, hospitals, nursing homes, daycare centers and schools. As such, the proposed provisions will further the goals of the Comprehensive Plan to preserve the single family character of the Borough, to manage and promote future growth and to protect natural sites.

B.	Information provided to the Borough Council and Planning Commission by property owners, Department of Environmental Protection and gas experts indicates that horizontal drilling techniques allow for gas to be extracted at distances of up to and in excess of seven thousand five hundred (7,500) feet from the well site. The regulation of well sites herein will permit reasonable access to a large percentage of the gas resources in the Borough, while protecting certain other uses and  by regulating gas and oil well use  in  a manner similar to other permitted mineral removal without regulating the technical aspects of oil and gas well functioning and matters ancillary thereto.

C.	The Borough Council has been informed that heavy truck traffic generated by mineral removal activities can severely damage roads, creating safety hazards to the travelling public and imposing great  repair  and  reconstruction  costs upon the Borough. Therefore, to protect the safety of the public and the Borough's sound fiscal operation, it is necessary that advance secured arrangements for repair or replacement of such roads damaged by mineral removal generated traffic be required as a condition of approval.

D.	The Borough's experience with mineral removal activity is that extensive engineering and legal resources are consumed in the review process. Due to
 


the number and complexity of land use issues to be addressed and required interaction with other regulatory agencies, a higher application fee and review fee deposit is warranted.

E. The Borough Council has given due public notice, held the requisite hearing and	duly notified the Allegheny County Department of Economic Development as it pertains to the proposed rezoning and the Planning Commission has made a recommendation.

2.	Purpose

It is hereby declared to be the purpose of this chapter to declare the Development of Oil and Gas as a conditional use within newly created designated overlay zoning districts based upon the type of drilling conducted within a site. The purpose of this ordinance is to provide for the health, safety and welfare of the residents and their property in the Borough of Jefferson Hills; to provide the procedure for the issuance of zoning permits to enable the exploration or production of oil or natural gas from a shale reservoir or source rock; to protect the character of the community, facilitating beneficial and compatible land uses; and to further the Borough's interest in the orderly development and use of land in a manner consistent with local demographic and land use concerns.

Jefferson Hills recognizes that the regulation of oil and gas operations is the primary responsibility of the regulatory agencies of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, but that the Borough maintains its zoning powers as set forth in Pennsylvania Statute Title 53, Municipal Planning Code ("MPC") and through the Borough of Jefferson Hills Zoning Ordinance. It is in the Borough's best interest to address the Zoning districts where such activities will be permitted by Conditional Use and to have information concerning oil and gas exploration, development, and production taking place within the Borough and to ensure certain security and safety measures related to oil and gas well drilling are in place in certain areas. It is further necessary to define and classify Natural Gas Compressor Stations and Natural Gas Processing Plants as conditional uses within the 1-2 zoning district, and establish appropriate standards to protect the public, health, safety and welfare from potential impacts of these uses.
