Manager certifies that there are available for appropriations revenues in
excess of those estimated in the budget, Council may by ordinance make
supplemental appropriations for the year up to the amount of such excess.
   (b)   Emergency Appropriations. To meet a declared public emergency
affecting life, health, safety, property, or the public peace, Council may make
emergency appropriations. Such appropriations may be made by emergency
ordinance, but such ordinances may not levy taxes, grant, renew, or extend a

are no available unappropriated revenues to meet such appropriations. Council
may by such emergency ordinance authorize the issuance of emergency notes which
may be renewed from time to time.
   (c)   Reduction of Appropriations. If, at any time during the fiscal year it
appears probable to the City Manager that the revenues available will be
insufficient to meet the amount appropriated, the City Manager shall report to
Council without delay, indicating the estimated amount of the deficit, any
remedial action taken, and recommendations as to any other steps to be taken.
Council shall then take such further action as it deems necessary to prevent or
minimize any deficit and for that purpose it may, by ordinance, reduce one or
more appropriations.
   (d)   Transfer of Appropriations. At any time during the fiscal year the
City Manager, with the consent of Council, may transfer part or all on any
unencumbered appropriation balance among programs within a department, except
that appropriations for Capital Program expenditures shall be excluded from
this provision, and after the first six (6) months of the fiscal year, the City
Manager, with the consent of Council, may transfer part of all of any
unencumbered appropriation balance from one department to another. Such actions
shall be by ordinance.
   (e)   Limitations: Effective Date. No appropriation for debt service may be
reduced or transferred, and no appropriation may be reduced below any amount
required by law to be appropriated or by more than the amount of the
unencumbered balance thereof. The supplemental and emergency appropriations and
reduction or transfer of appropriations authorized by this section may be made
effective immediately upon adoption of the ordinance.
§ 910.  Lapse of Appropriations.
   Every appropriation, except an appropriation for a Capital Program
expenditure, shall lapse at the close of the fiscal year to the extent that it
has not been expended or encumbered. An appropriation for a Capital Program
expenditure shall continue in force until the purpose for which it was made has
been accomplished or abandoned. An appropriated project or program shall be
deemed abandoned if two (2) years pass without any disbursement from, or
encumbrance of, the appropriation.
§ 911.  Administration of Budget.
   At such time as the City Manager shall specify, each department, office or
agency shall submit work programs for the ensuing fiscal year showing the

increased revenue generated by the earned income tax.
(Amendment approved by the electorate November, 2014)
§ 915.  Payment of Funds.

surety companies authorized to do business in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
and duly licensed by the Insurance Commissioner of said Commonwealth.
   Each bond shall be conditioned upon the faithful discharge by the officer,
the clerks, assistants, and appointees of all trusts confided in them by virtue
of their office, upon the faithful execution of all duties required of them by
virtue of their office, upon the just and faithful accounting or payment over,
according to law, of all moneys and all balances thereof paid to, received or

of all books, papers, documents, or other official things held in right of the
office. All such bonds and sureties thereon, before being accepted by the City,

   (a)   Introduction. A proposed ordinance may be introduced by any
Councilmember at any regular or special meeting of Council as long as the
introduction of said ordinance has been properly placed on the agenda or is
included in the notice of special meeting. Upon introduction of any proposed
ordinance, the City Clerk shall distribute a copy of the proposed ordinance to
each Councilmember, the City Manager, and shall file a reasonable number of
copies in the office of the City Clerk and such other public places as Council
may designate.
   (b)   Prior Publication. If the ordinance is approved by Council for
introduction, Council shall publish the proposed ordinance together with a
notice setting forth the date, time and place for a public hearing thereon when
the proposed ordinance shall receive further consideration by Council. The full
text of the proposed ordinance need not be published; instead the title and
general substance of the proposed ordinance will be sufficient, along with a
designation of the places where copies of the full text of the proposed
ordinance are filed and the times when they are available for public
inspection.
   (c)   Adoption by Council. Provided that the citizens of the City have been
given an opportunity to express their views at the public hearing prior to

special meeting of Council. If there is a postponement and no announcement made
at the time of postponement of a latter date, time and place when the ordinance
will receive further consideration, or if an amendment makes any changes in the

action may be taken until the proposed ordinance has again been published in
accordance with subsection (b) of this section.
   (d)   "Publish" defined. As used in this section, the term "publish" shall
mean to post and display on the official City website for a period of seven (7)
consecutive days not more than thirty (30) days prior to the public hearing at
which the proposed ordinance is to be considered. To the extent any proposed
ordinance is required by law to be published by newspaper advertisement, the
term "publish" shall mean, in addition to posting on the official City website
in the manner set forth in this section, to advertise in a newspaper of general
circulation in the City not more than thirty (30) days nor less than seven (7)
days prior to the public hearing at which the proposed ordinance is to be
considered.
§ 1105.  Effective Date.
   Except as otherwise provided by law or this charter, all ordinances shall
become effective on the tenth (10th) day after adoption or at any later date
specified therein.

verified by the signature of Council President or other member of Council
presiding at the meeting where final action thereon was taken. The City Clerk
shall affix the official seal of the City to the original copy of each
ordinance and shall attest the signature of the other signatory.

adoption or at such later time as it may specify.  Every emergency ordinance
except one made pursuant to §
909(b) of this charter shall automatically stand repealed as of the sixty first
(61st) day following the date on which it was adopted, but this shall not
prevent re-enactment of the ordinance in the manner specified in this section
if the emergency still exists. An emergency ordinance may also be repealed by
adoption of a repealing ordinance in the same manner specified in this section
for adoption of emergency ordinances.

sufficiency, specifying if it is insufficient the particulars wherein it is
defective and shall promptly send a copy of the certificate to the petitioners'
committee by registered mail. A petition certified insufficient for lack of the
required number of valid signatures may be amended once if the petitioners'
committee files a notice of intention to amend with the City Clerk within two
(2) days after receiving the copy of the City Clerk's certificate and files a
supplementary petition upon additional papers within ten (10) days after
receiving a copy of such certificate. Such supplementary petition shall comply
with the requirements of subsections (b) and (c) of §
1603, and within five (5) days after it is filed, the City Clerk shall complete
a certificate as to the sufficiency of the petition as amended and promptly
send a copy of such certificate to the petitioners' committee by registered
mail as in the case of an original petition. If a petition or amended petition
is certified sufficient, or if a petition or amended petition is certified
insufficient and the petitioners' committee does not elect to amend or request
Council to review pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section within the time

Council and the certificate shall then be a final determination as to the
sufficiency of the petition.

the petitioner's committee does not file notice of intention to amend or if an
amended petition has been certified insufficient, the committee may, within two
(2) days after receiving the copy of such certificate file a request that it be
reviewed by Council. Council shall review the certificate at its next public
meeting following the filing of such request and approve or disapprove it, and
Council's determination shall then be a final determination as to the
sufficiency of the petition.
   (c)   Court Review; New Petition. A final determination as to the
sufficiency of a petition shall be subject to court review. A final
determination of insufficiency, even if sustained upon court review, shall not

sufficient, it shall submit the proposed initiative or referred ordinance to
the voters of the City.

be made available at the polls.
   (c)   Withdrawal of Petitions. An initiative or referendum petition may be
withdrawn at any time prior to the fifteenth (15th) day preceding the day
scheduled for a vote of the City by filing with the City Clerk a request for
withdrawal signed by a least four (4) members of the petitioners' committee.
Upon the filing of such request, the petition shall have no further force or
effect and all proceedings shall thereon be terminated.
§ 1607.  Results of Election.
   (a)   Initiative. If a majority of the qualified electors voting on a
proposed initiative ordinance vote in its favor, it shall be considered adopted
upon certification of the election results and shall be treated in all respects
in the same manner as an ordinance of the same kind adopted by Council. If
conflicting ordinances are approved at the same election, the ordinance
receiving the greatest number of affirmative votes shall prevail to the extent
of such conflict.
   (b)   Referendum. If a majority of the qualified electors voting on a
referendum ordinance vote against it, it shall be considered repealed upon
certification of the election results.

as quickly as possible, so as to insure efficiency and promote employee morale.
   Should any employee or group of employees feel aggrieved as a result of any
condition arising out of the employee-employer relationship, including the
claim of unjust discrimination on any matter or condition affecting health and
safety beyond those normally encountered in all phases of their employment,
adjustment shall be sought as follows by the employee or group of employees, in
writing, through a representative of their grievance committee who is employed
by the City, within two days from the infraction.
   (a)   The matter shall first be presented in writing and then discussed with
the employee's grievance representative. Such written grievance shall then be
discussed with the chief or head of the department.  If such discussion does
not resolve the grievance within five days, exclusive of Saturdays and Sundays,
it may be processed to the next step.
   (b)   Within five days, exclusive of Saturdays and Sundays, from receiving
an answer from the chief in writing, the grievance shall be presented in
writing to the City Manager. The City Manager shall give his answer in writing
within ten days, exclusive of Saturdays and Sundays, of the receipt of the
grievance. If this answer does not resolve the grievance, it may be processed
to the next step.
   (c)   The grievance shall be presented to Council in writing within ten days
before its next regular meeting. Council shall then hold a closed hearing on
the grievance by or on the date of its next regular meeting and give its answer
in writing at the following regular  meeting. At this hearing the employees
shall be represented by not more than three representatives who shall also be
employees of the City.
   In steps (a) and (b) the employees shall be represented by one grievance
representative, who is also employed by the City. If the grievance is not
processed within the time limits established in this section, it shall be
presumed that the grievance has been satisfactorily resolved at the first step
to which it has been properly processed.  If the various department heads fail
to answer the grievance within the time limits established in this section, it
shall be presumed that the claim made in the grievance is sustained and that
the satisfaction requested will be provided.
   The time limits specified in this section may be extended by agreement of
both parties.

period, or manner of payment from a specific benefit provided under the Plan,
but having the same value when computed using the applicable mortality table

   (c)   Relationship to Social Security. No change in the Social Security Act
after the date of a participant's separation from service shall affect the
benefits as described under this Plan.
   (d)   Maximum Benefits.
      (1)   Subject to exceptions below, the maximum annual benefit payable to
a participant under this Plan in any limitation year shall equal ninety
thousand dollars ($90,000).
      (2)   For purposes of this Plan, "annual benefit" means the benefit which
would be payable in the form of a straight life annuity with no ancillary
benefit or a qualified joint and survivor annuity.
      (3)   Preservation of current accrued benefit under the Plan.
         A.   In general, this division (d)(3) shall apply to defined benefit
plans that were in existence on May 6, 1986, and that met the applicable
requirements of Code Section 415 as in effect for all limitation years.
         B.   If the current accrued benefit of an individual who is a
participant as of the first day of the limitation year beginning on or after
January 1, 1987, exceeds the benefit limitations under Code Section 415(6)9
then for purposes of Code Section 415(6) and (e), the defined benefit dollar
limitation with respect to such individual shall be equal to such current
accrued benefit.
         C.   "Current accrued benefit" shall mean a participant's accrued
benefit under the Plan, determined as if the participant had separated from
service as of the close of the last limitation year beginning before January 1,
1987, when expressed as an annual benefit within the meaning of Code Section
415(6)(2). In determining the amount of a participant's current accrued
benefit, the following shall be disregarded:
            1.   Any change in the terms and conditions of the Plan after May
5, 1986; and
            2.   Any cost-of-living adjustment occurring after May 5, 1986.
      (4)   The dollar limitation under Code Section 415(b)(1)(A) stated in
division (a)(1) of this section shall be adjusted annually as provided in Code
Section 415(d) pursuant to the Regulations and IRS Pronouncements. The adjusted
limitation is effective as of January 1 of each calendar year and is applicable
to limitation years ending with or within that calendar year.
      (5)   Applicable limitations above for participants who have separated
from service with a nonforfeitable right to an accrued benefit shall be
adjusted annually as provided in Code Section 415(d) pursuant to the
Regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury.
      (6)   For purposes of divisions (d) and (e) of this section, all defined
benefit plans of the employer, whether or not terminated, are to be treated as
one defined benefit plan and all defined contribution plans of the employer,
whether or not terminated, are to be treated as one defined contribution plan
of the employer.
      (7)   In the case of a group of related employers, all such employers
shall be considered a single employer for purposes of applying the limitation
of Section 415 of the Code.
      (8)   To the extent applicable, the above provisions and limitations
shall be governed by Code Section 415(b)(2)(F) and Code Section 415(b)(2)(G).
   (e)   Adjustments to Annual Benefit and Limitations.
      (1)   If the annual benefit begins before the participant's and new Plan
participant's Social Security retirement age, then the ninety thousand dollar
($90,000) limitation shall be reduced in such manner as the Secretary of the
Treasury shall prescribe which is consistent with the reduction for old-age
insurance benefits commencing before the Social Security retirement age.
      (2)   Notwithstanding division (a) of this section, for limitation years
beginning prior to January 1, 1987, the ninety thousand dollar ($90,000) limit
shall not be reduced if the annual benefit begins on or after age 62. If the
annual benefit begins before age 62, the ninety thousand dollar ($90,000)
limitation (but not the 100 percent of compensation limitation) shall be
reduced so that it is the actuarial equivalent of the ninety thousand dollar
($90,000) limitation beginning at age 62. However, the ninety thousand dollar
($90,000) limitation shall not be reduced to less than:
         A   Seventy-five thousand dollars ($75,000) if the annual benefit
commences on or after age 55; or
         B.   The amount which is the actuarial equivalent of seventy-five
thousand dollars ($75,000) at age 55 if the annual benefit commences prior to
age 55.
   For purposes of adjusting the ninety thousand dollar ($90,000) limitation
applicable prior to age 62 or the seventy-five thousand dollar ($75,000)
limitation prior to age 55, the adjustment shall be based on an interest rate
assumption of five percent and no mortality decrement. The above adjustment
shall not apply in the case of a survivor benefit or a disability benefit.
      (3)   If the annual benefit begins after the participant's and new Plan
participant's Social Security retirement age (or for limitation years beginning
prior to January 1, 1987, age 65), the ninety thousand dollar ($90,000)
limitation shall be increased so that it is the actuarial equivalent of the
ninety thousand dollar ($90,000) limitation at the participant's and new Plan
participant's Social Security retirement age (or for limitation years beginning
prior to January 1, 1987, age 65).  For purposes of adjusting the ninety
thousand dollar ($90,000) limitation applicable after the participant's Social
Security retirement age (or for limitation years beginning prior to January 1,
1987, age 65), the adjustment shall be based upon an interest rate assumption
of five percent and no mortality decrement. In no event, however, shall the
aforesaid dollar limitation be reduced to an amount less than that required by
the Code and the above limitations shall not apply to survivor or disability
pensions paid pursuant to the Plan.
      (4)   For purposes of adjusting any annual benefit under divisions (d)
(2), (e)(1), (e)(2) and/or (e)(3) of this section, no adjustments shall be
taken into account before the limitation year for which such adjustment first
takes effect. For purposes of employing any limitation, a separate limitation
may apply to police and firefighters.
      (5)   A.   If a participant who is not receiving a disability benefit
under the Plan has less than ten years of participation in the Plan at the time
he or she begins to receive benefits under the Plan, the ninety thousand dollar
($90,000) limitation shall be reduced by multiplying such limitation by a
fraction:
            1.   The numerator of which is the number of years of participation
(or part thereof) in the Plan; and
            2.   The denominator of which is ten, provided that said fraction
shall in no event be less than one-tenth.
         B.   Notwithstanding the foregoing, for limitation years beginning
prior to January 1, 1987, if a participant has fewer than ten years of service
with the employer at the time he or she begins to receive benefits under the
Plan, the maximum annual benefit payable to the retired participant shall be
reduced by multiplying such maximum annual benefit by a fraction:
            1.   The numerator of which is the number of years of service, or
part thereof, with the employer; and
            2.   The denominator of which is ten.
      (6)   Notwithstanding other limitations of this section with respect to a
participant included under the prior provisions of this Plan, the maximum
benefit computed under this section shall be a participant's accrued benefit
payable under the Plan provisions in effect at the close of the last Plan year
beginning before January 1, 1983, if such accrued benefit is greater than the
maximum annual benefit provided for in Section
286.04 based upon his or her rate of compensation under the Plan in effect as
of such date and based on the years of service to the date his or her
employment is terminated. For purposes of calculating a participant's accrued
benefit under this division, no changes in the terms and conditions of the plan
after July 1, 1982, and no cost-of-living adjustments after July 1, 1982, shall
be taken into account.
   (f)   Multiple Plan Reduction  The provisions contained in this division (f)
shall not apply to Plan limitation years after 1999.
      (1)   A.   If a participant has at any time participated in one or more
defined benefit plans and one or more defined contributions plans maintained by
the employer, the sum of the defined benefit plan fraction and the defined
contribution plan fraction for any limitation year may not exceed 1.0.  In the
case of an individual who was a participant in one or more defined benefit
plans of the employer as of the first day of the first limitation year
beginning after December 31, 1986, the application of the limitations of this
section shall not cause the maximum permissible amount for such individual
under all such defined benefit plans to be less than the individual's current
accrued benefit. The preceding sentence applies only if such defined benefit
plans met the requirements of Code Section 415, for all limitation years
beginning before January 1, 1987.
         B.   The defined benefit plan fraction for any limitation year is a
fraction, the numerator of which is the participant's projected annual benefit
under the Plan (determined as of the close of the limitation year pursuant to
Regulations 1.415-7(b)(3)), and the denominator of which is the lesser of:
            1.   The product of 1.25 multiplied by the maximum dollar
limitation in effect under Code Section 415(b)(1)(A) for such limitation year;
or
            2.   The product of 1.4 multiplied by the amount which may be taken
into account under Code Section 415(b)(1)(B) for such limitation year.
         C.   The defined contribution plan fraction for any limitation year is
a fraction, the numerator of which is the sum of the annual additions to the
participant's accounts for such limitation year and for all prior limitation
years, and the denominator of which is the sum of the lesser of the following
amounts determined for such year and each prior year of service with the
employer:
            1.   The product of 1.25 multiplied by the dollar limitation in
effect under Code Section 415(c)(1)(A) for such year (determined without regard
to Code Section 415(c)(6)); or
            2.   The product of 1.4 multiplied by the amount which may be taken
into account under Code Section 415(c)(1)(B) for such year.
         D.   For the purpose of this division, the term "participant's
account" shall mean the account established and maintained for each participant
with respect to his or her total interest in the defined contribution plan
maintained by the employer resulting from annual additions.
         E.   The annual addition allocated to pay any participant's account
under this Plan in a limitation year, plus all annual additions allocated to
such participant under any other defined contribution plan of the employer for
such limitation year, shall not exceed the lesser of (i) thirty thousand
dollars ($30,000) (or such greater amount as may be determined by the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue Service for Limitation Years ending on or
after January 1, 1988, as a cost-of-living adjustment), or (ii) twenty-five
percent of such participant's compensation.
         F.   "Annual additions" means the sum credited to a participant's
account for any limitation year of:
            1.   Employer contributions;
            2.   Employee contributions;
            3.   Forfeitures;
            4.   Amounts allocated after March 31, 1984, to any individual
medical account, as defined in Code Section 4150)(2) which is part of a pension
of annuity plan maintained by the employer; and
            5.   Amounts derived from contributions paid or accrued after
December 31, 1985, in taxable years ending after such date, which are
attributable to post-retirement medical benefits allocated to a separate
account of a key employee (as defined in Code Section 419A(d)(3)) under a
welfare benefit plan (as defined in Code Section 419(e)) maintained by the
employer.
         G.   Notwithstanding the foregoing, for Plan years beginning prior to
January 1, 1987, only that portion of employee contributions equal to the
lesser of employee contributions in excess of six percent of compensation or
one-half of employee contributions shall be considered an annual addition.
         H.   The annual addition for any limitation year beginning before
January 1, 1987, shall not be recomputed to treat all employee contributions as
an annual addition.
         I.   If the Plan satisfied Code Section 415 as in effect for all
limitation years beginning before January 1, 1987, an amount shall be
subtracted from the numerator of the defined contribution plan fraction (not
exceeding such numerator) as prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury so
that the sum of the defined benefit plan fraction and defined contribution plan
fraction computed under Section 415(e)(1), as amended by the Tax Reform Act of
1986, does not exceed 1.0 for such limitation year.
         J.   For years beginning after December 31, 2001, annual additions
shall be calculated in conformance with the Economic Growth and Tax
Reconciliation Act of 2001.
      (2)   Except as specifically permitted in the Regulations of the
Secretary of the Treasury under Section 415 of the Code, the benefits paid or
payable at any time shall not exceed the limitations of division (a) of this
section.
      (3)   Special rule for defined contribution fraction for defined
contribution plan in effect on or before July 1, 1982.  Council may elect, for
any limitation year ending after December 31, 1982, that the amount taken into
account in the denominator for every participant and new Plan participant for
all limitation years ending before January 1, 1983, shall be an amount equal to
the product of:
         A.   The denominator for the limitation year ending in 1982 determined
under the law in effect for the limitation year ending in 1982, multiplied by,
         B.   The "transition fraction".  The term "transition fraction" shall
mean a fraction:
            1.   The numerator of which is the lesser of:
               a.   Fifty-one thousand eight hundred seventy-five dollars
($51,875); or
               b.   1.4 multiplied by twenty-five percent of the participant's
compensation for the limitation year ending in 1981; and
            2.   The denominator of which is the lesser of:
               a.   Forty-one thousand five hundred dollars ($41,500); or
               b.   Twenty-five percent of the participant's compensation for
the limitation year ending in 1981.
         C.   Notwithstanding the foregoing, for any limitation year in which
the Plan is a top heavy Plan, forty-one thousand five hundred dollars ($41,500)
shall be substituted for fifty-one thousand eight hundred seventy-five dollars
($51,875) in determining the "transition fraction" unless the extra minimum
benefit is provided pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code. However, for any
limitation year in which this Plan is a top heavy plan, forty-one thousand five
hundred dollars ($41,500) shall be substituted for fifty-one thousand eight
hundred seventy-five dollars ($51,875) in any event.
      (4)   If the sum of the defined benefit plan fraction and the defined
contribution plan fraction shall exceed 1.0 in any limitation year for any
participant in the Plan, for reasons other than those described in division (f)
(5) of this section, Council shall adjust the numerator of the defined benefit
plan fraction so that the sum of both fractions shall not exceed 1.0 in any
limitation year for such participant.
      (5)   If the substitution of 1.00 for 1.25 and forty-one thousand five
hundred dollars ($41,500) for fifty-one thousand eight hundred seventy-five
dollars ($51,875) above or the excess benefit accruals or annual additions
provided for in Internal Revenue Service Notice 82-19 cause the 1.0 limitation
to be exceeded for any participant in any limitation year, such participant
shall be subject to the following restrictions for each future limitation year
until the 1.0 limitation is satisfied:
         A.   The participant's accrued benefit shall not increase;
         B.   No annual additions may be credited to a participant's account;
and
         C.   No employee contributions (voluntary or mandatory) shall be made
under any defined benefit plan or any defined contribution plan of the
employer.
   (g)   Incorporation of Code Section 415 by Reference. Notwithstanding
anything contained in this chapter to the contrary, the limitations,
adjustments, and other requirements prescribed in this chapter shall at all
times comply with the provisions of Code Section 415 (as such apply to
governmental plans) and the Regulations thereunder, the terms of which are
specifically incorporated herein by reference. Thus, for the first 415
limitation year beginning after December 31, 1994, the applicable mortality
table described in Rev. Ruling 956, 1995-1 C.B. 80 shall be utilized, and
effective for Plan years beginning after December 31, 1997, the term
compensation for Code Section 415 purposes, in accordance with Section 415(c)
(3)(D) of the Code and Treasury Regulation Section 1.415-2(d), shall include

of this Plan to the contrary, contributions, benefits and service credit with
respect to qualified military service will be provided in accordance with

expectancy of the participant in accordance with Regulations. The above
division (g)(1)A. shall not impact the benefit of any survivor or beneficiary.
      (2)   Distributions to a participant and his or her beneficiaries shall
only be made in accordance with the incidental death benefit requirements of
Code Section 401(a)(9)(G) and the Regulations thereunder.
   (h)   Time of Payment of Benefits.
      (1)   Unless elected otherwise as provided in division (b) of this
section, payment of benefits must begin no later than 60 days after the close
of the Plan year which the latest of the following events occurs:
         A.   The attainment of normal retirement age;
         B.   The termination of a participant's service with the employer.
      (2)   Payment of benefits shall begin on the date elected by the
participant (subject to the restrictions of Subsection
286.06(f)). The election shall be made in writing, signed by the participant
and submitted to the Commission, and shall describe the date on which payments
are to begin.
   (i)   Minimum Monthly Pension Benefit.  The minimum monthly pension benefit
payable to a participant or his or her surviving spouse who is otherwise
entitled to a monthly pension benefit under the terms of this Plan, shall be
$1,000.00 per month. Upon the death of a surviving spouse or if no spouse
survives the death of the participant, 50% of the minimum monthly pension (100%
in the case of disability pensions) that would otherwise be payable to the
participant or surviving spouse under this subsection, shall be paid to the
surviving children of the participant in equal shares until the death or
attainment of age 18 by each child. In the event that no spouse or children
under the age of 18 survive the participant, no minimum benefit shall be
payable under this section. The minimum monthly pension benefit payable under
this subsection does not apply where there is a return of participant
contributions pursuant to the terms of this Plan. There is no minimum monthly
pension benefit payable under this section to a beneficiary who is not the
surviving spouse or a child of the participant under the age of 18.
(Ord. 01-04.  Passed 3-25-04; Ord. 01-19.  Passed 3-27-19.)
286.07  DEATH BENEFITS
   (a)   Death Benefits.  Upon a participant's death prior to his or her
retirement date, his or her beneficiary will be entitled to receive a death
benefit equal to a refund of the participant's contributions (without interest)
including any pick-up contributions pursuant to Section
286.03(b)(6).
   (b)   Beneficiary Designation.  "Beneficiary" shall mean the person or
entity designated by the participant to receive a refund of the participant's
contributions (without interest) should the participant die prior to becoming
entitled to a retirement benefit. In the event that a participant does not
designate a beneficiary or the beneficiary does not survive the participant,
the beneficiary shall be the surviving spouse, or if there is no surviving
spouse, the participant's children, or if there are no surviving children, the
estate; but if no personal representative has been appointed, to those persons
who would be entitled to the estate under the intestacy laws of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania if the participant had died intestate and a
resident of Pennsylvania.
   (c)   Survivor Benefit.  The survivor benefit paid pursuant to Sections
286.04(a),
286.04(b),
286.06(b),
288.06(c), (when the participant would have reached 55 years of age) or
286.06(d) shall be a pension equal to the pension the participant was receiving
or would have received had he been retired at the time of his or her death and
shall be paid to the surviving spouse until the date of death of the surviving
spouse. Upon the death of the surviving spouse of a participant, 50 percent
(100 percent in the case of disability pensions) of the pension the participant
was receiving or would have been eligible to receive had he or she been retired
at the time of his or her death shall be paid monthly in equal shares to the
surviving children of the deceased participant until the death or attainment of
age 18 of each child. The shares payable to the surviving children shall be
adjusted as each child ceases to be eligible to receive a share of the benefit
hereunder due to death or attainment of age 18. The payee above, whether the
spouse or the children shall be defined herein as the survivor.
   (d)   Distribution of Minor Beneficiary. In the event a distribution is to
be made to a minor, then the Commission shall direct that such distribution be
paid to the legal guardian, or if none, to a parent of such minor or a
responsible adult with whom the minor maintains his or her residence, or to the
custodian for such minor under the Uniform Gift to Minors Act or Gift to Minors
Act, if such is permitted by the laws of the state in which said minor resides.
Such a payment to the legal guardian or parent of a minor shall fully discharge
the Commission, employer and Plan from liability on account thereof.
(Ord. 01-02.  Passed 4-8-02.)
286.08  TERMINATION OF SERVICE BEFORE RETIREMENT/DIRECT ROLLOVER OF
DISTRIBUTIONS.
   (a)   Forfeitures.  Upon the forfeiture of any non-vested portion of a
participant's accrued benefit, the amount of such forfeiture shall be credited
against the future contributions of the employer under the Plan as provided
under Section
286.03(a).
   (b)   Return of Contributions. A participant who terminates employment for
causes other than death or disability prior to entitlement to a pension
hereunder, the total amount of the contributions paid into the pension fund by
such member including pick-up contributions (pursuant to Section
286.03(b)(6)) shall be refunded to him or her without interest. If any such
member shall have returned to him or her the amount contributed, and shall
afterward again become a member of the Police Department, he or she shall not
be entitled to the pension designated until 20 years after his or her re-
employment (and upon reaching age 50, if later,) unless he or she shall return
to the pension fund the amount withdrawn, in which event the period of 20 years
shall be computed from the time the member first became a member of the Police
Department, excluding therefrom any period of time during which the member was
not employed by the Police Department.
   (c)   Direct Rollover of Eligible Rollover Distribution.
      (1)   This division (c) applies to distributions made on or after January
1, 1993. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary that would
otherwise limit a distributee's election under this division (c), a distributee
may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by Council, to have any
portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible
retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover.
      (2)   For purposes of applying this division (c):
         A.   An "eligible rollover distribution" is any distribution of all or
any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an
eligible rollover distribution does not include any distribution that is one of
a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than
annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee's
designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten years or more; any
distribution to the extent such distribution is required under Section 4.01(a)
(9) of the Code; and the portion of any distribution that is not includable in
gross income (determined without regard to the exclusion for net unrealized
appreciation with respect to employer securities).
         B.   An "eligible retirement plan" is an individual retirement account
described in Section 408(a) of the Code, an individual retirement annuity
described in Section 408(b) of the Code, an annuity plan described in Section
403(a) of the Code, or a qualified trust described in Section 401(a) of the
Code, that accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution. However,
in the case of an eligible rollover distribution to the surviving spouse, an
eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account or individual
retirement annuity.
         C.   A "distributee" includes an employee or former employee. In
addition, the employee's or former employee's surviving spouse and the
employee's or former employee's spouse or former spouse who is the alternate
payee under a qualified domestic relations order, as defined in Section 414(p)
of the Code, are distributees with regard to the interest of the spouse or
former spouse.
         D.   A "direct rollover" is a payment by the Plan to the eligible
retirement plan specified by the distributee.
      (3)   This section shall apply to distributions made after December 31,
2001:
         A.   Modification of definition of eligible retirement plan. For
purposes of the direct rollover provisions in Section
286.08(c) of the Plan, an eligible retirement plan shall also mean an annuity
contract described in Section 403(b) of the Code and an eligible plan under
Section 457(b) of the Code which is maintained by a state, political
subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or
political subdivision of a state and which agrees to separately account for
amounts transferred into such plan from this plan. The definition of eligible
retirement plan shall also apply in the case of a distribution to a surviving
spouse, or to a spouse or former spouse who is the alternate payee pursuant to
a domestic relations order as provided by applicable state law. In evaluating
any such domestic relations order, Code Section 414(p) may be used as a guide.
         B.   Modification of definition of eligible rollover distribution to
include after-tax employee contributions. For purposes of the direct rollover
provisions in Section
286.08(c) of the Plan, a portion of a distribution shall not fail to be an
eligible rollover distribution merely because the portion consists of after-tax
employee contributions which are not includible in gross income. However, such
portion may be paid only to an individual retirement account or annuity
described in Section 408(a) or (b) of the Code, or to a qualified defined
contribution plan described in Section 401(a) or 403(a) of the Code that agrees
to separately account for amounts so transferred, including separately
accounting for the portion of such distribution which is includible in gross
income and the portion of such distribution which is not so includable.

commingled trust fund maintained by a bank or trust company, including any bank

participating plans through such a medium is hereby specifically authorized.
Any assets of the Plan which may be so added to such collective trusts shall be
subject to all of the provisions of the applicable declaration of trust, as
amended from time to time, which declaration, if required by its terms or by
applicable law, is hereby adopted as part of the Plan, to the extent of the
participation in such collective or commingled trust fund by the Plan.
      (11)   To make any payment or distribution required or advisable to carry
out the provisions of the Plan, provided that if a trustee is appointed by the

the employer.
      (12)   To compromise, contest, arbitrate, enforce or abandon claims and

consultants, professional plan administrators and other specialists), or
otherwise act to secure specialized advice or assistance, as it deems necessary

prohibited by applicable law, the employer shall be entitled to rely
conclusively upon and shall be fully protected in any action or omission taken
by it in good faith reliance upon, the advice or opinion of such persons or
firms, provided such persons or firms were prudently chosen by the employer,
taking into account the interests of the participants and beneficiaries and
with due regard to the ability of the persons or firms to perform their
assigned functions.
      (16)   To retain the services of one or more persons or firms for the
management of (including the power to acquire and dispose of) all or any part
of the Fund assets, provided that each of such persons or firms is registered
as an investment advisor under the Investment Advisors Act of 1940, is a bank
(as defined in that act), or is an insurance company qualified to manage,
acquire or dispose of pension trust assets under the laws of more than one
state; in such event, the employer shall follow the directions of such
Investment Manager or Managers with respect to the acquisition and disposition
of Fund assets, but shall not be liable for the acts or omissions of such
Investment Manager or Managers, nor shall it be under any obligation to review
or otherwise manage any Fund assets which are subject to the management of such
Investment Manage or Managers. If the employer appoints a trustee, the trustee
shall not be permitted to retain such an Investment Manager except with the
express written consent of the employer.
   (c)   Common Investments: The employer shall not be required to make
separate investments for individual participants or to maintain separate
investments for each participant's account, but many invest contributions and
any profits or gains therefrom in common investments.
   (d)   Compensation and Expenses of Appointed Trustee. If a trustee is
appointed, the trustee shall be entitled to such reasonable compensation as
shall from time to time be agreed upon by the employer and the trustee, unless
such compensation is prohibited by law. Such compensation, and all expenses
reasonably incurred by the trustee in carrying out his or her functions, shall
constitute a charge upon the employer or the Pension Fund, which may be
executed at any time after 30 days written notice to the employer. The employer
shall be under no obligation to pay such costs and expenses, and, in the event
of its failure to do so, the trustee shall be entitled to pay the same, or to
reimburse themselves for the payment thereof, from the Pension Fund.
   (e)   Periodic Accounting.  If a trustee is appointed, the Pension Fund
shall be evaluated annually, or at more frequent intervals, by the trustee and

additional dates as requested by the employer, showing the condition of the
Fund and all receipts, disbursements and other transactions effected by the
trustee during the period covered by the accounting, based on fair market
values prevailing as of such date.
   (f)   Value of the Pension Fund.  All determinations as to the value of the
assets of the Pension Fund, and as to the amount of the liabilities thereof,
shall be made by the employer or its appointed trustee, whose decisions shall
be final and their estates. In making any such determination, the employer or
trustee shall be entitled to seek and rely upon the opinion of or any
information furnished by brokers, appraisers and other experts, and shall also
be entitled to rely upon reports as to sales and quotations, both on security

him or her as a participant in this Plan.
   (d)   Ownership of Plan Assets.  Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to

indebtedness. Prior to making a payment, however, the participant or
beneficiary must be given written notice by Council that such indebtedness is

dollars ($275,000) for the Plan year and limitation year beginning in 2018. The
limit is automatically adjusted periodically, without formal amendment, for
changes in the law and cost-of-living adjustments under Code section 401(a)
(17).
   (d)   Leased Employees and Independent Contractors. Leased employees and
independent contractors are not eligible to participate in this Plan. Any
person whom the employer does not regard as being an employee shall not be
eligible to participate.
   (e)   Limit on Accrued Benefit.
      (1)   General rule. Except as otherwise provided, this Plan shall at all
times comply with the provisions of Code section 415 and the regulations
thereunder, the terms of which are specifically incorporated herein by
reference. If a benefit payable to a participant under this Plan would
otherwise exceed the limit under Code section 415, the benefit will be reduced
to the maximum permissible benefit.
      (2)   Effective date. If there is more than one permitted effective date
for any change, the change shall be effective as of the latest permissible
effective date; however, any adjustment in the dollar limit under Code section
415(b)(1)(A), whether required or permissible, shall take effect automatically
as of the earliest permissible effective date. Effective as of January 1, 2008
the "applicable mortality table" and "applicable interest rate" are found in
Rev. Rul. 2007-67. The "applicable mortality table" in Rev. Rul. 2001-62 was
effective from December 31, 2002 through December 31, 2007. The "applicable
mortality table" and "applicable interest rate" shall be automatically adjusted
for changes in the law and IRS announcements.
      (3)   No reduction in accrued benefits. Notwithstanding the above, no
change in the limits under this section shall reduce the benefit of any
participant.
      (4)   Multiple plans. If a participant also participates in one or more
other plans that are required to be aggregated with this Plan for purposes of
determining the limits under Code section 415(b), and if the aggregated
benefits would otherwise exceed the limit under Code section 415(b), then
benefits shall be reduced first under this Plan.
      (5)   Mandatory contributions. Participant contributions are annual
additions, and any benefit attributable to participant contributions is not
included in the benefit subject to the limits of Code section 415(b). This
subsection does not apply to contributions "picked-up" in accordance with Code
section 414(h).
      (6)   Permissive service credit. Effective as of January 1, 1998, if a
participant makes a purchase of permissive service credit (within the meaning
of Code section 415(n)) under the Plan, the benefit derived from the
contributions made to purchase the service credit shall be treated as part of
the benefit subject to the limitations under this section.
      (7)   415 extension. To the extent applicable, the above provisions and
limitations shall be subject to Code section 415(b)(2)(g).
   (f)   Limit on Annual Additions.
      (1)   Annual additions  Except as otherwise provided, annual additions
(which include participant contributions) under this Plan shall at all times
comply with the provisions of Code section 415(c) and the regulations
thereunder, the terms of which are specifically incorporated herein by
reference. If an annual addition would otherwise exceed the limit under Code
section 415(c), the excess annual addition will be eliminated in accordance
with methods permitted under Rev. Proc. 2008-50 (Rev. Proc. 2006-27 prior to
2009) or its successor.
      (2)   Multiple plans.  If a participant also participates in one or more
other plans that are required to be aggregated with this Plan for purposes of
determining the limits under Code section 415(c), and if the annual additions
would otherwise exceed the limit under Code section 415(c), annual additions
will first be reduced under the other plan. If there is more than one other
plan, annual additions will first be reduced under the plan with the greatest
amount of annual additions.
      (3)   Effective date.  The limits under which Code section 415(c) are
adjusted periodically in accordance with changes in the law or cost of living
adjustments without the need for a plan amendment. If there is more than one
permissible effective date for any required change relating to Code section 415
(c), then the change shall be effective as of the earliest permissible
effective date.
      (4)   415(c) compensation.  For the purposes of this section,
"compensation" includes only those items specified in Treas. Reg. §1.415(c)-2
(b)l or (2) and excludes all items listed in Treas. Reg. §1.415(c)-2(c), the
terms of which are specifically incorporated herein by reference. Effective as
of January 1, 2009, to the extent required by the Heroes Earnings Assistance
Tax Relief Tax Act of 2008 (HEART Act), differential wage payments shall be
included in compensation for the purposes of applying the limits on annual
additions under IRC section 415(c). This provision shall be applied to all
similarly situated individuals in a reasonable equivalent manner.
   (g)   Direct Rollovers.
      (1)   If a participant, a spousal beneficiary, or an alternate payee (who
is a spouse or former spouse of a participant) is entitled (under other
provisions of this Plan) to receive an "eligible rollover distribution" of at
least two hundred dollars ($200.00), the distributee may elect that the Plan
Administrator transfer all or part (provided that the part is at least five
hundred dollars ($500.00)) to any "eligible retirement plan" capable of
accepting such a transfer.
      (2)   For purposes of this section, the following definitions shall
apply:
         A.   An "eligible rollover distribution" is any distribution of all or
any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an
eligible rollover distribution does not include: (i) any distribution that is
one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently
than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the
joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the
distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten years or
more; (ii) any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under
Code section 401(a)(9); (iii) the portion of any distribution that is not
includible in gross income (determined without regard to the exclusion for net
unrealized appreciation with respect to employer securities), and (iv)
effective as of January 1, 2002, any hardship distribution. Effective as of
January 1, 2002 clause (iii) does not apply to any after-tax participant
contributions that are paid to an individual retirement account or annuity
described in Code section 408(a) or (b), or to a qualified defined contribution
plan described in Code section 401(a) or 403(a), or effective as of January 1,
2007, any 403(b) annuity contract that agrees to separately account for amounts
so transferred, including separately accounting for the portion of such
distribution which is includible in gross income and the portion of such
distribution which is not so includible.
         B.   An "eligible retirement plan" is an individual retirement account
described in Code section 408(a), an individual retirement annuity described in
Code section 408(b), an annuity plan described in Code section 403(a), or a
qualified trust described in Code section 401(a), that accepts the
distributee's eligible rollover distribution. However, in the case of an
eligible rollover distribution to a surviving spouse, prior to January 1, 2002,
an eligible retirement plan was an individual retirement account or individual
retirement annuity. Effective as of January 1, 2002, an "eligible retirement
plan" includes an annuity contract described in Code section 403(b) and an
eligible plan under Code section 457(b) which is maintained by a state,
political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state
or political subdivision of a state and which agrees to separately account for
amounts transferred into such plan from this plan. Effective as of January 1,
2008 a Roth IRA is an "eligible retirement plan".
         C.   A distributee includes an employee or former employee. In
addition, the employee's or former employee's surviving spouse and the
employee's or former employee's spouse or former spouse who is the alternate
payee under a qualified domestic relations order, as defined in Code section
414(p)(11), are distributees with regard to the interest of the spouse or
former spouse.
         D.   Effective as of January 1, 2002, an employee may, in accordance
with Code section 457(e)(17), make a trustee-to-trustee transfer from an
eligible deferred compensation plan (as defined in Code section 457(b)) to this
plan for the purpose of purchasing service credit (to the extent that such
purchases are permitted under the terms of the Plan) or repaying a cash-out of
contributions refunded under the Plan.
   (h)   Minimum Required Distributions. Notwithstanding any provision in this
Plan to the contrary, the distribution of a participant's benefits shall be
made in accordance with the requirements of Code section 401(a)(9). For
purposes of complying with Code section 401(a)(9), life expectancies were
determined in accordance with the 1987 proposed regulations prior to January 1,
2003 and with the final regulations (§ 1.401 (a)(9)-1 through § 1.401(a)(9)-9)
on or after January 1, 2003.
      (1)   Distribution of a participant's benefits shall begin not later than
April 1st of the calendar year following the later of:
         A.   The calendar year in which the participant attains age seventy
and one-half, or
         B.   The calendar year in which the participant retires.
               Distributions must be made over a period not exceeding the life
of the participant or the joint lives a participant and his beneficiary.
      (2)   Distributions to a participant and his beneficiaries shall only be
made in accordance with the incidental death benefit requirements of Code
section 401(a)(9)(G) and the regulations thereunder. If a participant receives
a joint and survivor annuity and the beneficiary is not the participant's
spouse, life expectancy shall be determined using the Uniform Lifetime Table of
Treasury regulation §1.401(a)(9)-9.
      (3)   This section does not authorize the payment of any benefit in any
form not permitted under another provision of the Plan.
   (i)   Approved Domestic Relations Orders. All rights and benefits, including
elections, provided to a participant in this Plan shall be subject to the
rights afforded to any "alternate payee" under what is recognized pursuant to
State law support provisions or as an "approved domestic relations order."
   (j)   Credit for Qualified Military Service.  Notwithstanding any provision
of this Plan to the contrary, contributions, benefits and service credit with
respect to qualified military service will be provided in accordance Code
sections 401(a)(37) and 414(u).
   (k)   Vesting Upon Plan Termination. Upon the termination of this Plan, or
complete discontinuance of contributions (within the meaning of pre-ERISA Code
section 401(a)(7)) to this Plan, each employee (who is not already 100 percent
vested) as of the date of such termination or discontinuance shall become
vested to the extent that the Plan is funded.
   (l)   Mandatory Lump Sum Distributions.  Effective as of January 1, 2006,
unless the participant consents to the distribution, any lump-sum distribution
in excess of one thousand dollars ($1,000) made to a participant prior to the
participant's attainment of normal retirement age shall be rolled over by the
Plan Administrator into an individual retirement account established by the
Plan Administrator for that purpose.
   (m)   Non-Spousal Rollover. Effective January 1, 2007, if a beneficiary who
is not a surviving spouse is entitled to receive what would otherwise be an
"eligible rollover distribution", the beneficiary may, in accordance with Code
section 402(c)(11), make a trustee-to-trustee transfer of that amount to an IRA
or individual retirement annuity (other than an endowment contract); provided
that:
      (1)   The transfer is made not later than the end of the fourth year
after the year of the participant's death; and
      (2)   The account or annuity to which the amount is transferred is
treated as an inherited IRA or individual retirement annuity in accordance with
Code section 408(d)(3)(C).
   (n)   Full Vesting at Normal Retirement Age. A participant's normal
retirement benefit shall be 100 percent vested upon attainment of his normal
retirement age.
   (o)   Forfeitures.  Forfeitures shall not be used to increase the benefits
of any participant in this Plan but may be used to reduce employer
contributions to the Plan.
   (p)   Exclusive Benefit.  The Plan is maintained for the exclusive benefit
of its participants and beneficiaries.
   (q)   No Reversion to Employer.  At no time shall it be possible for the
Plan assets to be used for, or diverted to, any purpose other than for the
exclusive benefit of the participants and their beneficiaries, except that
contributions made by the employer may be returned to the employer if:
      (1)   The contribution was made due to a mistake of fact and the
contribution is returned within one year of the mistaken payment of the
contribution; or
      (2)   The Plan is terminated.
   (r)   Windsor Case. Effective June 23, 2013, the terms spouse, husband,
wife, widow and widower shall include individuals married to persons of the
same sex if the individuals are legally married under State law. Also, where
the term widow appears, it shall be read to include widower.

compensation shall be at the standard rate of pay for the classification of
service performed less the amount the retired employee is receiving from the
plan as a pension payment (prorated on a daily scale).

the employer beyond his or her normal retirement date shall be entitled to

vested interest shall only entitle the member to receive a reduced monthly
pension benefit commencing on the date that the participant would have attained
his or her normal retirement age had he or she continued in employment with the
employer until that date. The reduced pension benefit payable under this
section shall be based upon the participant's final average monthly salary

fraction, the numerator of which shall be his or her years of service at
termination of employment and the denominator of which shall be the years of
service that he or she would have rendered had he or she continued to work
until he or she attained normal retirement age. The limited vested benefit
under this section shall commence on the date that the participant attains age
fifty and shall be payable to the participant during the remainder of his or
her life. Benefits payable pursuant to this section hereof are optional with
the participant upon his or her termination. If the participant does not elect
to vest pursuant to the provisions of this section, then amounts paid by the

shall be made within thirty days of termination and shall be final and binding
upon all parties.

upon the recommendation of the persons having custody and management of the
Police Pension Fund, increase the allowances of persons receiving allowances of
any kind from the fund by reason of and after termination of the services of
any member of the fund. Such increases shall be in conformity with a uniform
scale which may be based on the cost of living, and the total of any such
allowances shall not at any time exceed one-half of the current salary being
paid patrolmen of the highest pay grade.

death and shall be paid to the surviving spouse until the date of death of the
surviving spouse. Upon the death of the surviving spouse of a participant or if
the participant died without a surviving spouse, fifty percent (one hundred
percent in the case of disability pensions) of the pension the participant was
receiving or would have been eligible to receive had he or she been retired at
the time of his or her death shall be paid monthly in equal shares to the
surviving children of the deceased participant until the death or attainment of

responsible adult with whom the minor maintains his or her residence, or to the
custodian for such minor under the Uniform Gift to Minors Act or Gift to Minors
Act, if such is permitted by the laws of the state in which said minor resides.

member shall have returned to him or her the amount contributed, and shall
afterward again become a member of the Police Department, he or she shall not
be entitled to the pension designated until twenty years after his or her re-
employment (and upon reaching age fifty, if later,) unless he shall return to
the Pension Fund the amount withdrawn, in which event the period of twenty
years shall be computed from the time the member first became a member of the
Police Department, excluding therefrom any period of time during which the
member was not employed by the Police Department.

accrued benefit.
         C.   "Current accrued benefit" shall mean a participant's accrued
benefit under the Plan, determined as if the participant had separated from
service as of the close of the last limitation year beginning before January 1,
1987, when expressed as an annual benefit within the meaning of Code Section
415(b)(2). In determining the amount of a participant's current accrued
benefit, the following shall be disregarded:
            1.   Any change in the terms and conditions of the Plan after May
5, 1986; and
            2.   Any cost-of-living adjustment occurring after May 5, 1986.
      (4)   The dollar limitation under Code Section 415(b)(1)(A) stated in
division (a)(1) of this section shall be adjusted annually as provided in Code
Section 415(d) pursuant to the Regulations and IRS Pronouncements. The adjusted
limitation is effective as of January 1 of each calendar year and is applicable
to limitation years ending with or within that calendar year.
      (5)   Applicable limitations above for participants who have separated
from service with a nonforfeitable right to an accrued benefit shall be
adjusted annually as provided in Code Section 415(d) pursuant to the
regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury.
      (6)   For purposes of divisions (d) and (e) of this section, all defined
benefit plans of the employer, whether or not terminated, are to be treated as
one defined benefit plan and all defined contribution plans of the employer,
whether or not terminated, are to be treated as one defined contribution plan
of the employer.
      (7)   In the case of a group of related employers, all such employers
shall be considered a single employer for purposes of applying the limitation
of Section 415 of the Code.
      (8)   To the extent applicable, the above provisions and limitations
shall be governed by Code Section 415(b)(2)(F) and Code Section 415(b)(2)(G).
   (e)   Adjustments to Annual Benefit and Limitations.
      (1)   If the annual benefit begins before the participant's and new Plan
participant's Social Security retirement age, then the ninety thousand dollar
($90,000) limitation shall be reduced in such manner as the Secretary of the
Treasury shall prescribe which is consistent with the reduction for old-age
insurance benefits commencing before the Social Security Retirement Age.
      (2)   Notwithstanding division (a) of this section, for limitation years
beginning prior to January 1, 1987, the ninety thousand dollar ($90,000) limit
shall not be reduced if the annual benefit begins on or after age 62. If the
annual benefit begins before age 62, the ninety thousand dollar ($90,000)
limitation (but not the 100 percent of compensation limitation) shall be
reduced so that it is the actuarial equivalent of the ninety thousand dollar
($90,000) limitation beginning at age 62. However, the ninety thousand dollar
($90,000) limitation shall not be reduced to less than:
         A.   Seventy-five thousand dollars ($75,000) if the annual benefit
commences on or after age 55; or
         B.   The amount which is the actuarial equivalent of seventy-five
thousand dollars ($75,000) at age 55 if the annual benefit commences prior to
age 55.
   For purposes of adjusting the ninety thousand dollar ($90,000) limitation
applicable prior to age 62 or the seventy-five thousand dollar ($75,000)
limitation prior to age 55, the adjustment shall be based on an interest rate
assumption of five percent and no mortality decrement. In no event, however,
shall the aforesaid dollar limitations be reduced to an amount less than
required by the Code. The above adjustment shall not apply in the case of a
survivor benefit or a disability benefit.
      (3)   If the annual benefit begins after the participant's and new Plan
participant's Social Security retirement age (or for limitation years beginning
prior to January 1, 1987, age 65), the ninety thousand dollar ($90,000)
limitation shall be increased so that it is the actuarial equivalent of the
ninety thousand dollar ($90,000) limitation at the participant's and new Plan
participant's Social Security retirement age (or for limitation years beginning
prior to January 1, 1987, age 65). For purposes of adjusting the ninety
thousand dollar ($90,000) limitation applicable after the participant's Social
Security retirement age (or for limitation years beginning prior to January 1,
1987, age 65), the adjustment shall be based upon an interest rate assumption
of five percent and no mortality decrement.
      (4)   For purposes of adjusting any annual benefit under divisions (d)
(2), (e)(1), (2) and/or (3) of this section, no adjustments shall be taken into
account before the limitation year for which such adjustment first takes
effect. For purposes of employing any limitation, a separate limitation may
apply to police and firefighters.
      (5)   A. If a participant has less than ten years of participation in the
Plan at the time he or she begins to receive benefits under the Plan, the
ninety thousand dollar ($90,000) limitation shall be reduced by multiplying
such limitation by a fraction:
            1.    The numerator of which is the number of years of
participation (or part thereof) in the Plan; and
            2.    The denominator of which is ten, provided that said fraction
shall in no event be less than one-tenth.
         B.    Notwithstanding the foregoing, for limitation years beginning
prior to January 1, 1987, if a participant has fewer than ten years of service
with the employer at the time he or she begins to receive benefits under the
Plan, the maximum annual benefit payable to the retired participant shall be
reduced by multiplying such maximum annual benefit by a fraction:
            1.   The numerator of which is the number of years of service, or
part thereof, with the employer; and
            2.   The denominator of which is ten.
      (6)   Notwithstanding other limitations of this section with respect to a
participant included under the prior provisions of this Plan, the maximum
benefit computed under this section shall be a participant's 's accrued benefit
payable under the Plan provisions in effect at the close of the last Plan year
beginning before January 1., 1983, if such accrued benefit is greater than the
maximum annual benefit provided for in division (d) of this section based upon
his or her rate of compensation under the Plan in effect as of such date and
based on the years of service to the date his or her employment is terminated.
For purposes of calculating a participant's accrued benefit under this
division, no changes in the terms and conditions of the Plan after July 1, 1982
and no cost of living adjustments after July 1, 1982 shall be taken into
account.
   (f)   Multiple Plan Reduction. The provisions contained in this division (f)
shall not apply to Plan limitation years after 1999.
      (1)   A.    If a participant has at any time participated in one or more
defined benefit plans and one or more defined contributions plans maintained by
the employer, the sum of the defined benefit plan fraction and the defined
contribution plan fraction for any limitation year may not exceed 1.0. In the
case of an individual who was a participant in one or more defined benefit
plans of the employer as of the first day of the first limitation year
beginning after December 31, 1986, the application of the limitations of this
section shall not cause the maximum permissible amount for such individual
under all such defined benefit plans to be less than the individual's current
accrued benefit. The preceding sentence applies only if such defined benefit
plans met the requirements of Code Section 415, for all limitation years
beginning before January 1, 1987.
         B.    The defined benefit plan fraction for any limitation year is a
fraction, the numerator of which is the participant's projected annual benefit
under the Plan (determined as of the close of the limitation year pursuant to
Regulations 1.415-7(b)(3)), and the denominator of which is the lesser of:
            1.   The product of 1.25 multiplied by the maximum dollar
limitation in effect under Code Section 415(b)(1)(A) for such limitation year;
or
            2.   The product of 1.4 multiplied by the amount which may be taken
into account under Code Section 415(b)(1)(B) for such limitation year.
         C.   The defined contribution plan fraction for any limitation year is
a fraction, the numerator of which is the sum of the annual additions to the
participant's accounts for such limitation year and for all prior limitation
years, and the denominator of which is the sum of the lesser of the following
amounts determined for such year and each prior year of service with the
Employer:
            1.   The product of 1.25 multiplied by the dollar limitation in
effect under Code Section 415(c)(1)(A) for such year (determined without regard
to Code Section 415(c)(6)); or
            2.   The product of 1.4 multiplied by the amount which may be taken
into account under Code Section 415(c)(1)(B) for such year.
         D.    For the purpose of this division, the term "participant's
account" shall mean the account established and maintained for each participant
with respect to his or her total interest in the defined contribution plan
maintained by the employer resulting from annual additions.
         E.   The annual addition allocated to pay any participant's account
under this Plan in a limitation year, plus all annual additions allocated to
such participant under any other defined contribution plan of the employer for
such limitation year, shall not exceed the lesser of (i) thirty thousand
dollars ($30,000) (or such greater amount as may be determined by the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue Service for limitation years ending on or
after January 1, 1988, as a cost-ofliving adjustment), or (ii) twenty-five
percent of such participant's compensation.
         F.   "Annual additions" means the sum credited to a participant's
account for any limitation year of:
            1.   Employer contributions;
            2.   Employee contributions;
            3.   Forfeitures;
            4.   Amounts allocated after March 31, 1984, to any individual
medical account, as defined in Code Section 415(1)(2) which is part of a
pension of annuity plan maintained by the employer; and
            5.   Amounts derived from contributions paid or accrued after
December 31, 1985, in taxable years ending after such date, which are
attributable to post-retirement medical benefits allocated to a separate
account of a key employee (as defined in Code Section 419A(d)(3)) under a
welfare benefit plan (as defined in Code Section 419(e)) maintained by the
employer.
         G.   Notwithstanding the foregoing, for Plan years beginning prior to
January 1, 1987, only that portion of employee contributions equal to the
lesser of employee contributions in excess of six percent of compensation or
one-half of employee contributions shall be considered an annual addition.
         H.   The annual addition for any limitation year beginning before
January 1, 1987, shall not be recomputed to treat all employee contributions as
an annual addition.
         I.   If the Plan satisfied Code Section 415 as in effect for all
limitation years beginning before January 1, 1987, an amount shall be
subtracted from the numerator of the defined contribution plan fraction (not
exceeding such numerator) as prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury so
that the sum of the defined benefit plan fraction and defined contribution plan
fraction computed under Section 415(e)(1), as amended by the Tax Reform Act of
1986, does not exceed 1.0 for such limitation year.
         J.   For years beginning after December 31, 2001, annual additions
shall be calculated in conformance with the Economic Growth and Tax
Reconciliation Act of 2001.
      (2)   Except as specifically permitted in the .Regulations of the
Secretary of the Treasury under Section 415 of the Code, the benefits paid or
payable at any time shall not exceed the limitations of division (a) of this
section.
      (3)   Special rule for defined contribution fraction for defined
contribution plan in effect on or before July 1, 1982. Council may elect, for
any limitation year ending after December 31, 1982, that the amount taken into
account in the denominator for every participant and new Plan participant for
all limitation years ending before January 1, 1983, shall be an amount equal to
the product of:
         A.   The denominator for the limitation year ending in 1982 determined
under the law in effect for the limitation year ending in 1982, multiplied by
         B.   The "transition fraction". The term "transition fraction" shall
mean a fraction:
            1.   The numerator of which is the lesser of:
               a.   Fifty-one thousand eight hundred seventy-five dollars
($51,875); or
               b.   1.4 multiplied by twenty-five percent of the participant's
Compensation for the Limitation Year ending in1981, and
            2.   The denominator of which is the lesser of:
               a.   Forty-one thousand five hundred dollars ($41,500);or
               b.   Twenty-five percent of the participant's compensation for
the limitation year ending in 1981.
         C.   Notwithstanding the foregoing, for any limitation year in which
the Plan is a top heavy plan, forty-one thousand five hundred dollars ($41,500)
shall be substituted for fifty-one thousand eight hundred seventy-five dollars
($51,875) in determining the "transition fraction" unless the extra minimum
benefit is provided pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code. However, for any
limitation year in which this Plan is a top heavy plan, forty-one thousand five
hundred dollars ($41,500) shall be substituted for fifty-one thousand eight
hundred seventy-five dollars ($51,875) in any event.
      (4)   If the sum of the defined benefit plan fraction and the defined
contribution plan fraction shall exceed 1.0 in any limitation year for any
participant in the Plan, for reasons other than those described in division (f)
(5) of this section, the Board shall adjust the numerator of the defined
benefit plan fraction so that the sum of both fractions shall not exceed 1.0 in
any limitation year for such participant .
      (5)   If the substitution of 1.00 for 1.25 and forty-one thousand five
hundred dollars ($41,500) for fifty-one thousand eight hundred seventy-five
($51,875) above or the excess benefit accruals or annual additions provided for
in Internal Revenue Service Notice 82-19 cause the 1.0 limitation to be
exceeded for any participant in any limitation year, such participant shall be
subject to the following restrictions for each future limitation year until the
1.0 limitation is satisfied:
         A.   The participant's accrued benefit shall not increase;
         B.   No annual additions may be credited to a participant's account;
and
         C.   No employee contributions (voluntary or mandatory) shall be made
under any defined benefit plan or any defined contribution plan of the
employer.
   (g)   Incorporation of Code Section 415 by Reference. Notwithstanding
anything contained in this chapter to the contrary, the limitations,
adjustments, and other requirements prescribed in this chapter shall. at all
times comply with the provisions of Code Section 415 and the Regulations

   (c)   Direct Rollover of Eligible Rollover Distribution.
      (1)   This division (c) applies to distributions made on or after January
1, 1993. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary that would
otherwise limit a distributee's election under this division (c), a distributee
may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the Board, to have any
portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible
retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover.
      (2)   For purposes of applying this division (c):
         A.   An "eligible rollover distribution" is any distribution of all or
any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an
eligible rollover distribution does not include: any distribution that is one
of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than
annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee's
designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten years or more; any
distribution to the extent such distribution is required under Section 401(a)
(9) of the Code; and the portion of any distribution that is not includable in
gross income (determined without regard to the exclusion for net unrealized
appreciation with respect to employer securities) and the portion of any
distribution made on or after January 1, 2000, which is attributable to a
hardship distribution described in Code Section 401(k)(2)(B)(i)(IV).
         B.   An "eligible retirement plan" is an individual retirement account
described in Section 408(a) of the Code, an individual retirement annuity
described in Section 408(b) of the Code, an annuity plan described in Section
403(a) of the Code, or a qualified trust described in Section 401(a) of the
Code, that accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution. However,
in the case of an eligible rollover distribution to the surviving spouse, an
eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account or individual
retirement annuity.
         C.   A "distributee" includes an employee or former employee. In
addition, the employee's or former employee's surviving spouse and the
employee's or former employee's spouse or former spouse who is the alternate
payee under a qualified domestic relations order, as defined in Section 414(p)
of the Code, are distributees with regard to the interest of the spouse or
former spouse.
         D.   A "direct rollover" is a payment by the plan to the eligible
retirement plan specified by the distributee.
      (3)   This section shall apply to distributions made after December 31,
2001.
         A.   Modification of definition of eligible retirement plan. For
purposes of the direct rollover provisions in Section
288.08(c) of the Plan, an eligible retirement plan shall also mean an annuity
contract described in Section 403(b) of the Code and an eligible plan under
Section 457(b) of the Code which is maintained by a state, political
subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or
political subdivision of a state and which agrees to separately account for
amounts transferred into such plan from this Plan. The definition of eligible
retirement plan shall also apply in the case of a distribution to a surviving
spouse, or to a spouse or former spouse who is the alternate payee under a
qualified domestic relation order, as defined in Section 414(p) of the Code.
         B.   Modification of definition of eligible rollover distribution to
include after-tax employee contributions. For purposes of the direct rollover
provisions in Section
288.08(c) of the Plan, a portion of a distribution shall not fail to be an
eligible rollover distribution merely because the portion consists of after-tax
employee contributions that are not includable in gross income. However, such
portion may be paid only to an individual retirement account or annuity
described in Section 408(a) or (b) of the Code, or to a qualified defined
contribution plan described in Section 401(a) or 403(a) of the Code that agrees
to separately account for amounts so transferred, including separately
accounting for the portion of such distribution which is includable in gross
income and the portion of such distribution which is not so includable.

amended from time to time, which declaration, if required by its terms or by
applicable law, is hereby adopted as part of the Plan, to the extent of the
participation in such collective or commingled trust fund by the Plan.
      (10)   To make any payment or distribution required or advisable to carry

assets, but shall not be liable for the acts or omissions of such Investment
Manager or Managers, nor shall it be under any obligation to review or

   (c)   Common Investments. The Board shall not be required to make separate
investments for individual participants or to maintain separate investments for
each participant's account, but may invest contributions and any profits or
gains therefrom in common investments.
   (d)   Compensation and Expenses of Appointed Trustee. If a trustee is
appointed, the trustee shall be entitled to such reasonable compensation as
shall from time to time be agreed upon by the Board and the trustee, unless
such compensation is prohibited by law. Such compensation, and all expenses
reasonably incurred by the trustee in carrying out his or her functions, shall
constitute a charge upon the Board or the Pension Fund, which may be executed
at any time after 30 days written notice to the Board. The Board shall be under
no obligation to pay such costs and expenses, and, in the event of its failure

288.12  APPLICABLE PROVISIONS OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE.
   (a)   Intent to Comply with Internal Revenue Code.  The employer intends
that this Plan shall meet all the pertinent requirements established for a
governmental plan (as defined in Internal Revenue Code § 414(d)) under Internal
Revenue Code § 401(a), as amended, and the Plan shall be interpreted, wherever
possible, to comply with the terms of said Code and all formal regulations and
rulings pertinent to the Plan and trust agreement. The provisions of this
section shall supersede the Internal Revenue Code provisions of the Plan,
including those found in this Plan section.
   (b)   Definitions. The following definitions apply for purposes of this
section only:
      (1)   "Leased employee" shall mean any person (other than an employee of
the recipient) who pursuant to an agreement between the recipient and any other
person ("leasing organization") has performed services for the recipient (or
for the recipient and related persons determined in accordance with Code
section 414(n)(6)) on a substantially full-time basis for a period of at least
one year, and such services are performed under primary direction or control by
the recipient.
      (2)   "Limitation Year" shall mean the Plan year.
   (c)   Limitation Compensation. Compensation is subject to the limitation
under Code section 401(a)(17), which is two hundred seventy-five thousand
dollars ($275,000) for the Plan year and limitation year beginning in 2018. The
limit is automatically adjusted periodically, without formal amendment, for
changes in the law and cost-of-living adjustments under Code section 401(a)
(17).
   (d)   Leased Employees and Independent Contractors. Leased employees and
independent contractors are not eligible to participate in this Plan. Any
person whom the employer does not regard as being an employee shall not be
eligible to participate.
   (e)   Limit on Accrued Benefit.
      (1)   General rule. Except as otherwise provided, this Plan shall at all
times comply with the provisions of Code section 415 and the regulations
thereunder, the terms of which are specifically incorporated herein by
reference. If a benefit payable to a participant under this Plan would
otherwise exceed the limit under Code section 415, the benefit will be reduced
to the maximum permissible benefit.
      (2)   Effective date. If there is more than one permitted effective date
for any change, the change shall be effective as of the latest permissible
effective date; however, any adjustment in the dollar limit under Code section
415(b)(1)(A), whether required or permissible, shall take effect automatically
as of the earliest permissible effective date. Effective as of January 1, 2008
the "applicable mortality table" and "applicable interest rate'' are found in
Rev. Rul. 2007-67. The "applicable mortality table" in Rev. Rul. 2001-62 was
effective from December 31, 2002 through December 31, 2007. The ''applicable
mortality table" and ''applicable interest rate" shall be automatically
adjusted for changes in the law and IRS announcements.
      (3)   No reduction in accrued benefits. Notwithstanding the above, no
change in the limits under this section shall reduce the benefit of any
participant.
      (4)   Multiple plans. If a participant also participates in one or more
other plans that are required to be aggregated with this Plan for purposes of
determining the limits under Code section 415(b), and if the aggregated
benefits would otherwise exceed the limit under Code section 415(b), then
benefits shall be reduced first under this Plan.
      (5)   Mandatory contributions. Participant contributions are annual
additions, and any benefit attributable to participant contributions is not
included in the benefit subject to the limits of Code section 415(b). This
subsection does not apply to contributions "picked-up" in accordance with Code
section 414(h).
      (6)   Permissive service credit. Effective as of January 1, 1998, if a
participant makes a purchase of permissive service credit (within the meaning
of Code section 415(n)) under the Plan, the benefit derived from the
contributions made to purchase the service credit shall be treated as part of
the benefit subject to the limitations under this section.
      (7)   415 extension. To the extent applicable, the above provisions and
limitations shall be subject to Code section 415(b)(2)(g).
   (f)   Limit on Annual Additions.
      (1)   Annual additions.  Except as otherwise provided, annual additions
(which include participant contributions) under this Plan shall at all times
comply with the provisions of Code section 415(c) and the regulations
thereunder, the terms of which are specifically incorporated herein by
reference. If an annual addition would otherwise exceed the limit under Code
section 415(c), the excess annual addition will be eliminated in accordance
with methods permitted under Rev. Proc. 2008-50 (Rev. Proc. 2006-27 prior to
2009) or its successor.
      (2)   Multiple plans.  If a participant also participates in one or more
other plans that are required to be aggregated with this Plan for purposes of
determining the limits under Code section 415(c), and if the annual additions
would otherwise exceed the limit under Code section 415(c), annual additions
will first be reduced under the other plan. If there is more than one other
plan, annual additions will first be reduced under the plan with the greatest
amount of annual additions.
      (3)   Effective date.  The limits under which Code section 415(c) are
adjusted periodically in accordance with changes in the law or cost of living
adjustments without the need for a plan amendment. If there is more than one
permissible effective date for any required change relating to Code section 415
(c), then the change shall be effective as of the earliest permissible
effective date.
      (4)   415(c) compensation.  For the purposes of this section,
"compensation" includes only those items specified in Treas. Reg. §1.415(c)-2
(b)l or (2) and excludes all items listed in Treas. Reg. §1.415(c)-2(c), the
terms of which are specifically incorporated herein by reference. Effective as
of January 1, 2009, to the extent required by the Heroes Earnings Assistance
Tax Relief Tax Act of 2008 (HEART Act), differential wage payments shall be
included in compensation for the purposes of applying the limits on annual
additions under IRC section 415(c). This provision shall be applied to all
similarly situated individuals in a reasonable equivalent manner.
   (g)   Direct Rollovers.
      (1)   If a participant, a spousal beneficiary, or an alternate payee (who
is a spouse or former spouse of a participant) is entitled (under other
provisions of this Plan) to receive an "eligible rollover distribution" of at
least two hundred dollars ($200.00), the distributee may elect that the Plan
Administrator transfer all or part (provided that the part is at least five
hundred dollars ($500.00)) to any "eligible retirement plan" capable of
accepting such a transfer.
      (2)   For purposes of this section, the following definitions shall
apply:
         A.   An "eligible rollover distribution" is any distribution of all or
any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an
eligible rollover distribution does not include: (i) any distribution that is
one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently
than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the
joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the
distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten years or
more; (ii) any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under
Code section 401(a)(9); (iii) the portion of any distribution that is not
includible in gross income (determined without regard to the exclusion for net
unrealized appreciation with respect to employer securities), and (iv)
effective as of January 1, 2002, any hardship distribution. Effective as of
January 1, 2002 clause (iii) does not apply to any after-tax participant
contributions that are paid to an individual retirement account or annuity
described in Code section 408(a) or (b), or to a qualified defined contribution
plan described in Code section 401(a) or 403(a), or effective as of January 1,
2007, any 403(b) annuity contract that agrees to separately account for amounts
so transferred, including separately accounting for the portion of such
distribution which is includible in gross income and the portion of such
distribution which is not so includible.
         B.   An "eligible retirement plan" is an individual retirement account
described in Code section 408(a), an individual retirement annuity described in
Code section 408(b), an annuity plan described in Code section 403(a), or a
qualified trust described in Code section 401(a), that accepts the
distributee's eligible rollover distribution. However, in the case of an
eligible rollover distribution to a surviving spouse, prior to January 1, 2002,
an eligible retirement plan was an individual retirement account or individual
retirement annuity. Effective as of January 1, 2002, an "eligible retirement
plan" includes an annuity contract described in Code section 403(b) and an
eligible plan under Code section 457(b) which is maintained by a state,
political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state
or political subdivision of a state and which agrees to separately account for
amounts transferred into such plan from this plan. Effective as of January 1,
2008 a Roth IRA is an "eligible retirement plan".
         C.   A distributee includes an employee or former employee. In
addition, the employee's or former employee's surviving spouse and the
employee's or former employee's spouse or former spouse who is the alternate
payee under a qualified domestic relations order, as defined in Code section
414(p)(11), are distributees with regard to the interest of the spouse or
former spouse.
         D.   Effective as of January 1, 2002, an employee may, in accordance
with Code section 457(e)(17), make a trustee-to-trustee transfer from an
eligible deferred compensation plan (as defined in Code section 457(b)) to this
plan for the purpose of purchasing service credit (to the extent that such
purchases are permitted under the terms of the Plan) or repaying a cash-out of
contributions refunded under the Plan.
   (h)   Minimum Required Distributions. Notwithstanding any provision in this
Plan to the contrary, the distribution of a participant's benefits shall be
made in accordance with the requirements of Code section 401(a)(9). For
purposes of complying with Code section 401(a)(9), life expectancies were
determined in accordance with the 1987 proposed regulations prior to January 1,
2003 and with the final regulations (§1.401 (a)(9)-1 through §1.401(a)(9)-9) on
or after January 1, 2003.
      (1)   Distribution of a participant's benefits shall begin not later than
April 1st of the calendar year following the later of:
         A.   The calendar year in which the participant attains age seventy
and one-half, or
         B.   The calendar year in which the participant retires.
               Distributions must be made over a period not exceeding the life
of the participant or the joint lives of a participant and his beneficiary.
      (2)   Distributions to a participant and his beneficiaries shall only be
made in accordance with the incidental death benefit requirements of Code
section 401(a)(9)(G) and the regulations thereunder. If a participant receives
a joint and survivor annuity and the beneficiary is not the participant's
spouse, life expectancy shall be determined using the Uniform Lifetime Table of
Treasury regulation §1.401(a)(9)-9.
      (3)   This section does not authorize the payment of any benefit in any
form not permitted under another provision of the Plan.
   (i)   Approved Domestic Relations Orders. All rights and benefits, including
elections, provided to a participant in this Plan shall be subject to the
rights afforded to any "alternate payee" under what is recognized pursuant to
State law support provisions or as an "approved domestic relations order."
   (j)   Credit for Qualified Military Service. Notwithstanding any provision
of this Plan to the contrary, contributions, benefits and service credit with
respect to qualified military service will be provided in accordance Code
sections 401(a)(37) and 414(u).
   (k)   Vesting Upon Plan Termination. Upon the termination of this Plan, or
complete discontinuance of contributions (within the meaning of pre-ERISA Code
section 401(a)(7)) to this Plan, each employee (who is not already 100 percent
vested) as of the date of such termination or discontinuance shall become
vested to the extent that the Plan is funded.
   (l)   Mandatory Lump Sum Distributions. Effective as of January 1, 2006,
unless the participant consents to the distribution, any lump-sum distribution
in excess of one thousand dollars ($1,000) made to a participant prior to the
participant's attainment of normal retirement age shall be rolled over by the
Plan Administrator into an individual retirement account established by the
Plan Administrator for that purpose.
   (m)   Non-Spousal Rollover. Effective January 1, 2007, if a beneficiary who
is not a surviving spouse is entitled to receive what would otherwise be an
"eligible rollover distribution", the beneficiary may, in accordance with Code
section 402(c)(11), make a trustee-to-trustee transfer of that amount to an IRA
or individual retirement annuity (other than an endowment contract); provided
that:
      (1)   The transfer is made not later than the end of the fourth year
after the year of the participant's death; and
      (2)   The account or annuity to which the amount is transferred is
treated as an inherited IRA or individual retirement annuity in accordance with
Code section 408(d)(3)(C).
   (n)   Full Vesting at Normal Retirement Age. A participant's normal
retirement benefit shall be 100 percent vested upon attainment of his normal
retirement age.
   (o)   Forfeitures. Forfeitures shall not be used to increase the benefits of
any participant in this Plan but may be used to reduce employer contributions
to the Plan.
   (p)   Exclusive Benefit. The Plan is maintained for the exclusive benefit of
its participants and beneficiaries.
   (q)   No Reversion to Employer.  At no time shall it be possible for the
Plan assets to be used for, or diverted to, any purpose other than for the
exclusive benefit of the participants and their beneficiaries, except that
contributions made by the employer may be returned to the employer if:
      (1)   The contribution was made due to a mistake of fact and the
contribution is returned within one year of the mistaken payment of the
contribution; or
      (2)   The Plan is terminated.
   (r)   Windsor Case.  Effective June 23, 2013, the terms spouse, husband,
wife, widow and widower shall include individuals married to persons of the
same sex if the individuals are legally married under State law. Also, where
the term widow appears, it shall be read to include widower.

444.01  COMPLIANCE WITH AUTOMATIC TRAFFIC LIGHTS REQUIRED.
   No person shall operate a vehicle at the intersections named in the
following sections of this chapter, known and designated as automatic traffic
light intersections, except in the manner described in such sections.
(Ord. 4-78. Passed 2-22-78. )
444.02  TRAFFIC CONTROL SIGNALS.
   (a)   Meaning and Application of Colored Lights. Whenever traffic is
controlled by traffic control signals exhibiting different colored lights, or
colored lighted arrows, successively one at a time or in combination, only the
colors green, red and yellow shall be used, except for special pedestrian
signals carrying a word legend, and the lights shall indicate and apply to
drivers of vehicles and pedestrians as follows:
      (1)   Green indication.
         A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal may proceed
straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at such place prohibits
either such turn except that vehicular traffic, including traffic turning right
or left, shall yield the right of way to other vehicles and to pedestrians
lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time the
signal is exhibited.
         B.   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in
combination with another indication, may enter the intersection only to make
the movement indicated by the arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by
other indications shown at the same time. Such vehicular traffic shall yield
the right of way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to
other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
   C.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal, pedestrians
facing any green signal may proceed across the roadway within a crosswalk.
      (2)   Steady yellow indication.
         A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow signal is thereby warned
that the related green indication is being terminated or that a red indication
will be exhibited immediately thereafter.
         B.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal,
pedestrians facing a steady yellow signal are thereby advised that there is
insufficient time to cross the roadway before a red indication is shown and no
pedestrian shall then start to cross the roadway.
      (3)   Steady red indication.
         A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red signal alone shall stop at
a clearly marked stop line, or if none, before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection, or if none, then before entering the
intersection and shall remain standing until an indication to proceed is shown
except as provided in the following paragraph.
         B.   Unless a sign is in place prohibiting a turn, vehicular traffic
facing a steady red signal may enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn
left from a one-way roadway onto a one-way roadway after stopping as required
in the preceding paragraph. Such vehicular traffic shall yield the right of way
to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic
lawfully using the intersection.
         C.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal,
pedestrians facing a steady red signal alone shall not enter the roadway.
   (b)   Places Other Than Intersections. In the event that an official traffic
control signal is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection,
the provisions of this section shall be applicable except as to those
provisions which by their nature can have no application. Any stop required
shall be made at a sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop
shall be made, but in the absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be
made at the signal.
   (c)   Inoperable or Malfunctioning Signal. If a traffic control signal is
out of operation or is not functioning properly, vehicular traffic facing a:
      (1)   Green or yellow signal may proceed with caution as indicated in
paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) hereof;
      (2)   Red or completely unlighted signal shall stop in the same manner as
a stop sign, and the right to proceed shall be subject to the rules applicable
after making a stop at a stop sign.
(Ord. 4-78. Passed 2-22-78.)
444.03  PEDESTRIAN CONTROL SIGNALS.
   Whenever special pedestrian control signals exhibiting the words "Walk" or
"Don't Walk" are in place, the signals shall indicate as follows:
   (a)   "Walk." Pedestrians facing the signal shall proceed across the roadway
in the direction of the signal and shall be given the right of way by the
drivers of all vehicles.
   (b)   "Don't Walk." Pedestrians shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal, but any pedestrian who has partially completed his
crossing on the "Walk" signal shall proceed to a sidewalk or safety zone while
the "Don't Walk" signal is showing.
   (c)   Flashing "Walk." Whenever the "Walk" indication is flashing,
pedestrians facing the signal are cautioned that there is a possible hazard
from turning vehicles, but pedestrians may proceed across the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication and shall be given the right of way by
drivers of all vehicles.
   (d)   Flashing "Don't Walk." Whenever the "Don't Walk" indication is
flashing, pedestrians shall not start to cross the roadway in the direction of
the indication, but any pedestrian who has partially completed his crossing
during the "Walk" indication shall proceed to a sidewalk or safety zone, and
all drivers of vehicles shall yield to the pedestrian.
(Ord. 4-78. Passed 2-22-78.)
444.04  FLASHING SIGNALS.
   Whenever a flashing red or yellow signal is used in a traffic signal or with
a traffic sign it shall require obedience by vehicular traffic as follows:
   (a)   Flashing Red. When a red lens is illuminated with rapid intermittent
flashes, drivers of vehicles shall stop in the same manner as at a stop sign,
and the right to proceed shall be subject to the rules applicable after making
a stop at a stop sign.
   (b)   Flashing Yellow. When a yellow lens is illuminated with rapid
intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles may proceed through the intersection
or past such signal only with caution.

   (b)   Securing Vicious Dogs. Dogs of fierce, dangerous or vicious
propensity, when on the property of the owner or of a person keeping or
harboring such dog, shall be secured in such a way that the dog cannot reach
mailmen, delivery personnel, newspaper boys or any others who may have occasion
to enter the owner's premises in the course of their work.

person and/or from escaping. Such rabies-suspected dog shall be confined until
such time as a veterinarian has authorized in writing its release or
nonconfinement. The veterinarian's examination must be made between the tenth
and fifteenth day after the date the dog bite occurred.
(Ord. 12-77. Passed 5-11-77. )

Valley any dog six months of age or older unless such dog has a current rabies
vaccination. A dog will have a current vaccination for the remainder of the
month during which it was vaccinated and for the following twelve calendar
months, if injected with a dead virus, and/or for the following thirty-six
calendar months, if injected with a live virus vaccine. The dog must be re-
vaccinated before the expiration of the first and each subsequent current
vaccination period.
   (b)   Exception. Vaccination will not be required of any dog when a
certificate from a veterinarian that such dog should not be inoculated with
rabies vaccine and the valid medical reasons therefor have been filed with the
Board at the Animal Shelter.
   (c)   Registration. No owner shall have, within the Shenango Valley, any dog
six months of age or older unless such dog is currently vaccine-registered with
the Board. No dog shall be registered unless it has a current vaccination or an
exemption under subsection (b) hereof.
   (d)   Vaccination Tag. A registration shall be considered as being current
for the period of the current vaccination for which it was issued. A
vaccination-registration certificate and tag may be obtained at the time of
vaccination from veterinarians who have obtained authority from the Animal
Control Board to issue them or from a duly authorized employee at the Animal
Shelter upon presentation of a certificate of current vaccination.
   (e)   Veterinarian Registering. Upon application by a veterinarian, the
Board shall furnish such veterinarian with a supply of prenumbered vaccination
registration certificates and corresponding tags. The veterinarian shall be
authorized to receive applications and issue certificates and tags for animals
at the time of vaccination. Copies of all certificates issued shall be
transmitted to the Board in accordance with arrangements made by the Board with
the veterinarian. When applying for additional certificates and tags, the
veterinarian shall account to the Board for all those previously supplied to
him. At that time the veterinarian shall remit to the Animal Shelter all fees
collected. The veterinarian shall be held financially responsible for any other
certificates and tags no longer in his possession that have not been issued or
voided and returned to the Animal Shelter. All fees collected by veterinarians
are payable to the Board upon demand.

animal other than the one for which it was issued.

name. Application for such transfer shall be made at the Animal Shelter in
writing or in person and must be accompanied by a fee of twenty-five cents
($0.25).
   (j)   Registration Fee Exemption. Any person owning and using a dog for
leading because of a visual handicap is exempt from the vaccination-
registration fee.
   (k)   Responsibility. Eligibility for the registration fee exemption does
not release the owner of responsibility under other provisions of this section.
   (l)   Loss of Tag. If the tag is lost or destroyed the owner shall apply at
the Animal Shelter in writing or in person for a new tag by presentation of the
applicable vaccination-registration certificate accompanied by a fee of fifty
cents ($0.50).

educational or governmental use, and facilities and equipment for the use of
that channel capacity.
   (l)   "Price cap" means the ceiling set by the FCC on future increases in
basic cable rates regulated by the City, based on a formula using the Gross
National Product fixed weight price index, reflecting general increases in the
cost of doing business and changes in overall inflation.
   (m)   "Reasonable rate standard" means a per channel rate that is at, or
below, the benchmark or price cap level.
   (n)   "Superstation" means any non-local broadcast signal secondarily

(Ord. 21-93. Passed 1-27-94.)
823.02  FCC RATE REGULATIONS.
   (a)   The City will follow the FCC Rate Regulations in its regulation of the
basic service rates and charges of any cable television system operating in the
City, notwithstanding any different or inconsistent provisions in an applicable
franchise.
   (b)   In connection with such regulation, the City will ensure a reasonable
opportunity for consideration of the views of interested parties as provided in
this chapter.
   (c)   The Mayor or his or her designee is authorized to execute on behalf of
the City, and file with the FCC, such certification forms or other instruments
as are now or may hereafter be required by the FCC Rate Regulations in order to
enable the City to regulate basic service rates and charges.
(Res. 206-93. Passed 10-21-93.)
823.03  INITIAL REVIEW AND ESTABLISHMENT OF BASIC CABLE RATES.
   (a)   Notification of Operators of City's Intent to Regulate. Upon the
adoption of this section and the certification of the City by the FCC, the City
shall immediately notify all cable operators in the City, by certified mail,
return receipt requested, that the City intends to regulate subscriber rates
charged for the basic service tier and associated equipment as authorized by
the Cable Act of 1992.
   (b)   Cable Operator Response. Within thirty days of receiving notice from
the City, a cable operator shall file with the City its current rates for the
basic service tier and associated equipment and any supporting material
concerning the reasonableness of its rates.
   (c)   Expedited Determination of Rates.
      (1)   If Council is able to expeditiously determine that a cable
operator's rates for the basic service tier and associated equipment are within
the FCC's reasonable rate standard as determined by the applicable benchmark,
Council shall:
         A.   Hold a public hearing at which interested persons may express
their views; and
         B.   Act to approve the rates within thirty days from the date the
cable operator filed its basic cable rates with the City.
      (2)   If Council takes no action within thirty days from the date the
cable operator filed its basic cable rates with the City, the proposed rates
will continue in effect.
   (d)   Extended Review of Rates.
      (1)   If Council is unable to determine whether the rates at issue are
within the FCC's reasonable rate standard based on the material before it, or
if the cable operator submits a cost-of-service showing, Council shall, within
thirty days from the date the cable operator filed its basic cable rates with
the City, and by adoption of a formal resolution, invoke the following
additional periods of time, as applicable, to make a final determination:
         A.   Ninety days if Council needs more time to ensure that a rate is
within the FCC's reasonable rate standard; or
         B.   150 days if the cable operator has submitted a cost-of-service
showing seeking to justify a rate above the applicable benchmark.
      (2)   If Council has not made a decision within the ninety or 150-day
period, it shall issue a brief written order at the end of the period
requesting the cable operator to keep an accurate account of all amounts
received by reason of the proposed rate and on whose behalf the amounts are
paid.
   (e)   Public Hearings. During the extended review period and before taking
action on the proposed rate, Council shall hold at least one public hearing at
which interested persons may express their views and record objections.
   (f)   Objections. An interested person who wishes to make an objection to
the proposed initial basic rate may request the City Clerk to record the
objection during the public hearing or may submit the objection in writing
anytime before the decision resolution is adopted. In order for an objection to
be made part of the record, the objector must provide the City Clerk with the
objector's name and address.
   (g)   Benchmark Analysis. If a cable operator submits its current basic
cable rate schedule as being in compliance with the FCC's reasonable rate
standard, Council shall review the rates using the benchmark analysis in
accordance with the standard form authorized by the FCC. Based on the City
Council's findings, the initial basic cable rates shall be established as
follows:
      (1)   If the current basic cable rates are below the benchmark, those
rates shall become the initial basic cable rates, and the cable operator's
rates will be capped at that level.
      (2)   If the current basic cable rates exceed the benchmark, the rates
shall be the greater of the cable operator's per channel rate on September 30,
1992, reduced by ten percent, or the applicable benchmark, adjusted for
inflation and any change in the number of channels occurring between September
30, 1992, and the initial date of regulation.
      (3)   If the current basic cable rates exceed the benchmark, but the
cable operator's per channel rate was below the benchmark on September 30,
1992, the initial basic cable rate shall be the benchmark, adjusted for
inflation.
   (h)   Cost-of-Service Showings. If a cable operator does not wish to reduce
the rates to the permitted level, the cable operator shall have the opportunity
to submit a cost-of-service showing in an attempt to justify initial basic
cable rates above the FCC's reasonable rate standard. Council will review a
cost-of-service submission pursuant to FCC standards for cost-of-service
review. Council may approve initial basic cable rates above the benchmark if
the cable operator makes the necessary showing. However, a cost-of-service
determination resulting in rates below the benchmark or below the cable
operator's September 30, 1992, rates minus ten percent, will prescribe the
cable operator's new rates.
   (i)   Decisions of Council.
      (1)   Contents of formal resolutions. After completion of its review of
the cable operator's proposed rates, Council shall adopt its decision by formal
resolution. The decision shall include one of the following:
         A.   If the proposal is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard or
is justified by a cost-of-service analysis, Council shall approve the initial
basic cable rates proposed by the cable operator; or
         B.   If the proposal is not within the FCC's reasonable rate standard
and the cost-of-service analysis, if any, does not justify the proposed rates,
Council shall establish initial basic cable rates that are within the FCC's
reasonable rate standard or that are justified by a cost-of-service analysis.
      (2)   Rollbacks and refunds. If Council determines that the initial basic
cable rates as submitted exceed the reasonable rate standard or that the cable
operator's cost-of-service showing justifies lower rates, Council may order the
rates reduced in accordance with subsection (g) or (h) hereof, as applicable.
In addition, Council may order the cable operator to pay to subscribers refunds
of the excessive portion of the rates, with interest (computed at applicable
rates published by the Internal Revenue Service for tax refunds and additional
tax payments), retroactive to September 1, 1993. The method for paying any
refund and the interest rate will be in accordance with FCC regulations as
directed in Council's decision resolution.
      (3)   Statements of reasons for decisions and public notice. If rates
proposed by a cable operator are disapproved, in whole or in part, or if there
were objections made by other parties to the proposed rates, the resolution
must state the reasons for the decision and Council must give public notice of
its decision. Public notice will be given by advertisement once in the official
newspaper of the City.
   (j)   Appeals. Council's decision concerning rates for the basic service
tier or associated equipment may be appealed to the FCC in accordance with
applicable Federal regulations.
(Ord. 21-93. Passed 1-27-94.)
823.04  REVIEW AND APPROVAL OF REQUESTS FOR INCREASES IN BASIC CABLE RATES.
   (a)   Notification to City and Subscribers of Proposed Increases. A cable
operator in the City who wishes to increase the rates for the basic service
tier or associated equipment shall file a request with the City and notify all
subscribers at least thirty days before the cable operator desires the increase
to take effect. This notice may not be given more often than annually and not
until at least one year after the determination of the initial basic cable
rates.
   (b)   Expedited Determination of Rates.
      (1)   If Council is able to expeditiously determine that the cable
operator's rate increase request for basic cable service is within the FCC's
reasonable rate standard, as determined by the applicable price cap, Council
shall:
         A.   Hold a public hearing at which interested persons may express
their views; and
         B.   Act to approve the rate increase within thirty days from the date
the cable operator filed its request with the City.
      (2)   If Council takes no action within thirty days from the date the
cable operator filed its request with the City, the proposed rates will go into
effect.
   (c)   Extended Review of Rates.
      (1)   If Council is unable to determine whether the rate increase is
within the FCC's reasonable rate standard based on the material before it, or
if the cable operator submits a cost-of-service showing, Council shall, by
adoption of a formal resolution, invoke the following additional periods of
time, as applicable, to make a final determination:
         A.   Ninety days if Council needs more time to ensure that the
requested increase is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard as determined
by the applicable price cap; and
         B.   150 days if the cable operator has submitted a cost-of-service
showing seeking to justify a rate increase above the applicable price cap.
      (2)   The proposed rate increase shall be tolled during the extended
review period.
      (3)   If Council has not made a decision within the ninety or 150-day
period, it shall issue a brief order at the end of the period requesting the
cable operator to keep an accurate account of all amounts received by reason of
the proposed rate increase and on whose behalf the amounts are paid.
   (d)   Public Hearings. During the extended review period and before taking
action on the requested rate increase, Council shall hold at least one public
hearing at which interested persons may express their views and record
objections.
   (e)   Objections. An interested person who wishes to make an objection to
the proposed rate increase may request the City Clerk to record the objection
during the public hearing or may submit the objection in writing anytime before
the decision resolution is adopted. In order for an objection to be made part
of the record, the objector must provide the City Clerk with the objector's
name and address.
   (f)   Delayed Determinations. If Council is unable to make a final
determination concerning a requested rate increase within the extended time
period, the cable operator may put the increase into effect, subject to
subsequent refund if Council later issues a decision disapproving any portion
of the increase.
   (g)   Price Cap Analysis. If a cable operator presents its request for a
rate increase as being in compliance with the FCC's price cap, Council shall
review the rate using the price cap analysis in accordance with the standard
form authorized by the FCC. Based on Council's findings, the basic cable rate
shall be established as follows:
      (1)   If the proposed basic cable rate increase is within the price cap
established by the FCC, the proposed rates shall become the new basic cable
rates.
      (2)   If the proposed basic cable rate increase exceeds the price cap
established by the FCC, Council shall disapprove the proposed rate increase and
order an increase that is in compliance with the price cap.
   (h)   Cost-of-Service Showings. If a cable operator submits a cost-of-
service showing in an attempt to justify a rate increase above the price cap,
Council will review the submission pursuant to FCC standards for cost-of-
service review. Council may approve a rate increase above the price cap if the
cable operator makes the necessary showing. However, a cost-of-service
determination resulting in a rate below the price cap or below the cable
operator's then-current rate will prescribe the cable operator's new rate.
   (i)   Decisions of Council. Council's decision concerning the requested rate
increase shall be adopted by formal resolution. If a rate increase proposed by
a cable operator is disapproved, in whole or in part, or if objections were
made by other parties to the proposed rate increase, then the resolution must
state the reasons for the decision. Objections may be made at the public
hearing by a person requesting the City Clerk to record the objection or may be
submitted in writing at any time before the decision resolution is adopted.
   (j)   Refunds.
      (1)   Council may order refunds of subscribers' rate payments, with
interest, if:
         A.   Council was unable to make a decision within the extended time
period described in subsection (c) hereof; and
         B.   The cable operator implemented the rate increase at the end of
the extended review period; and
         C.   Council determines that the rate increase as submitted exceeds
the applicable price cap or that the cable operator failed to justify the rate
increase by a cost-of-service showing, and Council disapproves any portion of
the rate increase.
      (2)   The method for paying any refund and the interest rate will be in
accordance with FCC regulations as directed in Council's decision resolution.
   (k)   Appeals. Council's decision concerning rate increases for the basic
service tier or associated equipment may be appealed to the FCC in accordance
with applicable Federal regulations.
(Ord. 21-93. Passed 1-27-94.)
823.05  CABLE OPERATOR INFORMATION.
   (a)   Required.
      (1)   In those cases when the cable operator has submitted initial rates
or proposed an increase that exceeds the reasonable rate standard, Council may
require the cable operator to produce information in addition to that
submitted, including proprietary information, if needed to make a rate
determination. In these cases, a cable operator may request that the
information be kept confidential in accordance with this section.
      (2)   In cases where initial or proposed rates comply with the reasonable
rate standard, Council may request additional information only in order to
document that the cable operator's rates are in accordance with the standard.
   (b)   Requests for Confidentiality.
      (1)   A cable operator submitting information to Council may request, in
writing, that the information not be made routinely available for public
inspection. A copy of the request shall be attached to and cover all of the
information and all copies of the information to which it applies.
      (2)   If feasible, the information to which the request applies shall be
physically separated from any information to which the request does not apply.
If this is not feasible, the portion of the information to which the request
applies shall be identified.
      (3)   Each request shall contain a statement of the reasons for
withholding inspection and a statement of the facts upon which those reasons
are based.
      (4)   Casual requests which do not comply with the requirements of this
subsection shall not be considered.
   (c)   Council Action. Requests which comply with the requirements of
subsection (b) hereof will be acted upon by Council. Council will grant the
request if the cable operator presents, by a preponderance of the evidence, a
case for nondisclosure consistent with applicable Federal regulations. If the
request is granted, the ruling will be placed in a public file in lieu of the
information withheld from public inspection. If the request does not present a
case for nondisclosure and Council denies the request, Council shall take one
of the following actions:
      (1)   If the information has been submitted voluntarily without any
direction from the City, the cable operator may request that the City return
the information without considering it. Ordinarily, the City will comply with
this request. Only in the unusual instance when the public interest so requires
will the information be made available for public inspection.
      (2)   If the information was required to be submitted by Council, the
information will be made available for public inspection.
   (d)   Appeals. If Council denies the request for confidentiality, the cable
operator may seek review of that decision from the FCC within five working days
of Council's decision, and the release of the information will be stayed
pending review.
(Ord. 21-93. Passed 1-27-94.)
823.06  AUTOMATIC RATE ADJUSTMENTS
   (a)   Annual Inflation Adjustment. In accordance with FCC regulations, the
cable operator may adjust its capped base per-channel rate for the basic
service tier annually by the final GNP-PI Index.
   (b)   Other External Costs.
      (1)   The FCC regulations also allow the cable operator to increase its
rate for the basic service tier automatically to reflect certain external cost
factors to the extent that the increase in cost of those factors exceeds the
GNP-PI. These factors include retransmission consent fees, programming costs,
State and local taxes applicable to the provision of cable television service
and costs of franchise requirements. The total cost of an increase in a
franchise fee may be automatically added to the base per channel rate, without
regard to its relation to the GNP-PI.
      (2)   For all categories of external costs other than retransmission
consent and franchise fees, the starting date for measuring changes in external
costs for which the basic service per-channel rate may be adjusted will be the
date on which the basic service tier becomes subject to regulation, or February
28, 1994, whichever occurs first. The permitted per-channel charge may not be
adjusted for costs of retransmission consent fees or changes in those fees
incurred before October 6, 1994.
   (c)   Notification and Review. The cable operator shall notify the City at
least thirty days in advance of a rate increase based on automatic adjustment
items. The City shall review the increase to determine whether the item or
items qualify as automatic adjustments. If the City makes no objection within
thirty days of receiving notice of the increase, the increase may go into
effect.
(Ord. 21-93. Passed 1-27-94.)
823.07  REFUNDS.
   The City may order the cable operator to refund to subscribers a portion of
previously paid rates under the following circumstances:
   (a)   A portion of the previously paid rates have been determined to be in
excess of the permitted tier charge or above the actual cost of equipment; or
   (b)   The cable operator has failed to comply with a valid rate order issued
by the City.
(Ord. 21-93. Passed 1-27-94.)
823.99  PENALTY.
   If a cable operator fails to comply with a rate decision or refund order,
the cable operator shall be subject to a fine of five hundred dollars ($500.00)
for each day that the cable operator fails to comply.
(Ord. 21-93. Passed 1-27-94.)

dollar ($1.00) shall accompany each application.
(Ord. 870. Passed 12-12-39.)
826.05  REGULATIONS GOVERNING FUMIGATION.
   Every fumigation within the City shall be conducted in accordance with the
following regulations:
   (a)   When using hydrocyanic acid gas in fumigation, the concentration shall
never be greater than one percent. This concentration of hydrocyanic acid gas
shall be the standard of toxicity as regards all other poisonous gases.
   (b)   The fumigation permit shall be posted in a prominent place at the
entrance of the premises to be fumigated and kept posted until fumigation and
ventilation are completed.
   (c)   Warning signs, supplied by the fumigator and approved by the Director
of Public Safety, shall be posted at every entrance to the premises and kept
posted until fumigation and ventilation are completed.
   (d)   The fumigator, immediately prior to the commencement of a fumigation,
shall notify every person in the premises of the intended fumigation and no
person shall remain on the premises during such fumigation. Attached houses
shall be considered as one building.
   (e)   The fumigator shall warn occupants of adjacent premises immediately
prior to the commencement of a fumigation and all windows in such premises
shall be kept closed during the fumigation and ventilation period if inspection
by the fumigator shows a possibility of gas gaining entrance, except where

make a final inspection and see that all workers and other persons are out of
the premises. Immediately following such inspection, the final entrance shall
be sealed, locked and the keyhole taped.
   (h)   During the period from the commencement of preparation for fumigation
until the premises are released after ventilation, the following persons shall
be on duty: two men, one of whom shall be a licensed fumigator, from the
commencement of the preparation until the premises are sealed; one properly
instructed watchman thereafter until fumigation has been completed and
ventilation is started; and two men from the time ventilation is started until
completed and the premises
released.
   (i)   The fumigator shall at all times have available a supply of ammonium
carbonate and aromatic spirits of ammonia for first aid in case of accident.
   (j)   The fumigator shall use test paper to determine leaks in the premises
during fumigation and after ventilation shall apply test papers to bedding and
clothing to determine the presence of gas. The fumigator shall not leave the
premises until reasonably certain that they have been thoroughly ventilated and

months unless revoked as herein provided.
      (2)   Any person as defined herein who comes into possession by any means
whatsoever, or acquires a legal or equitable ownership interest in a dwelling
or dwelling unit that is, or is to be, occupied by a tenant as defined herein
or by a person or persons who are not the owners of said property, which is not
validly licensed, shall make application for a license as prescribed by this
Chapter within thirty (30) days from the date that they come into possession or
acquire legal or equitable ownership interest in said dwelling or dwelling
unit. The landlord shall thereafter be required to re-apply for a license in
accordance with this Chapter.
      (3)   Every landlord shall make a separate application to the City of
Sharon Code Enforcement officer for a license for each dwelling or dwelling
unit owned. In the case of dwelling or dwelling units that have multiple units
contained therein, including but not limited to, apartment complexes, duplexes,
triplexes, residential care facilities, supervising care facilities, rooming
houses or any or all combinations thereof, each separate unit contained therein
that is occupied or available for occupancy by someone other than the owner
shall be considered a dwelling or dwelling unit as defined herein and shall
require its own separate license.
      (4)   Every landlord applying for a license shall complete the
application form as provided by the City of Sharon and shall supply such
information as required by the City, including but not limited to:
         A.   The name, address, telephone number of the owner or owners of the

conspicuous manner and in bold type that the landlord, by making application to
the City for a license, consents to the City Code Officer entering the
landlord’s rental unit(s) to complete the inspection as required by this
Chapter.
      (5)   Every landlord shall pay a license fee in the following amount each
time an application for a license is made:
         A.   One hundred dollars ($100.00) per dwelling for up to three (3)
units contained therein;
         B.   One hundred dollars ($100.00) per dwelling plus an additional

         D.   One hundred dollars ($100.00) per dwelling plus an additional
three hundred dollars ($300.00) for all units in excess of eighty (80) units.
      (6)   Upon receipt of the fully completed licensing application form,
payment of the fee, and completed passing inspection, the Code Enforcement
Officer or his designee shall, within ten (10) days, issue a license to the
owner or responsible local agent, except in the event that the dwelling or
dwelling unit has been determined by the Code Enforcement Officer to be in
violation of this Chapter. The license shall be valid until re-application is
required unless it is revoked or suspended pursuant to this Chapter. Upon
expiration the dwelling(s) or dwelling unit(s) shall not be occupied by a
tenant as defined herein unless the landlord re-applies, and is granted, a new
license as required by this Chapter. At least thirty (30) days prior to the
expiration of the license, the landlord shall notify the Code Enforcement
Officer of the pending expiration and that the landlord wishes to schedule a
time and date for a new “initial inspection” as defined herein.
         A.   Every dwelling or dwelling unit shall, after the landlord’s
application for a license, be subject to the inspection provisions contained
herein. Every landlord shall comply with and satisfy all requirements of this
Chapter and any other requirements that the City may require from time to time.
         B.   Every license (in whatever form) shall at all times be maintained
in a conspicuous place in the dwelling or dwelling unit and available for
inspection by City officials, or, in the alternative, the City may, for
properties with a single rental unit thereon, issue a sticker for placement on
an outside door or window that is then conspicuously displayed at all times to
City Officials and to the public.
      (7)   No license may be issued with respect to any application unless
proof of comprehensive property insurance in an amount of not less that ten
thousand dollars ($10,000.00) or such higher amounts that may be reasonably
necessary to cover the costs of demolition of any structure for which the
application pertains is in force naming the City of Sharon as a certificate
holder and further providing for not less than thirty (30) days notice to the
City of any cancellation or modification or termination of the policy. Failure
to obtain this required insurance coverage within fourteen (14) days after a
tenant takes possession of a dwelling or dwelling unit and then maintains same
during the complete term of the license issued shall be grounds for immediate
revocation or suspension of the applicable license.
   (b)   Inspections.
      (1)   The Code Enforcement Officer or his designee shall, upon the
receipt of an application for a license, schedule the dwelling or dwelling unit
as soon as possible for inspection. Said inspection shall hereinafter be
referred to as the “initial inspection.”
      (2)   The Code Enforcement Officer or his designee is hereby authorized
and directed to make inspections to each dwelling or dwelling unit and each
unit contained therein which the City receives an application for a license to
determine the condition of the dwelling or dwelling unit, its rooms and
premises in order that the code enforcement officer may perform such duties
necessary for safeguarding the health and safety of the occupants of the
dwelling or dwelling units and to the general public. For the purpose of making
such inspections, the Code Enforcement Officer is hereby authorized to enter,
examine and survey during normal business hours, all dwelling or dwelling units
contained therein, establishments and premises. The owner or occupant of every
dwelling or dwelling unit, contained therein, shall give the Code Enforcement
Officer access to such dwelling or dwelling unit and its premises at all
reasonable times for the purposes of such inspection, examination and survey.
Every occupant of a dwelling or dwelling unit shall give the owner thereof, or
his agent or employee, access to any part of the dwelling or dwelling unit or
its premises at all reasonable times for the purposes of making such repairs or
alterations that are necessary to effect compliance with the provisions of this
Chapter. It shall be the responsibility of every landlord to provide access to
each dwelling and/or dwelling unit for every inspection scheduled by the Code
Enforcement Officer whether the dwelling and/or dwelling and/or dwelling unit
is vacant or occupied.
      (3)   The Code Enforcement Officer shall, after the initial inspection,
certify to the City that the dwelling or dwelling unit is in compliance with
this Chapter.
      (4)   Inspection shall also occur which may be required in the
investigation of complaints by tenants or reinspection of a dwelling or
dwelling units that are not in compliance with this Chapter. It shall be
unlawful for a landlord to transfer possession or occupancy of a dwelling or
dwelling unit to a tenant without first notifying the City of Sharon in writing
of the landlord’s intent to do so thereafter complying with all other
provisions of this Chapter including, but not limited to the inspection and
licensing provisions.
      (5)   If in the event that the City Code Enforcement Office receives a
complaint from a tenant(s), the Code Enforcement Officer shall notify the
landlord or its responsible agent in writing that a complaint has been filed
and that an inspection of the dwelling or dwelling unit is required. The notice
shall contain the time and date of the scheduled inspection. The landlord shall
make the premises available for inspection. If, after the inspection the Code
Enforcement Officer finds that the problem complained of exists and that it is
a violation of this Chapter, specifically Section
829.12, the landlord shall be ordered to correct the violation pursuant to the
requirements of this Chapter and shall pay an inspection fee to the City in the
amount of fifty dollars ($50.00). If the landlord fails to bring the dwelling
or dwelling unit into compliance within twenty (20) days, the landlord shall be
subject to Section
829.09(b)(8) and all other provisions of this Chapter. If after inspection, the
Code Enforcement Officer finds that the problem complained of does not exist,
or if existent, does not violate the provisions of this Chapter, then in either
said event, the complaining tenant(s) shall be billed fifty dollars ($50.00) by
the City, one-half of which shall be remitted to the landlord upon collection
thereof.
      (6)   For any inspection conducted by the City pursuant to the
requirements of this Chapter as amended the following fees shall be chargeable:
         A.   For an initial inspection: one hundred dollars ($100.00).
         B.   For a required first re-inspection: twenty-five dollars ($25.00).
         C.   For a required second re-inspection: fifty dollars ($50.00).
         D.   For a required third re-inspection: seventy-five dollars
($75.00).
         E.   For a required fourth and all subsequent re-inspections: one
hundred dollars ($100.00) each.
      (7)   All scheduled inspection or re-inspection appointments not attended
by the landlord or a designated property manager or tenant shall be treated as
an inspection or re-inspection as the case may be and the appropriate fee
pursuant to the inspection fee schedule shall be charged.
      (8)   In the event that a dwelling or dwelling unit fails to pass any
inspection required by this Chapter, the Code Enforcement Officer shall
reinspect the dwelling or dwelling unit as soon as conveniently possible, but
shall occur no later than twenty (20) days after the dwelling or dwelling unit
is deemed to be in violation of this Chapter. Until such time as the Code
Enforcement Officer certifies that the dwelling or dwelling unit is in
compliance with this Chapter, the dwelling or dwelling unit shall not be leased
for non-owner occupancy or made available for the same. The landlord shall, at
the landlord’s sole and absolute expense, re-locate any tenants occupying a
dwelling unit for which a license, as required by this Chapter, has not been
obtained or maintained.
   (c)   Alternative Inspections.
      (1)   Every landlord as defined herein shall have the option of securing
a license by having a qualified inspector, other than the City Code Enforcement
Officer, certify that their dwelling(s) or dwelling unit(s) as in compliance
with this Chapter, including but not limited to Section 829.12 as set forth
below. The landlord shall notify the City Code Enforcement Office in writing at
least ten (10) days prior to the inspection of the proposed inspection date
that they have elected an alternate inspector. The written notice shall
designate the name, telephone number, qualifications of the alternate inspector
and the date that the inspection is to occur. Thereafter, when the landlord
reapplies for a new license on the applicable date from the issuance of the
previous license, and the landlord elects to have the inspection done by an
inspector other then the City Code Officer, the landlord shall notify the City
Code Enforcement Office in writing not more than thirty (30) days but not less
than ten (10) days prior to the expiration of the license of this election of
an alternate inspector. All other provisions of this Chapter shall remain in
full force and effect. The inspection, if done by an alternate inspector, shall
be completed and submitted to the Code Enforcement Office no more then sixty
(60) days from the date that the landlord makes application for a license.
      (2)   The alternate inspector chosen by the landlord shall be approved by
the City Code Enforcement Officer prior to the inspector performing any
inspections and shall have at least the following minimum requirements;
         A.   Be familiar with the provisions and requirements of the
International Property Maintenance Code, and
         B.   Be a Pennsylvania State certified engineer or;

         D.   Be a certified property maintenance inspector or;
         E.   Be approved by the City Code Enforcement Office because of

      (3)   If in any event the landlord chooses to have an inspector other

landlord shall be responsible for all fees charged or otherwise due and owing
to the inspector for any inspections that are required by this Chapter.

with a primary place of employment within the City during the tax year.  Each
natural person who exercises such privilege for any length of time during any
tax year shall pay the tax for that year in the amount of fifty-two dollars
($52.00), assessed on a pro rata basis, in accordance with the provisions of
this chapter.  This tax may be used solely for the following purposes as the
same may be allocated by the City Council from time to time: emergency
services, which shall include emergency medical services, police services and/
or fire services; road construction and/or maintenance; reduction of property
taxes; or property tax relief through implementation of a homestead and
farmstead exclusion in accordance with 53 Pa. C.S. Ch. 85, Subch. F (relating
to a homestead property exclusion). The City shall use no less than twenty-five
percent of the funds derived from the tax for emergency services. This tax is
in addition to all other taxes of any kind or nature heretofore levied by the
City.  The tax shall be no more than fifty-two dollars ($52.00) on each person
for each calendar year, irrespective of the number of political subdivisions
within which a person maybe employed.
(Ord. 19-07.  Passed 11-29-2007.)
852.04  DUTY OF EMPLOYERS TO COLLECT.
   (a)   Each employer within the City, as well as those employers situated
outside the City but who engage in business within the City, is hereby charged
with the duty of collecting the tax from each of his or her employees engaged
by him or her or performing for him or her within the City and making a return
and payment thereof to the Collector. Further, each employer is hereby
authorized to deduct this tax for each employee in his or her employ, whether
said employee is paid by salary, wage or commission and whether or not all such
services are performed within the City.
   (b)   A person subject to the tax shall be assessed by the employer a pro
rata share of the tax for each payroll period in which the person is engaging
in an occupation. The pro rata share of the tax assessed on the person for a
payroll period shall be determined by dividing the rate of the tax levied for
the calendar year by the number of payroll periods established by the employer
for the calendar year. For purposes of determining the pro rata share, an
employer shall round down the amount of the tax collected each payroll period
to the nearest one-hundredth of a dollar. Collection of the tax shall be made
on a payroll period basis for each payroll period in which the person is
engaging in an occupation, except as provided in subsection (d) hereof.  For
purposes of this subsection, combined rate shall mean the aggregate annual rate
of the tax levied by the school district and the City.
   (c)   No person shall be subject to the payment of the local services tax by
more than one political subdivision during each payroll period.
   (d)   In the case of concurrent employment, an employer shall refrain from
withholding the tax if the employee provides a recent pay statement from a
principal employer that includes the name of the employer, the length of the
payroll period and the amount of the tax withheld and a statement from the
employee that the pay statement is from the employee's principal employer and
the employee will notify other employers of a change in principal place of
employment within two weeks of its occurrence. The employee's statement shall
be provided on the form approved by DCED.
   (e)   The tax shall be no more than fifty-two dollars ($52.00) on each
person for each calendar year, irrespective of the number of political
subdivisions within which a person may be employed. The political subdivision
shall provide a taxpayer a receipt of payment upon request by the taxpayer.
   (f)   No employer shall be held liable for failure to withhold the tax or
for the payment of the withheld tax money to the political subdivision if the
failure to withhold taxes arises from incorrect information submitted by the
employee as to the employee's place or places of employment, the employee's
principal office or where the employee is principally employed. Further, an
employer shall not be liable for payment of the local services tax in an amount
exceeding the amount withheld by the employer if the employer complies with the
provisions of subsection (b) hereof and this subsection and remits the amount
so withheld in accordance with this chapter.
   (g)   Employers shall be required to remit the local services taxes thirty
days after the end of each quarter of a calendar year.
(Ord. 19-07.  Passed 11-29-2007.)
852.05  RETURNS.
   Each employer shall prepare and file a return showing a computation of the
tax on forms to be supplied to the employer by the Collector. If an employer
fails to file the return and pay the tax, whether or not the employer makes
collection thereof from the salary, wages or commissions paid by him or her to
an employee, except as provided hereafter in this chapter, the employer shall
be responsible for the payment of the tax in full as though the tax had
originally been levied against the employer.
(Ord. 19-07.  Passed 11-29-2007.)
852.06  DATES FOR DETERMINING TAX LIABILITY AND PAYMENT.

over to the Collector on or before the thirtieth day following the end of each
calendar quarter of each such tax year.
(Ord. 19-07.  Passed 11-29-2007.)
852.07  INDIVIDUALS ENGAGED IN MORE THAN ONE OCCUPATION OR EMPLOYED IN MORE
THAN ONE POLITICAL SUBDIVISION.
   (a)   The situs of the tax shall be the place of employment on the first day
the person becomes subject to the tax during each payroll period.  In the event
a person is engaged in more than one occupation, that is, concurrent
employment, or an occupation which requires the person working in more than one
political subdivision during a payroll period, the priority of claim to collect
the local services tax shall be in the following order:
      (1)   First, the political subdivision in which a person maintains his or
her principal office or is principally employed;
      (2)   Second, the political subdivision in which the person resides and
works if the tax is levied by that political subdivision;
      (3)   Third, the political subdivision in which a person is employed and
which imposes the tax nearest in miles to the person's home.
   (b)   In case of dispute, a tax receipt of the taxing authority for that
calendar year declaring that the taxpayer has made prior payment constitutes
prima facie certification of payment to all other political subdivisions.
(Ord. 19-07.  Passed 11-29-2007.)
852.08  SELF-EMPLOYED INDIVIDUALS.
   Each self-employed individual who performs services of any type or kind or
engages in any occupation or profession within a primary place of employment
within the City shall be required to comply with this chapter and pay the pro
rata portion of the tax due to the Collector on or before the thirtieth day
following the end of each quarter.
(Ord. 19-07.  Passed 11-29-2007.)
852.09  NONRESIDENTS SUBJECT TO TAX.
   All employers and self-employed individuals residing or having their place
of business outside of the City, but who perform services of any type or kind
or engage in any occupation or profession within the City, do by virtue thereof
agree to be bound by and subject themselves to the provisions, penalties and
regulations promulgated under this chapter with the same force and effect as
though they were residents of the City. Further, any individual engaged in an
occupation within the City and an employee of a nonresident employer may, for
the purpose of this chapter, be considered a self-employed person, and in the
event his or her tax is not paid, the City shall have the option of proceeding
against either the employer or employee for the collection of this tax as
hereinafter provided.
(Ord. 19-07.  Passed 11-29-2007.)
852.10  ADMINISTRATION OF TAX.
   (a)   The Collector shall be appointed by resolution of the City.  It shall
be the duty of the Collector to accept and receive payments of this tax and to
keep a record thereof showing the amount received by him from each employer or
self-employed person together with the date the tax was received.
   (b)   The Collector is hereby charged with the administration and
enforcement of this chapter and is hereby charged and empowered, subject to
municipal approval, to prescribe, adopt and promulgate rules and regulations
relating to any matter pertaining to the administration and enforcement of this
chapter including provisions for the examination of the payroll records of any
employer subject to this chapter, the examination and correction of any return
made in compliance with this chapter and any payment alleged or found to be
incorrect, or as to which overpayment is claimed or found to have occurred. Any
person aggrieved by any decision of the Collector shall have the right to
appeal consistent with the Local Taxpayers Bill of Rights under Act 50 of 1998
(municipalities may detail their appeal processes).
   (c)   The Collector is hereby authorized to examine the books and payroll
records of any employer in order to verify the accuracy of any return made by
an employer, or, if no return was made, to ascertain the tax due. Each employer
is hereby directed and required to give the Collector the means, facilities and
opportunity for such examination.
(Ord. 19-07.  Passed 11-29-2007.)
852.11  RECOVERY OF TAXES AND SURCHARGES.

thirty days after the due dates above set forth, the Collector may sue for the
recovery of any such tax due or unpaid under this chapter together with
interest and penalty.
   (b)   If for any reason the tax is not paid when due, interest at the rate
of six percent on the amount of such tax shall be calculated beginning with the
due date of such tax, and a penalty of five percent shall be added to the flat
rate of such tax for nonpayment thereof. Where suit is brought for the recovery
of this tax or other appropriate remedy undertaken, the individual liable
therefor shall, in addition, be responsible and liable for the costs of
collection.
(Ord. 19-07.  Passed 11-29-2007.)
852.12  INTERPRETATION.

City to levy and collect the tax hereby imposed on any occupation not within
the taxing power of the City under the Constitution of the United States and
the laws of the Commonwealth.
   (b)   If the tax imposed under this chapter is held by any court of

or the validity of the tax so imposed, on other persons or individuals as
herein provided.
(Ord. 19-07.  Passed 11-29-2007.)
852.13  EFFECTIVE PERIOD.

required by this chapter.
(Ord. 19-07.  Passed 11-29-2007.)
852.15  EXEMPTION AND REFUNDS.
   (a)   Exemption. Any person whose total earned income and net profits from
all sources within the City is less than twelve thousand dollars ($12,000) for
any calendar year in which the tax is levied is exempt from the payment of the
tax for that calendar year. In addition, the following persons are exempt from
payment of the tax:
      (1)   Any person who has served in any war or armed conflict in which the
United States was engaged and is honorably discharged or released under
honorable circumstances from active service if, as a result of military
service, the person is blind, paraplegic or a double or quadruple amputee or
has a service-connected disability declared by the United States Veterans'
Administration or its successor to be a total one hundred percent disability.
      (2)   Any person who serves as a member of a reserve component of the
armed forces and is called to active duty at any time during the taxable year.
For the purposes of this paragraph, "reserve component of the armed forces"
shall mean the United States Army Reserve, United States Navy Reserve, United
States Marine Corps Reserve, United States Coast Guard Reserve, United States
Air Force Reserve, the Pennsylvania Army National Guard or the Pennsylvania Air
National Guard.
   (b)   Procedure to Claim Exemption.
      (1)   A person seeking to claim an exemption from the local services tax
may annually file an exemption certificate with the City and with the person's
employer affirming that the person reasonably expects to receive earned income
and net profits from all sources within the City of less than twelve thousand
dollars ($12,000) in the calendar year for which the exemption certificate is
filed. In the event the City utilizes a tax collection officer, it shall
provide a copy of the exemption certificate to that officer. The exemption
certificate shall have attached to it a copy of all the employee's last pay
stubs or W-2 forms from employment within the City for the year prior to the
fiscal year for which the employee is requesting to be exempted from the tax.
Upon receipt of the exemption certificate and until otherwise instructed by the
City or except as required by clause (2), the employer shall not withhold the
tax from the person during the calendar year or the remainder of the calendar
year for which the exemption certificate applies. Employers shall ensure that
the exemption certificate forms are readily available to employees at all times
and shall furnish each new employee with a form at the time of hiring. The
exemption certificate form shall be the uniform form provided by the City.
      (2)   With the respect to a person who claimed an exemption for a given
calendar year from the tax, upon notification to an employer by the person or
by the City that the person has received earned income and net profits from all
sources within the City equal to or in excess of twelve thousand dollars
($12,000) in that calendar year, or upon an employer's payment to the person of
earned income within the City in an amount equal to or in excess of twelve
thousand dollars ($12,000) in that calendar year, an employer shall withhold
the local services tax from the person under clause (3).
      (3)   If a person who claimed an exemption for a given calendar year from
the tax becomes subject to the tax for the calendar year under clause (2), the
employer shall withhold the tax for the remainder of that calendar year. The
employer shall withhold from the person, for the first payroll period after
receipt of the notification under clause (2), a lump sum equal to the amount of
tax that was not withheld from the person due to the exemption claimed by the
person under this paragraph, plus the per payroll amount due for that first
payroll period. The amount of tax withheld per payroll period for the remaining
payroll periods in that calendar year shall be the same amount withheld for
other employees. In the event the employment of a person subject to withholding
of the tax under this clause is subsequently severed in that calendar year, the
person shall be liable for any outstanding balance of tax due, and the City may
pursue collection under this chapter.
      (4)   Except as provided in clause (2), it is the intent of this
paragraph that employers shall not be responsible for investigating exemption
certificates, monitoring tax exemption eligibility or exempting any employee
from the local services tax.
   (c)   Refunds. The City, in consultation with the Collector and DCED, shall
establish procedures for the processing of refund claims for any tax paid by
any person who is eligible for exemption, which procedures shall be in accord
with provisions of the general municipal law relating to refunds of
overpayments and interest on overpayments. Refunds made within seventy-five
days of a refund request or seventy-five days after the last day the employer
is required to remit the tax for the last quarter of the calendar year,
whichever is later, shall not be subject to interest. No refunds shall be made
for amounts overpaid in a calendar year that do not exceed one dollar ($1.00). 
The City or the Collector shall determine eligibility for exemption and provide
refunds to exempt persons.

prosecution, and, in default of payment of such fine and costs, to imprisonment

delivered, accepted or presented for recording, shall be subject to pay, for
and in respect to the transaction or any part thereof, a tax at the rate of two
percent of the value of the real estate represented by such document, which tax

Sections 6901 et seq., as amended, so that if any other political subdivision
has imposed or hereafter imposes such tax on the same person or transfer, then
the tax levied by the City under the authority of such Act shall, during the
time such duplication of the tax exists, except as hereinafter otherwise
provided, be one percent of the value of the real estate presented by such
document and such rate shall become effective without any action on the part of
the City. However, the City and any other political subdivision which imposes
such tax on the same person or transfer may agree that, instead of limiting
their respective rates as herein provided, they will impose, respectively,
different rates, the total of which rates shall not exceed the maximum rate
permitted under this section.
   (d)   Any tax imposed under this section that is not paid by the date the
tax is due shall bear interest as prescribed for interest on delinquent

delinquent Commonwealth taxes as provided in Section 806 of the Act of April 9,
1929 (P.L. 343, No. 176) (72 P.S. § 806), as amended, known as "The Fiscal
Code" or the maximum interest rate permitted under the Municipal Claims and Tax
Liens Act for tax claims.

860.05  EXCEPTION FOR GOVERNMENTAL BODIES.
   The United States, the Commonwealth and all of their instrumentalities,
agencies or political subdivisions shall be exempt from payment of the tax
imposed by this chapter. However, the exemption of such governmental bodies
shall not relieve any other party to a transaction from liability for the tax.

nominal actual consideration, of property passed by testate or intestate
succession and held by covenants, provided, however, that if any party takes
shares greater in value than his or her undivided interest, tax is due on the
excess;

previously husband and wife who have since been divorced, provided that the
property or interest therein subject to such transfer was acquired by the
husband and wife or by the husband or wife prior to the granting of the final
decree in divorce; between parent and child or the spouse of such child;
between brother or sister or the spouse of a brother or sister and brother or

document by which title is acquired by a grantee or statement of value fails to
set forth that the property was acquired by the grantee from, or for the
benefit of, his or her principal, there is a rebuttable presumption that the
property is the property of the grantee in his or her individual capacity if
the grantee claims an exemption from taxation under this subsection;

facilitate the sale, conveyance, assignment or transfer of any real property,
by deed, agreement of sale, or otherwise, or for any person not already an
owner thereof, to acquire an interest in any such real estate, without first
securing a Certificate of Compliance issued by the City's sewer enforcement
officer, or his or her designee, with respect to the real property being
transferred, certifying compliance with all rules and regulations of the City
relative to the tapping into, discharging into, or connection with, the City's
public sanitary sewer system.
   (b)   Application for Certificate. An application for a certificate of
compliance shall be made to the City's sewage enforcement officer, or his or
her designee, on forms furnished by the City and shall be accompanied by a fee

enforcement officer, or his or her designee, shall, within ten (10) calendar
days, physically inspect the real property proposed to be transferred, and
shall determine its compliance with the City's rules and regulations relative
to its connection to the public sanitary sewer system: If the officer, as
aforementioned, determines compliance, he or she shall immediately issue a
Certificate of Compliance authorizing the transfer of the real estate. If the
officer determines there is non-compliance, he or she shall separately set
forth each violation and the required remedial action in order for a
Certificate of Compliance to be issued and shall promptly forward a copy of his
or her findings to all parties in interest. Upon notification of the remedial
action having been completed, the officer shall, within two (2) working days,
re-inspect the real estate to be transferred and, if in compliance, shall
immediately issue a Certificate of Compliance. If upon re-inspection the
officer determines that all necessary remedial action has not occurred, he or
she shall identify that remedial action still required and shall promptly
forward a copy of his or her findings to all parties in interest. No
Certificate of Compliance shall be issued until all remedial action shall have
been completed in a manner satisfactory to the sewer enforcement officer.
   (d)   Appeal. Any person or persons aggrieved by a decision of the sewage
enforcement officer may, within thirty (30) days, of being so aggrieved, file a
written appeal from said decision to the Board of Code Appeals of the City of
Sharon. Said appeal shall be in writing and shall set forth, in reasonable
detail, the proportionate decision by the sewage enforcement officer to which
exception is taken; the reason for the exception being taken; and the proposed
remedy. Upon receipt of an appeal the Code Board of Appeals shall schedule a
hearing within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt and shall conduct a hearing
in the manner otherwise prescribed by ordinances for hearings by said body.
   (e)   Validity.  All Certificates of Compliance shall be valid for a period
of three (3) years following their date of issuance and shall be deemed
assigned to all purchasers of the real estate for which they were originally
issued during that period of time.

(Ord. 20-86. Passed 12-29-86.)
1041.06  SEWAGE STRENGTH DETERMINATION FOR SURCHARGE.
   The strength of sewage discharged into the public sewer shall be determined
in one of the following ways at the option of the City:
   (a)   Sampling of Average Characteristics. Samples of the sewage discharge
shall be taken at a sampling point provided by the property owner and
acceptable to the City in accordance with this chapter and other regulations
and rules promulgated by the City. Sufficient samplings shall be made to enable
the determination of a reasonable average value for the quality and
characteristics of the sewage discharge satisfactory to the City. Samplings and
laboratory evaluation shall be made by the City in accordance with the current
edition of "Standard Methods for Examination of Water and Waste Water," as
published by the American Public Health Association, or regulations of the
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources. The average characteristics
thus determined shall be used as the basis for extraordinary waste surcharge
calculations. The City shall review such average characteristics as often as it
deems necessary to maintain an average characteristic with reasonable accuracy.
   (b)   Sampling of Individual Characteristics. When, in the opinion of the
City Engineer, a reasonable average sewage characteristic cannot be obtained as
outlined in subsection (a) hereof, the installation of a device capable of
automatic sampling may be required. Such device shall be of a type acceptable
to the City, shall be installed in accordance with plans and specifications
having prior City approval, shall be installed in a control manhole as required
by ordinances of the City, and shall be installed, maintained and repaired by
the owner at his or her expense. Sampling by means of this instrument shall be
at a time and in a manner directed by the City Engineer in order to secure a
reasonable and representative sample satisfactory to the City. The results of
this sampling shall be used in the computation of surcharges.
(Ord. 20-86. Passed 12-29-86.)
1041.07  PRIVATE WATER SUPPLIES; METERS.
   (a)   Meters Required. If any person discharges into the City sewerage
system and obtains part or all of the water used by him or her from a source
other than the Shenango Valley Water Company, then such water supply or source
shall be metered in a manner acceptable to the City. If the water from such
water supply is not measured by a water meter or is measured by a water meter
not acceptable to the City, then the City shall install a suitable meter or
have such a meter installed so as to properly measure all water consumption on
the premises. The meter size shall be determined by the City according to
standard engineering procedures for sizing water meters.
   (b)   Installation Costs. All costs for water meter installation, including
the cost of the meter, shall be paid by the City. The property owner shall be
required to provide access for meter placement and for subsequent readings. The
property owner shall also be required to pay a deposit for the meter in
accordance with the meter size as shown in subsection (d) hereof. The deposit
shall be refunded in full by the City upon presentation of the receipt for the
deposit payment, together with return of the meter to the City in acceptable
working condition. The City may withhold from any meter deposit any sums
necessary to cover unpaid sewer rentals or charges, as of the date of removal
of the meter, or to pay for any damage done to the meter while in the
possession of the property owner.
   (c)   Notice of Intention to Remove Meter. Any property owner having a City
installed meter on his or her premises, who sells or vacates the premises, or
for any other reason desires to have the meter removed and a refund of his or
her deposit made to him or her, shall give the City written notice of his or
her intention to sell or vacate the premises or to install or have installed a
meter supplied by the Shenango Valley Water Company if such company makes water
available to the premises. This notice shall be given to the City at least
twenty-four hours in advance of the time for removal of the meter in order that
the City may have a final reading made, establish a final billing for the
premises and make arrangements to have the meter removed.
   (d)   Deposits.   Meter deposits required in accordance with this section
shall be as follows:
 
Standard Meter Size  Deposit Compound Meter Size (in.) Deposit
(in.)
5/8   $60.00 3 450.00
3/4   75.00  4 600.00
1     100.00 6 750.00

(Ord. 20-86. Passed 12-29-86.)
1041.08  RENTALS FOR VACANT PREMISES; DISCONNECTIONS AND RECONNECTIONS.
   The procedure described herein shall apply to all premises utilizing the
City sewerage system, either directly or indirectly, to all premises connected
thereto and to all premises paying sewer rental to the City either on a flat-
rate basis or a water-consumption basis. When any such premises becomes vacant,
the sewer rental shall continue so long as the building sewer or sewer lateral
is connected to, the City public sewer. Owners of premises paying on a flat-
rate basis shall continue to pay at the applicable flat rate. Owners of
premises paying sewer rental on a water-consumption basis shall continue to pay
the base quarterly charge, plus a flow charge if water is used. If no water is
used, the sewer rental shall be continued predicated upon one EDU per quarter.
If the water meter is removed, the sewer rental shall be continued predicated
upon an amount equal to the average of the last three months of actual usage.
If the premises are disconnected from the sewer by proper disconnection of the
sewer lateral, the rental charge shall be discontinued at the beginning of the
next billing period. If at a later date it is desired to reconnect such
premises to the public sewer, standard connection procedures as detailed in
this chapter for new sewer connections shall be followed, including the
obtaining of A permit and the payment of a connection fee. The connection fee
charged for reconnection shall be based on the new type of occupancy intended.
Any lateral to be reconnected shall be subject to inspection and/or test before
reconnection as may be required by the City at its discretion to determine the
acceptability of the existing lateral in compliance with this chapter and other
ordinances of the City.
(Ord. 20-86. Passed 12-29-86.)
1041.09  REDUCTION IN SEWER CHARGES FOR WATER EXCLUDED FROM SEWERS
   (a)   Any user of the City sewerage system paying sewer rentals or charges
on the basis of metered water, who discharges less than his or her total water
usage into the sewerage system, may make written application to the City for a
reduction in his or her sewer rental because of water excluded from the City
sewerage system. Such application shall be in a form acceptable to the City and
shall contain information as the City may reasonably require, including
supporting data fully describing other sources of water, as well as the manner
of disposition of water alleged to be excluded from the City sewerage system.
If it is established to the satisfaction of the City Engineer that a portion of
the water utilized by the premises does not and cannot enter the City sewerage
system, then the City may require or permit the installation of additional
meters at the owner's or interested party's expense, in such a manner as to
measure either the quantity of water actually excluded from the City sewerage
system or the actual quantity of water discharged thereto.. Meters shall be of
a type suitable for the service they are to perform and shall meet with the
approval of the City Engineer. In addition, they shall be installed and
maintained in a manner satisfactory to the City. The City Engineer may
establish reasonable regulations to ensure the integrity of the measuring
devices to be accessible to him or her at any reasonable hour for inspection.
(Ord. 20-86. Passed 12-29-86.)
   (b)   Any residential user of the City sewerage system paying sewer rentals
or charges on the basis of metered water may have excluded therefrom, upon
proper application to the City, that amount of water used for purposes of
filling a residential swimming pool, provided that:
      (1)   Water discharged from the residential swimming pool is not, in any
manner, discharged into the City's sanitary sewerage system; and
      (2)   Prior to use of water for purposes of filling a pool, the user
advises the City of his or her intended use of water for the purposes stated
and, further, makes appropriate arrangements with representatives of the City
to monitor and verify the amount of water actually used for the purposes
intended. Upon verification by the City, the proper ,City officials are hereby
authorized to make appropriate refunds or credits with respect to the amount of
metered water consumed for purposes of filling and/or maintaining residential
swimming pools.
(Ord. 8-88. Passed 7-27-88.)
1041.10  COMPUTATION OF REDUCTION OF SEWER RENTALS.
   Persons complying with this chapter may be granted a reduction in their
sewer bilis. The amount of reduction shall be based on the volume of water
excluded from the City sewerage system. The rental rates shall then be based on
the net amount of the discharge to the City sewerage system, plus any
surcharges or other rental modifications, but in no event shall any user pay
less than the minimum rate for his or her classification as set forth in this
chapter.
(Ord. 20-86. Passed 12-29-86.)
1041.11  METER REPAIR.
   If the City has any reason to believe that any meter or metering device
installed pursuant to Section
1041.09 is inaccurate or in need of repair, then the owner, at his or her own
expense, shall have it tested and/or repaired and restored to accuracy to the
satisfaction of the City. Such testing or restoration to accuracy shall be
completed within sixty days of notice from the City Engineer. A reasonable
interim sewer rental rate may be established by the City for that period during
which suitable metering is not provided by the owner, or the owner may be
required to establish suitable interim metering subject to City approval.
(Ord. 20-86. Passed 12-29-86.)
1041.12  ALTERNATIVE METHODS OF MEASUREMENT OF DIVERTED WATER.
   If the City finds that it is not practical to measure either the actual
sewage or the flow of diverted water, it may, at its discretion, approve some
other manner of computing or estimating the amount of water diverted from the
City sewerage system.
(Ord. 20-86. Passed 12-29-86.)
1041.13  BILLING; DEFAULT OF PAYMENT.

paid within thirty days of rendering, said bill shall have added thereto a
penalty in the amount of five percent of its face.  If said bill and penalty
are not paid in full within sixty days of the original rendering, then there
shall be added to the amount then owing interest at the rate of one and one-
half percent per month for each month or portion thereof until paid in full.
      (2)   If any person refuses or neglects to pay said sewer rentals and
charges for a period in excess of sixty days after rendering, the City may lien
and/or collect the same in any manner authorized by law and/or may discontinue
sewer service to any premises owned or occupied by said delinquent.  In
addition thereto, the City shall add to any balance owing all costs and fees,
including reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred by the City in its collection
effort.
(Ord. 8-00. Passed 5-25-00.)
   (b)   If the owner or occupant of the premises serviced by the Shenango
Valley Water Company neglects or fails to pay any bill rendered to him or her
for sewer rental or charge for use of the City sewerage system, the Shenango
Valley Water Company is hereby directed, upon request of the City, to shut off
the supply of water to such premises until such overdue rentals, rates and
charges, together with any penalties and interest thereon and the costs of

1460.01   STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Legislature of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has, by the passage of
the Pennsylvania Flood Plain Management Act of 1978, delegated the
responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management
regulations to promote public health, safety, and the general welfare of its
citizenry. Therefore, the Council of the City of Sharon hereby order as
follows.
(Ord. 02-14.  Passed 6-19-14.)
GENERAL PROVISIONS
1460.02   INTENT.
   The intent of this chapter is to:
   (a)   Promote the general health, welfare, and safety of the community.
   (b)   Encourage the utilization of appropriate construction practices in
order to prevent or minimize flood damage in the future.
   (c)   Minimize danger to public health by protecting water supply and
natural drainage.
   (d)   Reduce financial burdens imposed on the community, its governmental
units, and its residents, by preventing excessive development in areas subject
to flooding.
   (e)   Comply with Federal and State floodplain management requirements.
(Ord. 02-14.  Passed 6-19-14.)
1460.03   APPLICABILITY.
   (a)   It shall be unlawful for any person, partnership, business or
corporation to undertake, or cause to be undertaken, any construction or
development anywhere within the City of Sharon unless a permit has been
obtained from the Floodplain Administrator.
   (b)   A permit shall not be required for minor repairs to existing buildings
or structures.
(Ord. 02-14.  Passed 6-19-14.)
1460.04   ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   This chapter supersedes any other conflicting provisions which may be in
effect in identified floodplain areas. However, any other ordinance provisions
shall remain in full force and effect to the extent that those provisions are
more restrictive. If there is any conflict between any of the provisions of
this chapter, the more restrictive shall apply.
(Ord. 02-14.  Passed 6-19-14.)
1460.05   SEVERABILITY.
   If any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause, or phrase of this
chapter shall be declared invalid for any reason whatsoever, such a decision
shall not affect the remaining portions of the chapter, which shall remain in
full force and effect, and for this purpose the provisions of this chapter are
hereby declared to be severable.
(Ord. 02-14.  Passed 6-19-14.)
1460.06   WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   (a)   The degree of flood protection sought by the provisions of this
chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on
accepted engineering methods of study. Larger floods may occur or flood heights
may be increased by man-made or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge
openings restricted by debris. This chapter does not imply that areas outside
any identified floodplain areas, or that land uses permitted within such areas
will be free from flooding or flood damages.
   (b)   This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the City of
Sharon or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result
from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder.
(Ord. 02-14.  Passed 6-19-14.)
ADMINISTRATION
1460.07   DESIGNATION OF FLOODPLAIN ADMINISTRATOR.

regulations to qualified technical personnel, plan examiners, inspectors, and
other employees; or enter into a written agreement or written contract with
another agency or private sector entity to administer specific provisions of
these regulations. Administration of any part of these regulations by another
entity shall not relieve the community of its responsibilities pursuant to the
participation requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program as set forth
in the Code of Federal Regulations at 44 C.F.R. Section 59.22.
   (b)   In the absence of a designated Floodplain Administrator, the
Floodplain Administrator duties are to be fulfilled by the City Manager.

IDENTIFICATION OF FLOODPLAIN AREAS
1460.18   IDENTIFICATION.
   (a)   The identified floodplain area shall be: Any areas of City of Sharon,
classified as special flood hazard areas (SFHAs) in the flood insurance study
(FIS) and the accompanying flood insurance rate maps (FIRMs) dated [effective
map date] and issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or the
most recent revision thereof, including all digital data developed as part of
the flood insurance study and,
   (b)   The above referenced FIS and FIRMs, and any subsequent revisions and
amendments are hereby adopted by City of Sharon and declared to be a part of
this chapter.
(Ord. 02-14.  Passed 6-19-14.)
1460.19   DESCRIPTION AND SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS OF IDENTIFIED FLOODPLAIN AREAS.
   The identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific
areas:
   (a)   The floodway area shall be those areas identified in the FIS and the
FIRM as floodway and which represent the channel of a watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood
without increasing the water surface elevation by more than one foot at any
point. This term shall also include floodway areas which have been identified
in other available studies or sources of information for those special flood
hazard areas where no floodway has been identified in the FIS and FIRM.
      (1)   Within any floodway area, no encroachments, including fill, new
construction, substantial improvements, or other development shall be permitted
unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed
encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the
community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
      (2)   Within any floodway area, no new construction or development shall
be allowed, unless the appropriate permit is obtained from the Department of
Environmental Protection Regional Office.
   (b)   The AE Area/District shall be those areas identified as an AE Zone on
the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base flood elevations
have been provided.
      (1)   The AE Area adjacent to the floodway shall be those areas
identified as an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for
which base flood elevations have been provided and a floodway has been
delineated.
      (2)   AE Area without floodway shall be those areas identified as an AE
zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base flood
elevations have been provided but no floodway has been determined.
         A.   No permit shall be granted for any construction, development,
use, or activity within any AE Area/District without floodway unless it is
demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development would not,
together with all other existing and anticipated development, increase the BFE
more than one foot at any point.
         B.   No new construction or development shall be located within the
area measured fifty feet landward from the top-of-bank of any watercourse,
unless the appropriate permit is obtained from the Department of Environmental
Protection Regional Office.
   (c)   (1)   The A Area/District shall be those areas identified as an A Zone
on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no base flood
elevations have been provided. For these areas, elevation and floodway
information from other Federal, State, or other acceptable sources shall be
used when available. Where other acceptable information is not available, the
base flood elevation shall be determined by using the elevation of a point on
the boundary of the identified floodplain area which is nearest the
construction site.
      (2)   In lieu of the above, the municipality may require the applicant to
determine the elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering techniques.
Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by professional
engineers or others of demonstrated qualifications, who shall certify that the
technical methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts.
Studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail
to allow a thorough technical review by the municipality.
   (d)   The AO and AH Area/ District shall be those areas identified as Zones

   (b)   No application for a special permit shall be approved unless it can be
determined that the structure or activity will be located, constructed and
maintained in a manner which will:
      (1)   Fully protect the health and safety of the general public and any
occupants of the structure. At a minimum, all new structures shall be designed,
located, and constructed so that:
         A.   The structure will survive inundation by waters of the base flood
without any lateral movement or damage to either the structure itself, or to
any of its equipment or contents below the BFE.
         B.   The lowest floor (including basement) will be elevated to at
least one and one-half feet above base flood elevation.
         C.   The occupants of the structure can remain inside for an
indefinite period of time and be safely evacuated at any time during the base
flood.
      (2)   Prevent any significant possibility of pollution, increased flood
levels or flows, or debris endangering life and property.
All hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by professional
engineers or others of demonstrated qualifications, who shall certify that the
technical methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts.
Studies, analyses, computations, etc. shall be submitted in sufficient detail
to allow a thorough technical review by the City of Sharon and the Department
of Community and Economic Development.

an exceptional hardship to a prospective builder, developer or landowner, the
City of Sharon may, upon request, grant relief from the strict application of
the requirements.
(Ord. 02-14.  Passed 6-19-14.)
1460.36   VARIANCE PROCEDURES AND CONDITIONS.
   (a)   Requests for variances shall be considered by the City of Sharon in
accordance with the following procedures:
      (1)   No variance shall be granted for any construction, development,
use, or activity within any floodway area/district that would cause any
increase in the BFE.

elevation requirement involved, no variance shall be granted for any of the
other requirements pertaining specifically to development regulated by special
permit (or prohibited activities) (Sections
1460.26 through
1460.32) or to development which may endanger human life (Section
1460.25).
      (4)   If granted, a variance shall involve only the least modification
necessary to provide relief.
      (5)   In granting any variance, the City of Sharon shall attach whatever
reasonable conditions and safeguards it considers necessary in order to protect
the public health, safety, and welfare, and to achieve the objectives of this
chapter.
      (6)   Whenever a variance is granted, the City of Sharon shall notify the
applicant in writing that:
         A.   The granting of the variance may result in increased premium
rates for flood insurance.
         B.   Such variances may increase the risks to life and property.
      (7)   In reviewing any request for a variance, the City of Sharon shall
consider, at a minimum, the following:
         A.   That there is good and sufficient cause.
         B.   That failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional
hardship to the applicant.

Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and
walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or
foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds

provided, however, that the subdivision by lease of land for agricultural
purposes into parcels of more than ten acres, not involving any new street or
easement of access or any residential dwelling, shall be exempted.
   (jj)   “Substantial damage” means damage from any cause sustained by a

condition would equal or exceed fifty percent or more of the market value of
the structure before the damage occurred.
   (kk)   “Substantial improvement” means any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, of which the cost equals or
exceeds fifty percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have
incurred "substantial damage" regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include any project for improvement of a structure
to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety
code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement
official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions.
   (ll)   “Uniform Construction Code (UCC)” is the statewide building code
adopted by The Pennsylvania General Assembly in 1999 applicable to new
construction in all municipalities whether administered by the municipality, a
third party or the Department of Labor and Industry, applicable to residential
and commercial buildings. The Code adopted The International Residential Code
(IRC) and the International Building Code (IBC), by reference, as the
construction standard applicable with the State floodplain construction. For
coordination purposes, references to the above are made specifically to various
sections of the IRC and the IBC.
   (mm)   “Variance” means a grant of relief by a community from the terms of a
floodplain management regulation.
   (nn)   “Violation” means the failure of a structure or other development to

1476.01  STATEMENT OF FINDINGS.
   The City of Sharon finds that:
   (a)   Inadequate management of accelerated and/or redirected runoff of
stormwater from land development and/or alteration throughout the City may
increase flood flows and velocities, contribute to erosion and sedimentation,
overtax the carrying capacity of streams and storm sewers, greatly increase the
cost of public facilities to carry and control stormwater, undermine flood
plain management, reduce groundwater recharge and threaten public health and
safety.
   (b)   A comprehensive program of stormwater management, including reasonable
regulation of development and other activities causing accelerated or
redirected runoff, is fundamental to the public health, safety and welfare and
the protection of the people of the City of Sharon, their resources and the
environment.
(Ord. 14-91. Passed 8-28-91.)
1476.02  PURPOSES; APPLICATION OF CHAPTER; DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   (a)   Purposes. These regulations are adopted and implemented to achieve the
following general purposes and objectives:
      (1)   To control accelerated and/or redirected runoff and erosion and
sedimentation problems at their source by regulating activities which cause
such problems.
      (2)   To utilize and preserve the desirable existing natural drainage
systems and to preserve the flood-carrying capacity of streams.
      (3)   To encourage natural infiltration of rainfall to preserve
groundwater supplies and stream flows.
      (4)   To provide for adequate maintenance of all permanent stormwater
management structures in the Municipality.
   (b)   Applicability. The following activities are included within the scope
of this chapter:
      (1)   Subdivision;
      (2)   Land development;
      (3)   Earthmoving involving one or more acres;
      (4)   Agricultural operations;
      (5)   Construction of new or additional impervious or semi-pervious
surfaces (driveways, parking lots, etc.);
      (6)   Forest management operations;
      (7)   Nursery operations;
      (8)   Diversion of piping of any natural or man-made stream channel;
      (9)   Installation of stormwater systems or appurtenances;
      (10)   Mining operations; and
      (11)   Other activities which produce the effect of altering existing
runoff; rates and/or patterns so as to materially affect downstream persons or
properties.
   (c)   Liability Disclaimer.
      (1)   Neither the granting of any approval under the stormwater
management provisions of this chapter, nor compliance with the provisions of
this chapter, or with any condition imposed by a Municipal official hereunder,
shall relieve any person from any responsibility for damage to persons or
property resulting therefrom, or as otherwise imposed by law, nor impose any
liability upon the Municipality for damages to persons or property.
      (2)   The granting of a permit which includes any stormwater management
facilities shall not constitute a representation, guarantee or warranty of any
kind by the Municipality, or by an official or employee thereof, of the
practicability or safety of any structure, use or other plan proposed, and
shall create no liability upon or cause of action against such public body,
official or employee for any damage that may result pursuant thereto.
(Ord. 14-91. Passed 8-28-91.)
1476.03  PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   (a)   General Standards. The following provisions shall be considered the
overriding performance standards against which all proposed stormwater control
measures shall be evaluated and shall apply throughout the City of Sharon:
      (1)   Any landowner and any person engaged in alteration or development
of land which may affect stormwater runoff characteristics shall implement such
measures as are reasonably necessary to prevent injury to health, safety or
other property. Such measures shall include such actions as are required:
         A.   To assure that the maximum rate of stormwater runoff is no
greater after development than prior to development activities; or
         B.   To manage the quantity, velocity and direction of resulting
stormwater runoff in a manner which otherwise adequately protects health and
property from possible injury.
      (2)   The stormwater management plan for the site must consider all the
stormwater runoff flowing over the site.
      (3)   No discharge of toxic materials shall be permitted into any
stormwater management system.
   (b)   Specific Standards.
      (1)   Application; conflict of laws. The stormwater performance standards
contained in this section are intended to be applied in all areas of the City
of Sharon where no approved Act 167 Watershed Storm Water Management Plan is in
effect and to implement the standards and criteria for areas for which such Act
167 Storm Water Management Plans have been adopted and approved in accordance
with the Pennsylvania Storm Water Management Act. If there is any discrepancy
between provisions of this section and the standards and criteria of such
approved plan, or if the watershed plan is subsequently amended, then the
standards/criteria of the current watershed plan shall govern.
      (2)   Storm frequencies. Stormwater management facilities on all
development sites shall control the peak stormwater discharge for the two, ten,
twenty-five and 100-year storm frequencies. The SCS twenty-four hour, Type II
Rainfall Distribution shall be used for analyzing stormwater runoff for both
pre- and post-development conditions. The twenty-four hour total rainfall for
these storm frequencies in the watershed are:
 
Storm Frequency Rainfall Depth (in.)
2-year          2.28
10-year         3.84
25-year         4.80
100-year        6.24
 
   (For additional information or data on other storm return periods, consult
the Storm Intensity - Duration - Frequency Curves, as published by the
Pennsylvania Department of Transportation Storm Intensity - Duration -
Frequency Charts, May 1986 edition or its successor publication or standard.)
      (3)   Calculation methods.
         A.   Development sites. For the purpose of computing peak flow rates
and runoff hydrographs from development sites, calculations shall be performed
using the SCS Technical Release (TR) 55  Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds.
         B.   Stormwater collection/conveyance facilities. For the purpose of
designing storm sewers, open swales and other stormwater runoff collection and
conveyance facilities, the rational method shall be applied. Rainfall
intensities for design should be obtained from the Pennsylvania Department of
Transportation rainfall charts.
         C.   Predevelopment conditions. Predevelopment conditions shall be
assumed to be those which exist on any site prior to the start of land
alteration and/or development. Hydrologic conditions for all areas with
pervious cover (i.e. fields, woods, lawn areas, pastures, cropland, etc.) shall
be assumed to be in "good" condition and the lowest recommended SCS runoff
curve number (CN) shall be applied for all pervious land uses within the
respective range for each land use and hydrologic soil group
      (4)   Release rate percentage.
         A.   Definition. The release rate percentage defines the percentage of
the pre-development peak rate of runoff that can be discharged from an outfall
on the site development. It applies uniformly to all land development or
alterations within a subarea. In the absence of an approved Act 167 Stormwater
Management Plan a uniform release rate percentage of 100 shall be applied. In
areas for which an approved Act 167 Plan is in effect, the appropriate release
rate percentage defined in the plan shall be applied.
         B.   Procedure for use.
            1.   Determine the appropriate release rate percentage.
            2.   Compute the pre- and post-development runoff hydrographs for
each stormwater outfall on the development site using an acceptable calculation
method for the two, ten, twenty-five and 100-year storms. Apply no on-site
detention for stormwater management but include any techniques to minimize
impervious surfaces and/or increase the time of concentration for stormwater
runoff flowing from the development site. If the post-development peak runoff
rate and the runoff volume are less than equal to the predevelopment peak
runoff rate and volume, then additional stormwater control shall not be
required at that outfall. If the post-development peak runoff rate and volume
are greater than the predevelopment peak runoff rate and volume, then
stormwater detention will be required and the capacity of the detention
facility must be calculated in the manner prescribed below.
         3.   Multiply the subarea release rate percentage by the
predevelopment rate of runoff from the development site to determine the
maximum allowable release rate from any detention facility for the four
prescribed storm events.
(Ord. 14-91. Passed 8-28-91.)
1476.04  DESIGN CRITERIA FOR STORMWATER MANAGEMENT CONTROLS.
   (a)   Generally.
      (1)   Applicants may select runoff control techniques, or a combination
of techniques, which are most suitable to control stormwater runoff from the
development site. All controls are subject to the approval of the Municipal
Engineer. The Municipal Engineer may request specific information on design
and/or operating features of the proposed stormwater controls in order to
determine their suitability and adequacy in terms of the standards of this
chapter.
      (2)   The applicant should consider the effect of the proposed stormwater
management techniques on any special soil conditions or geological hazards
which may exist on the development site. In the event such conditions are
identified on the site, the Municipal Engineer may require in depth studies by
a competent geotechnical engineer. Not all stormwater control methods may be
advisable or allowable at a particular development site.
      (3)   The stormwater management practices to be used in developing a
stormwater management plan for a particular site shall be selected according to
the following order of preference:
         A.   Infiltration of runoff on-site;
         B.   Flow attenuation by use of open vegetated swales and natural
depressions; and
         C.   Stormwater detention/retention structures.
      (4)   Infiltration practices shall be used to the extent practicable to
reduce volume increases and promote groundwater recharge. A combination of
successive practices may be used to achieve the applicable minimum control
requirements. Justification shall be provided by the applicant for rejecting
each of the preferred practices based on actual site conditions.
   (b)   Infiltration Systems.
      (1)   Infiltration systems shall be sized and designed based upon local
soil and groundwater conditions.
      (2)   Infiltration systems greater than three feet deep shall be located
at least ten feet from basement walls.
      (3)   Infiltration systems designed to handle runoff from commercial or
industrial parking areas shall be located a minimum of 100 feet from any water
supply well.
      (4)   Infiltration systems may not receive runoff until the entire
drainage area to the system has received final stabilization.
      (5)   The stormwater infiltration facility design shall provide an
overflow system with measures to provide a non-erosive velocity of flow along
its length and at the outfall.
   (c)   Stormwater Detention Facilities.
      (1)   If detention facilities are utilized for the development site, the
facility(ies) shall be designed such that post-development peak runoff rates
from the developed site are controlled to those rates defined by the subarea
release percentage for the two, ten, twenty-five and 100-year storm
frequencies.
      (2)   All detention facilities shall be equipped with outlet structures
to provide discharge control for the four designated storm frequencies.
Provisions shall also be made to safety pass the postdevelopment 100-year storm
runoff without damaging (i.e. impairing) the continued function of the
facilities.
      (3)   Shared-storage facilities, which provide detention of runoff for
more than one development site within a single subarea, may be considered and
are encouraged. Such facilities shall meet the criteria contained in this
section. In addition, runoff from the development sites involved shall be
conveyed to the facility in a manner that avoids adverse impacts (such as
flooding or erosion) to channels and properties located between the development
site and the shared-storage facilities.
      (4)   'Where detention facilities will be utilized, multiple use
facilities, such as wetlands, lakes, ballfields or similar recreational/open
spaces uses, are encouraged wherever feasible, subject to the approval of the
Municipality.
      (5)   Other considerations which should be incorporated into design of
the detention facilities include:
         A.   Inflow and outflow structures shall be designed and installed to
prevent erosion, and bottoms of impoundment-type structures should be protected
from soil erosion.
         B.   Standpipes shall be constructed of reinforced concrete or castin-
place, precast or block and shall be provided with debris grates.
         C.   Control and removal of debris both in the storage structure and
in all inlet or outlet devices shall be a design consideration.
         D.   Inflow and outflow structures, pumping stations, and other
structures shall be designed and protected to minimize safety hazards.
         E.   An emergency spillway or overflow shall be provided that is
capable of passing the peak flow generated by a 100-year, twenty-four hour
storm following construction.
         F.   The water depth at the perimeter of a storage pond should be
limited to that which is safe for children. This is especially necessary if
bank slopes are steep or if ponds are full and recirculating in dry periods
Restriction of access (fence, walls, etc.) may be necessary depending on the
location of the facility. Unless otherwise approved, the maximum planned water
depth shall not exceed four feet.
         G.   The facility shall be designed with a minimum freeboard of one
foot between the peak emergency spillway design flow elevation and the top of
the embankment.
         H.   Side slope of storage ponds shall not exceed a ratio of two to
one horizontal to vertical dimension.
         I.   Landscaping shall be provided for the facility which harmonizes
with the surrounding area.
         J.   The facility shall be located to facilitate maintenance,
considering the frequency and type of equipment that will be required.
         K.   All detention facilities shall be provided with an access road
for maintenance purposes. Such roads shall be a minimum of ten feet wide and
have a maximum grade of fifteen percent.
   (d)   Criteria for Collection/Conveyance Facilities.
      (1)   All stormwater runoff collection or conveyance facilities, whether
storm sewers or other open or closed channels, shall be designed in accordance
with the following basic standards:
         A.   All collection/conveyance facilities shall be designed to convey
the runoff from what has been calculated to be a ten-year storm for this
vicinity as shown on the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation rainfall
charts. Where the flow from the ten-year storm exceeds twenty c.f.s., then from
that point downstream, all storm drainage systems and structures shall be
designed to handle the peak flow from a twenty-five year storm. Where a storm
drainage structure must handle the flow in a stream within a Federally designed
floodplain, the structure shall be designed to handle the peak flow from a 100-
year storm. The developer and the Planning Commission should keep in mind that
more severe storms occur at less frequent intervals and, where feasible, so
design subdivisions that especially heavy runoff, exceeding the capacity of the
required channels or storm sewers, can be handled with the least possible
damage to improvements and structures.
         B.   The rational method shall ordinarily be used in computing runoff
using the formula:
   Q = C * I * A
Wherein
   Q = water reaching the channel, culvert, bridge or storm sewer in cubic feet
per second (c.f.s.)
   I = rainfall rate in inches per hour
   A = drainage area in acres
   C = coefficient of runoff as follows:
      areas primarily paved or in building (such as shopping centers) = 0.90
      primarily residential areas with lots smaller than 7,500 square feet of
apartment areas = 0.60
      primarily residential areas with lots 7,500 square feet to 1/2 acre =
0.50
      primarily residential areas with lots 20,000 square feet or over = 0.40
      cemeteries, park land and other permanent areas = 0.35
   In computing "I", the concentration time for each collection area shall be
computed and the rainfall per hour determined by use of the Storm Intensity -
Duration - Frequency Curves, as published by the Pennsylvania Department of
Transportation Storm Intensity - Duration - Frequency Charts, May 1986 edition,
or its successor publication or standard.
         C.   Required design of streets and grading in relation to storm
drainage shall be such that runoff from roofs, driveways and other impervious
surfaces shall be towards the street or other approved storm drainage system
and will be collected in the storm sewers or street drainage system.
         D.   All sites shall be graded to provide drainage away from and
around the structure ln order to prevent any potential flooding damage.
         E.   Lots located on the high side of streets shall extend roof and
french drains to the curb line storm sewer (if applicable). Low side lots shall
extend roof and french drains to a stormwater collection/conveyance/control
system or natural watercourse ln accordance with the approved stormwater
management plan for the development site.
         F.   Storm sewers shall be required to be installed along both sides
of the streets in all subdivisions.
         G.   Open channel drainage between or across lots carrying stormwater
from public rights-of-way or storm sewers shall not be permitted. Such drainage
shall be contained in approved storm sewers. Open channel drainage shall be
permitted in natural streams or stream beds provided adequate provisions for
erosion control are made where necessary.
         H.   Subdivision and development of any area increases and
concentrates the runoff of stormwater from the area. Subdividers are warned
that such increase may cause flood or erosion damage to properties lying
downstream. Downstream disposal of stormwater shall be directly into an
existing storm sewer system or natural watercourse of adequate capacity,
located on the property of the developer. Stormwater shall not be discharged
onto private property, unless the developer obtains drainage easement(s) as
needed from downstream property owner(s), and installs a stormwater conveyance
system to carry the stormwater from the developer's property across the private
property to a natural watercourse or storm sewer system.
         I.   Collection/conveyance facilities should not be installed parallel
and close to the top or bottom of a major embankment to avoid the possibility
of failing or causing the embankment to fail.
         J.   Where drainage swales or open channels are used, they shall be
suitably lined to prevent erosion and designed to avoid excessive velocities.
      (2)   Wherever storm sewers are proposed to be utilized, they shall
comply with the following criteria:
         A.   The storm sewer shall be located according to specifications of
the City Engineer.
         B.   The design of storm sewer layout, including the handling of
abrupt changes in direction, shall be as approved by the City Engineer.
         C.   Where practical, storm sewers should be designed to traverse
under seeded and planted areas. If constructed within ten feet of road paving,
walks or other surfaced areas, drains shall have a narrow trench and maximum
compaction of backfill to prevent settlement of the superimposed surface or
development.
         D.   Storm sewers preferably should be installed after excavating and
filling in the area to be traversed is complete, unless the drain is installed
in the original ground with a minimum of three feet cover and/or adequate
protection during the fill construction.
         E.   Storm sewers shall be designed with cradle when traversing fill
areas of indeterminate stability, with anchors when gradient exceeds twenty
percent, and with encasement or special backfill requirements when traversing
under a paved area.
         F.   Storm sewers shall be designed to adequately handle the
anticipated stormwater flow and be economical to construct and maintain. The
minimum pipe size shall be twelve inches in diameter and the minimum grade
shall be 0.5 percent.
         G.   Drain pipe, trenching, bedding and backfilling requirements shall
conform to the requirements of the Municipality and/or applicable PENNDOT
Specifications, Form 408.
         H.   All corrugated metal pipe shall be polymer coated, and with
asbestos bonding and paved inverts where prone to erode. Pipe within a
Municipal right of way shall be reinforced concrete pipe with a minimum
diameter of fifteen inches.
         I.   Storm inlets and structures shall be designed to be adequate,
safe, self-cleaning and unobtrusive. Inlets shall be constructed of precast
concrete of a design approved by the City Engineer. A two-feet by two-feet
precast inlet shall be permitted where pipe diameter is fifteen inches or less
and where no more than two pipes are inserted into the inlet. The size and
design of larger inlets shall be as approved by the City Engineer.
         J.   Appropriate grates shall be designed for all catch basins,
stormwater inlets and other entrance appurtenances.
         K.   Manholes shall not be more than 300 feet apart where pipe sizes
of twenty-four inches or less are used and not more than 450 feet apart where
larger sizes are installed. When approved by the City Engineer, inlets may be
substituted for manholes.
         L.   Manholes shall be designed so that the top shall be at finished
grade and sloped to confirm to the slope of the finished grade. Top castings of
structures located in roads or parking areas shall be machined or installed to
preclude "rattling."
         M.   Where a proposed sewer connects with an existing sewer system,
the applicant shall demonstrate that sufficient capacity exists in the
downstream system to handle the additional flow.
         N.   Storm sewers outfalls shall be equipped with energy dissipation
devices to prevent erosion and conform with applicable requirements of the
Pennsylvania DER for stream encroachments (Chapter 105 of Pennsylvania DER
Rules and Regulations).
(Ord. 14-91. Passed 8-28-91.)
1476.05  EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION CONTROLS.
   (a)   An erosion/sedimentation plan shall be provided in accordance with the
Pennsylvania Erosion/Sedimentation Regulations (25 PA Code, Chapter 102) and
the standards and guidelines of the County Conservation District.
   (b)   Proposed erosion/sedimentation measures shall be submitted with the
stormwater management plan as part of the preliminary and final applications.
(Ord. 14-91. Passed 8-28-91.)
1476.06  MAINTENANCE OF STORMWATER MANAGEMENT CONTROLS.
   (a)   Maintenance Reponsibilities.
      (1)   The stormwater management plan for the site shall contain an
operation and maintenance plan prepared by the developer and approved by the
Municipal Engineer. The operations and maintenance plan shall outline required
routine maintenance actions and schedules necessary to insure proper operation
of the facility(ies).
      (2)   The stormwater management plan for the site shall establish
responsibilities for the continuing operation and maintenance of all proposed
stormwater control facilities, consistent with the following principles:
         A.   If a land development/alteration consists of structures or lots
which are to be separately owned and in which streets, sewers and other public
improvements are to be dedicated to the Municipality, stormwater control
facilities should also be dedicated to and maintained by the City.
         B.   If a development site is to be maintained in single ownership or
if sewers and other public improvements are to be privately owned and
maintained, then the ownership and maintenance of stormwater control facilities
should be the responsibility of the owner or private management entity.
      (3)   The governing body, upon recommendation of the City Engineer, shall
make final determination on the continuing maintenance responsibilities prior
to final approval of the stormwater management plan. The governing body
reserves the right to accept the ownership and operating responsibility for any
or all of the stormwater management controls.
   (b)   Maintenance Agreement for Privately Owned Facilities.
      (1)   Prior to final approval of the site's stormwater management plan,
the property owner shall sign and record a maintenance agreement covering all
stormwater control facilities which are to be privately owned. The agreement
shall stipulate that:
         A.   The owner shall maintain all facilities in accordance with the
approved maintenance schedule and shall keep all facilities in a safe and
attractive manner.
         B.   The owner shall convey to the Municipality easements and or
rights of way to assure access for periodic inspections by the Municipality and
maintenance if required.
         C.   The owner shall keep on file with Municipality the name, address
and telephone number of the person or company responsible for maintenance
activities; in the event of a change, new information will be submitted to the
City within ten days of the change.
         D.   If the owner fails to maintain the stormwater control facilities
following due notice by the City to correct the problem(s), the City may
perform the necessary maintenance work or corrective work and the owner shall
reimburse the City for all costs.
      (2)   Other items may be included in the agreement where determined
necessary to guarantee the satisfactory maintenance of all facilities. The
maintenance agreement shall be subject to the review and approval of the City
Solicitor and governing body.
   (c)   Municipal Stormwater Maintenance Fund.
      (1)   Persons installing stormwater storage facilities shall be required
to pay a specified amount to the Municipal Stormwater Maintenance Fund to help
defray costs of periodic inspections and maintenance expenses. The amount of
the deposit shall be determined as follows:
         A.   If the storage facility is to be privately owned and maintained,
the deposit shall cover the cost of periodic inspections performed by the
Municipality for a period of ten years, as estimated by the Municipal Engineer.
After that period of time, inspections will be performed at the expense of the
Municipality.
         B.   If the storage facility is to be owned and maintained by the
Municipality, the deposit shall cover the estimated costs for maintenance and
inspections for ten years.
         C.   The amount of the deposit to the Fund shall be converted to
present worth of the annual series values. The City Engineer shall determine
the present worth equivalents which shall be subject to the approval of the
governing body. (The required deposit would be equal to an amount that with
interest would generate sufficient income annually to pay the maintenance and
inspection costs over ten years. If the estimated maintenance/inspection cost
is five hundred dollars ($500.00) per year, instead of requiring a deposit of
five thousand dollars ($5,000) ($500.00 x 10 years), the deposit would be
reduced to three thousand, six hundred ninety dollars ($3,690) with the present
worth approach, assuming a six percent annual interest rate and that the funds
would be reduced to zero at the end of ten years.)
      (2)   If a storage facility is proposed that also serves as a recreation
facility (e.g. a ballfield, a lake), the City may reduce or waive the amount of
the Maintenance Fund deposit based upon the value of the land for public
recreation purposes.
      (3)   If at some future time a storage facility (whether publicly or
privately owned) is eliminated due to the installation of storm sewers or other
storage facility, the unused portion of the Maintenance Fund deposit will be
applied to the cost of abandoning the facility and connecting to the storm
sewer system or other facility. Any amount of the deposit remaining after the
costs of abandonment are paid will be returned to the depositor.
(Ord. 14-91. Passed 8-28-91.)
1476.07  STORMWATER PLAN REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   General Requirements. No final subdivision/land development plan shall

control facilities. The plan should show accurately site boundaries, locations
of watershed and/or subarea boundaries on the site (if applicable) and any
watercourses, floodplains or existing drainage facilities or structures located
on the site. The City reserves the right to require that the plan be prepared
by a registered professional engineer, surveyor or landscape architect.
      (2)   The City Engineer shall review and approve the proposed provisions
and remedial measures for stormwater management in accordance with the
standards and requirements of this chapter.
   (e)   Plans for Existing Developed Property.
      (1)   The City Engineer is authorized to determine that stormwater runoff
from an existing developed property is inadequately controlled and is causing
flooding, accelerated erosion or other damage to adjacent or downstream
property. Subsequent to the adoption of this chapter, the City Engineer shall
develop written standards and procedures for the identification and
determination of developed property(ies) that require remediation of stormwater
runoff problems.
      (2)   Upon making such determination, the owner of the existing developed
property shall be required to submit a stormwater management plan detailing the
remedial actions to be taken to eliminate the problem(s). Within 120 days of
receipt of notification of the City Engineer's determination that a landowner's
property is creating stormwater problems, the landowner shall submit to the
City a stormwater management plan. Such plans shall include information which
describes existing conditions and the proposed remedial measures. Information
provided shall include the type and location of the developed property, the

(Ord 14-91. Passed 8-28-91.)
1476.08  PLAN REVIEW PROCEDURES.
   (a)   Pre-application Phase.
      (1)   Before submitting the stormwater plan, applicants are urged to
consult with the City on the requirements for safety managing stormwater runoff
from the development site in a manner consistent with Municipal ordinances and
the applicable watershed stormwater management plan. These agencies may also be
helpful in providing necessary data for the stormwater management plan.
      (2)   Applicants are encouraged to submit a sketch plan with a narrative
description of the proposed stormwater management controls for general guidance
and discussion with the City.
      (3)   The pre-application phase is not mandatory; any review comments
provided by the City or other agencies are advisory only and do not constitute
any legally binding action on the part of the City.
   (b)   Stormwater Plan Reviews.
      (1)   Submission of plans. Stormwater plan applications shall be
submitted with the preliminary and final subdivision/land development
applications.
      (2)   City Engineer's review. The City Engineer shall approve or
disapprove the stormwater management plan based on the requirements of
Municipal ordinances, the standards and criteria of the watershed plan and good
engineering practice. The Engineer shall submit a written report, along with
supporting documentation, stating the reasons for approval or disapproval.
      (3)   Status of the City Engineer's determination. The approval/
disapproval of the site's stormwater management plan by the City Engineer shall
be considered final. The governing body shall not reverse the Engineer's
determination by approving or disapproving the site's stormwater management
plan or any specific control measure in contradiction to the Engineer's action.
The governing body may request modification or alternative approaches to the
stormwater management controls, provided these are agreed to by the City
Engineer and the applicant's engineer.
      (4)   Permits required from other governmental agencies. Where the
proposed development requires an obstruction permit from the Pennsylvania DER
or an erosion/sedimentation permit from the County Conservation District, then
final stormwater management plan approval shall be conditional upon receipt of
such permits. However, no building permit shall be issued, nor construction
started, until the permits are received and copies filed with the City.
(Ord. 14-91. Passed 8-28-91.)
1476.09  IMPLEMENTATION OF PLAN; TIME LIMITS.
   (a)   Upon final stormwater plan approval and receipt of all necessary
permits, the applicant may commence to install or implement the approved
stormwater management controls.
   (b)   If site development or building construction does not begin within two
years of the date of the final approval of the stormwater management plan, then
before doing so the applicant shall resubmit the stormwater management plan to
verify that no condition has changed within the watershed that would affect the
feasibility or effectiveness of the previously approved stormwater management
controls. Further, if for any reason development activities are suspended for
two years or more, then the same requirement for resubmission of the stormwater
management plan shall apply.
(Ord. 14-91. Passed 8-28-91.)
1476.10  PLAN MODIFICATIONS.
   (a)   If the request for a plan modification is initiated before
construction begins, the stormwater plan must be submitted and reviewed
according to the procedures contained in Section
1476.09.
   (b)   If the request for a plan modification is initiated after construction
is underway, the City Engineer shall have the authority to approve or
disapprove the modification based on field inspection, provided that the
requested changes in stormwater controls do not result in any modifications to
other approved Municipal land use/development requirements (e.g. building
setbacks, yards, etc.) and that the performance standards in Section
1476.03 are met. Notification of the Engineer's action shall be sent to the
governing body which may issue a stay of the plan modification within five 5
days and require the permittee to resubmit the plan modification for full
stormwater plan review in accordance with Section
1476.09.
(Ord. 14-91. Passed 8-28-91.)
1476.11  INSPECTIONS.
   (a)   The City Engineer or a designated representative shall inspect the
construction of the temporary and permanent stormwater management system for
the development site. The permittee shall notify the City Engineer forty-eight
hours in advance of the completion of the following key development phases:
      (1)   At the completion of preliminary site preparation, including
stripping of vegetation, stockpiling of topsoil and construction of temporary
stormwater management and erosion control facilities.
      (2)   At the completion of rough grading but prior to placing topsoil,
permanent drainage or other site development improvements and ground covers.
      (3)   During construction of the permanent stormwater facilities at such
times as specified by the City Engineer.
      (4)   At the completion of permanent stormwater management facilities,
including established ground covers and plantings.
      (5)   At the completion of final grading, vegetative control measures or
other site restoration work done in accordance with the approved plan and
permit.
   (b)   No work shall commence on any subsequent phase until the preceding one
has been inspected and approved. If there are deficiencies in any phase, the
City Engineer shall issue a written description of the required corrections and
stipulate the time by which they must be made.
   (c)   If, during construction, the contractor or permittee identifies any
site condition, such as subsurface soil conditions or alterations in surface or
subsurface drainage, which could affect the feasibility of the approved
stormwater facilities, he/she shall notify the Municipal Engineer within
twenty-four hours of the discovery of such condition and request a field
inspection. The Municipal Engineer shall determine if the condition requires a
stormwater plan modification.
   (d)   In cases where stormwater facilities are to be installed in areas of

1476.12  FINANCIAL GUARANTEES AND DEDICATION OF PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS.
   (a)   Guarantee of Completion Required. A completion guarantee in the form
of a bond, cash deposit, certified check or other negotiable securities
acceptable to the Municipality, shall be filed. The guarantee shall cover all
streets, sanitary sewers, stormwater management facilities, water systems, fire
hydrants, sidewalks and other required improvements; it shall be in the amount
and form prescribed by the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code (Section
509).
   (b)   Release of Completion Guarantee. The completion guarantee shall be
returned or released upon written certification by the City Engineer or a
designated agent that improvements and facilities have been installed and
completed in accordance with the approved plan and specifications. The
procedures for requesting and obtaining a release of the completion guarantee
shall be in a manner prescribed by the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning
Code (Section 510).
   (c)   Default of Completion Guarantee. If improvements are not installed in
accordance with the approved final plan, the governing body may enforce any
corporate bond or other security by appropriate legal and equitable remedies.
If proceeds of such bond or other security are insufficient to pay the cost of
installing or making repairs or corrections to all improvements covered by said
security, the governing body may at its option install part of such
improvements in all or part of the development and may institute appropriate
legal or equitable action to recover the monies necessary to complete the
remainder of the improvements. All proceeds, whether resulting from the
security or from any legal or equitable action brought against the developer,
or both, shall be used solely for the installation of the improvements covered
by such security and not for any other Municipal purpose.
   (d)   Dedication of Public Improvements.
      (1)   When streets, sanitary sewers, stormwater management facilities,
water lines or other required improvements in the development have been
completed in accordance with the final approved plan, such improvements shall
be deemed private until such time as they have been offered for dedication to
the Municipality and accepted by separate ordinance or resolution or until they
have been condemned for use as a public facility.
      (2)   Prior to acceptance of any improvements or facilities, the City
Engineer shall inspect them to ensure that they are constructed in accordance
with the approved plan and are functioning properly. In case of any stormwater
control facility, it must be free of sediment and debris.
      (3)   The owner shall submit as-built plans for all facilities proposed
for dedication.
   (e)   Maintenance Guarantee. Prior to acceptance of any improvements or
facilities, the applicant shall provide a financial security to secure the
structural integrity and functioning of the improvements. The security shall be

acceptable to the Municipality, shall be for a term of eighteen months, and
shall be in an amount equal to fifteen percent of the actual cost of the
improvements and facilities so dedicated.

personally; if a copy thereof is sent by registered mail to his or her last
known address; if a copy thereof is posted in a conspicuous place in or about
the dwelling affected by the notice; or if he or she is served with such notice
by any other method authorized or required under the laws of the State.

pursuant hereto.
   (b)   Any person affected by any such notice may request and shall be

such petition, the Board shall set a time and place for such hearing and shall
give the petitioner written notice thereof. At such hearing the petitioner
shall be given an opportunity to be heard and to show why such notice should be
modified or withdrawn. The hearing shall be commenced not later than ten days

   (c)   After such hearing, the Board shall instruct the Health Officer to
sustain, modify or withdraw the notice, depending upon its findings as to
whether or not this chapter and the rules and regulations adopted pursuant
hereto have been complied with. If the Health Officer sustains or modifies such
notice, it shall be deemed to be an order. Any notice served pursuant to
subsection (a) hereof shall automatically become an order if a written petition
for a hearing is not filed in the office of the Health Officer within ten days
after such notice is served. After a hearing in the case of any notice
suspending any permit required by this chapter or by any rule or regulation
adopted pursuant hereto, when such notice has been sustained by the Board, the
permit shall be deemed to have been revoked. Any such permit which has been
suspended by a notice shall be deemed to be automatically revoked if a petition
for a hearing is not filed in the office of the Health Officer within ten days
after such notice is served.
   (d)   The proceedings at such hearing, including the findings and decision
of the Board, shall be summarized, reduced to writing and entered as a matter
of public record in the office of the Health Officer. Such record shall also
include a copy of every notice or order issued in connection with the matter.
Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Board may seek relief by
submitting, within thirty days after such decision of the Board, an appeal to
the County Court of Common Pleas by petition duly verified, setting forth that
such decision is arbitrary, capricious or otherwise not in accordance with law
and specifying the grounds upon which he or she relies.
   (e)   Whenever the Health Officer finds that an emergency exists which
requires immediate action to protect the public health, he or she may, without
notice or hearing, issue an order reciting the existence of such an emergency
and requiring that such action be taken as he or she deems necessary to meet
the emergency. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this chapter, such order
shall be effective immediately. Any person to whom such order is directed shall
comply therewith immediately, but upon petition to the Board, shall be afforded
a hearing as soon as possible. After such hearing, depending upon the finding
as to whether or not this chapter and the rules and regulations adopted
pursuant hereto have been complied with, the Health Officer shall continue such
order in effect, modify it or revoke it, in accordance with the decision of the
Board.

308 Special Provisions: This section is intended to comply with the requirements of
§603(C) of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code:
1. Prime Agricultural Land: The City of Sharon is an urban place and is nearly fully
developed. Furthermore, there is no active agriculture currently within its borders.
Therefore, no special provision for agriculture appears warranted.
2. Areas of Historic Significance: Areas of historic significance in Sharon should be
presented to City Council and the City Planning Commission. The proposers will be
advised to take one or both of the following actions:
(a) Documentation of the historic resources for nomination to the National Register
of Historic Places.
(b) Proposal for a Historic District under Act 167.
3. Protection of Environmentally Sensitive Areas:
(a) Areas in floodplains are governed by the City’s Floodplain Regulations Ordinance
of 1978.
(b) Development in areas governed by Federal and State environmental regulations,
such as wetlands, shall be referred to appropriate agencies for any needed permits.
4. Forestry: The practice of forestry, including timber harvesting is declared as a
permitted use in all districts. It is subject to the following conditions:
(a) Any harvesting shall present an approved erosion and sediment control plan prior
to the issuance of a zoning permit.
(b) All tree harvesting practices must protect nearby structures and utility lines. No
uncontrolled felling shall be allowed in developed areas.
(c) To avoid traffic congestion and sound disturbance, all activities must start after
8:30 a.m. and end by 4:00 p.m. during the working week. No weekend work shall
be permitted.
309 Conditions, Conditional Uses and Special Exceptions: The criteria for
Conditions, Conditional Uses and Special Exceptions are listed below. In addition to these, the
Zoning Hearing Board, in granting Special Exceptions, and City Council/Planning Commission
in considering Conditional Uses, are charged with considering the effect that such proposed uses
will have upon the immediate neighborhood. The preservation and integrity of existing
development must be carefully weighed and given priority in each decision. In granting a
Special Exception or Conditional Use, the Board or Council (as appropriate) may attach
reasonable conditions and safeguards, in addition to those expressed in this Ordinance, as it may
deem necessary to implement the purposes of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code
Article 3 – District Regulations Page 17
and this Ordinance. Certain uses have conditions attached which are contained in this section.
These uses are to be approved, or denied, by the Zoning Officer based upon the applicant’s
submission relative to the criteria set forth in this Ordinance. It must be clearly noted that the
Zoning Officer, in his review of such applications, has no power to waive, change or otherwise
alter the requirements of this Ordinance.

(a) The facility shall provide all parking as required for residential units off-street.
No parking areas are allowed between the street and the front of the building.

(c) Any multi-family development with more than six dwelling units will be
considered a Planned Residential Development (PRD) and must conform to the

309.11 Conversion Apartments: The purpose of conversion dwellings is to allow for
the conversion of older, larger single-family homes into multi-family units. To be allowed
to convert from a single-family into duplex or multi-family units, the following criteria must
be met:
(a) All units must have separate kitchen and bathroom facilities as well as living/sleeping
spaces.
(b) Each unit shall have a minimum size of 600 square feet exclusive of common spaces.
(c) All required parking shall be accommodated on lot.
(d) Conversion shall be limited to three dwelling units or less in the R-2 District.
(e) All other City codes must be met.
309.12 Residence as a Secondary Use: This Special Exception is specifically
designed to allow residential uses in the C-1 and C-1A Districts on upper floors only. In
addition to meeting other applicable regulations set forth in this Ordinance, such uses shall:
(a) Meet all City and applicable State building and safety codes.
(b) Provide for off-street parking for occupants, on-lot, or within 400 feet of the
proposed dwelling. The provision of adequate off-street parking shall be
mandatory to maintain a secondary residence use.

dwelling units, off-street parking must be provided for employees and customers
in accordance with the criteria set forth by this Ordinance.

repair, automotive repair, automotive body work and similar undertakings.
(d) Home occupations may include, but are not limited to, art studios, music studios
(limited to one student at a time), professional services, dressmakers, beauty
shops and offices when the use is limited to office and storage facilities in keeping
with the intent of this section.
(e) The nature of the home occupation shall not change the outward characteristics of
the home as a residential unit.
(f) No more than twenty-five percent (25% in aggregate) of the home and accessory

belief of City Council that it has a vital duty and role to protect the moral fiber and standards
of City residents, and in particular, the minors of our community. The City Council, by
including this section relative to adult entertainment, is exercising the power granted to
them, and does not attempt or intend to absolutely prohibit adult entertainment

ARTICLE 4
SUPPLEMENTARY REGULATIONS
401 Nonconforming Uses and Structures: The following provisions shall apply to all
nonconforming uses and structures. It is the intention of the City of Sharon that all legal
nonconforming uses and structures shall be able to continue; however, all changes in such
uses shall only be as allowed in this Article. It is, however, the policy of the City of
Sharon that these nonconforming uses are incompatible with the intent of the zoning
district in which they are located and once legally abandoned, only uses conforming to
this Ordinance shall be permitted. If a nonconforming use of land or structure is
discontinued for a period of one year, it will be presumed to be abandoned.

one year, such nonconforming use shall not be resumed and any further use shall be in
conformity with the provisions of this Ordinance.
D) The nonconforming use of a building may be extended throughout those parts thereof
which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of adoption of this
Ordinance.
E) A nonconforming use may be changed to a different nonconforming use with the
approval of the Board by its findings determines the proposed use is equally appropriate to
the zoning district and neighborhood as the existing use. In permitting such changes, the
Board may require reasonable conditions and safeguards.
F) Nothing contained herein shall require any change in the overall layout, plans,
construction, size or designated use of any development, building, structure or part thereof
for which official approval and required permits have been granted prior to the effective
date of this Ordinance and where construction is completed within six months from the
date of issuance of the permit.
G) Once changed to a conforming use, no structure or land shall be permitted to revert to a
nonconforming use.
Article 4 – Supplementary Regulations Page 30

district to another of a different classification, this Article shall also apply to any use
which thereby becomes nonconforming.
402 Existing Lots of Record: The following provisions shall apply to all lots of record as

ownership different from the ownership of adjoining lots, may be used for the erection of
a structure conforming to the use regulations of the district in which it is located even
though its lot area and width are less than the minimum required by this Ordinance. If
the proposed development does not comply to such standards, the property owner may
appeal to the Board. However, in no event can the Board reduce required yard
requirements greater than fifty percent (50%) of those required by this Ordinance.
B) If two or more lots or combinations of lots and portions of lots with continuous frontage
in single ownership are of record at the time of passage of this Ordinance, and if all or
part of the lots do not meet the requirements established for lot width and area, the lands
involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for the purpose of this Ordinance,
and no portion of said parcel shall be used or sold in a manner which diminishes
compliance with lot width and area requirements established by this Ordinance.
C) No division of any parcel shall be made which creates a lot width or area below the
requirements as stated in this Ordinance.

twelve feet in width, double drives (for ingress and egress) may be up to 24 feet wide.
Reasonable radius flairs at street or alley entrances/exits shall be permitted. There shall
be at least fifteen feet between driveways at the street line and at least five feet between a
driveway and a fire hydrant, catch basin or street intersection radius.
407.2(b) Parking Within Yards: In residential districts required parking facilities shall
be permitted only in the rear or side yards, or in driveway areas. In other districts parking
shall also be allowed in the front yard subject to Section 407.2(g).
407.2(c) Number of Parking Spaces Required: The number of off-street parking
spaces required is set forth on the following page. Where the use of the premises is not
specifically mentioned, requirements for similar uses shall apply. If no similar uses are
mentioned, the parking requirements shall be one space for each two proposed patrons
and/or occupants of that structure. Where more than one use exists on a lot, parking
regulations for each use must be met. No parking shall be required of existing or future

407.2(d) Parking Bonuses / Alternative Parking Plans: This Section is a means to
meet the minimum parking requirement by alternate means other than providing on-site
automobile parking in accordance with Section 407.2(c). Alternatives include:
(1) Bicycle Spaces – For every three bicycle parking spaces provided on-lot, a
reduction of one automobile parking space may be allowed, up to a maximum of
five percent of the total parking required.
(2) Mass Transit Allowances – If a business is located within 300 feet of a Shenango
Valley Shuttle Service (SVSS) or other mass transit stop, a reduction in parking of
up to ten percent (10%) may be allowed.
(3) On-Street Parking Space Credit – On street parking spaces may be used to satisfy up
to ten percent (10%) of the requirements for off-street parking. Such on-street
parking shall be located only on arterial or collector streets and within the public
right-of-way and shall be located within 500 feet of the use.
(4) Shared Parking – Shared Parking is encouraged to promote efficient use of land and
resources by allowing users to share off-street parking areas for uses that are located
near one another and have different peak parking demands or different operating
hours. Shared parking shall be subject to the following standards:
(a) Parking may only be shared by uses that are within 500 feet of one another
and have a convenient, visible pedestrian connection between the two
properties;
Article 4 – Supplementary Regulations Page 37
(b) The minimum number of parking spaces can be met for each use by using

(c) To compute the number of spaces needed for two or more distinguishable
land uses, complete the following:
i. Multiply the minimum parking required for each individual use, as
set in 407.2.c, by the appropriate percentage in the above table, for
each of the six designated time periods.
ii. Add the resulting sums for each of the six columns.
iii. The minimum shall be the highest sum among the six columns
resulting from the above calculations.
iv. Select the time period with the highest total parking requirement
and use that total as the shared parking requirement.
(d) Other Uses – If one or all of the land uses proposing to make use of shared
parking facilities do not conform to the general land use categories in the
table on the previous page (as determined by the Zoning Officer), then the
Applicant shall submit sufficient data to indicate the principal operating
hours of the uses. Based on this information, the Zoning Officer, with
approval of the Zoning Hearing Board, shall determine the appropriate
shared parking requirement, if any, for such uses.
(e) Agreement for Shared Parking – If parking is to be shared by uses located
on two or more lots, an agreement must be presented to the Zoning Officer
assuring use of the required parking spaces until or unless the required
parking spaces are located on the same lot as the use they serve.
Article 4 – Supplementary Regulations Page 38
407.2(e) Maximum Parking Requirements: The maximum number of off-street
parking spaces for any building or use shall not exceed the amount determined as
follows:
(1) Parking lots of more than 20 spaces – Parking lots may not have more than
120% of the number of spaces specified in Section 407.2 (c), not including
handicap accessible spaces; unless a minimum of 20% of the parking area is
landscaped in accordance with the standards of this Ordinance.
(2) Parking lots of more than 50 spaces – No more than 135% of the minimum
number of spaces required as specified in Section 407.2(c), not including
handicap accessible spaces, are permitted.
407.2(f) Location and Parking: Required parking spaces shall be located on the same
lot with the principal use. The Zoning Hearing Board may permit parking spaces to be
located not more than 400 feet from the lot of the principal use, and the Board finds that
it is impractical to provide parking on the same lot with the principal use.
407.2(g) Screening and Landscaping: Off-street parking areas for more than five
vehicles, and off-street loading areas, shall be effectively screened (see definition of
Screening) on any side which adjoins a residential district or use. In addition, there shall
be a planting strip of at least five feet between the front lot line and the parking lot. Such
planting strip shall be suitably landscaped and maintained.
407.2(h) Minimum Distance and Setbacks: No off-street loading or parking area for
more than five vehicles shall be closer than five feet to any adjoining property line. If the
adjoining property contains a residential dwelling, residential district, school, hospital, or
similar institution, a ten foot setback is required.
407.2(i) Surfacing: With the exception of single- and two-family dwellings, all
parking and loading areas and access drives shall have a paved or concrete surface,
graded with positive drainage to dispose of surface water. Parking areas larger than
10,000 square feet shall submit a plan, including drainage provisions, to the City for
approval. Lots shall be designed to provide for orderly and safe loading and parking.
407.2(j) Lighting: Any lighting used to illuminate off-street parking or loading areas
shall be arranged so as to reflect the light away from the adjoining premises of any
residential district or use and away from roads or highways. (See Section 406.6)
407.2(k) Parking Major Items of Recreational Equipment in Areas Outside of
Travel Parks: The outdoor storage of major recreational equipment owned by the
occupant of the premises, including but not limited to travel trailers, motor homes, tent
trailers, pickup campers (designed to be mounted on automotive vehicles), boats and boat
trailers shall be permitted in all zoning districts; however, in the residential zoning
districts storage locations shall be in rear yards or in accessory buildings only. Except for
Article 4 – Supplementary Regulations Page 39
use by temporary visitors [less than two days], such vehicles will not be used for living,
sleeping or housekeeping purposes.
407.2(l) Outdoor Storage of Inoperative, Unlicensed, Uninspected Vehicles:
Except for the provisions of 309.25, there shall be no outdoor storage of motor vehicles
which are inoperative, unlicensed, lack current Pennsylvania inspection in any district.
Such vehicles may be stored in garages, barns or other enclosed structures.
408 Steep Slope Protection Overlay Standards: Any development of slopes of more
than 15% must be submitted on a plan prepared by a registered engineer or architect
showing how the development will treat the slope problem.
408.1 Purpose: This section is intended to protect resources in environmentally
sensitive areas to ensure that development does not result in erosion and in flooding
during site preparation and the development process. All uses and activities established
after the effective date of this Ordinance shall comply with the following standards. Site
alternations, re-grading, filling or the clearing of vegetation, or any other activity deemed
detrimental to any environmentally sensitive area or resource prior to the submission of
plans for subdivision or land development shall be a violation of this Ordinance.
408.2 General Design Standards:
(a) Structures shall be designed in a manner that requires a minimum amount of
alternation to the steep slope and that otherwise complies with the grading standards in
Section 408.3. Except where a geologic hazard investigation report recommends
otherwise, multi-level building design and/or terracing shall be used. Otherwise,
structures shall be sited on existing level areas of the site.
(b) Particular caution shall be taken to prevent increases in the rate of stormwater runoff
and erosion downslope of any steep slope development site. All approved permits
from the Department of Environmental Protection shall be submitted before any use is
approved under the provisions of this Section.
408.3 Specific Design Standards:
(a) Any site disturbance of slopes exceeding fifteen (15%) percent shall be
minimized.
(b) No site disturbance shall be allowed on slopes exceeding twenty-five (25%)
percent, except under the following circumstances.
1) Grading for a portion of a driveway accessing a single family dwelling when
it can be demonstrated that no other routing which avoids slopes exceeding
twenty-five (25%) percent is possible.
Article 4 – Supplementary Regulations Page 40
2) Upon submission of a report by a certified soil or geotechnical engineer
indicating that the steep slope may be safety developed and execution of a
provision agreeing to hold the City harmless from any claims of damages due
to approval of such development. If development is allowed to proceed under
this subsection, no more than (15%) percent of such areas shall be developed
and/or re-graded or stripped of vegetation.
(c) Finished slopes of all cuts and fills shall not exceed three-to-one (3:1), unless the
applicant can demonstrate that steeper slopes can be stabilized and maintained
adequately.
409 Swimming Pools: All swimming pools shall be enclosed by a fence at least four feet
high for the purpose of public safety. The fence is to be so constructed so that small
children cannot climb under, through or on the fence. Gates shall also be so constructed
so they can be secured to prevent access by small children. For above-ground pools, the
pool structure may be used as part of the required fencing. Any ladder or steps used to
access to above-ground pools must be secured to prevent access by small children.
410 Flood Hazard Areas: The City of Sharon has adopted an ordinance regulating
development within floodplains. All developments within designated areas are required
to follow the regulations contained in said Ordinance.
411 Riverfront Overlay District: The Riverfront Overlay district consists of any parcel of
land which has lands within 100 feet of the Shenango River. The purpose of this district
is to provide for the visual enhancement of Shenango River within the City of Sharon.
An overlay zone may encompass one or more underlying zoning districts and imposes
additional requirements above that required by the underlying zone. All applications for
development in the Riverfront Overlay District shall be referred to the Sharon City
Planning Commission. They shall review proposed development using four basic
approaches:
411.1 General Architectural Design: The developer shall provide color photographs
of the area to be developed and provide renderings or elevation sketches to demonstrate
design treatment and, if appropriate, compatibility with nearby development. Included in
the Planning Commission’s consideration shall be:
o Height, bulk, and general mass
o Facade design, including windows and doors
o Roof elevation and material
o General architectural style and features
o Relationship to surrounding buildings
o Relationship to the Shenango River
Article 4 – Supplementary Regulations Page 41
411.2 Landscaping: The developer is encouraged to view landscaping as part of the
overall design and not an after thought. Consideration shall be given to how the
landscaping enhances the developer’s structure and to the preservation and enhancement
of river vistas.
411.3 Lighting: Exterior lighting may be used to illuminate of building or its grounds
for aesthetic or security reasons. However, lighting which produces glare or would
unreasonably limit vistas of the Shenango River should be avoided.
411.4 Signage: Signs should observe the criteria of this Ordinance, but should also
seek to achieve design compatibility with the surrounding environment and not block
vistas of the Shenango River.
411.5 Other Regulations: All development in the Riverfront Overlay District shall
meet the following requirements:
(a) The riparian buffer setback shall be 35 feet, as measured from the edge of the bank
of the Shenango River. The following land disturbances shall be permitted
without limitation within the riparian buffer setback:
i. Vegetation management or open space management plan, which provides
for the maintenance of stream banks and water quality.
ii. Activities regulated by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (such as
permitted stream or wetland crossings or other encroachments)
iii. Installation of pervious-surfaced trail providing access to the river, or an
impervious-surfaced trail when required or authorized by federal or state
regulations.
iv. Gardening and exterior yard maintenance.
v. Temporary construction attendant to construction activities occurring
within the riparian buffer setback; provided, however, that such temporary
construction shall be removed and any land disturbance within the riparian
buffer setback be remedied within a time period approved by the City.
(b) To help manage stormwater runoff and improve stream quality, any parcel in the
Riverfront Overlay Zone shall receive up to a twenty percent (20%) reduction in
the number of required parking spaces for the number of parking spaces that use
pervious surfaces for pavement.
411.10 Processing:
411.11: The review of the Planning Commission shall be completed within 30 days from
submission to the Zoning Officer. All Commission meetings shall be open to the public
and the meetings shall follow the Pennsylvania Sunshine Law. Planning Commission
recommendations shall be forwarded to Sharon City Council.
Article 4 – Supplementary Regulations Page 42
411.12: Council shall receive the application and the recommendation of the Planning
Commission and shall act on same within 20 days. They may approve the application as
submitted or approve with the recommendations (either as submitted for modified) of the
Planning Commission.
411.13: It is the intent of this section that this process, from submitting of a complete
application, to approval or denial shall not take more than 45 days.
412 Central Commercial Frame Area: In order to enhance the economic viability of the
Central Commercial Frame Area, the City of Sharon encourages the use of building in
this area in a compatible, but nontraditional manner. Such uses shall refer to the Planning
Commission who shall consider the following elements:
412.1 Design: Though a building may convert from retail to another use, the developer
shall endeavor to keep the original architectural design and facade treatment intact.
412.2 Intensity of Use: Uses must meet the performance standards within the
Ordinance. Uses which produce loud noises, or vibrations will not be allowed.
412.10 Processing: Shall follow the same requirements set forth in Section 411.10.

503 Computations: The following principles shall control the computation of sign area and
sign height:
503.1 - Computation of Area of Individual Signs: The area of a sign face (which
is also the sign area of a wall sign or other sign with only one face) shall be computed by
means of the smallest square, circle, rectangle, triangle, or combination thereof that will
encompass the extreme limits of the writing, representation, emblem, or other display,
together with any material or color forming an integral part of the background of the
display or used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is
placed, but not including any supporting framework, bracing, or decorative fence or wall
when such fence or wall otherwise meets zoning ordinance regulations and is clearly
incidental to the display itself.
503.2 - Computation of Area of Multi-Faced Sign: The sign area for a sign with
more than one face shall be computed by adding together the area of all sign faces visible
from any one point. When two identical sign faces are placed back to back, so that both
faces cannot be viewed from any point at the same time, and when such faces are part of
the same sign structure and are not more than 42 inches apart, the sign area shall be
computed by the measurement of one of the faces.
Article 5 – Sign Regulations Page 47
503.3 - Computation of Height: The height of a sign shall be computed as the

on two or more streets are allowed the permitted sign area for each street frontage.
However, the total sign area that is oriented toward a particular street may not exceed the

area frontage on that street.

nor timely appeals the judgment, the City may enforce the judgment pursuant to the
applicable rules of civil procedure. Each day that a violation continues shall
constitute a separate violation, unless the district justice determining that there has
been a violation further determine that there was a good faith basis for the person,
partnership or corporation violating this Ordinance to have believed that there was no
such violation, in which event there shall be deemed to have been only one such
violation until the fifth day following the date of the determination of a violation
continues shall constitute a separate violation by the district justice and thereafter

Zoning Officer the right to commence any action for enforcement pursuant to this
section.

H) Variances: The Board shall hear requests for variances where it is alleged that the
provisions of this Ordinance inflict unnecessary hardship upon the applicant. The Board
may by rule prescribe the form of application and may require preliminary application to
the Zoning Officer. The Board may grant a variance provided that all of the following
findings are made where relevant in a given case:
1) That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions, including irregularity,
narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or shape, or exceptional topographical or
other physical conditions peculiar to the particular property, and that the
unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions, and not the circumstances or
conditions generally created by the provisions of this Ordinance in the
neighborhood or district in which the property is located;
2) That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is no possibility
that the property can be developed in strict conformity with the provisions of this
Ordinance and that the authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to enable
the reasonable use of the property;
3) That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the applicant;
4) That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential character of the
neighborhood or district in which the property is located, nor substantially or
permanently impair the appropriate use or development of adjacent property, nor
be detrimental to the public welfare; and
5) That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum variance that will
afford relief and will represent the least modification possible of the regulation in
issue.
In granting any variance, the Board may attach such reasonable conditions and
safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement the purpose of this Ordinance.
I) Special Exceptions: The Board shall hear and decide requests for special exceptions in
accordance with the standards and criteria of this Ordinance. In granting a special
exception, the Board may attach such reasonable conditions and safeguards, in addition to
those expressed in the Ordinance, as it may deem necessary to implement the purposes of
the Zoning Ordinance.

proceeding with the Board later than thirty (30) days after an application for
development, preliminary or final, has been approved by an appropriate City officer,
agency or body if such proceeding is designed to secure reversal or to limit the approval
in any manner unless such person alleges and proves that he had no notice, knowledge, or
reason to believe that such approval had been given. If such person has succeeded to his
interest after such approval, he shall be bound by the knowledge of his predecessor in
interest. See also Section 914.1 of the Planning Code.
711 Stay of Proceedings: Upon filing of any proceeding referred to in Section 708 and
during its pendency before the Board, all land development pursuant to any challenged
ordinance, order or approval of the Zoning Officer or of any agency or body, and all
official action thereunder shall be stayed unless the Zoning Officer or any other
appropriate agency or body certifies to the Board facts indicating that such stay would
cause imminent peril to life or property, in which case the development or official action
shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order, which may be granted by the
Board or by the court having jurisdiction of zoning appeals on petition after notice to the

Article 10 – Planned Residential Development Page 81
ARTICLE 10
PLANNED RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT
1001 Planned Residential Development:
Purpose: The purpose of the planned residential development regulations (PRD) is to
encourage the flexibility in the design and development of land in order to promote its
most appropriate use; to encourage grouping of housing and a mixture of housing types in
alternative patterns and in a variety of ways; to facilitate the adequate and economical
provision of streets and utilities; and to preserve the natural and scenic qualities of open
areas. Planned residential developments are permitted as a conditional use in the R-2 and
R-3 Districts in the City of Sharon. The specific purposes of these districts in Sharon
City are:
R-2 - In the R-2 District, the PRD is intended to facilitate the redevelopment of relatively
small tracts of land while at the same time promoting better design.
R-3 - In the R-3 District, the PRD has a quite different purpose. Here the intent is to
allow the development of larger tracts of land while promoting good design and allowing
a mixture of housing types and densities.
1002 Minimum Development Size: In the R-2 District, no PRD may include less than
20,000 square feet of land. In the R-3 District, no PRD may include less than 2 acres of
land.
1003 General Standards: The planned residential development must meet all of the
following general standards:
(a) The planned residential development is consistent with the Comprehensive Plan and
this Ordinance's Statement of Community Development Objectives.
(b) The planned residential development is an effective and unified treatment of the
development possibilities on the project site, and the development plan makes
appropriate provision for the preservation of unique physical, cultural and historic
resources.
(c) The planned residential development shall be planned and developed to harmonize
with any existing or proposed development in the area surrounding the project site.
(d) Performance bond(s) for all public improvements in the development must be posted
as required in the City of Sharon Subdivision Ordinance.
(e) Connection to the City’s sanitary sewer system shall be required.
Article 10 – Planned Residential Development Page 82
(f) Connection to the City’s public water supplies will be required.
(g) The height for buildings in any PRD shall not exceed 40 feet in the R-2 zoning
district, and 80 feet in the R-3 zoning district, in accordance with Section 405.2.
1004 Applicable Districts and Uses Permitted: Planned residential developments may
be approved in the R-2 and R-3 Residential Districts and may include the mixture of
single-family, two-family and multi-family residential uses in a single development.
1005 Calculations of Project Densities: The number of dwelling units which may be
constructed within the planned residential development shall be determined by dividing
the gross project area by the required lot area per dwelling unit which is required in the
respective zoning districts.
1006 Increase in Density: It is recognized that the expense of complying with the approval
process contained in the planned residential development regulations may discourage
developers from seeking approval of a planned residential development project. At the
time the outline or preliminary development plan is filed, the applicant may apply for an
increase in the densities permitted by the zone in which the planned residential
development is to be constructed. If it gives its approval to the planned residential
development, the City Council may authorize the developer to increase permitted
densities by an amount up to 10%.
Additional increase in density may be granted up to 27%, providing:
(a) If common open space is developed to more intense usable open space providing
facilities for active outdoor recreation, such as playgrounds, playground equipment,
picnic facilities, ball fields and equipment, or other similar improvements to the open
space, an additional 10% increase in density may be permitted.
(b) If item (a), above, is developed and unique indoor-outdoor buildings, to be used for
recreation or other similar activities of the residents of the development, such as
swimming pools, club houses, or other similar buildings are provided, then an
additional 17% increase in density may be permitted.
1007 Lot Size and Spacing of Buildings: The location of all structures shall be as shown
on final plans. The proposed location and arrangement shall not be detrimental to
existing or prospective adjacent dwellings or to the existing or prospective development
of the neighborhood. There shall be no minimum lot size, no minimum or maximum
percentage of lot coverage and no minimum lot width in the planned residential
development. However, every single-family dwelling shall have access to a public street,
court, walkway, or other area dedicated to public use. No dwelling and no addition to
Article 10 – Planned Residential Development Page 83
any dwellings shall be erected within a distance of less than the height of the highest
adjacent building.
PRD’s in the R-3 District are encouraged to mix housing types and densities. Generally,
the design shall focus multi-family units in the center of the PRD with two-family and
one-family units along the periphery.
Vehicular access to dwellings by means of adequate service drives and/or emergency
entrances shall be provided in all cases where dwellings do not front on a public street, or
where the City deems necessary for public safety. In general, the City will expect PRD’s
in the R-3 District to have at least two points of access to the existing City street system,
if practical. Internal streets and sidewalks shall be constructed to City standards.
However, street cartway widths may be reduced from normal City requirements if
adequate off-street parking is provided at a rate of 1.5 spaces per residential unit.
1008 Perimeter Requirements: The requirements of this section apply only to structures
located in an R-3 PRD within 50 feet of the perimeter of a planned residential
development. If the proposed PRD abuts single-family residences or an R-1 District, an
adequate buffer area of 30 feet will be required, at least 10 feet of which will be in screen
planting. If topographical or other barriers do not provide adequate privacy for existing
uses adjacent to the planned residential development, the Planning Commission may
require either or both of the following:
(a) Structures located on the perimeter of the planned residential development must be set
back by a distance sufficient to protect the privacy and amenity of adjacent existing
uses, in no case less than the height of the buildings.
(b) Structures located on the perimeter of the planned residential development must
provide a 20 foot permanent planted screen in a manner which is sufficient to protect
the privacy and amenity of adjacent existing uses.
1009 Common Open Space Required: For PRD’s in the R-3 District, the development
plan will contain areas to be allocated for common open space which satisfy the standards
governing the usability and quality of common open space that is contained in this
Ordinance.
No open area may be accepted as common open space under the provisions of this
Ordinance unless it meets the following standards:
(a) A minimum of one-and-one-half (1½) acres of common open space shall be provided
including usable and scenic green space for the first ten acres (or fraction thereof) plus
one acre for each additional five acres (or fraction thereof) of gross project area.
Article 10 – Planned Residential Development Page 84
(b) The location, shape, size, and character of the common open space must be suitable
for the planned residential development.
(c) Common open space must be suitably improved for its intended use, but a portion (up
to 50%) of common open space containing natural features worthy of preservation
may be left unimproved. The building, structures, and improvements which are
permitted in the common open space must be appropriate to the uses which are
authorized for the common open space and must conserve and enhance the amenities
of the common open space having regard to its topography and unimproved condition.
(d) The development schedule which is part of the development plan must coordinate the
improvement of the common open space, the construction of buildings, structures, and
improvements in the common open space, and the construction of residential
dwellings in the planned residential development.
(e) If the final development plan provides for buildings, structures, and improvements in
the common open space of a value in excess of ten thousand ($10,000) dollars, the
developer must provide a bond in the estimated amount of the improvements assuring
that the buildings, structures, and improvements will be completed. The City Council
shall release the bond or other assurance when the buildings, structures, or
improvements have been completed according to the development plan.
1010 Conveyance and Maintenance of Common Space: All land shown on the final
development plan as common open space must be conveyed under one of the following
options:
(a) It may be conveyed to a public agency which will agree to maintain the common open
space and any buildings, structures, or improvements which have been placed on it, in
which case the general public must have use of the open space.
(b) It may be conveyed to trustees provided in an indenture establishing an association or
similar organization for the maintenance of the planned residential development. The
common open space must be conveyed to the trustees subject to covenants to be
approved by the City which restrict the common open space to the uses specified on the
final development plan, and which provide for the maintenance of the common open
space in a manner which assures its containing use for its intended purpose.
(1) No common open space may be put to any use not specified in the final
development plan unless the final development plan has been amended to permit
that use.
(2) If the common open space is not conveyed to a public agency, either one of the
following methods of enforcement must be provided:
Article 10 – Planned Residential Development Page 85
(a) The legal right to develop the common open space for the uses not
specified in the final development plan must be approved by the City.
(b) The restrictions governing the use, improvement, and maintenance of the
common open space must be stated as conditions to the conveyance of the
common open space, the fee title to the common open space to vest in a
public agency in the event of a substantial default in the stated conditions.
(3) If the common open space is not conveyed to the City, or a public agency
approved by the City, the covenants governing the use, improvement, and
maintenance of the common open space shall then be enforceable by the City, and
the instrument of conveyance shall so provide.
(4) It is the purpose and intent of these regulations that the City shall have the
authority and powers to require the adequate maintenance of common open space
as set forth by Article VII of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code.
1011 Process for Approval, Hearings, and Enforcement: It is the intent of the City of
Sharon to follow the provisions of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code (as
amended) for the review, approval, processing, and enforcement of provisions relative to
Planned Residential Development. Please see Article VII of the Code.

ARTICLE 11
TRADITIONAL NEIGHBORHOOD DEVELOPMENT (TND)
1101 Purpose and Authority: Authority for this Article derives from Article VII-A of the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, and its purposes are as follows:
(a) To insure that the zoning regulations which are concerned in part with the uniform
treatment of dwelling type, bulk, density, intensity, and open space within each zoning
district shall not be applied to the improvement of land by other than lot-by-lot
development in a manner that would distort the objectives of the City’s Community
Development Goals and Objectives.
(b) To encourage innovations in residential and nonresidential development and renewal
that makes use of a mixed-use form of development so that the growing demand for
housing and other development may be met by greater variety in type, design, and
layout of dwellings and other buildings and structures and by the conservation and
more effective use of open space ancillary to said dwellings and uses.
(c) To extend greater opportunities for better housing, recreation, and access to goods,
services, and employment opportunities to all citizens and residents of this
Commonwealth.
(d) To encourage a more efficient use of land and of public services to reflect changes in
the technology of land development so that economies secured may benefit those who
need home and for other uses.
(e) To allow for the development of fully-integrated, mixed-use pedestrian-oriented
neighborhoods.
(f) To minimize traffic congestion, infrastructure costs, and environmental degradation.
(g) To promote the implementation of the objectives of the City of Sharon Comprehensive
Plan for guiding the location of growth.
(h) To provide a procedure in aid of these purposes which can relate the type, design, and
layout of residential and nonresidential development to the particular demand for
housing existing at the time of development in a manner consistent with the
preservation of the property values within existing residential and nonresidential areas.
(i) To insure that the increased flexibility of regulations over land development
authorized herein is carried out under such administrative standards and procedure as
shall encourage the disposition of proposals for land development without undue delay.

and visually, to the greatest extent possible. Buildings shall not be oriented to front
toward a parking lot. Blank windowless walls shall be discouraged on facades of
buildings.

building line for each block. The building line shall be generally continued across side
yard setback areas between buildings by using landscaping. The streetscape shall also
be reinforced by lines of closely planted shade trees, and may be further reinforced by
walls, hedges, or fences which define front yards.

1108 Public Hearings:
(a) Within 60 days after the filing of an application for tentative approval of a Traditional
Neighborhood Development pursuant to this Ordinance, a public hearing pursuant to
public notice of said application shall be held by the City in the manner prescribed in
the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code.
(b) The governing body may continue the hearing from time to time, and where

Article 11 – Traditional Neighborhood Development Page 93
review, provided, however, that in any event, the public hearing or hearings shall be
concluded within 30 days after the date of the first public hearing.
1109 The Findings:
(a) The governing body, within 60 days following the conclusion of the public hearing
provided for in this Article, shall, by official written communication, to the developer,
either:
(1) Grant tentative approval of the development plan as submitted;
(2) Grant tentative approval subject to specified conditions not included in the
development plan as submitted; or
(3) Deny tentative approval to the development plan.
Failure to so act within said period shall be deemed to be a grant of tentative approval
of the development plan as submitted. In the event, however, the tentative approval is
granted subject to conditions, the developer may, within 30 days after receiving a
copy of the official written communication of the municipality to notify such
governing body of his refusal to accept all said conditions, in which case, the
municipality shall be deemed to have denied tentative approval of the development
plan. In the event the developer does not, within said period, notify the governing
body of his refusal to accept all.41 said conditions, tentative approval of the
development plan, with all said conditions, shall stand as granted.
(b) The grant or denial of tentative approval by official written communication shall
include not only conclusions but also findings of fact related to the specific proposal
and set forth the reasons for the grant, with or without conditions, or for the denial, and
said communication shall set forth with particularity in what respects the development
plan would or would not be in the public interest, including, but not limited to, findings
of fact and conclusions on the following:
(1) In those respects in which the development plan is or is not consistent with the
comprehensive plan for the development of the municipality;
(2) The extent to which the development plan departs from zoning and subdivision
regulations otherwise applicable to the subject property, including but not limited
to density, bulk and use, and the reasons why such departures are or are not
deemed to be in the public interest;
(3) The purpose, location and amount of the common open space in the Traditional
Neighborhood Development, the reliability of the proposals for maintenance and
conservation of the common open space, and the adequacy or inadequacy of the
Article 11 – Traditional Neighborhood Development Page 94
amount and purpose of the common open space as related to the proposed density
and type of residential development;
(4) The physical design of the development plan and the manner in which said design
does or does not make adequate provision for public services, provide adequate
control over vehicular traffic, and further the amenities of light and air, recreation,
and visual enjoyment;
(5) The relationship, beneficial or adverse, of the proposed Traditional Neighborhood
Development to the neighborhood in which it is proposed to be established; and
(6) In the case of a development plan which proposes development over a period of
years, the sufficiency of the terms and conditions intended to protect the interests
of the public and of the residents of the Traditional Neighborhood Development
in the integrity of the development plan.
(c) In the event a development plan is granted tentative approval, with or without
conditions, the municipality may set forth in the official written communication the
time within which an application for final approval of the development plan shall be
filed or, in the case of a development plan which provides for development over a
period of years, the periods of time within which applications for final approval of each
part thereof shall be filed. Except upon the consent of the developer, the time so
established between grant of tentative approval and an application for final approval
shall not be less than 12 months and, in the case of developments over a period of
years, the time between applications for final approval of each part of a plan shall be
not less than 12 months.
1110 Status of Plan After Tentative Approval:
(d) The official written communication provided for in this Article shall be certified by
the municipal secretary of the governing body and shall be filed in his office, and a
certified copy shall be mailed to the developer. Where tentative approval has been
granted, it shall be deemed an amendment to the zoning map, effective upon final
approval, and shall be note on the zoning map.
(e) Tentative approval of a development plan shall not qualify a plat of the Traditional
Neighborhood Development for recording nor authorize development or the issuance
of any building permits. A development plan which has been given tentative approval
as submitted, or which has been given tentative approval with conditions which have
been accepted by the developer (and provided that the developer has not defaulted nor
violated any of the conditions of the tentative approval), shall not be modified or
revoked nor otherwise impaired by action of the municipality pending an application or
applications for final approval, without the consent of the developer, provided an
application or applications for final approval is filed or, in the case of development
Article 11 – Traditional Neighborhood Development Page 95
over a period of years, provided applications are filed, within the period of time
specified in the official written communication granting tentative approval.
(f) In the event that a development plan is given tentative approval and thereafter, but
prior to final approval, the developer shall elect to abandon said development plan and
shall so notify the governing body in writing, or in the event the developer shall fail to
file application or applications for final approval within the required period of time or
times, as the case may be, the tentative approval shall be deemed to be revoked and all
that portion of the area included in the development plan for which final approval has
not been given shall be subject to those local ordinances otherwise applicable thereto as
they may be amended from time to time, and the same shall be noted on the zoning
map and in the records of the City Clerk.
1111 Application for Final Approval:
(a) An application for final approval may be for all the land included in a development
plan or, to the extent set forth in the tentative approval, for a section thereof. Said
application shall be made to the Zoning Officer of the municipality designated by the
Ordinance within one year of the official written communication granting tentative
approval. The application shall include any drawings, specifications, covenants,
easements, development agreement for applicable public improvements and such other
requirements as may be specified by this Ordinance, as well as any conditions set forth
in the official written communication at the time of tentative approval. A public
hearing on an application for final approval of the development plan, or the part
thereof, submitted for final approval, shall not be required provided the development
plan, or the part thereof submitted for final approval is in compliance with the
development plan theretofore given tentative approval and with any specified
conditions attached thereto. The submission shall be reviewed by the Zoning Officer
and the Planning Commission for compliance prior to being forwarded to the
governing body. This review is to take place in 35 days.
(b) In the event the application for final approval has been filed, together with all
drawings, specifications and other documents in support thereof, and as required by the
Ordinance and the official written communication of tentative approval, by the City
shall, within 45 days of such filing, grant such development plan final approval.
(c) In the event the development plan as submitted contains variations from the
development plan given tentative approval, the City may refuse to grant final approval
and shall, within 45 days from the filing of the application for final approval, so advise
the developer in writing of said refusal, setting forth in said notice the reasons why one
or more of said variations are not in the public interest. In the event of such refusal, the
developer may either:
(7) Refile his application for final approval without the variations objected; or
Article 11 – Traditional Neighborhood Development Page 96
(8) File a written request with the approving body that it hold a public hearing on his
application for final approval.
If the developer wishes to take either such alternate action he may do so at any time
within which he shall be entitled to apply for final approval, or within 30 additional days
if the time for applying for final approval shall have already passed at the time when the
developer was advised that the development plan was not in substantial compliance. In
the event the developer shall fail to take either of these alternative actions within said
time, he shall be deemed to have abandoned the development plan. Any such public
hearing shall be held pursuant to public notice within 30 days after request for the hearing
is made by the developer, and the hearing shall be conducted in the manner prescribed in
this Article for public hearings on applications for tentative approval. Within 30 days
after the conclusion of the hearing, the City shall by official written communication either
grant final approval to the development plan or deny final approval. The grant or denial
of final approval of the development plan shall, in cases arising under this section, be in
the form and contain the findings required for an application for tentative approval set
forth in this Ordinance.
(d) A development plan, or any part thereof, which has been given final approval shall be
so certified without delay by the City and shall be filed of record forthwith in the office
of the recorder of deeds before any development shall take place in accordance
therewith. Upon the filing of record of the development plan the zoning and
subdivision regulations otherwise applicable to the land included in such plan shall
cease to apply thereto. Pending completion, in accordance with the time provisions
stated in Section 508 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, of said
Traditional Neighborhood Development or of that part thereof, as the case may be, that
has been finally approved, no modification of the provisions of said development plan,
or part thereof, as finally approved, shall be made except with the consent of the
developer. Upon approval of a final plat, the developer shall record the plat in
accordance with the provisions of Section 513(a) of the Pennsylvania Municipalities
Planning Code and post financial security in accordance with Section 509 of the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code.
(e) In the event that a development plan, or a section thereof, is given final approval and
thereafter the developer shall abandon such plan or the section thereof that has been
finally approved, and shall so notify the City in writing; or, in the event the developer
shall fail to commence and carry out the Traditional Neighborhood Development in
accordance with the time provisions stated in Section 508 of the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code after final approval has been granted, no development or
further development shall take place on the property included in the development plan
until after the said property is reclassified by enactment of an amendment to the City of
Farrell Zoning Ordinance in the manner prescribed for such amendments.
