PREFACE
The Clifton Municipal Code contains the codification and revision of the
ordinances of the City of Clifton, Tennessee. By referring to the historical
citation appearing at the end of each section, the user can determine the origin
of each particular section. The absence of a historical citation means that the
section was added by the codifier. The word "modified" in the historical citation
indicates significant modification of the original ordinance.
The code is arranged into titles, chapters, and sections. Related matter
is kept together, so far as possible, within the same title. Each section number
is complete within itself, containing the title number, the chapter number, and
the section of the chapter of which it is a part. Specifically, the first digit,
followed by a hyphen, identifies the title number. The second digit identifies the
chapter number, and the last two digits identify the section number. For
example, title 2, chapter 1, section 6, is designated as § 2-106.
By utilizing the table of contents, code index and the analysis preceding
each title and chapter of the code, together with the cross references and
explanations included as footnotes, the user should locate all the provisions in
the code relating to any question that might arise. However, the user should
note that most of the administrative ordinances (e.g. Annual Budget, Zoning
Map Amendments, Tax Assessments, etc...) do not appear in the code. Likewise,
ordinances that have been passed since the last update of the code do not appear
here. Therefore, the user should refer to the city's ordinance book or the city
recorder for a comprehensive and up to date review of the city's ordinances.
Following this preface is an outline of the ordinance adoption procedures,
if any, prescribed by the city's charter.
The code has been arranged and prepared in loose-leaf form to facilitate
keeping it up to date. MTAS will provide updating service under the following
conditions:
(1) That all ordinances relating to subjects treated in the code or which
should be added to the code are adopted as amending, adding, or deleting
specific chapters or sections of the code (see section 7 of the adopting ordinance).
(2) That one copy of every ordinance adopted by the city is kept in a
separate ordinance book and forwarded to MTAS annually.
(3) That the city agrees to pay the annual update fee as provided in the
MTAS codification service charges policy in effect at the time of the update.
When the foregoing conditions are met MTAS will reproduce replacement
pages for the code to reflect the amendments and additions made by such
iii
ordinances. This service will be performed at least annually and more often if
justified by the volume of amendments. Replacement pages will be supplied
with detailed instructions for utilizing them so as again to make the code
complete and up to date.
The able assistance of the codes team: Kelley Myers and Nancy Gibson
is gratefully acknowledged.

officials and employees, whether compensated or not, including those of any
separate board, commission, committee, authority, corporation, or created by the
municipality. The words "municipal" and "municipality" include these separate
entities. (Ord. #211, Nov. 2006)
1-502. Definition of "personal interest." (1) For purposes of §§ 1-503
and 1-504, "personal interest" means:
(a) Any financial, ownership, or employment interest in the
subject of a vote by a municipal board not otherwise regulated by state
statutes on conflicts of interests; or
(b) Any financial, ownership, or employment interest in a
matter to be regulated or supervised; or

official or employee or designated family member is negotiating possible
employment with a person or organization that is the subject of the vote or that
is to be regulated or supervised.
(3) In any situation in which a personal interest is also a conflict of
interest under state law, the provisions of the state law take precedence over the
provisions of this chapter. (Ord. #211, Nov. 2006)
1-503. Disclosure of personal interest by official with vote. An
official with the responsibility to vote on a measure shall disclose during the
1-9
meeting at which the vote takes place, before the vote and so it appears in the
minutes, any personal interest that affects or that would lead a reasonable
person to infer that it affects the official's vote on the measure. In addition, the
official may recuse himself from voting on the measure. (Ord. #211, Nov. 2006)
1-504. Disclosure of personal interest in nonvoting matters. An
official or employee who must exercise discretion relative to any matter, other
than casting a vote, and who has a personal interest in the matter that affects
or that would lead a reasonable person to infer that it affects the exercise of the
discretion shall disclose, before the exercise of the discretion when possible, the
interest on a form provided by and filed with the recorder. In addition, the
official or employee may, to the extent allowed by law, charter, ordinance, or
policy, recuse himself from the exercise of discretion in the matter. (Ord. #211,
Nov. 2006)
1-505. Acceptance of gratuities, etc. An official or employee may not
accept, directly or indirectly, any money, gift, gratuity, or other consideration or
favor of any kind from anyone other than the municipality:
(1) For the performance of an act, or refraining from performance of
an act, that he would be expected to perform, or refrain from performing, in the
regular course of his duties; or
(2) That might reasonably be interpreted as an attempt to influence
his action, or reward him for past action, in executing municipal business. (Ord.
#211, Nov. 2006)
1-506. Use of information. (1) An official or employee may not disclose
any information obtained in his official capacity or position of employment that
is made confidential under state or federal law except as authorized by law.
(2) An official or employee may not use or disclose information
obtained in his official capacity or position of employment with the intent to
result in financial gain for himself or any other person or entity. (Ord. #211,
Nov. 2006)
1-507. Use of municipal time, facilities, etc. (1) An official or
employee may not use or authorize the use of municipal time, facilities,
equipment, or supplies for private gain or advantage to himself.
(2) An official or employee may not use or authorize the use of
municipal time, facilities, equipment, or supplies for private gain or advantage
to any private person or entity, except as authorized by legitimate contact or
lease that is determined by the governing body to be in the best interests of the
municipality. (Ord. #211, Nov. 2006)

not make or attempt to make private purchases, for cash or otherwise, in the
name of the municipality.

by the charter, general law, or ordinance or policy of municipality. (Ord. #211,
Nov. 2006)
1-509. Outside employment. An official or employee may not accept or
continue any outside employment if the work unreasonably inhibits the
performance of any affirmative duty of the municipal position or conflicts with
any provision of the municipality's charter or any ordinance or policy. (Ord.
#211, Nov. 2006)
1-510. Ethics complaints. (1) The city attorney is designated as the
ethics officer of the municipality. Upon the written request of an official or
employee potentially affected by a provision of this chapter, the city attorney
may render an oral or written advisory ethics opinion based upon this chapter
and other applicable law.
(2) (a) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the city
attorney shall investigate any credible complaint against an appointed
official or employee charging any violation of this charter, or may
undertake an investigation on his own initiative when he acquires
information indicating a possible violation and recommendations for
action to end or seek retribution for any activity that, in the attorney's
judgment, constitutes a violation of this code of ethics.
(b) The city attorney may request that the governing body hire
another attorney, individual, or entity to act as ethics officer when he has
or will have a conflict of interests in a particular matter.
(c) When a complaint of a violation of any provision of this
chapter is lodged against a member of the municipality's governing body,
the governing body shall either determine that the complaint does not
have merit, or determine that the complaint has sufficient merit to
warrant further investigation. If the governing body determines that a
complaint warrants further investigation, it shall authorize an
investigation by the city attorney or another individual or entity chosen
by the governing body.
(3) The interpretation that a reasonable person in the circumstances
would apply shall be used in interpreting and enforcing this code of ethics.
(4) When a violation of this code of ethics also constitutes a violation
of a personnel policy, rule, or regulation or a civil service policy, rule, or
regulation, the violation shall be dealt with as a violation of the personnel or
civil service provisions rather than as a violation of this code of ethics. (Ord.
#211, Nov. 2006)
1-11
1-511. Violations. An elected official or appointed member of a separate
municipal board, commission, committee, authority, corporation, or other
instrumentality who violates any provision of this chapter is subject to
punishment as provided by the municipality's charter or other applicable law
and in addition is subject to censure by the governing body. An appointed official
or an employee who violates any provision of this chapter is subject to
disciplinary action. (Ord. #211, Nov. 2006)
1-12
CHAPTER 6
PUBLIC INSPECTION OF, ACCESS TO, AND DUPLICATION
OF PUBLIC RECORDS
SECTION
1-601. Procedures regarding access to an inspection of public records.
1-601. Procedures regarding access to an inspection of public
records. (1) Consistent with the Public Records Act of the State of Tennessee,
personnel of the City of Clifton shall provide full access and assistance in a
timely and efficient manner to Tennessee residents who request access to public
documents.
(2) Employees of the City of Clifton shall protect the integrity and
organization of public records with respect to the manner in which the records
are inspected and copied. All inspections of records must be performed under the
supervision of the city recorder or designee. All copying of public records must
be performed by employees of the city, or, in the event that city personnel are
unable to copy the records, by an entity or person designated by the city
recorder.
(3) To prevent excessive disruptions of the work, essential functions,
and duties of employees of the City of Clifton, persons requesting inspection
and/or copying of public records are requested to complete a records request
form to be furnished by the city. If the requesting party refuses to complete a
request form, a city employee shall complete the form with the information
provided by the requesting party. Persons requesting access to open public
records shall describe the records with specificity so that the records may be
located and made available for public inspection or duplication, as provided in
subsection (2) above. All requests for public records shall be directed to the city
recorder.
(4) When records are requested for inspection or copying, the city
recorder has up to seven (7) business days to determine whether the city can
retrieve the records requested and whether the requested records contain any
confidential information, and the estimated charge for copying based upon the
number of copies and amount of time required. Within seven (7) business days
of a request for records the city recorder shall:
(a) Produce the records requested;
(b) Deny the records in writing, giving explanation for denial;
or
(c) In the case of voluminous requests, provide, in writing, the
requester with an estimated time frame for production and an estimation
of duplication costs.
1-13
(5) There is no charge assessed to a requester for inspecting a public
record. Charges for physical copies of records, in accordance with the Office of
Open Records Counsel (OORC) schedule of reasonable charges, are as follows:
(a) Standard 8 1/2 x 11 or 8 1/2 x 14 black and white copy -
fifteen cents ($.15) per page for each produced.
(b) Standard 8 1/2 x 11 or 8 1/2 x14 color copy- fifteen cents
($.15) per page for each produced.
(c) Accident reports - fifteen cents ($.15) per page for each
standard 8 1/2 x 11 or 8 1/2 x14 black and white copy produced.
(d) Maps, plats, electronic data, audio discs, video discs, and all
other materials shall be duplicated at actual costs to the city.
(6) Requests requiring less than one (1) hour of municipal employee
labor for research, retrieval, redaction and duplication will not result in an
assessment of labor charges to the requester. Employee labor in excess of one (1)
hour may be charged to the requester, in addition to the cost per copy, as
provided in subsection (5). The city may require payment in advance of
producing any request. Requests for copies of records may not be broken down
to multiple requests for the same information in order to qualify for the first free
hour.
(a) For a request requiring more than one (1) employee to
complete, labor charges will be assessed based on the following formula:
In calculating the charge for labor, a department head shall determine
the number of hours each employee spent producing a request. The
department head shall then subtract the one (1) hour threshold from the
number of hours the highest paid employee(s) spent producing the
request. The department head will then multiply total number of hours
to be charged for the labor of each employee by that employee's hourly
wage. Finally, the department head will add together the totals for all the
employees involved in the request and that will be the total amount of
labor that can be charged.
(2) When the total number of requests made by a requester
within a calendar month exceeds four (4), the requests will be aggregated,
and the requester shall charge a fee for any and all labor that is
reasonably necessary to produce the copies of the requested records after
informing the requester that the aggregation limit has been met. Request
for items that are routinely released and readily accessible, such as
agendas for current calendar month meetings and approved minutes from
meetings held in the previous calendar month, shall not be counted in the
aggregated requests.
(7) If the city is assessed a charge to retrieve the requested records
from archives or any other entity having possession of requested records, the
city recorder may assess the requester the cost assessed to the city.
(8) Upon completion of a records request the requester may pick up the
copies of records at the office of the city recorder. Alternatively, the requester
1-14
may choose to have the copies of records delivered via United States Postal
Service; provided that the requester pays all related expenses in advance.
(9) The police chief shall maintain in his office records of undercover
investigators containing personally identifying information. All other personnel
records of the police department shall be maintained in the office of the city
recorder. Requests for personnel records, other than for undercover

hearing is held by the board after reasonable notice to all the known parties in
interest. Revocation or suspension proceedings may be initiated by the police
chief or by any member of the beer board.
Where a permit is revoked, no new permit shall be issued to permit the
sale of beer on the same premises until after the expiration of one (1) year from
the date the revocation becomes final and effective. The board, in its discretion,
may determine that issuance of a permit before the expiration of one (1) year
from the date of revocation becomes final is appropriate, if the individual
applying for such issuance is not the original holder of the permit or any family
member who could inherit from such individual under the statute of intestate
succession.
(2) No permit or license shall be revoked on the grounds the operator
or any person working for the operator sells beer to a minor over the age of
eighteen (18) years if such minor exhibits an identification, false or otherwise,
indicating the minor's age to be twenty-one (21) or over, if the minor's
appearance as to maturity is such that the minor might reasonably be presumed
to be of such age and is unknown to such person making the sale. The license
8-8
or permit may be suspended for a period not to exceed ten (10) days or a civil
penalty up to one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500.00) may be imposed
pursuant to § 8-117.
(3) The action of the beer board in connection with the issuance of any
order of any kind, including the revocation or suspension of a permit, imposition
of a civil penalty or the refusal to grant a permit under this chapter, may be
reviewed by statutory writ of certiorari, with a trial de novo as a substitute for
an appeal, the petition of certiorari to be addressed to the circuit or chancery
court of Wayne County.
(4) Pursuant to Tennessee Code Annotated, § 57-5-608, the beer board
shall not revoke or suspend the permit of a "responsible vendor" qualified under
the requirements of Tennessee Code Annotated, § 57-5-606 for a clerk's illegal
sale of beer to a minor if the clerk is properly certified and has attended annual
meetings since the clerk's original certification, unless the vendor's status as a
certified responsible·vendor has been revoked by the alcoholic beverage
commission. If the responsible vendor's certification has been revoked, the
vendor shall be punished by the beer board as if the vendor were not certified
as a responsible vendor. "Clerk" means any person working in a capacity to sell
beer directly to consumers for off-premises consumption. Under Tennessee Code
Annotated, § 57-5-608, the alcoholic beverage commission shall revoke a
vendor's status as a responsible vendor upon notification by the beer board that
the board has made a final determination that the vendor has sold beer to a
minor for the second time in a consecutive twelve (12) month period. The
revocation shall be for three (3) years. (1999 Code, § 8-116, as amended by Ord.
#213, Aug. 2007)
8-117. Civil penalty in lieu of suspension. (1) Definition. "Responsible
vendor" means a person, corporation or other entity that has been issued a
permit to sell beer for off-premises consumption and has received certification
by the Tennessee Alcoholic Beverage Commission under the Tennessee
Responsible Vendor Act of 2006, Tennessee Code Annotated, § 57-5-601, et seq.
(2) Penalty, revocation or suspension. The beer board may, at the time
tt imposes a revocation or suspension, offer a permit holder that is not a
responsible vendor the alternative of paying a civil penalty not to exceed two
thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00) for each offense of making or
permitting to be made any sales to minors, or a civil penalty not to exceed one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00) for any other offense. The beer board may impose
on a responsible vendor a civil penalty not to exceed one thousand dollars
($1,000.00) for each offense of making or permitting to be made any sales to
minors or for any other offense.
If a civil penalty is offered as an alternative to revocation or suspension,
the holder shall have seven (7) days within which to pay the civil penalty before
the revocation or suspension shall be imposed. If the civil penalty is paid within
that time, the revocation or suspension shall be deemed withdrawn.
8-9
Payment of the civil penalty in lieu of revocation or suspension by a
permit holder shall be an admission by the holder of the violation so charged
and shall be paid to the exclusion of any other penalty that the city may impose.
(Ord. #213, Aug. 2007)
8-118. Loss of clerk's certification for sale to minor. If the beer
board determines that a clerk of an off-premises beer permit holder certified
under Tennessee Code Annotated, § 57-5-606, sold beer to a minor, the beer
board shall report the name of the clerk to the alcoholic beverage commission
within fifteen (15) days of determination of the sale. The certification of the clerk
shall be invalid and the clerk may not reapply for a new certificate for a period
of one (1) year from the date of the beer board's determination. (Ord. #213, Aug.
2007)
8-119. Violations and penalty. Except as provided in § 8-117, any
violation of this chapter shall constitute a civil offense and shall, upon
conviction, be punishable under the general penalty provision of this code. Each
day a violation shall be allowed to continue shall constitute a separate offense.

the gas piping or system in such building to the gas system, unless the same has
been installed by a qualified installing agency as defined and provided for in this
chapter, provided however a homeowner can install gas appliances, pipe, and
equipment in their own residence, but same must be inspected, tested and
approved by the gas inspector before service is commenced.
(12) No property owner shall cause or permit any installation,
modification, change to, conversion, or repair of any gas house piping or gas
appliances, as hereinabove provided, in the City of Clifton, or in its gas service
territory or receiving gas from the gas system of the City of Clifton unless such
person, firm, or corporation is a duly qualified installing agency as herein
provided and defined, and the fact that such work has been done by other than
an authorized installing agency, qualified as herein provided, shall be sufficient
to hold and render the property owner responsible for the violation of this
chapter and amenable to all provisions of the same.
(13) Penalty. It is hereby declared a misdemeanor and punishable by
a fine of not more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) and less than twenty-five

that such agency is engaged in the business of installing and repairing the work
contemplated by this chapter shall be deemed a separate offense. Any property
owner in violation of the same shall be liable for the same penalties. (1999

herein provided.
The city recorder and the gas inspector shall act upon all applications for
permits within a reasonable time and without unreasonable or unnecessary
delay and within a maximum of ten (10) days. Any permit issued shall be
construed as a license to proceed with the work and shall not be construed as
authority to violate, cancel, alter, or set aside any of the provisions of this
chapter or the gas code herein before adopted, nor shall such issuance of a
permit prevent the gas inspector or his duly authorized representative, from
thereafter requiring correction of errors in the permit or plan submitted with it,
or in the construction authorized by the permit.
(3) Upon notice from the gas inspector that work on any gas
installation is being done contrary to the provisions of the gas code, or this

that the same be confirmed in writing within a reasonable time.
The gas inspector, the city recorder, and/or the board of city
commissioners, may revoke a permit issued under the provisions of this chapter,
in case there has been any false statement or representation as to a material
fact in the application for the permit or in the plans submitted therewith. (1999

stop.
(2) It shall be unlawful and a misdemeanor for any person to trespass
upon, injure, molest, deface, damage, destroy, or carry away any portion of the

or corporation to violate any of the foregoing provisions of this chapter and each
days violation shall be considered a separate offense. Upon conviction for the
violation of the foregoing provisions of this chapter, the offender or offenders
shall be fined not less than twenty-five dollars ($25.00) nor more than fifty

as may be fixed by the gas inspector for the service pipe from the property line
to the point of delivery; provided, however, that during the time of the initial
construction of the gas distribution system, the City of Clifton will pay for the
first one hundred feet (100') of service pipe from the property line to the point
of delivery but in no event will the City of Clifton pay for or furnish and install
more than one hundred feet (100') and in the event the distance from the
property line to the nearest corner of the building to be served is less than one
hundred feet (100'), then the lesser of the two (2) distances shall determine the
city's obligation. The consumer will pay for all service pipe in excess of one
hundred feet (100').
The gas service pipe, the meter, and the meter box shall at all times
remain the property of the City of Clifton, and upon the discontinuance of gas
service to any premises by reason of the failure to pay the bills by the consumer
for gas service, or for any other reason, then the City of Clifton, through the gas
inspector or his representative, may remove the meter, regulators, the meter

provided so as to protect the City of Clifton and the gas system from loss.
The charges herein provided shall be paid, as before stated, at the time
when service is established to each consumer, and no service shall be
established to a consumer until the appropriate charges herein provided have
been paid. In the event service is discontinued to any consumer and the charges

by the consumer by applying the same to the bills; the consumer shall be liable
for the difference, and no gas shall be furnished to any person or consumer at

fails to comply with an order, as specified above, to remove or demolish the
structure, the public officer may cause such structure to be removed and
demolished.
13-208. Lien for expenses; sale of salvaged materials; other
powers not limited. The amount of the cost of such repairs, alterations or
improvements, or vacating and closing, or removal or demolition by the public
officer, as well as reasonable fees for registration, inspections and professional
evaluations of the property, shall be assessed against the owner of the property,
and shall, upon the certification of the sum owed being presented to the
municipal tax collector, be a lien on the property in favor of the municipality,
second only to liens of the state, county and municipality for taxes, any lien of
the municipality for special assessments, and any valid lien, right, or interest
in such property duly recorded or duly perfected by filing, prior to the filing of
such notice. These costs shall be collected by the municipal tax collector or
county trustee at the same time and in the same manner as property taxes are
collected. If the owner fails to pay the costs, they may be collected at the same
time and in the same manner as delinquent property taxes are collected and
shall be subject to the same penalty and interest as delinquent property taxes
as set forth in Tennessee Code Annotated, § 67-5-2010 and § 67-5-2410. In
addition, the municipality may collect the costs assessed against the owner
13-7
through an action for debt filed in any court of competent jurisdiction. The
municipality may bring one (1) action for debt against more than one (1) or all
of the owners of properties against whom said costs have been assessed, and the
fact that multiple owners have been joined in one (1) action shall not be
considered by the court as a misjoinder of parties. If the structure is removed

power of the City of Clifton to define and declare nuisances and to cause their
removal or abatement, by summary proceedings or otherwise.
13-209. Basis for a finding of unfitness. The public officer defined
herein shall have the power and may determine that a structure is unfit for
human occupation and use if he finds that conditions exist in such structure
which are dangerous or injurious to the health, safety or morals of the occupants
or users of such structure, the occupants or users of neighboring structures or
other residents of the City of Clifton. Such conditions may include the following
(without limiting the generality of the foregoing): defects therein increasing the
hazards of fire, accident, or other calamities; lack of adequate ventilation, light,
or sanitary facilities; dilapidation; disrepair; structural defects; or uncleanliness.
13-210. Service of complaints or orders. Complaints or orders issued
by the public officer pursuant to this chapter shall be served upon persons,
either personally or by registered mail, but if the whereabouts of such persons
are unknown and the same cannot be ascertained by the public officer in the
exercise of reasonable diligence, and the public officer shall make an affidavit
to that effect, then the serving of such complaint or order upon such persons
may be made by publishing the same once each week for two (2) consecutive
weeks in a newspaper printed and published in the city. In addition, a copy of
such complaint or order shall be posted in a conspicuous place on premises
affected by the complaint or order. A copy of such complaint or order shall also
be filed for record in the Register's Office of Wayne County, Tennessee, and such
filing shall have the same force and effect as other lis pendens notices provided
by law.
13-211. Enjoining enforcement of orders. Any person affected by an
order issued by the public officer served pursuant to this chapter may file a bill
in chancery court for an injunction restraining the public officer from carrying
out the provisions of the order, and the court may, upon the filing of such suit,
issue a temporary injunction restraining the public officer pending the final
13-8
disposition of the cause; provided, however, that within sixty (60) days after the
posting and service of the order of the public officer, such person shall file such
bill in the court.
The remedy provided herein shall be the exclusive remedy and no person
affected by an order of the public officer shall be entitled to recover any damages
for action taken pursuant to any order of the public officer, or because of
noncompliance by such person with any order of the public officer.
13-212. Additional powers of public officer. The public officer, in
order to carry out and effectuate the purposes and provisions of this chapter,
shall have the following powers in addition to those otherwise granted herein:
(1) To investigate conditions of the structures in the city in order to
determine which structures therein are unfit for human occupation or use;
(2) To administer oaths, affirmations, examine witnesses and receive
evidence;
(3) To enter upon premises for the purpose of making examination,
provided that such entry shall be made in such manner as to cause the least
possible inconvenience to the persons in possession;
(4) To appoint and fix the duties of such officers, agents and employees
as he deems necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter; and
(5) To delegate any of his functions and powers under this chapter to
such officers and agents as he may designate.
13-213. Powers conferred are supplemental. This chapter shall not
be construed to abrogate or impair the powers of the city with regard to the
enforcement of the provisions of its charter or any other ordinances or
regulations, nor to prevent or punish violations thereof, and the powers
conferred by this chapter shall be in addition and supplemental to the powers
conferred by the charter and other laws.
13-214. Structures unfit for human habitation deemed unlawful.
It shall be unlawful for any owner of record to create, maintain or permit to be
maintained in the city structures which are unfit for human occupation due to
dilapidation, defects increasing the hazards of fire, accident or other calamities,
lack of ventilation, light or sanitary facilities, or due to other conditions
rendering such dwellings unsafe or unsanitary, or dangerous or detrimental to
the health, safety and morals, or otherwise inimical to the welfare of the
residents of the city.
Violations of this section shall subject the offender to a penalty under the
general penalty provision of this code. Each day a violation is allowed to
continue shall constitute a separate offense.

14-204. Administration.
14-205. Provisions for flood hazard reduction.
14-206. Variance procedures.
14-207. Legal status provisions.
14-201. Statutory authorization, findings of fact, and objectives.
(1) Statutory authorization. The General Assembly of the State of
Tennessee has in Private Act 1961, Chapter 36, delegated the responsibility to
units of local government to adopt regulations designed to promote the public
health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the Clifton,
Tennessee Board of Commissioners does ordain the following.
(2) Findings of fact. (a) The Clifton mayor and legislative body wishes
to maintain eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program and in
order to do so must meet the requirements of 60.3 of the Federal
Insurance Administration Regulations found at 44 CFR ch. 1 (10-1-04
edition).
(b) Areas of Clifton are subject to periodic inundation which
could result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general
welfare.
(c) Flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains, causing increases in flood heights and
velocities; by uses in flood hazard areas which are vulnerable to floods; or
construction which is inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise
unprotected from flood damages.
(2) Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this ordinance to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to minimize public
and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas. This ordinance is
designed to:
14-4
(a) Restrict or prohibit uses which are vulnerable to flooding or
erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion, flood
heights, or velocities;
(b) Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including community
facilities, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
(c) Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream
channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the
accommodation floodwaters;
(d) Control filling, grading, dredging and other development
which may increase flood damage or erosion; and
(e) Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards
to other lands.
(3) Objectives. The objectives of this ordinance are:
(a) To protect human life, health and property;
(b) To minimize expenditure of public funds for costly flood
control projects;
(c) To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated
with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general
public;
(d) To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
(e) To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as
water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and
bridges located in floodable areas;
(f) To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the
sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to
minimize blight in flood areas;
(g) To ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that
property is in a floodable area; and
(h) To maintain eligibility for participation in the National
Flood Insurance Program.

boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard (for example, where there
appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field
conditions) the administrator shall make the necessary interpretation.
Any person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in this
ordinance.
(i) When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not
been provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency then the
administrator shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood
elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other
sources, including data developed as a result of these regulations, as
criteria for requiring that new construction, substantial improvements,
or other development in Zone A on the community FIRM meet the
requirements of this ordinance.
Within unnumbered A zones, where base flood elevations have not
been established and where alternative data is not available, the
administrator shall require the lowest floor of a building to be elevated
or floodproofed to a level of at least three feet (3') above the highest
adjacent grade (lowest floor and highest adjacent grade being defined in
§ 14-202 of this chapter). All applicable data including elevations or flood
proofing certifications shall be recorded as set forth in § 14-204(2).

§ 14-202 of this chapter). All applicable data including elevations or flood
proofing certifications shall be recorded as set forth in § 14-204(2).
Buildings located in all A-zones may be flood-proofed, in lieu of
being elevated, provided that all areas of the building below the required
elevation are watertight, with walls substantially impermeable to the
passage of water, and are built with structural components having the
capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects
of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify
that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with
accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall
provide such certification to the administrator as set forth in § 14-204(2).
(c) Elevated building. All new construction or substantial
improvements to existing buildings that include any fully enclosed areas
formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the base flood
elevation, or required height above the highest adjacent grade, shall be
designed to preclude finished living space and designed to allow for the
14-18
entry and exit of flood waters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood
forces on exterior walls.
(i) Designs for complying with this requirement must
either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet
the following minimum criteria.

than one foot (1') above the finish grade; and
(C) Openings may be equipped with screens,
louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they
permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions.
(ii) Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum
necessary to allow for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited
storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the
premises (standard exterior door) or entry to the elevated living
area (stairway or elevator); and
(iii) The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be
partitioned or finished into separate rooms in such a way as to
impede the movement of floodwaters and all such petitions shall
comply with the provisions of § 14-205(2) of this chapter.
(d) Standards for manufactured homes and recreational
vehicles.
(i) All manufactured homes placed, or substantially
improved, on:
(A) Individual lots or parcels;
(B) In expansions to existing manufactured home
parks or subdivisions; or
(C) In new or substantially improved
manufactured home parks or subdivisions, must meet all
the requirements of new construction, including elevations
and anchoring.
(ii) All manufactured homes placed or substantially
improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision
must be elevated so that either:
(A) When base flood elevations are available the
lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated on a
permanent foundation no lower than one foot (1') above the
level of the base flood elevation; or,
(B) Absent base flood elevations the manufactured
home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers
(or other foundation elements) at least three feet (3') in
height above the highest adjacent grade.
14-19
(iii) Any manufactured home, which has incurred
"substantial damage" as the result of a flood or that has
substantially improved, must meet the standards of § 14-205(2)(d)
of this chapter.
(iv) All manufactured homes must be securely anchored
to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation,
collapse and lateral movement.
(v) All recreational vehicles placed on identified flood
hazard sites must either:
(A) Be on the site for fewer than one hundred
eighty (180) consecutive days;
(B) Be fully licensed and ready for highway use.
(A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is
licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the
site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security
devices, and has no permanently attached structures or
additions.)
(C) The recreational vehicle must meet all the
requirements for new construction, including the anchoring
and elevation requirements of this section above if on the
site for longer than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive
days.
(e) Standards for subdivisions. Subdivisions and other proposed
new developments, including manufactured home parks, shall be
reviewed to determine whether such proposals will be reasonably safe
from flooding. If a subdivision proposal or other proposed new
development is in a flood-prone area, any such proposals shall be
reviewed to ensure that:
(i) All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the
need to minimize flood damage.
(ii) All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities
and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems
located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage.
(iii) All subdivision proposals shall have adequate
drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards.
(iv) Base flood elevation data shall be provided for
subdivision proposals and other proposed developments (including
manufactured home parks and subdivisions) that are greater than
fifty (50) lots and/or five (5) acres in area.
(3) Standards for areas of special flood hazard with established base
flood elevations and with floodways designated. Located within the areas of
special flood hazard established in § 14-203(2), are areas designated as
floodways. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity
of floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain
14-20
free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without
increased flood heights and velocities. Therefore, the following provisions shall
apply:
(a) Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill
material, new construction, substantial improvements or other
developments within the regulatory floodway. Development may be
permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and
hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering
practices that the cumulative effect of the proposed encroachments or
new development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated
development, shall not result in any increase the water surface elevation
of the base flood level, velocities or floodway widths during the occurrence
of a base flood discharge at any point within the community. A registered
professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and
certification thereof.
(b) New construction or substantial improvements of buildings
shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of § 14-
205.
(4) Standards for areas of special flood hazard Zones AE with
established base flood elevations but without floodways designated. Located
within the areas of special flood hazard established in§ 14-203(2), where streams
exist with base flood data provided but where no floodways have been
designated, (Zones AE) the following provisions apply:
(a) No encroachments, including fill material, new structures
or substantial improvements shall be located within areas of special flood
hazard, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is
provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed
development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated
development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base
flood more than one foot (1') at any point within the community. The
engineering certification should be supported by technical data that
conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles.
(b) New construction or substantial improvements of buildings
shall be elevated or flood-proofed to elevations established in accordance
with § 14-205(2).
(5) Standards for streams without established base flood elevations or
floodways (A Zones). Located within the areas of special flood hazard
established in § 14-203, where streams exist, but no base flood data has been
provided (A Zones), or where a floodway has not been delineated, the following
provisions shall apply:
(a) When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not
been provided in accordance with § 14-203, then the administrator shall
obtain, review and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood
elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state or other
14-21
source, in order to administer the provisions of § 14-205. Only if data is
not available from these sources, then the following provisions (b) and (c)
shall apply.
(b) No encroachments, including structures or fill material,
shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or twenty
feet (20'), whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream
bank, unless certification by registered professional engineer is provided
demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development,
when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will
not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one
foot (1') at any point within the community. The engineering certification
should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard
hydraulic engineering principles.
(c) In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation
data, new construction or substantial improvements of existing shall have
the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated
no less than three feet (3') above the highest adjacent grade at the
building site. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements
of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with the standards of § 14-
205(2), and "elevated buildings."
(6) Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO and AH Zones).
Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in § 14-203(2), are
areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have special flood
hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet (1' - 3') where a
clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate; therefore, the following provisions apply:
(a) All new construction and substantial improvements of
residential and non-residential buildings shall have the lowest floor,
including basement, elevated to at least one foot (1') above the flood depth
number specified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), in feet, above
the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the
lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated, at least three feet (3')
above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the
unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance
with standards of § 14-205(2), and "elevated buildings."
(b) All new construction and substantial improvements of
nonresidential buildings may be flood-proofed in lieu of elevation. The
structure together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities must be
flood proofed and designed watertight to be completely flood-proofed to at
least one foot (1') above the specified FIRM flood level, with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy. If no depth number is
specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be flood proofed to
14-22
at least three feet (3') above the highest adjacent grade. A registered
professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and
methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of
practice for meeting the provisions of this ordinance and shall provide
such certification to the administrator as set forth above and as required
in § 14-204(2).
(c) Adequate drainage paths shall be provided around slopes to
guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.
(d) The administrator shall certify the elevation or the highest
adjacent grade, where applicable, and the record shall become a
permanent part of the permit file.
(7) Standards for areas protected by flood protection system (A-99
Zones). Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in § 14-203
are areas of the 100-year floodplain protected by a flood protection system but
where base flood elevations and flood hazard factors have not been determined.
Within these areas (A-99 Zones) all provisions of §§ 14-204 and 14-205(1) shall
apply.
(8) Standards for unmapped streams. Located within Clifton,
Tennessee are unmapped streams where areas of special flood hazard are
neither indicated nor identified. Adjacent to such streams the following
provisions shall apply:
(a) In areas adjacent to such unmapped streams, no
encroachments including fill material or structures shall be located
within an area of at least equal to twice the width of the stream,
measured from the top of each stream bank, unless certification by a
registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the
cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all
other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water
surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot (1') at any point
within the locality.
(b) When new elevation data is available, new construction or
substantial improvements of buildings shall be elevated or flood proofed
to elevations established in accordance with § 14-204.
14-206. Variance procedures. (1) Board of floodplain review.

not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure and the variance is the minimum to
preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
(C) In passing upon such applications, the board of
floodplain review shall consider all technical evaluations, all
relevant factors, all standards specified in other sections of
this ordinance, and:
(1) The danger that materials may be swept
onto other property to the injury of others;
(2) The danger to life and property due to
flooding or erosion;
14-24
(3) The susceptibility of the proposed
facility and its contents to flood damage;

waterfront location, in the case of a functionally
dependent facility;
(6) The availability of alternative locations,
not subject to flooding or erosion damage, for the
proposed use;
(7) The relationship of the proposed use to
the comprehensive plan and floodplain management
program for that area;
(8) The safety of access to the property in
times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;
(9) The expected heights, velocity, duration,

review may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to effectuate the purposes
of this ordinance.
(B) Variances shall not be issued within any
designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during
the base flood discharge would result.
(2) Conditions for variances. (a) Variances shall be issued upon a
determination that the variance is the minimum relief necessary,
considering the flood hazard; and in the instance of a historical building,
a determination that the variance is the minimum relief necessary so as
not to destroy the historic character and design of the building.
(b) Variances shall only be issued upon: a showing of good and
sufficient cause, a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship; or a determination that the granting of a
variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to
public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud
on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or
ordinances.
14-25
(c) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the issuance of a variance to construct a structure
below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood
insurance, and that such construction below the base flood level increases
risks to life and property.
(d) The administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal
actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency upon request.
14-207. Legal status provisions. (1) Conflict with other ordinances.

are hereby created and established certain zones, which include all of the land
lying beneath the approach surface, transitional surfaces, horizontal surface,
and conical surface as they apply to Hassell Field. Such zones are shown on a
zoning map and the Airport Layout Drawing (ALD), which is attached to this
chapter as Attachment A1 and made a part hereof. An area located in more than
one (1) of the following zones is considered to be only in the zone with the more
restrictive height limitations. The various zones are hereby established and
defined as follows:

beneath the approach surface at the end of Runway 2 on Hassell Field for
visual landings and takeoffs. The inner edge of the approach zone shall
have a width of two hundred fifty feet (250') which coincides with the
width of the primary surface at the north end of the primary surface,
widening thereafter uniformly to a width of one thousand five hundred
feet (1,250') at horizontal distance of five thousand feet (5,000') beyond
the end of the primary surface, its centerline being continuation of the
centerline of the primary surface.
(b) Runway 20 approach zone is established beneath the
approach surface at the end of Runway 20 on Hassell Field for visual
landings and takeoffs. The inner edge of the approach zone shall have a
width of two hundred fifty feet (250') which coincides with the width of
the primary surface at the south end of the primary surface, widening
thereafter uniformly to a width of one thousand two hundred fifty feet
(1,250') at a horizontal distance of five thousand feet (5,000') beyond the
end of the primary surface, its centerline being the continuation of the
centerline of the primary surface.
(2) Transitional zones. Transitional zones are hereby established
beneath the transitional surface adjacent to each runway and approach surface
as indicated on the zoning map.
(3) Horizontal zone. The area beneath a horizontal plane one hundred
fifty feet (150') above the established airport elevation, the perimeter of which
is constructed by swinging arcs of five thousand feet (5,000') radii from the
center of each end of the primary surface of runway(s) 2 and 20 and connecting
the adjacent arcs by lines tangent to those arcs.
(4) Conical zone. The area beneath the conical surface extending
outward and upward from the periphery of the horizontal surface at a slope of

14-42
20:1 for a horizontal distance of four thousand feet (4,000'). (Ord. #242, July
2013)
14-504. Height limitations. Except as otherwise provided in this
chapter, no structure shall be erected, altered, or maintained and no tree shall
be allowed to grow in any zone created by this chapter to a height in excess of
the applicable height limit herein established for such zone. Such applicable
height limitations are hereby established for each of the zones in question as
follows:
(1) Approach zones. (a) Runway 2: One foot (1') in height for each
twenty feet (20') in horizontal distance beginning at the end of and at the
elevation of the primary surface and extending to a point five thousand
feet (5,000') from the end of the primary surface.
(b) Runway 20: One foot (1') in height for each twenty feet (20')
in horizontal distance beginning at the end of and at the elevation of the
primary surface and extending to a point five thousand feet (5,000') from
the end of the primary surface.
(2) Transitional zones. Slope seven feet (7') outward for each foot
upward beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the primary
surface and the approach surface, and extending to a height of one hundred fifty
(150') above the airport elevation which is four hundred one feet (401') above
mean sea level. In addition to the foregoing, there are established height limits
sloping seven feet (7') outward for each foot upward beginning at the sides of
and at the same elevation as the approach surface, and extending to where they
intersect the conical surface.
(3) Horizontal zone. Established at one hundred fifty feet (150') above
the airport elevation, or a height of five hundred fifty-one feet (551') above the
mean sea level.
(4) Conical zone. Slope twenty feet (20') outward for each foot upward
beginning at the periphery of the horizontal zone and at one hundred fifty feet
(150') above the airport elevation and extending to a height of three hundred
fifty feet (350') above the airport elevation.
(5) Excepted height limitations. Nothing in this chapter shall be
constructed as prohibiting the construction or maintenance of any structure, or
growth of any tree to a height up to fifty feet (50') above the surface of the land.
(Ord. #242, July 2013)
14-505. Use restrictions. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this
chapter, no use may be made of land or water within any zone established by
this chapter in such a manner as to create electrical interference with
navigational signals or radio communication between airport and aircraft, make
it difficult for pilots to distinguish between airport lights and others, result in
glare in the eyes of pilots using the airport, impair visibility in the vicinity of the
airport, create bird strike hazards, or otherwise in any way endanger or
14-43
interfere with the landing, taking-off, or maneuvering of aircraft intending to
use the airport. (Ord. #242, July 2013)
14-506. Nonconforming uses. (1) Regulations not retroactive. The
regulations described by this chapter shall not be construed to require the
removal, lowering, or other change or alteration of any structure or tree not
conforming to the relations as of July 2013, the effective date of this chapter, or
otherwise interfere with the continuance of any nonconforming use. Nothing
herein contained shall require any change in the construction, alteration, or
intended use of any structure, the construction or alteration of which was begun
prior to the effective date of this chapter and which has been diligently
prosecuted.
(2) Marking and lighting. Notwithstanding the preceding provision of
this section, the owner of any nonconforming structure or tree is hereby required
to permit the installation, operation, and maintenance thereon of such markers
and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the Clifton Airport Authority to
indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport, the presence of
such airport hazards. Such markers and lights shall be installed, operated, and
maintained at the expense of the Clifton Airport Authority. Except as indicated,
all applications or such a permit will be granted. (Ord. #242, July 2013)
14-507. Permits. (1) Future uses. Except as specifically provided in (a),
(b), and (c) hereunder, no material change shall be made in the use of land, no
structure shall be erected or otherwise established, and no tree shall be planted
in any zone hereby created unless a permit therefor shall have been applied for
and granted. Each application for a permit shall indicate the purpose for which
the permit is desired, with sufficient particularity to permit it to be determined
whether the resulting use, structure, or tree would conform to the regulations
herein prescribed. If such determination is in the affirmative, the permit shall
be granted. No permit for a use inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter
shall be granted unless a variance has been approved in accordance with
§ 14-507(4).
(a) In the area lying within the limits of the horizontal zone and
conical zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less
than seventy-five feet (75') of vertical height above the ground, except
when, because of terrain, land contour, or topographic features, such tree
or structure would extend above the height limits prescribed for such
zones.
(b) In areas lying within the limits of the approach zones, but
at a horizontal distance of not less than four thousand two hundred feet
(4,200') from each end of the runway no permit shall be required for any
tree or structure less than seventy-five feet (75') of vertical height above
the ground, except when such tree or structure would extend above the
height limit prescribed for such approach zones.
14-44
(c) In the areas lying within the limits of the transitional zones
beyond the perimeter of the horizontal zone, no permit shall be required
for any tree or structure less than seventy-five feet (75') of vertical height
above the ground, except when such tree or structure, because of terrain,
land contour, or topographic features, would extend above the height
limit prescribed for such transitional zones.
Nothing contained in any of the foregoing exceptions shall be construed as
permitting or intending to permit any construction or alteration of any structure
or growth of any tree in excess of any of the height limits established by this
chapter except as set forth in § 14-504(5).
(2) Existing uses. No permit shall be granted that would allow the
establishment or creation of any airport hazard or permit a nonconforming use,
structure, or tree to be made or become higher, or become a greater hazard to
air navigation, than it was on the effective date of this chapter or any
amendments hereto or than it is when the application for a permit is made.
(3) Nonconforming uses, abandoned or destroyed. Whenever the
Clifton Airport Authority and Clifton City Board of Commissioners determines
that a nonconforming structure or tree has been abandoned or more than eighty
percent (80%) torn down, physically deteriorated, or decayed, no permit shall be
granted that would allow such structure or tree to exceed the applicable height
limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning relations.
(4) Variances. Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of
any structure, or permit the growth of any tree or use his property in violation
of the regulations prescribed in this chapter, may apply to the city commission
for a variance from such regulations in question. The application for variance
shall be accompanied by a determination from the Federal Aviation
Administration as to the effect of the proposal on the operation of air navigation
facilities and the safe-efficient use of navigable airspace. Such variances shall
be allowed where it is duly found that a literal application or enforcement of the
relations will result in unnecessary hardship and the relief granted would not
be contrary to the public interest, but do substantial justice, and be in
accordance with the spirit of this chapter. Additionally, no application for
variance to the requirements of this chapter may be considered by the Clifton
Airport Authority or the city commission unless a copy of the application has
been furnished to the manager of Hassell Field for advice as to the aeronautical
effects of the variance. If the manager of Hassell Field does not respond to the
application within fifteen (15) days after receipt, the city commission may act
on its own to grant or deny said application.
(5) Obstruction marking and lighting. Any permit or variance granted,
if such action is deemed advisable by the Clifton Airport Authority or the city
commission to effectuate the purpose of this chapter and be reasonable in the
circumstances, may be so conditioned as to require the owner of the structure
or tree in question to allow the Clifton Airport Authority to install, operate, and
14-45
maintain, at the expense of the city, such markings and lights as may be
necessary. (Ord. #242, July 2013)
14-508. Enforcement. It shall be the duty of the City of Clifton to
administer and enforce the regulations prescribed herein. Applications for
permits shall be made to the Clifton Airport Authority upon a form published
for that purpose. Applications required by this chapter to be submitted to the
Clifton Airport Authority shall be promptly considered and granted or denied.
Applications for variance shall be made to the Clifton Airport Authority by filing
said application for variance determination. (Ord. #242, July 2013)
14-509. Appeals and judicial review. (1) Any person aggrieved by any
decision of the City of Clifton or the Clifton Airport Authority, the Clifton
Planning Commission or the Clifton City Board of Commissioners made in
administration of this chapter may appeal such decision to the Circuit Court of
Wayne County, Tennessee.
(2) All appeals hereunder must be taken within ten (10) days after
such ruling by filing a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The notice
of appeal shall forthwith be transmitted by the city recorder of the City of
Clifton to the clerk of the Circuit Court for Wayne County, Tennessee and shall
include papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was
taken.
(3) An appeal shall stay all activities in furtherance of the action by
the application and appeal in accordance with applicable law. (Ord. #242, July
2013)
14-510. Remedies. In case any building or structure is erected,
constructed, reconstructed, altered, repaired, converted or maintained or any
building, structure or land is used in violation of this chapter, the city
commission, in addition to other remedies, may institute any appropriate action
or proceedings to prevent, restrain, correct, or abate any such unlawful erection,
construction, reconstruction, alteration, repair, conversion, maintenance, or use,
to restrain, correct, or abate such violation, to prevent the occupancy of such
building, structure, or land, or to prevent any illegal act, conduct, business or
use in or about such premises. (Ord. #242, July 2013)
14-511. Conflicting regulations. (1) Where there exists a conflict
between any of the regulations or limitations prescribed in this chapter and any
other regulations applicable to the same area, whether the conflict be with
respect to the height of structures or trees, the use of land, or any other matter,
the terms and provisions of this chapter shall govern and prevail.
(2) If any of the provisions of this chapter or the application thereof to
any person or circumstance is held invalid, such invalidity shall not affect other
14-46
provisions or application, and to this end the provisions of this chapter are
declared to be severable. (Ord. #242, July 2013)

(4) Fats, oils and grease traps and interceptors. (a) Fat, Oil, and
Grease (FOG), waste food, and sand interceptors. FOG, waste food and
sand interceptors shall be installed when, in the opinion of the
superintendent, they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid
wastes containing fats, oils, and grease, any flammable wastes, ground
food waste, sand, soil, and solids, or other harmful ingredients in
excessive amount which impact the wastewater collection system. Such
interceptors shall not be required for single family residences, but may
be required on multiple family residences. All interceptors shall be of a
type and capacity approved by the superintendent, and shall be located
as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection.
(b) Fat, oil, grease, and food waste. (i) New construction and
renovation. Upon construction or renovation, all restaurants,
cafeterias, hotels, motels, hospitals, nursing homes, schools,
grocery stores, prisons, jails, churches, camps, caterers,
manufacturing plants and any other sewer users who discharge
applicable waste shall submit a FOG and food waste control plan
that will effectively control the discharge of FOG and food waste.
(ii) Existing structures. All existing restaurants,
cafeterias, hotels, motels, hospitals, nursing homes, schools,
grocery stores, prisons, jails, churches, camps, caterers,
manufacturing plants and any other sewer users who discharge
18-23
applicable waste shall be required to submit a plan for control of
FOG and food waste, if and when the superintendent determines
that FOG and food waste are causing excessive loading, plugging,
damage or potential problems to structures or equipment in the
public sewer system.
(iii) Implementation of plan. After approval of the FOG
plan by the superintendent the sewer user must:
(A) Implement the plan within a reasonable
amount of time;
(B) Service and maintain the equipment in order
to prevent impact upon the sewer collection system and
treatment facility. If in the opinion of the superintendent
the user continues to impact the collection system and
treatment plant, additional pretreatment may be required,
including a requirement to meet numeric limits and have
surcharges applied.
(c) Sand, soil, and oil interceptors. All car washes, truck
washes, garages, service stations and other sources of sand, soil, and oil
shall install effective sand, soil, and oil interceptors. These interceptors
shall be sized to effectively remove sand, soil, and oil at the expected flow
rates. The interceptors shall be cleaned on a regular basis to prevent
impact upon the wastewater collection and treatment system. Owners
whose interceptors are deemed to be ineffective by the superintendent
may be asked to change the cleaning frequency or to increase the size of
the interceptors. Owners or operators of washing facilities will prevent
the inflow of rainwater into the sanitary sewers.
(d) Laundries. Commercial laundries shall be equipped with an
interceptor with a wire basket or similar device, removable for cleaning,
that prevents passage into the sewer system of solids one half inch (1/2")
or larger in size such as strings, rags, buttons, or other solids detrimental
to the system.
(e) Control equipment. The equipment of facilities installed to
control FOG, food waste, sand and soil, must be designed in accordance
with the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation
engineering standards or applicable city guidelines. Underground
equipment shall be tightly sealed to prevent inflow of rainwater and
easily accessible to allow regular maintenance. Control equipment shall
be maintained by the owner or operator of the facility so as to prevent a
stoppage of the public sewer, and the accumulation of FOG in the lines,
pump stations and treatment plant. If the city is required to clean out
the public sewer lines as a result of a stoppage resulting from poorly
maintained control equipment, the property owner shall be required to
refund the labor, equipment, materials and overhead costs to the city.
Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prohibit or restrict any

and monitoring requirements regarding these parameters as set forth in this
chapter. In the event that the influent at the WWF reaches or exceeds the levels
established by Table A or subsequent criteria calculated as a result of changes
in pass through limits issued by the Tennessee Department of Environment and
Conservation, the pretreatment coordinator shall initiate technical studies to
determine the cause of the influent violation and shall recommend to the city
the necessary remedial measures, including, but not limited to, recommending
18-28
the establishment of new or revised local limits, best management practices, or
other criteria used to protect the WWF. The pretreatment coordinator shall also
recommend changes to any of these criteria in the event that: the WWF effluent
standards are changed, there are changes in any applicable law or regulation
affecting same, or changes are needed for more effective operation of the WWF.
(7) User inventory. The superintendent will maintain an up-to-date
inventory of users whose waste does or may fall into the requirements of this
chapter, and will notify the users of their status.
(8) Right to establish more restrictive criteria. No statement in this
chapter is intended or may be construed to prohibit the pretreatment
coordinator from establishing specific wastewater discharge criteria which are
more restrictive when wastes are determined to be harmful or destructive to the
facilities of the WWF or to create a public nuisance, or to cause the discharge of
the WWF to violate effluent or stream quality standards, or to interfere with the
use or handling of sludge, or to pass through the WWF resulting in a violation
of the NPDES permit, or to exceed industrial pretreatment standards for
discharge to municipal wastewater treatment systems as imposed or as may be
imposed by the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation and/or
the United States Environmental Protection Agency.
(9) Combined wastestream formula. When wastewater subject to
categorical pretreatment standards is mixed with wastewater not regulated by
the same standard, the permitting authority may impose an alternate limit
using the combined wastestream formula.
18-202. Discharge permits. (1) Application for discharge of commercial
or industrial wastewater. All users or prospective users which generate
commercial or industrial wastewater shall make application to the
superintendent for connection to the municipal wastewater treatment system.
It may be determined through the application that a user needs a discharge
permit according to the provisions of federal and state laws and regulations.
Applications shall be required from all new dischargers as well as for any
existing discharger desiring additional service or where there is a planned
change in the industrial or wastewater treatment process. Connection to the
city sewer or changes in the industrial process or wastewater treatment process
shall not be made until the application is received and approved by the
superintendent, the building sewer is installed in accordance with § 18-206 of
this ordinance and an inspection has been performed by the superintendent or
his representative.
The receipt by the city of a prospective customer's application for
connection shall not obligate the city to render the connection. If the service
applied for cannot be supplied in accordance with this chapter and the city's
rules and regulations and general practice, the connection charge will be
refunded in full, and there shall be no liability of the city to the applicant for
such service.
18-29
(2) Industrial wastewater discharge permits. (a) General
requirements. All industrial users proposing to connect to or to

additional facilities for pretreatment shall as part of the
application for wastewater discharge permit submit plans,
specifications and other pertinent information relative to the
proposed construction to the pretreatment coordinator for
approval. A wastewater discharge permit shall not be issued until
such plans and specifications are approved. Approval of such plans
and specifications shall in no way relieve the user from the
responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an
effluent acceptable to the city under the provisions of this chapter.
(iv) If additional pretreatment and/or operations and
maintenance will be required to meet the pretreatment standards,
the application shall include the shortest schedule by which the

18-32
shall apply for permit renewal a minimum of one hundred eighty (180)
days prior to the expiration of the user's existing permit.
(f) Permit transfer. Wastewater discharge permits are issued
to a specific user for a specific operation. A wastewater discharge permit
shall not be reassigned or transferred or sold to a new owner, new user,
different premises, or a new or changed operation without the prior
written approval of the local administrative officer. Any succeeding
owner or user shall also comply with the terms and conditions of the
existing permit. The permit holder must provide the new owner with a
copy of the current permit.
(g) Revocation of permit. Any permit issued under the
provisions of this chapter is subject to be modified, suspended, or revoked
in whole or in part during its term for cause including, but not limited to,
the following:
(i) Violation of any terms or conditions of the wastewater
discharge permit or other applicable federal, state, or local law or
regulation.

(B) Strength, volume, or timing of discharges;
(C) Addition or change in process lines generating
wastewater.
(iv) Intentional failure of a user to accurately report the
discharge constituents and characteristics or to report significant
changes in plant operations or wastewater characteristics.
(3) Confidential information. All information and data on a user
obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits and
monitoring programs and from inspection shall be available to the public or any
governmental agency without restriction unless the user specifically requests
and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the pretreatment coordinator
that the release of such information would divulge information, processes, or
methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets of the users.
When requested by the person furnishing the report, the portions of a
report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made
available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available to
governmental agencies for use; related to this chapter or the city's or user's
NPDES permit. Provided, however, that such portions of a report shall be
available for use by the state or any state agency in judicial review or
enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report.
18-33
Wastewater constituents and characteristics will not be recognized as
confidential information.
Information accepted by the pretreatment coordinator as confidential
shall not be transmitted to any governmental agency or to the general public by
the pretreatment coordinator until and unless prior and adequate notification
is given to the user.
18-203. Industrial user additional requirements. (1) Monitoring
facilities. The installation of a monitoring facility shall be required for all
industrial users. A monitoring facility shall be a manhole or other suitable
facility approved by the pretreatment coordinator.
When in the judgment of the pretreatment coordinator, there is a
significant difference in wastewater constituents and characteristics produced
by different operations of a single user the pretreatment coordinator may
require that separate monitoring facilities be installed for each separate source
of discharge.
Monitoring facilities that are required to be installed shall be constructed
and maintained at the user's expense. The purpose of the facility is to enable
inspection, sampling and flow measurement of wastewater produced by a user.
If sampling or metering equipment is also required by the pretreatment
coordinator, it shall be provided and installed at the user's expense.
The monitoring facility will normally be required to be located on the
user's premises outside of the building. The pretreatment coordinator may,
however, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on
the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street right-of-way
with the approval of the public agency having jurisdiction of that right-of-way
and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles.
There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility to allow
accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility,
sampling, and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe
and proper operating condition at the expenses of the user.
(2) Sample methods. All samples collected and analyzed pursuant to
this regulation shall be conducted using protocols (including appropriate
preservation) specified in the current edition of 40 CFR 136 and appropriate
EPA guidance. Multiple grab samples collected during a twenty-four (24) hour
period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: For cyanide, total
phenol, and sulfide the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the
field; for volatile organics and oil and grease the samples may be composited in
the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the
compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be
authorized by the control authority, as appropriate.
(3) Representative sampling and housekeeping. All wastewater
samples must be representative of the user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring
and flow measuring facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and in good
18-34
working order at all times. The failure of the user to keep its monitoring
facilities in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that
sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge.
(4) Proper operation and maintenance. The user shall at all times
properly operate and maintain the equipment and facilities associated with spill
control, wastewater collection, treatment, sampling and discharge. Proper
operation and maintenance includes adequate process control as well as
adequate testing and monitoring quality assurance.
(5) Inspection and sampling. The city may inspect the facilities of any
user to ascertain whether the purpose of this chapter is being met and all
requirements are being complied with. Persons or occupants of premises where
wastewater is created or discharged shall allow the city or its representative
ready access at all reasonable times to all parts of the premises for the purpose
of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying or in the performance
of any of its duties. The city, approval authority and EPA shall have the right
to set up on the user's property such devices as are necessary to conduct
sampling inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering operations. The
city will utilize qualified city personnel or a private laboratory to conduct
compliance monitoring. Where a user has security measures in force which
would require proper identification and clearance before entry into their
premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with their security
guards so that upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the
city, approval authority and EPA will be permitted to enter, without delay, for
the purposes of performing their specific responsibility.
(6) Safety. While performing the necessary work on private properties,
the pretreatment coordinator or duly authorized employees of the city shall
observe all safety rules applicable to the premises established by the company
and the company shall be held harmless for injury or death to the city employees
and the city shall indemnify the company against loss or damage to its property
by city employees and against liability claims and demands for personal injury
or property damage asserted against the company and growing out of the
monitoring and sampling operation, except as such may be caused by negligence
or failure of the company to maintain safe conditions.
(7) New sources. New sources of discharges to the WWF shall have in
full operation all pollution control equipment at start up of the industrial
process and be in full compliance of effluent standards within ninety (90) days
of start up of the industrial process.
(8) Slug discharge evaluations. Evaluations will be conducted of each
significant industrial user according to the state and federal regulations. Where
it is determined that a slug discharge control plan is needed, the user shall
prepare that plan according to the appropriate regulatory guidance
(9) Accidental discharges or slug discharges. (a) Protection from
accidental or slug discharge. All industrial users shall provide such
facilities and institute such procedures as are reasonably necessary to
18-35
prevent or minimize the potential for accidental or slug discharge into the
WWF of waste regulated by this chapter from liquid or raw material
storage areas, from truck and rail car loading and unloading areas, from
in plant transfer or processing and materials handling areas, and from
diked areas or holding ponds of any waste regulated by this chapter.
Detailed plans showing the facilities and operating procedures shall be
submitted to the pretreatment coordinator before the facility is
constructed.
The review and approval of such plans and operating procedures
will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the
facility to provide the protection necessary to meet the requirements of
this chapter.
(b) Notification of accidental discharge or slug discharge. Any
person causing or suffering from any accidental discharge or slug
discharge shall immediately notify the pretreatment coordinator in
person, or by the telephone to enable countermeasures to be taken by the
pretreatment coordinator to minimize damage to the WWF, the health
and welfare of the public, and the environment.
This notification shall be followed, within five (5) days of the date
of occurrence, by a detailed written statement describing the cause of the
accidental discharge and the measures being taken to prevent future
occurrence.
Such notification shall not relieve the user of liability for any
expense, loss, or damage to the WWF, fish kills, or any other damage to
person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any
fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this
chapter or state or federal law.
(c) Notice to employees. A notice shall be permanently posted
on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees
whom to call in the event of a dangerous discharge. Employers shall
ensure that all employees who may cause or suffer such a dangerous
discharge to occur are advised of the emergency notification procedure.
18-204. Reporting requirements. Users, whether permitted or
non-permitted may be required to submit reports detailing the nature and
characteristics of their discharges according to the following subsections. Failure
to make a requested report in the specified time is a violation subject to
enforcement actions under section 205.
(1) Baseline monitoring report. (a) Within either one hundred eighty
(180) days after the effective date of a categorical pretreatment standard,
or the final administrative decision on a category determination under
Tennessee Rule 1200-4-14-.06(1)(d), whichever is later, existing
categorical industrial users currently discharging to or scheduled to
discharge to the WWF shall submit to the superintendent a report which
18-36
contains the information listed in subsection (b), below. At least ninety
(90) days prior to commencement of their discharge, new sources, and
sources that become categorical industrial users subsequent to the
promulgation of an applicable categorical standard, shall submit to the
superintendent a report which contains the information listed in
subsection (b), below. A new source shall report the method of
pretreatment it intends to use to meet applicable categorical standards.
A new source also shall give estimates of its anticipated flow and quantity
of pollutants to be discharged.
(b) Users described above shall submit the information set forth
below.
(i) Identifying information. The user name, address of
the facility including the name of operators and owners.
(ii) Permit information. A listing of any environmental

nature, average rate of production (including each product
produced by type, amount, processes, and rate of production), and
standard industrial classifications of the operation(s) carried out
by such user. This description should include a schematic process
diagram, which indicates points of discharge to the WWF from the
regulated processes.
(iv) Flow measurement. Information showing the
measured average daily and maximum daily flow, in gallons per
day, to the POTW from regulated process streams and other
streams, as necessary, to allow use of the combined wastestream
formula.

pollution prevention alternative, the user shall submit
documentation as required by the superintendent or the
applicable standards to determine compliance with the
standard.
(E) The user shall take a minimum of one
representative sample to compile that data necessary to
comply with the requirements of this paragraph.
(F) Samples should be taken immediately
downstream from pretreatment facilities if such exist or
immediately downstream from the regulated process if no
pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed with
the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment the user
should measure the flows and concentrations necessary to
allow use of the combined wastestream formula to evaluate
compliance with the pretreatment standards
(G) Sampling and analysis shall be performed in
accordance with 40 CFR 136 or other approved methods;
(H) The superintendent may allow the submission
of a baseline report which utilizes only historical data so
long as the data provides information sufficient to
determine the need for industrial pretreatment measures;
(I) The baseline report shall indicate the time,
date and place of sampling and methods of analysis, and
shall certify that such sampling and analysis is
representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant
discharges to the WWF.
(c) Compliance certification. A statement, reviewed by the
user's duly authorized representative and certified by a qualified
professional, indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met
on a consistent basis, and, if not, whether additional Operation and
Maintenance (O&M) and/or additional pretreatment is required to meet
the Pretreatment Standards and Requirements.
(d) Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or
O&M will be required to meet the pretreatment standards, the shortest
schedule by which the user will provide such additional pretreatment
and/or O&M must be provided. The completion date in this schedule
shall not be later than the compliance date established for the applicable

applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source
following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the WWF, any
user subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to
the superintendent a report containing the information described in §18-
204(1)(b)(iv) and (v) of this ordinance. For all other users subject to categorical
pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per
unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the
user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. All compliance
reports must be signed and certified in accordance with subsection (14) of this
section. All sampling will be done in conformance with subsection (11).
(4) Periodic compliance reports. (a) All significant industrial users
must, at a frequency determined by the superintendent submit no less
than twice per year (April 10 and October 10) reports indicating the
nature, concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by
pretreatment standards and the measured or estimated average and
maximum daily flows for the reporting period. In cases where the
pretreatment standard requires compliance with a Best Management
Practice (BMP) or pollution prevention alternative, the user must submit
documentation required by the superintendent or the pretreatment
standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the user.
(b) All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified
in accordance with this ordinance.
18-39
(c) All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's
discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall
be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order
at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good
working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample
results are unrepresentative of its discharge.
(d) If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section
monitors any regulated pollutant at the appropriate sampling location
more frequently than required by the superintendent, using the
procedures prescribed in subsection (11) of this section, the results of this
monitoring shall be included in the report.
(5) Reports of changed conditions. Each user must notify the
superintendent of any significant changes to the user's operations or system
which might alter the nature, quality, or volume of its wastewater at least sixty
(60) days before the change.
(a) The superintendent may require the user to submit such
information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed
condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit
application under § 18-201 of this chapter.
(b) The superintendent may issue an individual wastewater
discharge permit under § 18-202 of this chapter or modify an existing
wastewater discharge permit under § 18-202 of this chapter in response
to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions.
(6) Report of potential problems. (a) In the case of any discharge,
including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a
nonroutine, episodic nature, a noncustomary batch discharge, a slug
discharge or slug load, that might cause potential problems for the
POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the
superintendent of the incident. This notification shall include the
location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if
known, and corrective actions taken by the user.
(b) Within five (5) days following such discharge, the user shall,
unless waived by the superintendent, submit a detailed written report
describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by
the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not
relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which
might be incurred as a result of damage to the WWF, natural resources,
or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification
relieve the user of any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be
imposed pursuant to this ordinance.
(c) A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin
board or other prominent place advising employees who to call in the
event of a discharge described in subsection (a), above. Employers shall
18-40
ensure that all employees, who could cause such a discharge to occur, are
advised of the emergency notification procedure.
(d) Significant industrial users are required to notify the
superintendent immediately of any changes at its facility affecting the
potential for a slug discharge.
(7) Reports from unpermitted users. All users not required to obtain
an individual wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to
the superintendent as the superintendent may require to determine users status
as non-permitted.
(8) Notice of violations/repeat sampling and reporting. Where a
violation has occurred, another sample shall be conducted within thirty (30)
days of becoming aware of the violation, either a repeat sample or a regularly
scheduled sample that falls within the required time frame. If sampling
performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify the
superintendent within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the
violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the
results of the repeat analysis to the superintendent within thirty (30) days after
becoming aware of the violation. Resampling by the industrial user is not
required if the city performs sampling at the user's facility at least once a
month, or if the city performs sampling at the user's facility between the time
when the initial sampling was conducted and the time when the user or the city
receives the results of this sampling, or if the city has performed the sampling
and analysis in lieu of the industrial user.
(9) Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste. (a) Any user who
commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the
EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state hazardous
waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a
substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste
under 40 CFR part 261. Such notification must include the name of the
hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR part 261, the EPA hazardous
waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If
the user discharges more than one hundred (100) kilograms of such waste
per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the
following information to the extent such information is known and readily
available to the user: an identification of the hazardous constituents
contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of
such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar
month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream
expected to be discharged during the following twelve (12) months. All
notifications must take place no later than one hundred eighty (180) days
after the discharge commences. Any notification under this paragraph
need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged.
However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under
§ 18-204(5) of this ordinance. The notification requirement in this section
18-41
does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to
categorical pretreatment standards under the self monitoring
requirements of § 18-204(1), (3), and (4) of this chapter.
(b) Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of paragraph
(a), above, during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than
fifteen (15) kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute
hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e).
Discharge of more than fifteen (15) kilograms of nonacute hazardous
wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes
as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one (1) time
notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more
than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional
notification.
(c) In the case of any new regulations under section 3001 of
RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing
any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the
superintendent, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division
Director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such
substance within ninety (90) days of the effective date of such regulations.
(d) In the case of any notification made under this section, the
user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and
toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to
be economically practical.
(e) This provision does not create a right to discharge any
substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this ordinance, a
permit issued there under, or any applicable federal or state law.
(10) Analytical requirements. All pollutant analyses, including
sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit
application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques
prescribed in 40 CFR part 136 and amendments thereto, unless otherwise
specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR part 136
does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question,
or where the EPA determines that the part 136 sampling and analytical
techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and
analyses shall be performed by using validated analytical methods or any other
applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested
by the superintendent or other parties approved by EPA.
(11) Sample collection. Samples collected to satisfy reporting
requirements must be based on data obtained through appropriate sampling and
analysis performed during the period covered by the report, based on data that
is representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period.
(a) Except as indicated in subsections (b) and (c) below, the user
must collect wastewater samples using twenty-four (24) hour flow
proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time proportional
18-42
composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the
superintendent. Where time proportional composite sampling or grab
sampling is authorized by the city, the samples must be representative
of the discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation)
specified in 40 CFR part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple
grab samples collected during a twenty-four (24) hour period may be
composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and
sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field;
for volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited
in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by
the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA
methodologies may be authorized by the city, as appropriate. In addition,
grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous
limits
(b) Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total
phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using
grab collection techniques.
(c) For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and
ninety (90) day compliance reports required in subsections (1) and (3) of
this section, a minimum of four (4) grab samples must be used for pH,
cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic
compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist;
for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the
superintendent may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required
by subsection (4) of this section, the industrial user is required to collect
the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance
with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.
(12) Date of receipt of reports. Written reports will be deemed to have
been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports, which are not mailed, the
date of receipt of the report shall govern.
(13) Recordkeeping. Users subject to the reporting requirements of this
ordinance shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all
records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required
by this ordinance, any additional records of information obtained pursuant to
monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements,
and documentation associated with best management practices established
under §18-202. Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time
of sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates
analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques
or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain
available for a period of at least three (3) years. This period shall be
automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or
the city, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention
period by the superintendent.
18-43
(14) Certification statements. Signature and certification. All reports
associated with compliance with the pretreatment program shall be signed by
the duly authorized representative and shall have the following certification
statement attached:
I certify under penalty of law that this document and all
attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision in
accordance with a system designed to assure that qualified
personnel properly gather and evaluate the information submitted.
Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the
system, or those persons directly responsible for gathering the
information, the information submitted is, to the best of my
knowledge and belief, true, accurate, and complete. I am aware
that there are significant penalties for submitting false
information, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment for
knowing violations.
Reports required to have signatures and certification statement include,
permit applications, periodic reports, compliance schedules, baseline monitoring,
reports of accidental or slug discharges, and any other written report that may
be used to determine water quality and compliance with local, state, and federal
requirements.
18-205. Enforcement response plan. Under the authority of
Tennessee Code Annotated, § 69-3-123 et. seq.
(1) Complaints; notification of violation; orders. (a) (i)
Whenever the local administrative officer has reason to believe
that a violation of any provision of the ______________ Wastewater
Regulations, pretreatment program, or of orders of the local
hearing authority issued under it has occurred, is occurring, or is
about to occur, the local administrative officer may cause a written
complaint to be served upon the alleged violator or violators.
(ii) The complaint shall specify the provision or
provisions of the pretreatment program or order alleged to be
violated or about to be violated and the facts alleged to constitute
a violation, may order that necessary corrective action be taken
within a reasonable time to be prescribed in the order, and shall
inform the violators of the opportunity for a hearing before the
local hearing authority.
(iii) Any such order shall become final and not subject to
review unless the alleged violators request by written petition a
hearing before the local hearing authority as provided in §18-
205(2), no later than thirty (30) days after the date the order is
served; provided, that the local hearing authority may review the
18-44
final order as provided in Tennessee Code Annotated,
§ 69-3-123(a)(3).
(iv) Notification of violation. Notwithstanding the
provisions of subsections (i) through (iii), whenever the
pretreatment coordinator finds that any user has violated or is
violating this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment requirements, the
city or its agent may serve upon the user a written notice of
violation. Within fifteen (15) days of the receipt of this notice, the
user shall submit to the pretreatment coordinator an explanation
of the violation and a plan for its satisfactory correction and
prevention including specific actions. Submission of this plan in
no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring
before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this
section limits the authority of the city to take any action, including
emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first
issuing a notice of violation.
(b) (i) When the local administrative officer finds that a user
has violated or continues to violate this chapter, wastewater
discharge permits, any order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, he may issue one of the
following orders. These orders are not prerequisite to taking any
other action against the user.
(A) Compliance order. An order to the user
responsible for the discharge directing that the user come
into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not
come into compliance within the specified time, sewer
service shall be discontinued unless adequate treatment
facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are
installed and properly operated. Compliance orders may
also contain other requirements to address the
noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring, and
management practices designed to minimize the amount of
pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may
not extend the deadline for compliance established for a
federal pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a
compliance order release the user of liability for any
violation, including any continuing violation.
(B) Cease and desist order. An order to the user
directing it to cease all such violations and directing it to
immediately comply with all requirements and take needed
remedial or preventive action to properly address a
continuing or threatened violation, including halting
operations and/or terminating the discharge.
18-45
(C) Consent order. Assurances of voluntary
compliance, or other documents establishing an agreement
with the user responsible for noncompliance, including
specific action to be taken by the user to correct the
noncompliance within a time period specified in the order.
(D) Emergency order. (1) Whenever the local
administrative officer finds that an emergency exists
imperatively requiring immediate action to protect
the public health, safety, or welfare, the health of
animals, fish or aquatic life, a public water supply, or
the facilities of the WWF, the local administrative
officer may, without prior notice, issue an order
reciting the existence of such an emergency and
requiring that any action be taken as the local
administrative officer deems necessary to meet the
emergency.
(2) If the violator fails to respond or is
unable to respond to the order, the local
administrative officer may take any emergency action
as the local administrative officer deems necessary,
or contract with a qualified person or persons to carry
out the emergency measures. The local
administrative officer may assess the person or
persons responsible for the emergency condition for
actual costs incurred by the city in meeting the
emergency.
(ii) Appeals from orders of the local administrative
officer.
(A) Any user affected by any order of the local
administrative officer in interpreting or implementing the
provisions of this chapter may file with the local
administrative officer a written request for reconsideration
within thirty (30) days of the order, setting forth in detail
the facts supporting the user's request for reconsideration.
(B) If the ruling made by the local administrative
officer is unsatisfactory to the person requesting
reconsideration, he may, within thirty (30) days, file a
written petition with the local hearing authority as provided
in subsection (2). The local administrative officer's order
shall remain in effect during the period of reconsideration.
(c) Except as otherwise expressly provided, any notice,
complaint, order, or other instrument issued by or under authority
of this section may be served on any named person personally, by
the local administrative officer or any person designated by the
18-46
local administrative officer, or service may be made in accordance
with Tennessee statutes authorizing service of process in civil
action. Proof of service shall be filed in the office of the local
administrative officer.
(2) Hearings. (a) Any hearing or rehearing brought before the local
hearing authority shall be conducted in accordance with the following,
Under the authority of Tennessee Code Annotated, § 69-3-124:
(i) Upon receipt of a written petition from the alleged
violator pursuant to this subsection, the local administrative
officer shall give the petitioner thirty (30) days' written notice of
the time and place of the hearing, but in no case shall the hearing
be held more than sixty (60) days from the receipt of the written
petition, unless the local administrative officer and the petitioner
agree to a postponement;
(ii) The hearing may be conducted by the local hearing
authority at a regular or special meeting. A quorum of the local
hearing authority must be present at the regular or special
meeting to conduct the hearing;
(iii) A verbatim record of the proceedings of the hearings
shall be taken and filed with the local hearing authority, together
with the findings of fact and conclusions of law made under
subsection (a)(vi). The recorded transcript shall be made available
to the petitioner or any party to a hearing upon payment of a
charge set by the local administrative officer to cover the costs of
preparation;
(iv) In connection with the hearing, the chair shall issue
subpoenas in response to any reasonable request by any party to
the hearing requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses
and the production of evidence relevant to any matter involved in
the hearing. In case of contumacy or refusal to obey a notice of
hearing or subpoena issued under this section, the chancery court
of ___________ County has jurisdiction upon the application of the
local hearing authority or the local administrative officer to issue
an order requiring the person to appear and testify or produce
evidence as the case may require, and any failure to obey an order
of the court may be punished by such court as contempt;
(v) Any member of the local hearing authority may
administer oaths and examine witnesses;
(vi) On the basis of the evidence produced at the hearing,
the local hearing authority shall make findings of fact and
conclusions of law and enter decisions and orders that, in its
opinion, will best further the purposes of the pretreatment
program. It shall provide written notice of its decisions and orders
to the alleged violator. The order issued under this subsection
18-47
shall be issued by the person or persons designated by the chair no
later than thirty (30) days following the close of the hearing;
(vii) The decision of the local hearing authority becomes
final and binding on all parties unless appealed to the courts as
provided in subsection (b).
(viii) Any person to whom an emergency order is directed
under § 18-205(1)(b)(i)(D) shall comply immediately, but on
petition to the local hearing authority will be afforded a hearing as
soon as possible. In no case will the hearing be held later than
three (3) days from the receipt of the petition by the local hearing
authority.
(b) An appeal may be taken from any final order or other final
determination of the local hearing authority by any party who is or may
be adversely affected, including the pretreatment agency. Appeal must
be made to the chancery court under the common law writ of certiorari
set out in Tennessee Code Annotated, § 27-8-101, et. seq. within sixty (60)
days from the date the order or determination is made.
(c) Show cause hearing. Notwithstanding the provisions of
subsections (a) or (b), the pretreatment coordinator may order any user
that causes or contributes to violation(s) of this chapter, wastewater
discharge permits, or orders issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment
standard or requirements, to appear before the local administrative
officer and show cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be
taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place
for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for the
action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed
enforcement action should be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be
served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt
requested) at least ten (10) days prior to the hearing. The notice may be
served on any authorized representative of the user. Whether or not the
user appears as ordered, immediate enforcement action may be pursued
following the hearing date. A show cause hearing shall not be
prerequisite for taking any other action against the user. A show cause
hearing may be requested by the discharger prior to revocation of a
discharge permit or termination of service.
(3) Violations, administrative civil penalty. Under the authority of
Tennessee Code Annotated, § 69-3-125.
(a) (i) Any person including, but not limited to, industrial
users, who does any of the following acts or omissions is
subject to a civil penalty of up to ten thousand dollars
($10,000.00) per day for each day during which the act or
omission continues or occurs:
(A) Unauthorized discharge, discharging without
a permit;
18-48
(B) Violates an effluent standard or limitation;
(C) Violates the terms or conditions of a permit;
(D) Fails to complete a filing requirement;
(E) Fails to allow or perform an entry, inspection,
monitoring or reporting requirement;
(F) Fails to pay user or cost recovery charges; or
(G) Violates a final determination or order of the
local hearing authority or the local administrative officer.
(ii) Any administrative civil penalty must be assessed in
the following manner:
(A) The local administrative officer may issue an
assessment against any person or industrial user
responsible for the violation;
(B) Any person or industrial user against whom an
assessment has been issued may secure a review of the
assessment by filing with the local administrative officer a
written petition setting forth the grounds and reasons for
the violator's objections and asking for a hearing in the
matter involved before the local hearing authority and, if a
petition for review of the assessment is not filed within
thirty (30) days after the date the assessment is served, the
violator is deemed to have consented to the assessment and
it becomes final;
(C) Whenever any assessment has become final
because of a person's failure to appeal the assessment, the
local administrative officer may apply to the appropriate
court for a judgment and seek execution of the judgment,
and the court, in such proceedings, shall treat a failure to
appeal the assessment as a confession of judgment in the
amount of the assessment;
(D) In assessing the civil penalty the local
administrative officer may consider the following factors:
(1) Whether the civil penalty imposed will
be a substantial economic deterrent to the illegal
activity;
(2) Damages to the pretreatment agency,
including compensation for the damage or
destruction of the facilities of the publicly owned
treatment works, and also including any penalties,
costs and attorneys' fees incurred by the
pretreatment agency as the result of the illegal
activity, as well as the expenses involved in enforcing
this section and the costs involved in rectifying any
damages;
18-49
(3) Cause of the discharge or violation;
(4) The severity of the discharge and its
effect upon the facilities of the publicly owned
treatment works and upon the quality and quantity
of the receiving waters;
(5) Effectiveness of action taken by the
violator to cease the violation;
(6) The technical and economic
reasonableness of reducing or eliminating the
discharge; and
(7) The economic benefit gained by the
violator.
(E) The local administrative officer may institute
proceedings for assessment in the chancery court of the
county in which all or part of the pollution or violation
occurred, in the name of the pretreatment agency.
(iii) The local hearing authority may establish by
regulation a schedule of the amount of civil penalty which can be
assessed by the local administrative officer for certain specific
violations or categories of violations.
(iv) Assessments may be added to the user's next
scheduled sewer service charge and the local administrative officer
shall have such other collection remedies as may be available for
other service charges and fees.
(b) Any civil penalty assessed to a violator pursuant to this
section may be in addition to any civil penalty assessed by the
commissioner for violations of Tennessee Code Annotated,
§ 69-3-115(a)(1)(F). However, the sum of penalties imposed by this
section and by Tennessee Code Annotated, § 69-3-115(a) shall not exceed
ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) per day for each day during which the
act or omission continues or occurs.
(4) Assessment for noncompliance with program permits or orders.
Under the authority of Tennessee Code Annotated, § 69-3-126.
(a) The local administrative officer may assess the liability of
any polluter or violator for damages to the city resulting from any
person's or industrial user's pollution or violation, failure, or neglect in
complying with any permits or orders issued pursuant to the provisions
of the pretreatment program or this section.
(b) If an appeal from such assessment is not made to the local
hearing authority by the polluter or violator within thirty (30) days of
notification of such assessment, the polluter or violator shall be deemed
to have consented to the assessment, and it shall become final.
(c) Damages may include any expenses incurred in
investigating and enforcing the pretreatment program of this section, in
18-50
removing, correcting, and terminating any pollution, and also
compensation for any actual damages caused by the pollution or violation.
(d) Whenever any assessment has become final because of a
person's failure to appeal within the time provided, the local
administrative officer may apply to the appropriate court for a judgment,
and seek execution on the judgment. The court, in its proceedings, shall
treat the failure to appeal the assessment as a confession of judgment in
the amount of the assessment.
(5) Judicial proceedings and relief. Under the authority of Tennessee
Code Annotated, § 69-3-127. The local administrative officer may initiate
proceedings in the chancery court of the county in which the activities occurred
against any person or industrial user who is alleged to have violated or is about
to violate the pretreatment program, this section, or orders of the local hearing
authority or local administrative officer. In the action, the local administrative
officer may seek, and the court may grant, injunctive relief and any other relief
available in law or equity.
(6) Termination of discharge. In addition to the revocation of permit
provisions in § 18-202(2)(g) of this chapter, users are subject to termination of
their wastewater discharge for violations of a wastewater discharge permits, or
orders issued hereunder, or for any of the following conditions:
(a) Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions.
(b) Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge.
(c) Failure to report significant changes in operations or
wastewater volume, constituents and characteristics prior to discharge.
(d) Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the
purpose of inspection, monitoring or sampling.
(e) Violation of the pretreatment standards in the general
discharge prohibitions in § 18-209.
(f) Failure to properly submit an industrial waste survey when
requested by the pretreatment coordination superintendent.
The user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be
offered an opportunity to show cause, as provided in subsection (2)(c) above, why
the proposed action should not be taken.
(7) Disposition of damage payments and penalties--special fund. All
damages and/or penalties assessed and collected under the provisions of this
section shall be placed in a special fund by the pretreatment agency and
allocated and appropriated for the administration of its wastewater fund or
combined water and wastewater fund.
(8) Levels of non-compliance. (a) Insignificant non-compliance: For
the purpose of this guide, insignificant non-compliance is considered a
relatively minor infrequent violation of pretreatment standards or
requirements. These will usually be responded to informally with a
phone call or site visit but may include a Notice of Violation (NOV).
18-51
(b) "Significant noncompliance." Per 1200-4-14-.08(6)(b)8.
(i) Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits,
defined here as those in which sixty-six percent (66%) or more of
all of the measurements taken for each parameter taken during a
six (6) month period exceed (by any magnitude) a numeric
pretreatment standard or requirement, including instantaneous
limit.
(ii) Technical Review Criteria (TRC) violations, defined
here as those in which thirty-three percent (33%) or more of all of
the measurements for each pollutant parameter taken during a six
(6) month period equal or exceed the product of the numeric
pretreatment standard or requirement, including instantaneous
limits multiplied by the applicable TRC (TRC=1.4 for BOD, TSS
fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH).
TRC calculations for pH are not required.
(iii) Any other violation of a pretreatment standard or
requirement (daily maximum of longer-term average,
instantaneous limit, or narrative standard) that the WWF
determines has caused, alone or in combination with other
discharges, interference or pass through (including endangering
the health of POTW personnel or the general public).
(iv) Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused
imminent endangerment to human health, welfare or to the
environment or has resulted in the WWF's exercise of its

18-304. Basis of determination of charges.
18-305. User charges.
18-306. Notification.
18-307. Biennial review of operation and maintenance charges.
18-301. Purpose of charges and fees. A schedule of charges and fees
shall be adopted by the City of Clifton which will enable it to comply with the
revenue requirements of section 204 of the Clean Water Act. Charges and fees
shall be determined in a manner consistent with regulations of the federal grant
program to ensure that sufficient revenues are collected to defray the cost of
operating and maintaining, including replacement, adequate wastewater
collection and treatment systems. Specific charges and fees shall be adopted by
a separate ordinance, this section describes the procedure to be used in
calculating the charges and fees. Additional charges and fees to recover funds
for capital outlay, bond service costs, and capital improvements may be assessed
by the City of Clifton. These charges and fees shall be recovered through the
user classification established below. (1999 Code, § 18-201)
18-302. Classification of user. All users shall be classified by the
superintendent either by assigning each one to a "user classification" category
according to the principal activity conducted on the user's premises, by
individual user analyzation, or by a combination thereof. The purpose of such
collective and/or individual classification is to facilitate the regulation of
wastewater discharges based on wastewater constituents and characteristics.
(1999 Code, § 18-202)
18-303. Types of charges and sewer fees. The charges and fees as
established in treatment works schedule of charges and fees, may include, but
not be limited to:
(1) User classification charges;
(2) Fees for monitoring requested by user;
(3) Fees for permit applications;
(4) Appeal fees;
(5) Charges and fees based on wastewater constituents and
characteristics;
(6) Fees for use of garbage grinders;
18-56
(7) Fees for holding tank wastes. (1999 Code, § 18-203)
18-304. Basis of determination of charges. Charges and fees may be
based upon a minimum basic charge for each premise, computed on the basis of
"normal wastewater" from a domestic premise with the following characteristics:
BOD5 300 milligrams per liter
COD 600 milligrams per liter
TKN 60 milligrams per liter
NH3-N 30 milligrams per liter
Suspended Solids 300 milligrams per liter
Fats, Oil, and Grease 100 milligrams per liter
The charges and fees for all classifications of users other than the basic
domestic premise shall be based upon the relative difference between the
average wastewater constituents and characteristics of that classification as
related to those of a domestic premise.
The charges and fees established for permit users shall be based upon the
measured or estimated constituents and characteristics of the wastewater
discharge of that user which may include, but not be limited to, BOD, COD, SS,
NH3 as N, chlorine demand, and volume. (1999 Code, § 18-204)
18-305. User charges. Each user shall be levied a charge for payment
of bonded indebtedness of the treatment system and for that user's
proportionate share of the operations and maintenance costs of the system. A
surcharge will be levied against those users with wastewater that exceeds the
strength of "normal wastewater."
The user charge will be computed from a base charge plus a surcharge.
The base charge will be the user's proportionate share of the costs of Operation
and Maintenance (O&M) including replacement for handling its periodic volume
of "normal wastewater."
(1) Operation and maintenance user charges. Each user's share of
operation and maintenance costs will be computed by the following formula:
Cu = Ct x (Vu)
Vt
Where: Cu = User's charge for O&M per unit of time.
Ct = Total O&M cost per unit of time.
Vt = Total volume contribution from all users per
unit of time.
Vu = Volume contribution from a user per unit of
time.
Operation and maintenance charges may be established on a percentage
of water use charge only in the event that water use charges are based on a
constant cost per unit of consumption.
18-57
(2) Surcharges. The surcharge will be the user's proportionate share
of the O&M costs for handling its periodic volume of wastewater which exceeds
the strength of BOD5, suspended solids, and/or other elements in "normal
wastewater" including "toxic wastes." The amount of the surcharge shall be
determined by the following formula:
Cs = [(Bc x B) + (Sc x S) + (Pc x P)]Vu
Where: Cs = Surcharge for wastewaters exceeding the
strength or "normal wastewater" expressed in
dollars per billing period.
Bc = O&M cost for treatment of a unit of BOD5,
expressed in dollars per pound.
B = Concentration of BOD5 from a user above the
base level of 2.50 lbs/1,000 gallons expressed
in pounds per 1,000 gallons.
Sc = O&M costs for treatment of a unit of
suspended solids expressed in dollars per
pound.
S = Concentration of suspended solids from a user
above the base level of 2.50 lbs/1,000 gallons
expressed in pounds per 1,000 gallons.
Pc = O&M cost for treatment of a unit of any
pollutant which the publicly-owned treatment
works is committed to treat by virtue of an
NPDES permit or other regulatory
requirement expressed in dollars per pound.
P = Concentration of any pollutant from a user
above base level. Base levels for pollutants
subject to surcharges will be established by the
superintendent.
Vu = Volume contribution of a user per billing
period (expressed in thousands of gallons).
The values of parameters used to determine user charges may vary from
time to time. Therefore, the superintendent is authorized to modify any
parameter or value as often as necessary. Review of all parameters and values
shall be undertaken whenever necessary; but in no case less frequently than
annually. (1999 Code, § 18-205)
18-306. Notification. Each user shall be notified, at least annually, in
conjunction with a regular bill, of the rate and that portion of the user charges
which are attributable to wastewater treatment services. (1999 Code, § 18-206)
18-58
18-307. Biennial review of operation and maintenance charges.
The City of Clifton shall review not less often than every two (2) years the waste
water contribution of users and user classes, the total costs of operation and
maintenance of the treatment works and its approval user charge system. The
town shall revise the charges for users or user classes to accomplish the
following:
(1) Maintain the proportionate distribution of operation and
maintenance costs among users and user classes as required herein;
(2) Generate sufficient revenue to pay the total operation and
maintenance costs necessary to the proper operation and maintenance
(including replacement) of the treatment works; and
(3) Apply excess revenues collected from a class of users to the costs
of operation and maintenance attributable to that class for the next year and
adjust the rate accordingly. (1999 Code, § 18-207)

comply with Tennessee Code Annotated, §§ 68-13-701 through 68-13-719 as well
as the rules and regulations for public water systems, legally adopted in
accordance with this code, which pertain to cross-connections, auxiliary intakes,
bypasses, and interconnections, and establish an effective ongoing program to
control these undesirable water uses. (Ord. #230, Feb. 2011)
18-403. Construction, operation, and supervision. It shall be
unlawful for any person to cause a cross-connection to be made, or allow one to
exist for any purpose whatsoever, unless the construction and operation of same
have been approved by the Tennessee Department of Health and Environment,
and the operation of such cross-connection, auxiliary intake, bypass or
interconnection is at all times under the direct supervision of the water
superintendent which means the official in charge of the public water system for
the City of Clifton. (Ord. #230, Feb. 2011)
18-404. Statement required. Any person whose premises are supplied
with water from the public water supply, and who also has on the same premise
a separate source of water supply or store water in an uncovered or unsanitary
storage reservoir from which the water store therein is circulated through a
piping system, shall file with the water superintendent which means the official
in charge of the public water system for the City of Clifton, a statement of the
non-existence of unapproved or unauthorized cross-connections, auxiliary
intakes, bypasses, or interconnection. Such statement shall also contain an
agreement that no cross-connection, auxiliary intake, bypass, or interconnection

authorized representative shall have the right to enter at any reasonable time,
any property served by a connection to the Clifton Water System for the purpose
of inspecting the piping system or systems therein for cross-connections,
auxiliary intakes, bypasses, or interconnections.
On request, the owner, lessee, or occupant or any property so served shall
furnish to the inspection agency any pertinent information regarding the piping
system or systems on such property. The refusal of such information or refusal
of access, when requested, shall be deemed evidence of the presence of
cross-connections. (Ord. #230, Feb. 2011)
18-407. Correction of existing violations. Any person who now has
cross-connections, auxiliary intakes, bypasses, or interconnections in violation
of the provisions of this chapter shall be allowed a reasonable time within which
to comply with the provisions of this chapter. After a thorough investigation of
existing conditions and an appraisal of the time required to complete the work,
the amount of time shall be designated by the Water Superintendent of the City
of Clifton Public Water System. The failure to correct conditions threatening the
safety of public water system as prohibited by this chapter and Tennessee Code
Annotated, § 68-13-711, within a reasonable time and within the time limits set
by the City of Clifton Public Water System, shall be grounds for denial of water
service. If proper protection has not been provided after a reasonable time, the
utility shall give the customer legal notification that water service is to be
discontinued and physically separate the public water system from the
customer's on-site piping system in such a manner that the two (2) systems
cannot again be connected by an unauthorized person. Where cross-connections,
interconnections, auxiliary intakes, or bypasses are found that constitutes an
extreme hazard of immediate concern of contaminating the public water system,
the management of the water system shall require that immediate corrective
action be taken to disconnect the public water system from the on-site piping
system unless the imminent hazards is corrected immediately. (Ord. #230, Feb.
2011)
18-408. Use of protective devices. Where the nature of use of the
water supplied a premises by the water system is such that it is deemed:
(1) Impractical to provide an effective air-gap separation.
(2) That the owner and/or occupant of the premises cannot, or is not
willing, to demonstrate to the official in charge of the water system, or his
designated representative, that the water use and protective features of the
plumbing are such as to propose no threat to the safety or to the potable water
of the system.
(3) That the nature and mode of operation within a premises are such
that frequent alterations are made to the plumbing.
18-62
(4) There is a likelihood that a protective measure may be subverted,

The Water Superintendent of the City of Clifton Public Water System, or
his designated representative, shall require the use of an approved protective
device on the service line serving the premises to assure that any contamination
that may originate in the customer's premises is contained therein. The
protective devices shall be a reduced pressure zone type backflow preventer
approved by the Tennessee Department of Health and Environment as to
manufacture, model, and size. The method of installation and shall comply with
the criteria set forth by the Tennessee Department of Health and Environment.
The installation shall be at the expense of the owner or occupant of the
premises.
Personnel of the City of Clifton Public Water System shall have the right
to inspect and test the device or devices on an annual basis or whenever deemed
necessary by the water superintendent, or his designated representative. Water
service shall not be disrupted to test the device without the knowledge of the
occupant of the premises. The owner or occupant of the premises is responsible
for the cost of device inspections and tests. A twenty-five dollar ($25.00) fee shall
be assessed for the initial or routine annual testing of backflow prevention
devices. A notice shall be issued for devices failing initial or annual tests and a
thirty (30) day grace period allowed for repair. If the deficiency is not corrected
during the grace period, the customer shall be notified that a penalty of
twenty-five dollars ($25.00) will be assessed on their monthly water bill, and the
fee will be reassessed for each subsequent visit after the thirty (30) day grace
period.
Where the use of water is critical to the continuance of normal operations
or protection of life, property, or equipment, duplicate units shall be provided to
avoid the necessity of discontinuing water service to test or repair the protective
device or devices. Where it is found that only one (1) unit has been installed and
the continuance of service is critical, the water superintendent, shall notify, in
writing, the occupant of the premises of plans to discontinue water service and
arrange for a mutually acceptable time to test and/or repair the device. The
water system shall require the occupant of the premises to make all repairs
indicated promptly, to keep the unit working properly, and the expense of such
repairs shall be borne by the owner or occupant of the premises. Repairs shall
be made by qualified personnel, acceptable to the Water Superintendent of the
City of Clifton Public Water System. The failure to maintain backflow
prevention devices in proper working order shall be ground for discontinuing
water service to any premises. Likewise the removal, bypassing, or altering of
the protective devices or the installation thereof so as to render the devices
ineffective shall constitute grounds for discontinuance of water service. Water
service to such premises shall not be restored until the customer has corrected
or eliminated such condition or defect to the satisfaction of the City of Clifton
Public Water System. (Ord. #230, Feb. 2011)

services to any premises. Such action, being essential for the protection of water
distribution system against the entrance of contamination which may render the
water unsafe health wise, or otherwise undesirable, shall be enforced rigidly
without regard to location of the premises, whether inside or outside the City
of Clifton corporate limits.
(2) Any person who neglects or refuses to comply with any of the
provisions of this chapter shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and upon
conviction therefor, shall be fined an amount not to exceed fifty dollars ($50.00),
plus costs. Each violation shall be considered a separate offense. (Ord. #230,

warranted. Within ten (10) working days following the receipt of
the complaint, the Safety Director will answer the complaint in
writing stating whether or not the complaint is deemed to be valid
and if no, why not, what action has been or will be taken to correct
or abate the condition(s), and giving a designated time period for
correction or abatement. Answers to anonymous complaints will
be posted upon bulletin boards or other places of common passage
where the anonymous complaint may be reasonably expected to be
seen by the complainant for a period of three (3) working days.
c. If the complainant finds the reply not satisfactory because it was
held to be invalid, the corrective action is felt to be insufficient, or
the time period of correction is felt to be too long, he may forward
a letter to the Chief Executive Officer or to the governing body
explaining the condition(s) cited in his original complaint and why
he believes the answer to be inappropriate or insufficient.
d. The Chief Executive Officer or a representative of the governing
body will evaluate the complaint and will begin to take action to
correct or abate the condition(s) through arbitration or
administrative sanctions or may find the complaint to be invalid.
An answer will be sent to the complainant within ten (10) working
days following receipt of the complaint or the next regularly
scheduled meeting of the governing body following receipt of the
complaint explaining decisions made and action taken or to be
taken.
e. After the above steps have been followed and the complainant is
still not satisfied with the results, he may then file a complaint
APP-A-13
with the Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development. Any
complaint filed with the Commissioner of Labor and Workforce
Development in such cases shall include copies of all related
correspondence with the Safety Director and the Chief Executive
Officer or the representative of the governing body.

required. They shall also be instructed on all specific
standards or regulations that apply to work in
dangerous or potentially dangerous areas.
iii. The immediate supervisor of any employee who must
perform work in a confined or enclosed space shall be
responsible for instructing employees on danger of
hazards which may be present, precautions to be
taken, and use of personal protective and emergency
equipment, immediately prior to their entry into such
an area and shall require use of appropriate personal
protective equipment.
XI. GENERAL INSPECTION PROCEDURES
It is the intention of the governing body and responsible officials to have
an Occupational Safety and Health Program Plan that will insure the
welfare of employees. In order to be aware of hazards, periodic
inspections must be performed. These inspections will enable the finding
APP-A-15
of hazards or unsafe conditions or operations that will need correction in
order to maintain safe and healthful worksites. Inspections made on a
pre-designated basis may not yield the desired results. Inspections will
be conducted, therefore, on a random basis at intervals not to exceed
thirty (30) calendar days.
a. In order to carry out the purposes of this ordinance, the Safety
Director and/or Compliance Inspector(s), if appointed, is
authorized:
1. To enter at any reasonable time, any establishment, facility,
or worksite where work is being performed by an employee
when such establishment, facility, or worksite is under the
jurisdiction of the employer and;
2. To inspect and investigate during regular working hours
and at other reasonable times, within reasonable limits, and
in a reasonable manner, any such place of employment and
all pertinent conditions, processes, structures, machines,
apparatus, devices, equipment, and materials therein, and
to question privately any supervisor, operator, agent, or
employee working therein.
b. If an imminent danger situation is found, alleged, or otherwise
brought to the attention of the Safety Director or Inspector during
a routine inspection, he shall immediately inspect the imminent
danger situation in accordance with Section XII of this plan before
inspecting the remaining portions of the establishment, facility, or
worksite.
c. An administrative representative of the employer and a
representative authorized by the employees shall be given an
opportunity to consult with and/or to accompany the Safety
Director or Inspector during the physical inspection of any
worksite for the purpose of aiding such inspection.
d. The right of accompaniment may be denied any person whose
conduct interferes with a full and orderly inspection.
e. The conduct of the inspection shall be such as to preclude
unreasonable disruptions of the operation(s) of the workplace.
f. Interviews of employees during the course of the inspection may be
made when such interviews are considered essential to
investigative techniques.
g. Advance Notice of inspections
1. Generally, advance notice of inspections will not be given as
this precludes the opportunity to make minor or temporary
APP-A-16
adjustments in an attempt to create misleading impression
of conditions in an establishment.
2. There may be occasions when advance notice of inspections
will be necessary in order to conduct an effective inspection
or investigation. When advance notice of inspection is
given, employees or their authorized representative(s) will
also be given notice of the inspection.
h. The Safety Director need not personally make an inspection of
each and every worksite once every thirty (30) days. He may
delegate the responsibility for such inspections to supervisors or
other personnel provided:
1. Inspections conducted by supervisors or other personnel are
at least as effective as those made by the Safety Director.
2. Records are made of the inspections, any discrepancies
found and corrective actions taken. This information is
forwarded to the Safety Director.
i. The Safety Director shall maintain records of inspections to
include identification of worksite inspected, date of inspection,
description of violations of standards or other unsafe conditions or
practices found, and corrective action taken toward abatement.
Said inspection records shall be subject to review by the
Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development or his
authorized representative.
XII. IMMINENT DANGER PROCEDURES
a. Any discovery, any allegation, or any report of imminent danger
shall be handled in accordance with the following procedures:
1. The Safety Director shall immediately be informed of the
alleged imminent danger situation and he shall immediately
ascertain whether there is a reasonable basis for the
allegation.
2. If the alleged imminent danger situation is determined to
have merit by the Safety Director, he shall make or cause to
be made an immediate inspection of the alleged imminent
danger location.
3. As soon as it is concluded from such inspection that
conditions or practices exist which constitutes an imminent
danger, the Safety Director or Compliance Inspector shall
attempt to have the danger corrected. All employees at the
location shall be informed of the danger and the supervisor
APP-A-17
or person in charge of the worksite shall be requested to
remove employees from the area, if deemed necessary.
4. The administrative or operational head of the workplace in
which the imminent danger exists, or his authorized
representative, shall be responsible for determining the
manner in which the imminent danger situation will be
abated. This shall be done in cooperation with the Safety
Director or Compliance Inspector and to the mutual
satisfaction of all parties involved.
5. The imminent danger shall be deemed abated if:
i. The imminence of the danger has been eliminated by
removal of employees from the area of danger.
ii. Conditions or practices which resulted in the
imminent danger have been eliminated or corrected
to the point where an unsafe condition or practice no
longer exists.
6. A written report shall be made by or to the Safety Director
describing in detail the imminent danger and its abatement.
This report will be maintained by the Safety Director in
accordance with subsection (i) of Section XI of this plan.
b. Refusal to Abate
1. Any refusal to abate an imminent danger situation shall be
reported to the Safety Director and Chief Executive Officer
immediately.
2. The Safety Director and/or Chief Executive Officer shall
take whatever action may be necessary to achieve
abatement.
XIII. ABATEMENT ORDERS AND HEARINGS
a. Whenever, as a result of an inspection or investigation, the Safety
Director or Compliance Inspector(s) finds that a worksite is not in
compliance with the standards, rules or regulations pursuant to
this plan and is unable to negotiate abatement with the
administrative or operational head of the worksite within a
reasonable period of time, the Safety Director shall:
1. Issue an abatement order to the head of the worksite.
2. Post or cause to be posted, a copy of the abatement order at
or near each location referred to in the abatement order.
APP-A-18
b. Abatement orders shall contain the following information:
1. The standard, rule, or regulation which was found to be
violated.
2. A description of the nature and location of the violation.
3. A description of what is required to abate or correct the
violation.
4. A reasonable period of time during which the violation must
be abated or corrected.
c. At any time within ten (10) days after receipt of an abatement
order, anyone affected by the order may advise the Safety Director
in writing of any objections to the terms and conditions of the
order. Upon receipt of such objections, the Safety Director shall act
promptly to hold a hearing with all interested and/or responsible
parties in an effort to resolve any objections. Following such
hearing, the Safety Director shall, within three (3) working days,
issue an abatement order and such subsequent order shall be
binding on all parties and shall be final.
XIV. PENALTIES
a. No civil or criminal penalties shall be issued against any official,
employee, or any other person for failure to comply with safety and
health standards or any rules or regulations issued pursuant to
this Program Plan.
b. Any employee, regardless of status, who willfully and/or repeatedly
violates, or causes to be violated, any safety and health standard,
rule, or regulation or any abatement order shall be subject to
disciplinary action by the appointing authority. It shall be the duty
of the appointing authority to administer discipline by taking
action in one of the following ways as appropriate and warranted:
1. Oral reprimand.
2. Written reprimand.
3. Suspension for three (3) or more working days.
4. Termination of employment.
XV. CONFIDENTIALITY OF PRIVILEGED INFORMATION
All information obtained by or reported to the Safety Director pursuant to this
plan of operation or the legislation (ordinance, or executive order) enabling this
Occupational Safety and Health Program Plan which contains or might reveal
information which is otherwise privileged shall be considered confidential. Such
APP-A-19
information may be disclosed to other officials or employees concerned with
carrying out this Program Plan or when relevant in any proceeding under this
Program Plan. Such information may also be disclosed to the Commissioner of
Labor and Workforce Development or their authorized representatives in
carrying out their duties under the Tennessee Occupational Safety and Health
Act of 1972.
