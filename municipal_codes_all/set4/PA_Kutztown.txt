actions) to remedy such emergency. Such emergency order shall be
effective immediately upon issuance. Any person to whom such order is
directed shall comply therewith immediately. Said person may file an appeal
or request for modification or waiver to the Housing License Appeals Board
regarding such order, but such appeal or request for modification or waiver
shall not serve as a supersedeas to the Code Enforcement Officer's
emergency order.

authority of the Code Enforcement Officer or other enforcement authority
to issue or file summary citations and to prosecute such summary citations
and/or to file and pursue civil proceedings, whether at law and/or in equity,
before a District Justice, the Court of Common Pleas of Berks County and/
or other permitted authority, regarding violations of the HLAB Jurisdictional
Laws and the abatement of such violations; provided, however, that
summary citations may be issued or filed and prosecuted during the
pendency of proceedings before the Housing License Appeals Board only if
a violation of § 12-30 of this chapter is alleged.

provide for the forms and procedures to be utilized in the filing and
processing of appeals and requests for modification or waivers before the

of Kutztown ("borough") and to the citizens and services consumers of the
borough. However, the unique characteristics of electronic systems utilized
for the making of payments, either by the transfer of funds or the granting
of credit, require modifications to the Code of the Borough of Kutztown in
order to clarify the use and application of such electronic systems in the
context of the making of payments to the borough for various purposes.
By enacting the electronic payment provisions set forth in this article, the
Borough Council of the Borough of Kutztown ("Council") intends to facilitate
the use of electronic systems in the remittance of sums to the borough

card transactions, point-of-sale transfers, automated teller machine
transfers and electronic deposit of funds. The term "electronic payment"
shall not include a transaction originated by or involving currency, check,
draft or similar paper instrument, whether or not the transaction involves
the use of an electronic device or telephone.

any reason, including, without limitation, any fee, charge, interest charge,
penalty, fine, permit fee, license fee, application fee, appeal fee, user

transaction, shall be subject to approval by the Council, from time to time,
by means of a resolution.

creates a nuisance and interferes with the peace and good order of
the Borough of Kutztown.
(2) The Council of the Borough of Kutztown further finds that the
possession of an open or unsealed container containing an
alcoholic beverage or the consumption of alcoholic beverages on
public ways and public places is a serious, substantial and
significant cause of persons (especially, but not limited to, persons
who are under the legal age for alcoholic consumption) becoming
unruly, disruptive, disorderly, uncontrollable, obnoxious, offensive
and of a general character detrimental to the health, welfare and
peaceful orderliness of the community. In addition, the allowance of
possession of an open or unsealed container containing an
alcoholic beverage or consumption of alcoholic beverages on public
ways and public places has been proven to be a significant and
substantial cause in the congregation of persons who in turn
significantly and substantially cause and promote unruly,
disruptive, disorderly, uncontrollable, obnoxious, offensive and
generally detrimental behavior.
(3) The Council of the Borough of Kutztown finds that this Article is
necessary and proper to promote the health, welfare and safety of
the general public and that the restrictions on conduct created by
this Article are not unduly harsh or restrictive and are necessary
and proper pursuant to the police power of the Borough of
Kutztown.

Borough's meter charts.
A. Adjustment of error. The consumer shall accept as a standard of
measurement the meter or meters installed by the Borough. Should the
meter or meters become defective or fail to register correctly, the
amount of energy used shall be determined by a test of the meter or
meters, by the registration of a meter or meters replacing the defective
meter or meters during the period next following or by the amount of
energy used during a corresponding period of the preceding year. In the
event that it is ascertained that the meter is registering at a rate of 1%
or more faster than normal, then the consumer shall receive a credit
adjustment based upon the consumer's (or his predecessor's) kilowatthour
consumption during the two-year period preceding the testing of
the meter.
B. Meter tests. The Borough, at its own expense, will make periodic tests
and inspections of its meters in order to maintain them at a high
standard of accuracy, but the Borough reserves the right to make a
charge, at a rate as from time to time shall be determined by Borough
Council,63 for any additional tests or inspections made at the request of
the consumer, provided that such test finds the meter to be correct
within prescribed tolerances of accuracy.
A. Notice of trouble. The consumer shall notify the Borough promptly of
any defect in, accident to or trouble with or damage to Borough lines or
property that he or she may discover.

[Adopted 10-19-2010 by Ord. No. 7-2010]
§ 107-55. Title.
This article shall be known and may be cited as the "Kutztown Borough
Customer Generation Ordinance."
§ 107-56. Customer eligibility.
§ 107-57. Application for interconnection.
A customer seeking to interconnect an eligible electric-generating facility to
the Borough's system must submit to the Borough's designated personnel a
completed interconnection application on the form designated the Borough,
and a one-line diagram showing the configuration of the proposed net
metering facility. The Borough will provide copies of all applicable forms
upon request.
A. For the purpose of this article, an eligible customer generator's electricgenerating
facility must comply with all of the following requirements:
(1) Generate electricity using photovoltaic systems, fuel cell, hydro or
wind;
(2) A residential customer generator's rate capacity shall not be in

electric distribution system without adversely effecting the
operation of equipment and service of the Borough and its
customers and without presenting safety hazards to Borough
personnel and Borough residents.
B. Requests for interconnection which meet all of the above requirements
except for the fact that the proposed customer generator's rate capacity
is in excess of the above established limits will be considered on a caseby-
case basis, and the Borough Council may permit exceptions to the
above limits when the exception is deemed to be in the best interest of
the Borough.
§ 107-55 DANCES, PUBLIC § 107-58
99:173
§ 107-58. Interconnection agreement.
An interconnection agreement between the Borough and the eligible
customer generator must be executed before the net metering facility may
be interconnected with the Borough's system. Said agreement shall be
provided by the Borough and a sample of same may be obtained from the
Borough Secretary.
§ 107-59. Technical specifications.
A customer generator's equipment and installation must comply with the
Borough's technical requirements for customer-owned generation. Said
requirements shall be kept on file with the Borough Secretary. All customer
generator equipment shall be installed in accordance with the
manufacturer's specifications as well as all applicable provisions of the
National Electrical Code and state and local codes. All customer generator

lockable, visible-break, alternating current (AC) isolation device
[Customer Owned Generation Disconnect Switch(s)] which is readily
accessible to Borough personnel and is clearly labeled.
C. The Borough may, at its own discretion, isolate any customer generator
facility if the Borough has reason to believe that continued
interconnection with said electric-generating facility creates or
contributes to a system of emergency.
D. The Borough may perform reasonable on-site inspections to verify the
proper installation and continuing safe operation of the net metering
facility and the interconnection facilities, at reasonable times and upon

at the same location upon notification to the Borough and verification
that the installation is in compliance with all applicable safety and power
quality standards. All other conditions of service set forth in this article or
referenced herein shall apply to the transferee.
§ 107-64. Metering.
Net energy metering shall be accomplished using a standard kilowatt-hour
meter capable of measuring the flow of electricity in two directions. If the
existing electrical meter installed at the customer's facility is not capable
of measuring the flow of electricity in two directions, the customer shall
be responsible for all expenses for the purchase and installation of an
appropriate meter or meters with such capability. In the case where two
meters are used, the reading of the meter measuring the flow of energy
from the customer to the company shall be subtracted from the reading of
the meter measuring the flow of energy from the company to the customer
to obtain a measurement of the net kilowatt-hours for billing purposes.
§ 107-65. Billing provisions. [Amended 7-19-2011 by Ord. No.
7-2011]
A. Customer net purchase of electricity. If at the end of the billing month,
the customer generator has consumed more kilowatt-hours of
electricity then the customers facility has produced, than all applicable
charges of the appropriate rate schedule shall be applied to the net
kilowatt-hours of Borough-supplied electricity that the customer
generator has consumed.
B. Customer generator net sale of electricity. If at the end of the billing
month, the customer generator facility has produced more kilowatthours
of electricity than the customer has consumed from Boroughsupplied
electricity, then the customer generator will receive a dollar
credit for each net excess kilowatt-hour received by the Borough from
the customer generator. This dollar credit will be based on the current
billed kilowatt-hours for the billing period. This credit will be reflected
on the bill as a line item. The customer will see the billed kilowatt-hours
and a line item for the credited kilowatt-hours in dollars. Should the
§ 107-62 DANCES, PUBLIC § 107-65

The Borough may disconnect the customer generator's service from the
Borough's electric system if the customer generator fails to comply with any
of the provisions of this article or the referenced technical specifications.
credit exceed the billed kilowatt-hours, a dollar balance forward will
continue on the account into the next billing period. The customer
generator is, in all cases, responsible for the customer charge and other
charges in the applicable rate schedule.
C. Customer generator net sale of electricity resulting in a buy-back in
excess of kilowatt-hours generated. A credit to repurchase excess
kilowatt-hours will be issued in terms of a dollar credit to purchase back
excess generated electricity at a buy-back price of 4.127 cents per
kilowatt-hour for this initial 2011 year. Annually thereafter, this price
will be revised to reflect the sale of excess energy rate included in the
current period approved budget. This credit will carry forward as a
balance on the customer statement and be applied during the next
billing cycle. A line item credit will appear on the customer bill
depicting the credit buy-back.
D. Customer net sale of electricity resulting in fifty-percent reduction in
electricity purchases. If, in any calendar year, a customer generator
receiving service under this rider self-generates electricity equal to
50% or more of the customer generators total purchase of electricity
through the Boroughs transmission and distribution network for the
calendar year immediately prior to the installation of the customer
generator facility, then the Borough reserves the right to begin to bill
the customer generator a surcharge equal to its pro rata share of
stranded delivery costs (SDC surcharge).The SDC surcharge, if applied,
is intended to prevent interclass or intraclass shifting of the delivery
cost to other Borough customers, in order to prevent other Borough
customers from being required, in effect, to subsidize service to
customer generators. The Borough, upon specific determination that a
customer's customer generator has or will exceed its fifty-percent
electricity reduction limitation, may at its sole option, and at any time
notify the customer generator of the Boroughs intent to apply the SDC
surcharge to the customer generators monthly bill. When deemed
necessary or appropriate by the Borough, the Borough will assess the
applicability of any imposed SDC surcharge. In the event the Borough
determines the SDC surcharge to be no longer applicable, the Borough
will discontinue billing the same to the customer generator.

12 months after the date of issuance of the permit or the permit shall
expire unless a time extension is granted, in writing, by the Floodplain
Administrator. The actual "start of construction" means either the first
placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as
the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction
of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the
placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent
construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it
include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as
garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main
structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual "start of
construction" means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or
other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects
the external dimensions of the building.

Floodplain Areas
§ 123-17. Identification.
§ 123-18. Description; special requirements.
A. The identified floodplain area shall be:
(1) Any areas of the Borough of Kutztown, classified as special flood
hazard areas (SFHAs) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and the
accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs), dated July 3,
2012, and issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA) or the most recent revision thereof, including all digital
data developed as part of the Flood Insurance Study; and
(2) Any community-identified flood hazard areas.
B. The above-referenced FIS and FIRMs, and any subsequent revisions
and amendments are hereby adopted by the Borough of Kutztown and
declared to be a part of this chapter.
A. The identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific
areas:
(1) The Floodway Area/District identified as "floodway" in the FIS
which represents the channel of a watercourse and the adjacent
land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base
flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation
by more than one foot at any point. This term shall also include
floodway areas which have been identified in other available
studies or sources of information for those special floodplain areas
where no floodway has been identified in the FIS.
(a) Within any floodway area, no encroachments, including fill,
new construction, substantial improvements, or other
development shall be permitted unless it has been
demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
performed in accordance with standard engineering practice
that the proposed encroachment would not result in any
increase in flood levels within the community during the
occurrence of the base flood discharge.
(b) No new construction or development shall be allowed, unless a
permit is obtained from the Department of Environmental
Protection Regional Office.
(2) The AE Area/District without floodway shall be those areas
identified as an "AE Zone" on the FIRM included in the FIS
prepared by FEMA and for which base flood elevations have been
provided in the FIS but no floodway has been delineated. In AE
Area/District without floodway, no new development shall be
§ 123-17 FIRE PREVENTION § 123-18
119:213
§ 123-19. Changes in identification of area.
The identified floodplain area may be revised or modified by the Borough
Council where studies or information provided by a qualified agency or
person documents the need for such revision. However, prior to any such
change, approval must be obtained from FEMA. Additionally, as soon as
practicable, but not later than six months after the date such information
becomes available, the applicant shall notify FEMA of the changes by
submitting technical or scientific data.
§ 123-20. Boundary disputes.
Should a dispute concerning any identified floodplain boundary arise, an
initial determination shall be made by the Borough of Kutztown Planning
permitted unless it can be demonstrated that the cumulative effect
of all past and projected development will not increase the BFE by
more than one foot.
(3) The A Area/District shall be those areas identified as an "A Zone" on
the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no
one-percent-annual-chance flood elevations have been provided.
For these areas, elevation and floodway information from other
federal, state, or other acceptable source shall be used when
available. Where other acceptable information is not available, the
elevation shall be determined by using the elevation of a point on
the boundary of the identified floodplain area which is nearest the
construction site. In lieu of the above, the municipality may require
the applicant to determine the elevation with hydrologic and
hydraulic engineering techniques. Hydrologic and hydraulic
analyses shall be undertaken only by professional engineers or
others of demonstrated qualifications, who shall certify that the
technical methods used correctly reflect currently accepted
technical concepts. Studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be
submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review
by the municipality.
B. No permit shall be granted for any construction, development, use, or
activity within any floodway area that would cause any increase in the
BFE.
C. No permit shall be granted for any construction, development, use, or
activity within any AE Area/District without floodway unless it is
demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development
would not, together with all other existing and anticipated
development, increase the BFE than one foot at any point.
D. No new construction or development shall be located within the area
measured 50 feet landward from the top-of-bank of any watercourse,
unless a permit is obtained from the Department of Environmental
Protection Regional Office.

Commission, and any party aggrieved by this decision or determination may
appeal to the Borough Zoning Hearing Board. The burden of proof shall be
on the appellant.
§ 123-21. Jurisdictional boundary changes.
Prior to development occurring in areas where annexation or other
corporate boundary changes are proposed or have occurred, the community
shall review flood hazard data affecting the lands subject to boundary
changes. The community shall adopt and enforce floodplain regulations in
areas subject to annexation or corporate boundary changes which meet or
exceed those in 44 CFR 60.3.

SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT 
UNIFORM CONSTRUCTION CODE (UCC)  The statewide building code
adopted by the Pennsylvania General Assembly in 1999 applicable to new
construction in all municipalities, whether administered by the municipality,
a third party or the Department of Labor and Industry. Applicable to

specifically to various sections of the IRC and the IBC.
VIOLATION  The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A
structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other
certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in 44 CFR

violation until such time as that documentation is provided.
Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a
structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of the market value
of the structure before the start of construction of the improvement.
This term includes structures which have incurred substantial damage
regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include any project for improvement of a structure to correct
existing violations of state or local health, sanitary or safety code
specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement
official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living
conditions.
A.
Historic structures undergoing repair or rehabilitation that would
constitute a substantial improvement as defined in this chapter must
comply with all ordinance requirements that do not preclude the
structure's continued designation as an historic structure.
Documentation that a specific ordinance requirement will cause
removal of the structure from the National Register of Historic Places
or the State Inventory of Historic Places must be obtained from the
Secretary of the Interior or the State Historic Preservation Officer. Any
exemption from ordinance requirements will be the minimum necessary
to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.

the unit which the Code Enforcement Officer determines or has
information to reasonably believe is in violation of the provisions of this
chapter or any rule or regulation adopted pursuant to it.
E. The housing license required by this chapter, when issued to the owner
or agent on behalf of the owner of a unit, shall constitute notice to such
owner or agent of the maximum number of persons that may lawfully
occupy the unit and the residential uses therefor.
F. Any owner or agent who, upon receipt of a housing license, disputes the
use and/or maximum occupancy listed thereon, may request in writing
a meeting concerning such use and/or occupancy with the Code
Enforcement Officer, such request to be filed within 10 business days
after receipt of the housing license. If the dispute cannot be resolved in
the aforesaid meeting with the Code Enforcement Officer, the owner or
agent may appeal to the Housing License Appeals Board as provided for
in Article II of Chapter 12 of the Code of the Borough of Kutztown, in
which case such appeal period shall commence on the day of such
meeting; provided, however, that any appeal of any aspect of a housing
license which sets forth a determination pursuant to Chapter 225,
entitled "Zoning," of the Code of the Borough of Kutztown, shall be
appealed in the manner set forth in said Chapter 225.
A. Any person who violates or fails to comply with any of the provisions of
this chapter or any order, notice, rule or regulation issued or made in
connection herewith shall, upon conviction thereof, pay a fine of not
less than $50 nor more than $1,000 and, in default of the payment
thereof, shall undergo imprisonment in the Berks County Prison for a
period not exceeding 30 days.
§ 135-9 KUTZTOWN CODE § 135-10
119:256
B. Every violation of this chapter shall constitute a separate offense, and
each day such violation exists shall constitute a separate offense. In the
event that any regulated unit is occupied by more than the maximum
number of persons allowed by and listed on the housing license issued
in accordance with § 135-3 of this chapter, then each day of occupancy
by each such person in excess of such maximum number of occupants
shall constitute a separate offense under this chapter. It shall be a
violation of this chapter to let a unit subject to regulation under this
chapter after nonrenewal, suspension and/or revocation of a housing
license pursuant to § 135-10C through F of this chapter.
C. Disciplinary actions. Subject to the procedure set forth in § 135-9A of
this chapter, the Code Enforcement Officer may initiate the disciplinary
actions set forth in this § 135-10C against an owner or agent with
respect to a regulated unit for any of the reasons set forth in § 135-10D
of this chapter:
(1) Formal warning: the formal written notification of at least one
violation of this chapter. Upon satisfactory compliance with this
chapter and any conditions imposed by the Code Enforcement
Officer and/or the Housing License Appeals Board, formal warnings
shall be removed when the owner applies for housing license
renewal when required by this chapter.
(2) Nonrenewal: the denial of the privilege to apply for housing license
renewal for a regulated unit after expiration of the license term.
The owner shall be permitted to maintain occupants in the
regulated unit in question until the end of the current license term
but the Code Enforcement Officer shall not accept applications for
renewal of the housing license until the expiration of the time set
by the Housing License Appeals Board.
(3) Suspension: the immediate loss of the privilege to let the regulated
unit for a period of time set by the Code Enforcement Officer or the
Housing License Appeals Board. The Code Enforcement Officer
may suspend only until the matter can be scheduled for the next
possible Housing License Appeals Board meeting, at which meeting
the Housing License Appeals Board shall consider the propriety of
the suspension and set the period of time for its duration, if it is to
be continued. The owner or agent, after the expiration of the
suspension period, may apply for housing license renewal for the
regulated unit without the need to show cause why the owner or
agent's privilege to apply for an housing license should be
reinstated. Upon suspension, the owner or agent shall take
immediate steps to evict the occupants of the regulated unit in
question.
(4) Revocation: The immediate loss of the privilege to let the regulated
unit for a period of time set by the Code Enforcement Officer or the
Housing License Appeals Board and the loss of the privilege to
apply for renewal of the housing license at the expiration of said
§ 135-10 FIRE PREVENTION § 135-10
119:257
time period. The Code Enforcement Officer may revoke only until
the matter can be scheduled for the next possible Housing License
Appeals Board meeting, at which meeting the Housing License
Appeals Board shall consider the propriety of the revocation and
set the period of time for its duration, if it is to be continued.
Upon the loss of the privilege to let, the owner or agent shall take
immediate steps to evict the occupants of the regulated unit in
question.
D. Grounds for imposing discipline.
(1) Actions subject to discipline.
(a) Any of the following may subject an owner to discipline as
provided for in § 135-10C:
[1] Failure to abate a violation of the Performance Codes and/
or this chapter applicable to the premises within the time
directed by the Code Enforcement Officer.
[2] Refusal to permit the inspection of the premises by the
Code Enforcement Officer as required by this chapter.
[3] Failure to take such actions as may be required or
necessary to cause any open DCR to be deemed a closed
DCR by the Code Enforcement Officer by the end of the
license year in which the DCR was issued, including, but
not limited to, failure to respond to notice of a DCR or
failure to perform an approved remedial plan in any
material respect. Such failure occurring with respect to
one or more open DCRs in each of two license years, when
at least two of such open DCRs were issued within a period
of 60 months, shall without more, constitute sufficient
grounds for nonrenewal as of the commencement of a
license year and/or for suspension or revocation. If a DCR
is received within the last 20 business days of the license
year, the owner shall have 20 business days from the date
of receipt of the notice of the issuance of DCR to cause the
Open DCR to be deemed a closed DCR, regardless of the
date of the end of the license year.
[4] Failure to remedy and prevent further violations of this
chapter, other than with respect to disruptive conduct.
(b) For purposes of this subsection, there need be no criminal
conviction before a violation can be found to exist.
(2) No discipline involving nonrenewal, suspension and/or revocation
shall be permitted unless the discipline has been preceded by the
issuance of a formal warning involving the same grounds for
discipline at least 10 days prior to the taking of the new disciplinary
action. A formal warning shall be issued when there exists one or
§ 135-10 KUTZTOWN CODE § 135-10
119:258
more open DCRs in each of two license years and at least two of
such open DCRs were issued within a period of 60 months.
E. Criteria for application of discipline.
(1) With respect to the issuance of a Level 2 DCR, the Code
Enforcement Officer, when considering which of the discipline
options to utilize as set forth in this section, and the Housing
License Appeals Board, when deciding any discipline matter under
this section, shall consider the following:
(a) The effect of the violation on the health, safety and welfare of
the occupants of the regulated unit and other residents of the
premises.
(b) The effect of the violation on the neighborhood.
(c) Whether the owner has a record of prior violations of this
chapter and other ordinances of the Borough of Kutztown or
has received notices of violations as provided for in this
chapter, whether or not related to the regulated units in
question. In this regard, no closed DCR (and any enforcement
actions related thereto) shall be considered.
(d) Whether the owner has been subject to prior discipline under
this chapter. In this regard, no closed DCR (and any
enforcement actions related thereto) shall be considered. The
prior issuance of a formal warning in connection with the open
DCR shall be considered.
(e) The effect of disciplinary action on the occupants.
(f) The action taken by the owner or agent to remedy the violation
and to prevent future violations, including any approved
remedial plan submitted by the owner or agent in response to a
Level 2 DCR with respect to any open DCR.
(g) The suitability of the policies and rental agreement or lease
terms employed by the owner or agent to manage the
regulated unit to enable the owner or agent to comply with the
provisions of this chapter.
(h) When an open Level 2 DCR is under consideration, the nature
of the associated criminal enforcement and/or other legal
actions, the nature of the owner's violations of this chapter and
the degree of the owner's unresponsiveness.
(2) In addition to applying discipline as set forth in this section relating
to a Level 2 DCR, the Code Enforcement Officer may recommend
and the Housing License Appeals Board may impose upon the
existing license [or subsequent license(s) with respect to the
Performance Codes] reasonable conditions related to the regulated
§ 135-10 FIRE PREVENTION § 135-10
119:259
unit in question for the purpose of fulfilling the goals of this
chapter.
F. Procedure for formal warning, Nonrenewal, suspension or revocation of
license.
(1) Following a determination that grounds exist for a formal warning
or for nonrenewal, suspension or revocation of a housing license,
the Code Enforcement Officer shall notify the owner or agent of the
action to be taken and the reason therefor. Such notification shall
be in writing, addressed to the owner or agent, and shall contain
the following information:
(a) The address and identification of the particular regulated
unit(s) affected.
(b) A description of the violation which has been found to exist.
(c) A statement that the owner or agent will receive a formal
warning, or that the housing license for the affected regulated
unit(s) will be subject to suspension or revocation or
nonrenewal for the next license year beginning August 1. In
the case of a suspension or revocation, the notice shall state
the date upon which such suspension or revocation will
commence, and in the case of a suspension the notice shall also
state the duration of the suspension.
(d) A statement that, due to the nonrenewal, suspension or
revocation (as the case may be) of the housing license, the
owner or agent or any person acting on the owner's behalf is
prohibited from letting or permitting occupancy of the affected
regulated unit(s) from and during the period said disciplinary
action is in effect.
(e) A statement informing the owner or agent of the owner's right
to appeal the decision to issue a formal warning or to subject
the housing license in question to suspension, revocation or
nonrenewal to the Housing License Appeals Board, as provided
in this chapter.
(2) The procedures applicable to this § 135-10F shall be the same
those of § 135-9A of this chapter, excepting § 135-9A(1) and (2).
G. In addition to any other remedy, discipline or enforcement action
provided for in this chapter, the Borough of Kutztown may enforce this
chapter by pursuing a civil action, including an action in equity or other
equitable injunctive relief, including therewith:
(1) The decision by the Borough of Kutztown to pursue any such action
shall not be deemed an election of remedy so as to preclude other
enforcement, disciplinary or other remedies available to the
Borough of Kutztown for enforcement of this chapter; and
§ 135-10 KUTZTOWN CODE § 135-10
119:260
§ 135-11. Severability.
It is the intention of Borough Council that each separate provision of this
chapter shall be independent of all other provisions herein, and it is further
the intention of Borough Council that if any of the provisions of this chapter
be declared to be invalid, all of the other provisions hereof shall remain
valid and in force.
§ 135-12. Repealer.
All ordinances or resolutions, or parts of ordinances or resolutions, insofar
as they are inconsistent with this chapter, including but not limited to any
portions of Chapter 135 of the Code of the Borough of Kutztown in effect on
the date of enactment of this chapter, are hereby repealed.

ARTICLE I
Fire Loss Claims
[Adopted 7-11-1995 as Ord. No. 7-1995]
§ 138-1. Requirements for payment of claim.
No insurance company, association or exchange (hereinafter the "insurer")
doing business in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania shall pay a claim of
a named insured for fire damage to a structure located within the borough
where the amount recoverable for the fire loss to the structure under all
policies exceeds seven thousand five hundred dollars ($7,500.) unless the
insurer is furnished by the borough's Treasurer with a certificate pursuant
to § 508(b) of the Act86 and unless there is compliance with the procedure
set forth in § 508(c) and (d) of the Act.
§ 138-2. Procedure for recouping unpaid municipal claims and
expenses.
A. Where there are delinquent taxes, assessments, penalties or user
charges against the property damaged by fire ("municipal claims"), or
there are expenses which the borough has incurred as costs for the
removal, repair or securing of a building or other structure on the
property (collectively, "municipal expenses"), the Manager of the
borough shall immediately render a certificate and bill for such
municipal claims and municipal expenses, if he has not already done so.
B. Upon written request of the named insured specifying the tax
description of the property, the name and address of the insurer and the
date of receipt by the insurer of a loss report of the claim, the Treasurer
shall furnish, within fourteen (14) working days after the request, to the
insurer, a certificate (or at his discretion an oral notification confirmed
in writing) either:
(1) Stating that there are no unpaid municipal claims or municipal
expenses against the property; or
(2) Specifying the nature and amount of such municipal claims or
municipal expenses, accompanied by a statement for such
amounts. Taxes, assessments, penalties and user charges shall be
deemed delinquent for this purpose, if a lien could have been filed
for such claims under applicable law.
C. Upon receipt of a certificate and bill pursuant to Subsection B(2), the
insurer shall transfer to the Borough Treasurer an amount from the
insurance proceeds sufficient to pay such sums prior to making
payment to the names insured, subject to the provisions of § 138-3
hereof.
86.Editor's Note: The Insurance Company Law of 1921, as amended by Act 98 of 1992 and Act
93 of 1994. See 40 P.S. § 638.
§ 138-1 INSURANCE § 138-3
138:267
§ 138-3. Payment of claim to insured; claims exceeding aggregate
limits of liability.
When all municipal claims and municipal expenses have been paid pursuant
to § 138-2, or where the Treasurer has issued a certificate described in
§ 138-2B(1) indicating that there are no municipal claims or municipal
expenses against the property, the insurer shall pay the claim of the named
insured; provided, however, that if the loss agreed upon by the named
insured and the insurer equals or exceeds sixty percent (60%) of the
aggregate limits of liability on all fire policies covering the building or
structure, the following procedures must be followed:
A. The insurer shall transfer, from the insurance proceeds to the Borough
Treasurer, in the aggregate, two thousand dollars ($2,000.) for each
fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000.) of such claim or fraction thereof.
B. If at the time a loss report is submitted by the insured such insured has
submitted to the insurer, with a copy to the borough, a contractor's
signed estimate of the costs of removing, repairing or securing the
building or other structure in an amount less than the amount
calculated under the foregoing formula, the insurer shall transfer to the
Borough Treasurer, from the insurance proceeds, the amount specified
in the estimate. If there is more than one (1) insurer, the transfer of
proceeds shall be on a pro rata basis by all insurers insuring the
building or other structure.
C. Upon receipt of the above-described portion of the insurance proceeds,
the Borough Treasurer shall do the following:
(1) Place the proceeds in a separate fund to be used solely as security
against the total municipal expenses anticipated by the borough to
be required in removing, repairing or securing the building or
structure. Such costs shall include, without limitation, all
engineering, legal or administrative costs incurred by the borough
in connection with such removal, repair or securing or any
proceedings related thereto.
(2) Mail to the named insured, at the address received from the
insurer, a notice that the proceeds have been received by the
borough and that the procedures enacted herein shall be followed.
(3) After the transfer of the proceeds into the separate fund, the named
insured may submit to the borough a contractor's signed estimate
of the costs of removing, repairing or securing the building or other
structure, in which event the Borough Treasurer shall, if such
estimate is deemed by the Treasurer to be reasonable, return to the
insured the amount of the funds transferred to the borough in
excess of that required to pay the municipal expenses already
incurred, provided that the borough has not commenced to remove,
repair or secure the building or other structure, in which case the
borough will complete the work and deduct the municipal expenses
incurred from such separate fund.
§ 138-3 KUTZTOWN CODE § 138-3
138:268
§ 138-4. Violations and penalties.
Any owner of property, any named insured or insurer who violates the
provisions of this Article or who shall fail to comply with any of the
requirements hereof shall be liable, upon summary conviction, to a fine and
penalty of not less than one hundred dollars ($100.) nor more than one
thousand dollars ($1,000.), which fine and penalty may be collected by suit
or summary proceeding.
(4) Pay to the Borough Manager, for reimbursement to the borough
general fund, the amount of the municipal expenses paid by the
borough.
(5) Pay the remaining balance in the separate fund (without interest)
to the named insured upon receipt of a certificate issued by the
Code Enforcement Officer of the borough (or other applicable
official of the borough) that the repair, removal or securing of the
building or other structure has been completed in accordance with
all applicable ordinances, codes and regulations of the borough.
D. Nothing in this Article shall be construed to limit the ability of the
borough to recover any deficiency in the amount of municipal claims or
municipal expenses recoverable pursuant to this Article or recoverable
under any other state law, or other ordinance, or to insurance proceeds,
by an action at law or equity to enforce the ordinances, codes and
regulations of the borough or to enter into an agreement with the
named insured with regard to such other disposition of the proceeds as
the borough may deem reasonable.

§ 155-1. Title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "parade Regulations"
of the Borough of Kutztown.
§ 155-2. Statutory authority.
This chapter is enacted pursuant to the authority of the laws of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, including, but not limited to, Subsections
(1), (6), (17), (20) and (74) of § 1202 of the Pennsylvania Borough Code (53
P.S. § 46202).
§ 155-3. Purpose and intent.
A. The Borough Council of the Borough of Kutztown (the "Council") has
determined that parades are a pleasant, enjoyable and entertaining
event for all members of the community. The Council recognizes,
however, that because such events can draw substantial spectator
crowds, proper planning, including but not limited to, essential
emergency and police services, public restroom facilities, solid waste
removal and traffic control are essential to maintaining the health,
safety and welfare of all persons involved. The Borough of Kutztown
has, in the past, been the host of a Halloween parade drawing
spectators from a wide region that numbered four or five times larger
than the population of the Borough. The enormity of the crowd of
spectators as well as parade participants stressed the resources of the
Kutztown Borough Police Department beyond its capacity to promptly
respond and react to emergency situations. Consequently, it was
necessary to enlist the aid of other law enforcement agencies to provide
assistance in maintaining peace and good order.
B. The Borough Council recognizes the right of the people to peaceably
assemble and speak freely as guaranteed by the United States
Constitution and the Pennsylvania Constitution. The Borough Council,
through the enactment of this chapter, intends only to establish
regulations requiring organizers of parades in our streets to properly
estimate and plan for the public health and safety aspects of proposed

reports and the application on the agenda of the next regularly
scheduled Borough Council meeting, at which meeting the reports
and application shall be reviewed and approved or denied or a
revised application may be required. A person filing an application
shall be present or have an authorized representative present at
such meeting. If the Borough Council is not satisfied that such
application adequately addresses the criteria set forth in § 155-6E,
the Borough Council may direct that the person filing the
application meet with the Borough Manager and Chief of Police to
address the issues raised by the Borough Council. Thereafter, the
person filing the application may present a revised application to
the Borough Council at the next regularly scheduled Borough
Council meeting for approval or denial at such meeting.
E. Review criteria. In reviewing an application, the Borough shall not
consider the political or social affiliation of the person filing the
application, nor that of the parade participants, nor the content of the
message the parade will convey. Rather, the Borough shall use the
following criteria in evaluating an application before making a decision
to issue or refuse to issue a parade permit:
(1) Whether the application has adequately addressed the availability
of parking for participants.
(2) Whether the application has adequately addressed the number and
location of waste receptacles and the removal and disposal of solid
waste and refuse.
(3) Whether the application has adequately addressed the number and
location of restroom facilities to be made available to the public and
to be provided at the sole cost and expense of the applicant.
(4) Whether the application has adequately addressed the number and
location of emergency vehicle break points in or crossing the
proposed parade route.
(5) Whether the application has adequately addressed the number and
location of fire-fighting personnel and fire suppression devices to
be stationed along or in the vicinity of the proposed parade route.
(6) Whether the application has adequately addressed the number of
police personnel and traffic control devices necessary to control
pedestrian and vehicular traffic along and across the proposed
parade route.

§ 155-7. Action on application for parade permit.
(7) Whether the application has adequately addressed the number of
police personnel and traffic control devices necessary to reroute
traffic around the proposed parade route.
(8) Whether the proposed date, time and/or route of the proposed
parade present specific dangers with respect to pedestrian and
vehicular traffic control, emergency access and/or public safety,
resulting from the unique conditions present at such date and time
and/or along such route, which cannot be reasonably be remedied
unless a modification is made to the proposed date, time and/or
route. If the Borough finds that such specific dangers are
presented, it must then offer alternative dates, times and routes for
the proposed parade.
(9) In determining the parade services fee, the Borough shall
determine the amount of the projected cost to the Borough for the
proposed parade which is attributable to the cost of providing
pedestrian and vehicular traffic control, solid waste/refuse removal
and public sanitation/restroom services, but excluding police and
related public safety costs which are not directly related to
pedestrian and vehicular traffic control.
F. Spontaneous parades.
(1) Application. persons or organizations who seek to hold a parade
after the latest date permitted for filing a permit application
required to conduct such a parade under § 155-6C or D (10 days

to the proposed date for a special parade) may apply for a permit to
hold a spontaneous parade. Such applicants must follow the
procedure set forth in § 155-6C for standard parade permits,
except that applications for spontaneous parade permits may be
filed less than 10 days prior to the proposed date of the parade.

application has adequately addressed all criteria set forth in
§ 155-6E within 24 hours after the filing of the permit application.
(3) Limitation on parade route. A spontaneous parade shall be limited
to the streets within the spontaneous parade district for no more
than four hours per twenty-four-hour period. Nothing in this

spontaneous parade district or the public park during its
operational hours.

additional police and emergency services personnel; or the Borough
Council or Borough Manager, as required by § 155-6, fails to make the
finding required by § 155-7A of this chapter. If either such event occurs,
the Borough Secretary shall be directed to provide written notification
of such denial and the specific reasons therefor to the applicant.
C. Notice. In the case of a standard or spontaneous parade, the Borough
Secretary shall provide written notice of approval or denial of the
application within 24 hours after the approval or denial by the Borough
Manager. In the case of a special parade, the Borough Secretary shall
provide written notice of the approval or denial of the application within
72 hours after the approval or denial by the Borough Council. Such
written notice shall be provided to the person who filed the application
at the address as stated in the application.
D. Appeal of standard or spontaneous parade decision. If an applicant for a
standard or spontaneous parade believes that any aspect of the
Borough Manager's decision with respect to the application therefor is
incorrect or illegal, the applicant shall, within 10 days after issuance of
notice of the decision, file a written request with the Borough Secretary
for review of such decision by the Borough Council, stating with
specificity the reasons for the requested review. The Borough Council
shall review the Borough Manager's decision at a Borough Council
meeting, either regularly scheduled or specially scheduled within 10
days after receipt of such request, and shall hear the comments of the
applicant at such meeting. A final decision shall be rendered by the
Borough Council at such meeting. If the Borough Council does not
render a final decision on a request for review of the Borough
Manager's decision by such time that is 48 hours prior to the starting
time for the proposed parade, the request for review shall be deemed
denied.

§ 155-13. Temporary forbearance.
The Borough Council is aware that during its consideration of the
enactment of this chapter and while seeking public comment on its
enactment, citizens may have been planning one or more potential parades.
The Borough Council does not wish to abridge the rights of those persons
contemplating such events. The Borough has also begun public safety
preparations, in advance of the enactment of this chapter and in an effort
to anticipate applications for such parades. Accordingly, all applications
submitted for a special parade, as defined herein, shall be processed in

such action as may be necessary with respect to a standard parade for

parade permit is revoked 48 hours prior to the commencement of the
parade.
B. Within 10 days of the scheduled date of the parade, the person to whom

which must be paid in full as to each clearly defined phase of the
Subdivision or Land Development prior to the issuance of any
building permits within such clearly defined phase of the
Subdivision or Land Development; or, if the developer provides
such security as is deemed satisfactory by the Council of the
borough in its sole discretion for the payment of all recreation fees

recreational fees as provided for in Subsection F(1) hereinabove,
then all such fees shall not be considered to be "paid" for the

§ 161-1. Title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Personnel Policies" of
the Code of the Borough of Kutztown.
§ 161-2. Statutory authority.
This chapter is enacted pursuant to the authority of the laws of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania including but not limited to, §§ (20) and
§§ (74) of § 1202 of the Pennsylvania Borough Code [53 P.S. § 46202(20) and
§ 46202(74)].
§ 161-3. Purpose and intent.
A. The Borough Council (the "Council") of the Borough of Kutztown (the
"Borough") has determined that personnel policies explicitly stating the
requirements, procedures and behavior expected of employees are an
essential part of maintaining a good, clear, and professional employer/
employee relationship with Borough employees. In addition, such
policies must also govern the conduct of elected and appointed Borough
officials in their interactions with other Borough personnel. In the past,
the Council found that cumulatively adopting personnel policies on
given subjects as the official policy of the Borough, was the most
efficient and effective method of establishing the Borough's personnel
policies for Borough employees to follow in the course of their
employment. However, Council has determined that simply adopting
the personnel policy, without more, does not provide adequate
protection for Borough employees adversely affected by violations of
the same. Without enforceable penalties for violations, such personnel
policies leave Borough management and the Council unable to
appropriately respond to complaints and maintain compliance with the
Borough's personnel policies. The Council has also determined that
inadequacies in the Borough's ability to maintain a professional work
environment may result in poor employee morale, reduced productivity,
the loss of valuable Borough employees and/or legal action against the
§ 158-8 (RESERVED) § 161-3
160:303
§ 161-4. Application; administration.
§ 161-5. Adoption of policies.
The Borough Council may, by resolution, adopt policies prohibiting
improper conduct in the Borough workplace by Borough employees and
elected and appointed officials (the "Borough Personnel Policies"), from
time to time, as may be reasonably necessary for the good and efficient
administration and management of the government. Such policy or policies
adopted by resolution shall be cumulative and shall be enforced under
this chapter. In no event shall this chapter be deemed to authorize the
imposition of any Borough Personnel Policies in violation of any collective
bargaining agreement.
§ 161-6. Enforcement.
Borough, all of which represent potential economic loss to the Borough.
The Council desires to avoid such potential loss by maintaining a
healthy, productive and professional work environment.
B. It is the Council's intention to ensure such a work environment within
the Borough government by establishing a method to formally enact the
personnel policies of the Borough, creating an administrative
procedure to address violations of such personnel policies, and
establishing penalties for violation of the same.
A. Application of chapter. This chapter shall apply to all Borough
employees, all elected Borough officials, and all appointed Borough
officials, when acting in the course of their respective employment or
official duties on behalf of the Borough.
B. Administration. This chapter shall be administered by the Borough
Manager and the Personnel Committee of the Borough Council of the
Borough of Kutztown (the "Personnel Committee") as hereinafter
prescribed.
A. Nonuniformed Borough employees. All violations of the Borough
Personnel Policies, adopted pursuant to § 161-5 of this chapter,
allegedly committed by nonuniformed Borough employees shall be
reported to the Borough Manager. The Borough Manager shall
immediately investigate all such reported violations to determine the
veracity of such allegations. The Borough Manager shall provide
written notification of his findings to the nonuniformed Borough
employee and present the same to the Council at a hearing to impose a
penalty in accordance with § 161-7 of this chapter. If the Borough
Manager determines the violation is of such a serious nature as to
require the suspension of a nonuniformed Borough employee or
employees, he shall immediately suspend the employee with pay and
notify the Council of the same at the time of the hearing.
§ 161-3 KUTZTOWN CODE § 161-6
161:304
B. Uniformed employees. All violations of the Borough Personnel Policies,
adopted pursuant to § 161-5 of this chapter, allegedly committed by
uniformed Borough employees shall be reported to the Chief of Police.
The Chief of Police shall immediately investigate all such reported
violations to determine the veracity of such allegations in accordance
with the Kutztown Police Department Code of Discipline. If the Chief of
Police determines the violation is of such a serious nature as to require
the suspension of a uniformed Borough employee or employees, he
shall immediately recommend suspension of the employee or
employees to the Mayor and the Council.
C. Elected and appointed Borough officials. All violations of the Borough
Personnel Policies, adopted pursuant to § 161-5 of this chapter,
allegedly committed by elected and/or appointed Borough officials shall
be reported to the Borough Manager, except in the instance when the
alleged violation of the personnel polices is allegedly committed by the
Borough Manager, in which case the alleged conduct shall be reported
to the Borough Council President. Upon receiving a complaint of
alleged violations of the Borough's personnel policies by an appointed
or elected official, the Borough Manager or the Borough Council
President shall immediately forward said complaint to the Personnel
Committee who shall immediately direct the complaint to special
counsel, a member of the Bar of the State of Pennsylvania excluding the
Solicitor or any member of the Solicitor's law firm, appointed by
Council to investigate allegations that elected or appointed officials
have violated the personnel polices of the Borough of Kutztown. Special
counsel shall have the following duties: [Amended 6-15-2004 by Ord.

(1) Initiate and accomplish a preliminary investigation at his/her sole

are facts which may exist to support the complaint. If the
preliminary investigation fails to establish the facts which support
the complaint, special counsel shall dismiss the complaint and
notify both the complainant and the subject of the complaint of this
dismissal of the complaint. If, however, at the conclusion of the
preliminary investigation, the special counsel determines that
there may exist facts to support the complaint, the special counsel
shall deliver to the Borough Council its findings report.
(5) Upon receiving the findings report from special counsel, the
Borough Council shall conduct a hearing which complies with the
§ 161-6 PERSONNEL POLICIES § 161-6
161:305
§ 161-7. Violations and penalties.
Local Agency Law (2 Pa. C.S.A. § 551 et seq.). Special counsel
during the aforementioned hearing shall present evidence and
testimony in support of the investigated complaint.
D. Investigations and punishment. All investigations and punishment, if
any, of Borough employees and of elected or appointed Borough
officials conducted pursuant to this section shall be held and conducted
in accordance with the Local Agency Law (2 Pa.C.S.A. § 551 et seq) (if

duly appointed Borough superintendent (or their designee then in
charge) shall, pursuant to this chapter, direct any person to
immediately leave a Borough building, facility or property (except when
such person is present there on account of a public meeting or public
hearing) if the Borough Manager, Chief of Police or superintendent
observes such person, engaging in a violation of the Borough of
Kutztown Conduct and Behavior Policy and/or the Borough of Kutztown
Sexual Harassment Policy.
A. Counseling and training. The Borough Council may, in appropriate
circumstances, require that the accused employee or official undergo
such harassment or other counseling or training as the Council believes
is appropriate in order to assure that future violations will not occur.
Successful completion of such counseling or training shall be deemed
an aggravating factor for consideration of the imposition of any
penalties under § 161-7B or C for successive violations hereunder.
B. Nonuniformed Borough employees. All penalties for violation of this
Chapter 161 shall be imposed by the Borough Council of the Borough of
Kutztown at a regular or special meeting. In determining the penalty to
be imposed, the Council shall consider the nature and severity of the
violation, the cost to the Borough of such violation and the penalty
recommended by the Borough Manager. The following possible
penalties or combination of penalties may be imposed:
(1) Informal reprimand. An informal reprimand shall be a verbal
warning informing the Borough employee that a policy violation
has occurred and that such employee shall not commit the same
infraction in the future.

Borough employee or employees, the Council may require that
such elected or appointed Borough official discontinue all
direct communication with the affected Borough employee(s)
and direct that all future communications with such Borough
employee(s) be conducted through a designated member of the
Council or other person.
(b) Borough property. In addition to Subsection D(2)(a) above, the
Council may restrict an elected or appointed Borough official's
access to Borough property. Such access restriction shall be
limited to areas of Borough property where affected Borough
employee(s) work. In the event the restricted appointed or
elected Borough official must have access to areas of Borough
property where affected Borough employee(s) work during

restricted appointed or elected Borough official be escorted by
a designated member of Council or other person to ensure

Sacony Creek Watershed
[Adopted 6-17-2008 by Ord. No. 6-2008104]
§ 189-1. Statement of findings.
The Council of the Borough of Kutztown finds that:
A. Inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting
from development throughout a watershed increases flood flows and
velocities, contributes to erosion and sedimentation, overtaxes the
carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers, greatly
increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater,
undermines floodplain management and flood reduction efforts in
upstream and downstream communities, reduces groundwater
recharge and threatens public health and safety.
B. Inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting
from land development and redevelopment throughout a watershed can
also harm surface water resources by changing the natural hydrologic
patterns, accelerating stream flows (which increase scour and erosion
of streambeds and streambanks thereby elevating sedimentation),
destroying aquatic habitat and elevating aquatic pollutant
concentrations and loadings such as sediments, nutrients, heavy metals
and pathogens. Groundwater resources are also impacted through loss
of recharge.
C. A comprehensive program of stormwater management, including
minimization of impacts of development, redevelopment and activities
causing accelerated erosion, is fundamental to the public health, safety,
welfare and the protection of the people of the Borough of Kutztown
and all the people of the commonwealth, their resources and the
environment.
D. Inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting
from development throughout a watershed poses a threat to surface
water and groundwater quality.
E. Stormwater can be an important water resource by providing
groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams,
which also protects and maintains surface water quality.
F. Through project design, impacts from stormwater runoff can be
minimized to maintain the natural hydrologic regime, and sustain high
water quality, groundwater recharge, stream baseflow and aquatic
ecosystems. The most cost effective and environmentally advantageous
way to manage stormwater runoff is through nonstructural project
design, minimizing impervious surfaces and sprawl, avoiding sensitive

adopted 3-10-1998 by Ord. No. 4-1998.

areas (i.e., stream buffers, floodplains, steep slopes), and designing to
topography and soils to maintain the natural hydrologic regime.
G. Public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an
essential component in successfully addressing stormwater.
H. Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to
implement a program of stormwater controls. These municipalities are
required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their
separate storm sewer systems under the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES).
I. Non-stormwater discharges to municipal separate storm sewer systems
can contribute to pollution of waters of the commonwealth by the
municipality.
A. The purpose of this article is to promote health, safety and welfare
within the Sacony Creek Watershed by minimizing the damages
described in § 189-1A of this article through provisions designed to:
(1) Promote alternative project designs and layout that minimizes
impacts to surface and ground water.
(2) Promote nonstructural BMPs.
(3) Minimize increases in stormwater volume.
(4) Minimize impervious surfaces.
(5) Manage accelerated runoff and erosion and sedimentation
problems at their source by regulating activities that cause these
problems.
(6) Utilize and preserve the existing natural drainage systems.
(7) Manage stormwater impacts close to the runoff source, which
requires a minimum of structures and relies on natural processes.
(8) Focus on infiltration of stormwater to maintain groundwater
recharge, to prevent degradation of surface and ground water
quality and to otherwise protect water resources.
(9) Strive to maintain existing base flows and quality of streams and
watercourses in the Borough of Kutztown and the commonwealth.
(10) Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including
regulations at 25 Pa. Code Chapter 93.4a to protect and maintain
existing uses and maintain the level of water quality to support
those uses in all streams, and to protect and maintain water quality
in special protection streams.
§ 189-1 KUTZTOWN CODE § 189-2
185:376
§ 189-3. Statutory authority.
(11) Address the quality and quantity of stormwater discharges from
the development site.
(12) Provide a mechanism to identify controls necessary to meet the
NPDES permit requirements.
(13) Implement an illegal discharge detection and elimination program
to address non-stormwater discharges into the municipality's
separate storm sewer system.
(14) Preserve and restore the flood-carrying capacity of streams.
(15) Prevent scour and erosion of streambanks and streambeds.
(16) Provide proper maintenance of all permanent stormwater
management facilities that are constructed in the Borough.
(17) Provide performance standards and design criteria for watershedwide
stormwater management and planning.
B. NPDES requirements. Federal regulations approved October 1999
require operators of small municipal separate storm sewer systems
(MS4s) to obtain NPDES Phase II permits from DEP by March 2003.
(NPDES II is an acronym for the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System Phase II Stormwater Permitting Regulations.) This
program affects all municipalities in urbanized areas of the state. This
definition applies to all Schuylkill River watershed municipalities
identified in Table III-1 of the Schuylkill River Stormwater Management
Plan Volume II as NPDES Phase II municipalities. Therefore, these
identified municipalities will be subject to the NPDES Phase II
requirements mandated by the Federal Clean Water Act as
administered by the DEP. For more information on NPDES II
requirements, contact the DEP Regional Office.
A. Primary authority. The Borough is empowered to regulate land use
activities that affect runoff by the authority of the Act of October 4,
1978, 32 P.S. § 680.1 et seq., P.L. 864 (Act 167), as amended and
supplemented, being the Stormwater Management Act, and by various
ordinances and the Code of the Borough, including the Subdivision and
Land Development Regulations, the Floodplain Regulations, the
Sanitary Sewers Ordinance, the Storm Sewer Ordinance and the
Wellhead Protection Regulations, as amended and supplemented from
time to time.105
B. Secondary authority. The municipality also is empowered to regulate
land use activities that affect runoff by the authority of the Act of July
105. Editor's Note: See Ch. 195, Subdivision and Land Development; Ch. 123, Floodplain

parking or driveway areas and any new streets and sidewalks.
Any areas designed to initially be gravel or crushed stone shall be
assumed to be impervious for the purposes of comparison to the
waiver criteria.
(2) The applicant is required to evaluate practicable alternatives to the
surface discharge of stormwater, the creation of impervious
surfaces and the degradation of waters of the commonwealth, and
must maintain as much as possible the natural hydrologic regime.
(3) The drainage plan must be designed consistent with the
sequencing provisions of § 189-10D to ensure maintenance of the
natural hydrologic regime and to promote groundwater recharge
and protect groundwater and surface water quality and quantity.
The drainage plan designer must proceed sequentially in
accordance with this section of this article.
(4) The existing points of concentrated drainage that discharge onto
adjacent property shall not be altered without permission of the
adjacent property owner(s) and shall be subject to any applicable
discharge criteria specified in this article.
(5) Areas of existing diffused drainage discharge shall be subject to
any applicable discharge criteria in the general direction of
existing discharge, whether proposed to be concentrated or
maintained as diffused drainage areas, except as otherwise
provided by this article. If diffused flow is proposed to be
concentrated and discharged onto adjacent property, the developer
must document that adequate downstream conveyance facilities
exist to safely transport the concentrated discharge or otherwise
prove that no erosion, sedimentation, flooding or other harm will
result from the concentrated discharge.
(6) Where a development site is traversed by watercourses, drainage
easements shall be provided conforming to the line of such
watercourses. The terms of the easement shall prohibit excavation,
the placing of fill or structures, and any alterations that may
adversely affect the flow of stormwater within any portion of the
easement. Maintenance, including mowing of vegetation within the
easement, shall be required.
(7) Any stormwater management facilities regulated by this article
that would be located in or adjacent to waters of the
commonwealth or wetlands shall be subject to approval by the PA
DEP through the joint permit application process or, where deemed
appropriate by the PA DEP, the general permit process. When there
§ 189-10 KUTZTOWN CODE § 189-10
185:392
is a question whether wetlands may be involved, it is the
responsibility of the developer or his agent to show that the land
in question cannot be classified as wetlands, otherwise approval to
work in the area must be obtained from the PA DEP.
(8) Any stormwater management facilities regulated by this article
that would be located on state highway rights-of-way shall be
subject to approval by PENNDOT.
(9) Minimization of impervious surfaces and infiltration of runoff
through seepage beds, infiltration trenches, etc., are encouraged,
where soil conditions permit, to reduce the size or eliminate the
need for detention facilities.
(10) All stormwater runoff shall be treated for water quality.
(11) Roof drains must not be connected to streets, sanitary or storm
sewers or roadside ditches to promote overload flow and
infiltration/percolation of stormwater where advantageous to do so.
When it is more advantageous to connect directly to streets or
storm sewers, then it shall be permitted, on a case-by-case basis, by
the Borough.
(12) Transference of runoff to or from an EV/HQ watershed is
prohibited unless otherwise authorized by DEP or DRBC.
[Amended 8-17-2010 by Ord. No. 5-2010]
B. Permit requirements by other government entities. Permits must
comply with any and all applicable local, county, state and federal
regulations.

activities.
(1) No regulated earth disturbance activities within the municipality
shall commence until the municipality receives an approval from
the Conservation District of an erosion and sediment control plan
for construction activities.
(2) DEP has regulations that require an erosion and sediment control
plan for any earth disturbance activity of 5,000 square feet or
more, under 25 Pa. Code § 102.4(b).
(3) In addition, under 25 Pa. Code Chapter 92, a DEP NPDES
construction activities permit is required for regulated earth
disturbance activities.
(4) Evidence of any necessary permit(s) for regulated earth
disturbance activities from the appropriate DEP regional office or
County Conservation District must be provided to the municipality.
The issuance of an NPDES construction permit [or permit coverage
under the statewide general permit (PAG-22)] satisfies the
requirements, § 189-10C(1).
§ 189-10 SOLID WASTE § 189-10
185:393
(5) A copy of the erosion and sediment control plan and any required
permit, as required by DEP regulations, shall be available at the
project site at all times.
(6) Additional erosion and sediment control design standards and
criteria that are recommended to be applied where infiltration
BMPs are proposed shall include the following:
(a) Areas proposed for infiltration BMPs shall be protected from
sedimentation and compaction during the construction phase
to maintain maximum infiltration capacity.
(b) Infiltration BMPs shall not be constructed nor receive runoff
until the entire contributory drainage area to the infiltration
BMP has achieved final stabilization.
D. Nonstructural project design (sequencing to minimize stormwater
impacts).
(1) For projects disturbing one acre or more, the design of all
regulated activities shall include evaluation of practicable
alternatives to the surface discharge of stormwater, the creation of
impervious surfaces, and the degradation of waters of the
commonwealth, and must maintain as much as possible the natural
hydrologic regime of the site.
(a) An alternative is practicable if it is available and capable of
being done after taking into consideration cost, existing
technology and logistics in light of overall project purposes and
other municipal requirements.
(b) All practicable alternatives to the discharge of stormwater are
presumed to have less adverse impact on quantity and quality
of waters of the commonwealth unless otherwise
demonstrated.
(2) The applicant shall demonstrate that he/she designed the regulated
activities that disturb one acre or more included consideration of
the following issues:
(a) Prepare an existing resource and site analysis map (ERSAM)
showing environmentally sensitive areas, including, but not
limited to, steep slopes, ponds, lakes, streams, wetlands,
hydric soils, vernal pools, floodplains, stream buffer zones,
Hydrologic Soil Groups A and B (areas conducive to
infiltration), special geologic features, any existing recharge
areas and any other requirements outlined in the municipal
Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance.113
113. Editor's Note: See Ch. 195, Subdivision and Land Development.
§ 189-10 KUTZTOWN CODE § 189-10
185:394
(b) Establish appropriate buffers for each of the delineated
environmentally sensitive areas per the municipal zoning
ordinance.114 [See § 189-10F(4) for stream buffers and
§ 189-10J(9) for special geologic feature buffers.]
(c) Prepare a draft project layout avoiding sensitive areas
identified in § 189-10D(2)(a).
(d) Identify site specific existing conditions, drainage areas,
discharge points, recharge areas and hydrologic Soil Groups A
and B.
(e) Evaluate nonstructural stormwater management alternatives.
[1] Minimize earth disturbance.
[2] Minimize impervious surfaces.
[3] Break up large impervious surfaces.
(f) Satisfy groundwater infiltration objective (§ 189-10E) and
provide for stormwater pretreatment prior to infiltration.
Pretreatment may not be necessary for rooftop runoff which
enters the infiltration facility directly from a roof leader.
(g) Satisfy water quality (§ 189-10F) and streambank erosion
protection objective (§ 189-10G).
(h) Determine what management district the site falls into
(Appendix D115) and conduct an existing conditions runoff
analysis.
(i) Prepare final project design to maintain existing conditions
drainage areas and discharge points, to minimize earth
disturbance and impervious surfaces and, to the maximum
extent possible, to ensure the remaining site development has
no surface or point discharge.
(j) Conduct a post-development runoff analysis based on the final
design and to meet the release rate and in turn the overbank
flow and extreme event requirements (§ 189-10H).
(k) Manage any remaining runoff through treatment prior to
discharge, as part of detention, bioretention, direct discharge
or other structural control.
E. Groundwater recharge (infiltration/recharge/bioretention).
(1) Maximizing the groundwater recharge capacity of the area being
developed is required. Design of the infiltration stormwater
management facilities shall give consideration to providing
114. Editor's Note: See Ch. 225, Zoning.
115. Editor's Note: Appendix D is included at the end of this chapter.
§ 189-10 SOLID WASTE § 189-10
185:395
groundwater recharge to compensate for the reduction in the
percolation that occurs when the ground surface is disturbed or
impervious surface is created. It is recommended that roof runoff
be directed to infiltration BMPs which can be over-designed to
compensate for the infiltration losses due to parking areas. These
measures are required to be consistent with § 189-2, and take
advantage of utilizing any existing recharge areas.
(2) Infiltration may not be feasible on every site due to site-specific
limitations, such as soil type. If it cannot be physically
accomplished, due to seasonal high water table, soil permeability
rate, soil depth or setback distances from special geologic features,
then the design professional shall be responsible to show that this
cannot be physically accomplished. If it can be physically
accomplished, then the volume of runoff to be infiltrated shall be
determined from § 189-10E(3)(c) depending on demonstrated site
conditions and shall be the greater of the two volumes.
(3) Infiltration BMPs shall meet the following minimum requirements:
(a) Infiltration requirements. Regulated activities will be required
to infiltrate, where site conditions permit, a portion of the
runoff created by the development as part of an overall
stormwater management plan designed for the site. The
volume of runoff to be infiltrated shall be determined from
§ 189-10E(3)(c)[1] or [2], depending upon demonstrated site
conditions.
(b) Infiltration BMPs intended to receive runoff from developed
areas shall be selected based on suitability of soils and site
conditions and shall be constructed on soils that have the
following characteristics:
[1] A minimum depth of 36 inches between the bottom of the
BMP and the limiting zone.
[2] An infiltration and/or percolation rate sufficient to accept
the additional stormwater load and drain completely as
determined by field tests conducted by the applicant's
design professional.
[3] The infiltration facility shall be capable of completely
infiltrating the retention (infiltration) volume within four
days (96 hours).
[4] Pretreatment shall be provided prior to infiltration.
(c) The size of the infiltration facility shall be based upon the
following volume criteria:
[1] NRCS curve number equation:
§ 189-10 KUTZTOWN CODE § 189-10
185:396
[a] The NRCS runoff equation shall be utilized to
calculate infiltration requirements (I) in inches.
Equation 1
I (Infiltration requirement in inches) = (200 / CN)  2
Where
CN = SCS (NRCS) curve number of existing
conditions contributing to the infiltration
facility.
[b] This equation is displayed graphically in, and the
infiltration requirement can be determined from
Figure 1.
Figure 1. Infiltration Requirement Based Upon
NRCS Curve Number
[c] The retention (Infiltration) volume (Rev) required
would therefore be computed as:
Equation 2
Rev (Cubic Feet) = I * impervious area (square feet)
/ (12 inches/ft)
Where
I = infiltration requirement (in inches)
[2] Annual recharge: water budget approach. It has been
determined that infiltrating 0.42 inch of runoff from the
impervious areas will aid in maintaining the hydrologic
regime of the watershed. If the goals of § 189-10E(3)(b)[1]
cannot be achieved, then 0.42 inch of rainfall shall be
infiltrated from all impervious areas, up to an existing site
conditions curve number of 83. Above a curve number of
83, Equation 1 or the curve in Figure 1 should be used to
determine the infiltration requirement. The retention
(infiltration) volume (Rev) required would therefore be
computed as:
Rev (Cubic Feet) = (0.42 or I, whichever is less) *
impervious area (sq.ft.) / (12 in/ft)
(4) Soils. A detailed soils evaluation of the project site shall be required
where practicable to determine the suitability of recharge facilities.
§ 189-10 SOLID WASTE § 189-10
185:397
The evaluation shall be performed by a qualified design
professional and, at a minimum, address soil permeability, depth to
bedrock and subgrade stability. The general process for designing
the infiltration BMP shall be:
(a) Analyze hydrologic soil groups as well as natural and manmade
features within the site to determine general areas of
suitability for infiltration practices. In areas where
development on fill material is under consideration, conduct
geotechnical investigations of subgrade stability; infiltration is
not permitted to be ruled out without conducting these tests.
(b) Provide field tests such as double ring infiltrometer or
hydraulic conductivity tests (at the level of the proposed
infiltration surface) to determine the appropriate hydraulic
conductivity rate. Percolation tests are not recommended for
design purposes.
(c) Design the infiltration structure for the required retention
(Rev) volume based on field determined capacity at the level of
the proposed infiltration surface.
(d) If on-lot infiltration structures are proposed by the applicant's
design professional, it must be demonstrated to the
municipality that the soils are conducive to infiltrate on the lots
identified.
(5) Carbonate areas. The applicant is required to investigate the ability
of all areas on the site which are not underlain by carbonate rock to
meet the infiltration requirements of § 189-10E(3). If this
investigation proves infeasible, infiltration can occur on areas
underlain by carbonate rock by following the recommended
procedure below in conjunction with Figure B-4 in Ordinance
Appendix B.116 However, the applicant is not required to use
infiltration in carbonate areas even if the site falls into the
Recommended range on Figure B-4 in Ordinance Appendix B. If
infiltration is not proposed, the calculated infiltration volume
[§ 189-10E(3)] shall be treated by an acceptable BMP.
(a) Infiltration BMP loading rate percentages in Figure B-4 in
Ordinance Appendix B shall be calculated as follows:
(b) The area tributary to the infiltration BMP shall be weighted as
follows:
116. Editor's Note: Appendix B is included at the end of this chapter.
§ 189-10 KUTZTOWN CODE § 189-10
185:398
Area Description Weighting
All disturbed area to be made
impervious
100%
All disturbed areas to be made
pervious
50%
All undisturbed impervious areas 100%
All undisturbed pervious areas 0%
(c) Soil thickness is to be measured from the bottom of any
proposed infiltration BMP. The effective soil thickness in Figure
B-4 in Ordinance Appendix B is the measured soil thickness
multiplied by the thickness factor based on soil permeability, as
follows:
Permeability Range
(inches per hour) Thickness Factor
6.0 to 12.0 0.8
2.0 to 6.0 1.0
1.0 to 2.0 1.4
0.75 to 1.0 1.2
0.5 to 0.75 1.0
(d) The design of all facilities over Karst shall include an
evaluation of measures to minimize adverse effects.
(6) Stormwater hotspots.
(a) Following is a list of examples of designated hotspots. If a site
is designated as a hotspot, it has important implications for
how stormwater is managed. First and foremost, untreated
stormwater runoff from hotspots shall not be allowed to
recharge into groundwater where it may contaminate water
supplies. Therefore, the Rev requirement shall not be applied
to development sites that fit into the hotspot category. (The
entire WQv must still be treated.) Second, a greater level of
stormwater treatment shall be considered at hotspot sites to
prevent pollutant washoff after construction. The EPA's NPDES
stormwater program requires some industrial sites to prepare
and implement a stormwater pollution prevention plan.
(b) Examples of hotspots:
[1] Vehicle salvage yards and recycling facilities.
[2] Vehicle fueling stations.
[3] Vehicle service and maintenance facilities.
§ 189-10 SOLID WASTE § 189-10
185:399
[4] Vehicle and equipment cleaning facilities.
[5] Fleet storage areas (bus, truck, etc.).
[6] Industrial sites (based on Standard Industrial Codes).
[7] Marinas (service and maintenance).
[8] Outdoor liquid container storage.
[9] Outdoor loading/unloading facilities.
[10] Public works storage areas.
[11] Facilities that generate or store hazardous materials.
[12] Commercial container nursery.
[13] Other land uses and activities as designated by an
appropriate review authority.
(c) The following land uses and activities are not normally
considered hotspots:
[1] Residential streets and rural highways.
[2] Residential development.
[3] Institutional development.
[4] Office developments.
[5] Nonindustrial rooftops.
[6] Pervious areas, except golf courses and nurseries [which
may need an integrated pest management (IPM) plan].
(d) Large highways [average daily traffic volume (ADT) greater
than 30,000] are not designated as a stormwater hotspot;
however, it is important to ensure that highway stormwater
management plans adequately protect groundwater.
(7) Caution shall be exercised where infiltration is proposed in source
water protection areas as defined by the local municipality or water
authority.
(8) Infiltration facilities shall be used in conjunction with other
innovative or traditional stormwater control facilities that are
found within the PA DEP State BMP Manual.
(9) Caution shall be exercised where salt or chloride (municipal salt
storage) would be a pollutant since soils do little to filter this
pollutant and it may contaminate the groundwater. The qualified
design professional shall evaluate the possibility of groundwater
contamination from the proposed infiltration facility and perform a
hydrogeologic justification study if necessary.
§ 189-10 KUTZTOWN CODE § 189-10
185:400
(10) The infiltration requirement in high-quality or exceptional value
waters shall be subject to the Department's Chapter 93
Antidegradation Regulations.
(11) Dependent upon certain land use or hotspots, an impermeable liner
will be required in detention basins where the possibility of
groundwater contamination exists. A detailed hydrogeologic
investigation may be required by the municipality.
(12) The municipality shall require the applicant to provide safeguards
against groundwater contamination for land uses that may cause
groundwater contamination should there be a mishap or spill.
(13) For projects that disturb one acre or more, unless otherwise
specified in the Zoning Ordinance,117 the following setbacks for
infiltration facilities shall apply:
(a) One hundred feet from water supply wells.
(b) Ten feet downslope or 100 feet upslope from building
foundations.
(c) Fifty feet from septic system drainfields.
(d) Fifty feet from a geologic contact with carbonate bedrock,
unless a preliminary site investigation is done in the carbonate
bedrock to show the absence of special geologic features
within 50 feet of the proposed infiltration area.
(e) One hundred feet from the property line unless documentation
is provided to show all setbacks from wells, foundations and
drainfields on the neighboring property will be met.
F. Water quality requirements.
(1) Developed areas shall provide adequate storage and treatment
facilities necessary to capture and treat stormwater runoff. The
retention volume computed under § 189-10E may be a component
of the water quality volume if the applicant chooses to manage both
components in a single facility. If the infiltration volume is less than
the water quality volume, the remaining water quality volume may
be captured and treated by methods other than recharge/
infiltration BMPs. The required water quality volume (WQv) is the
storage capacity needed to capture and treat a portion of
stormwater runoff from the developed areas of the site. To achieve
this goal, the following criterion is established:
(a) The following calculation formula is to be used to determine
the water quality storage volume, (WQv), in acre-feet of
storage for the Sacony Creek watershed:
117. Editor's Note: See Ch. 225, Zoning.
§ 189-10 SOLID WASTE § 189-10
185:401
WQv = [(P)(Rv)(A)] / 12
Where
WQv = Water quality volume (acre-feet).
P = 1 inch.
A = Total contributing drainage area to the water
quality BMP (acres).
Rv = 0.05 + 0.009(l) where I is the percent of the area
that is impervious surface [(impervious area / A) *
100].
(b) This volume requirement can be accomplished by the
permanent volume of a wet basin or the detained volume from
other BMPs.
(c) Release of water can begin at the start of the storm (i.e., the
invert of the water quality orifice is at the invert of the facility).
The design of the facility shall provide for protection from
clogging and unwanted sedimentation.
(2) For areas within defined special protection subwatersheds which
include exceptional value (EV) and high-quality (HQ) waters, cold
water fishery (CWF) the temperature and quality of water and
streams shall be maintained.
(3) To accomplish the above, the applicant shall use innovative or
traditional stormwater control facilities that are found within the
PA DEP State BMP Manual.
(4) If a perennial or intermittent stream passes through the site, the
applicant shall create a stream buffer extending a minimum of 50
feet to either side of the top-of-bank of the channel. The buffer area
shall be maintained with appropriate native vegetation (reference
to Appendix F of Pennsylvania Handbook of Best Management
Practices for Developing Area for plant lists). If the applicable rear
or side yard setback is less than 50 feet, the buffer width may be
reduced to 25% of the setback to a minimum of 10 feet. If an
existing buffer is legally prescribed (i.e., deed, covenant, easement,
etc.) and it exceeds the requirements of this article, the existing
buffer shall be maintained. This does not include lakes or wetlands.
G. Streambank erosion requirements.
(1) In addition to control of the water quality volume, in order to
minimize the impact of stormwater runoff on downstream
streambank erosion, the primary requirement is to design a BMP to
detain the post-development two-year, twenty-four-hour design
storm to the existing conditions one-year peak flow using the SCS
Type II distribution. Additionally, provisions shall be made (such as
adding a small orifice at the bottom of the outlet structure) so that
§ 189-10 KUTZTOWN CODE § 189-10
185:402
the post-development one-year storm takes a minimum of 24 hours
to drain from the facility from a point where the maximum volume
of water from the one-year storm is captured (i.e., the maximum
water surface elevation is achieved in the facility). Release of water
can begin at the start of the storm (i.e., the invert of the water
quality orifice is at the invert of the facility).
(2) The minimum orifice size in the outlet structure to the BMP shall be
a three-inch diameter orifice, and a trash rack shall be installed to
prevent clogging. On sites with small contributing drainage areas
to this BMP that do not provide enough runoff volume to allow a
twenty-four-hour attenuation with the three-inch orifice, the
calculations shall be submitted showing this condition. Orifice sizes
less than three inches can be utilized, provided that the design will
prevent clogging of the intake.
H. Stormwater management districts.
(1) The Sacony Creek Watershed has been divided into stormwater
management districts as shown in Appendix D118 and as follows.
(2) In addition to the requirements specified in the table below, the
groundwater recharge, water quality and streambank erosion
control requirements shall be implemented. Development sites
located in each of the districts must control post-development
runoff rates to predevelopment runoff rates for the design storm as
follows:

I. Stormwater Management District implementation provisions
(performance standards).
(1) General. Post-development rates of runoff from any regulated
activity shall not exceed the peak release rates of runoff prior to
development for the design storms specified in § 189-10H of this
article. [Amended 8-17-2010 by Ord. No. 5-2010]
(2) District boundaries. The boundaries of the Stormwater
Management Districts are shown on an official map which is
available for inspections at the Borough municipal building. A copy
of the official map at a reduced scale is included in Appendix D. The
exact location of the Stormwater Management District boundaries
as they apply to a given development site shall be determined by
mapping the boundaries using the two-foot topographic contours
(or most accurate data required) provided as part of the drainage
plan.
(3) Sites located in more than one district. For a proposed
development site located within two or more release category
subareas, the peak discharge rate from any subarea shall be the
predevelopment peak discharge for that subarea multiplied by the
applicable release rate. The calculated peak discharges shall apply
regardless of whether the grading plan changes the drainage area
by subarea. An exception to the above may be granted if discharges
from multiple subareas recombine in proximity to the site. In this
case, peak discharge in any direction shall follow Management
District A criteria, provided that the overall site discharge meets
the management district criteria for which the discharge is located.
(4) Off-site areas. Off-site areas which drain through a proposed
development site are not subject to release rate criteria when
determining allowable peak runoff rates. However, on-site drainage
facilities shall be designed to safely convey off-site flows through
the development site.
(5) Site areas. Where the site area to be impacted by a proposed
development activity differs significantly from the total site area,
only the proposed impact area shall be subject to the management
district criteria. In other words, unimpacted areas bypassing the
§ 189-10 KUTZTOWN CODE § 189-10
185:404
stormwater management facilities would not be subject to the
management district criteria.
J. Design criteria for stormwater management facilities.
(1) Any stormwater facility located on state highway rights-of-way
shall be subject to approval by PENNDOT.
(2) Any stormwater management facility (i.e., detention basin)
designed to store runoff and requiring a berm or earthen
embankment required or regulated by this article shall be designed
to provide an emergency spillway to handle flow up to the onehundred-
year post-development conditions. The height of
embankment must be set as to provide a minimum 1.0 foot of
freeboard above the maximum pool elevation computed when the
facility functions for the one-hundred-year post-Mydevelopment
inflow. Should any stormwater management facility require a dam
safety permit under 25 Pa. Code Chapter 105 et seq., the facility
shall be designed in accordance with 25 Pa. Code Chapter 105 and
meet the regulations of 25 Pa. Code Chapter 105 concerning dam
safety which may be required to pass storms larger than the onehundred-
year event.
(3) Any facilities that constitute water obstructions (e.g., culverts,
bridges, outfalls of stream enclosures) and any work involving
wetlands as directed in the regulations of 25 Pa. Code Chapter 105
et seq. (as amended) shall be designed in accordance with 25 Pa.
Code Chapter 105 and will require a permit from PA DEP. Any other
drainage conveyance facility that doesn't fall under the regulations
of 25 Pa. Code Chapter 105 must be able to convey, without damage
to the drainage structure or roadway, runoff from the twenty-fiveyear
design storms with a minimum 1.0 foot of freeboard measured
below the lowest point along the top of the roadway. Roadway
crossings located within designated floodplain areas must be able
to convey runoff from a one-hundred-year design storm with a
minimum 1.0 foot of freeboard measured below the lowest point
along the top of roadway. Any facility that constitutes a dam as
defined in the regulations of 25 Pa. Code Chapter 105 et seq.
regulations may require a permit under dam safety regulations.
Any facility located within a PENNDOT right-of-way must meet
PENNDOT minimum design standards and permit submission
requirements.
(4) Any drainage conveyance facility and/or channel that doesn't fall
under the regulations of 25 Pa. Code Chapter 105 et seq. must be
able to convey, without damage to the drainage structure or
roadway, runoff from the ten-year design storm. Conveyance
facilities to or exiting from stormwater management facilities (i.e.,
detention basins) shall be designed to convey the design flow to or
from that structure. Roadway crossings located within designated
floodplain areas must be able to convey runoff from a one-hundred-
§ 189-10 SOLID WASTE § 189-10
185:405
year design storm. Any facility located within a PENNDOT right-ofway
must meet PENNDOT minimum design standards and permit
submission requirements.
(5) Storm sewers must be able to convey post-development runoff from
a twenty-five-year design storm without surcharging inlets.
(6) Adequate erosion protection shall be provided along all open
channels and at all points of discharge.
(7) The design of all stormwater management facilities shall
incorporate sound engineering principles and practices. The
Borough shall reserve the right to disapprove any design that
would result in the continuation of an adverse hydrologic or
hydraulic condition within the watershed.
(8) All wet basin designs shall incorporate biologic minimization
controls consistent with the West Nile Guidance found in Appendix
G.119
(9) No stormwater detention facility shall be placed within 50 feet of a
special geologic feature. No stormwater subsurface conveyance
facility shall be constructed within 50 feet of a special geologic
feature, unless it is constructed of durable pipe utilizing watertight
joints.
K. Calculation methodology. Stormwater runoff from all development sites
shall be calculated using either the Rational Method or a Soil-Cover-
Complex methodology.
(1) Any stormwater runoff calculations involving drainage areas
greater than 200 acres, including on- and off-site areas, shall use a
generally accepted calculation technique that is based on the
NRCS Soil-Cover-Compels Method. Table 1 summarizes acceptable
computation methods. It is assumed that all methods will be
selected by the design professional based on the individual
limitations and suitability of each method for a particular site. The
Borough may approve the use of the Rational Method to estimate
peak discharges from drainage areas that contain fewer than 200
acres.

(2) All calculations consistent with the requirements of this article
using the Soil-Cover-Complex Method shall use the appropriate
design rainfall depths for the various return period storms
presented in Table B-1 in Appendix B120 of this article. If a
hydrologic computer model, such as PSRM or HEC-1, is used for
stormwater runoff calculations, then the duration of rainfall shall
be 24 hours. The NRCS S-curve as shown in Figure B-1, Appendix B
of this article shall be used for the rainfall distribution.
(3) For the purposes of predevelopment flow rate determination,
undeveloped land shall be considered as meadow condition, unless
the natural ground cover generates a lower curve number or
Rational "C" value (i.e., forest).

§ 189-10 SOLID WASTE § 189-10
185:407
(4) All calculations using the Rational Method shall use rainfall
intensities consistent with appropriate times of concentration for
overland flow and return periods from the Design Storm Curves
from PENNDOT Design Rainfall Curves (1986) (Figure B-3). Times
of concentration for overland flow shall be calculated using the
methodology presented in Chapter 3 of Urban Hydrology for Small
Watersheds, NRCS, TR-55 (as amended or replaced from time to
time by NRCS). Times of concentration for channel and pipe flow
shall be computed using Manning's equation. NRCS lag equation
divided by 0.6 is an acceptable method for Tc in undeveloped areas.
(5) Runoff curve numbers (CN) for both existing and proposed
conditions to be used in the Soil-Cover-Complex Method shall be
obtained from Table B-2 in Appendix B121 of this article.
(6) Runoff coefficients (c) for both existing and proposed conditions for
use in the Rational Method shall be obtained from Table B-3 in
Appendix B.122 of this article.
(7) Where uniform flow is anticipated, the Manning Equation shall be
used for hydraulic computations and to determine the capacity of
open channels, pipes and storm sewers. Values for Manning's
roughness coefficient (n) shall be consistent with Table B-4 in
Appendix B of this article. Full flow shall be assumed for closed
conduits. Outlet structures for stormwater management facilities
shall be designed to meet the performance standards of this article
using any generally accepted hydraulic analysis technique or
method.
(8) The design of any stormwater detention facilities intended to meet
the performed standards of this article shall be verified by routing
the design storm hydrograph through these facilities using the
Storage-Indication Method. For drainage areas greater than 20
acres in size, the design storm hydrograph shall be computed using
a calculation method that produces a full hydrograph. The Borough
may approve the use of any generally accepted full hydrograph
approximation technique which shall use a total runoff volume that
is consistent with the volume from a method that produces a full
hydrograph.
L. Limestone and/or sinkhole prone areas.
(1) The ability to retain and maximize the groundwater recharge
capacity of the area being developed is encouraged. Design of the
stormwater management facilities shall give consideration to
providing groundwater recharge to compensate for the reduction
in the percolation that occurs when the ground surface is paved
and roofed over. A detailed geologic evaluation of the project site

facilities. The evaluation shall be performed by a qualified geologist
and/or soil scientist and at a minimum, address soil permeability,
depth to bedrock, susceptibility to sinkhole formation and subgrade
stability. Where pervious pavement is permitted for parking lots,
recreational facilities, nondedicated streets or other areas,
pavement construction specifications shall be noted on the plan.
(2) Whenever a basin will be located in an area underlain by limestone,
a geological evaluation of the proposed location shall be conducted
to determine susceptibility to sinkhole formations. The design of all
facilities over limestone formations shall include measures to
prevent groundwater contamination and, where necessary,
sinkhole formation. Soils used for the construction of basins shall
have low-erodibility factors ("K" factors). The municipality may
require the installation of an impermeable liner in detention basins.
(3) It shall be the developer's responsibility to verify if the site is
underlain by limestone. The following note shall be attached to all
drainage plans and signed and sealed by the developer's engineer/
surveyor/landscape architect/architect:

charge of $5 will be levied for each bore hole made. A permit will be
required for each bore hole grouping. The permittee shall plug or seal
bore holes in a manner and with materials approved by the Borough to
the street surface within 30 days of boring. If the applicant does not
plug or seal these holes within the given time, the Borough reserves the

the Borough Council to render a decision and communicate it to the
applicant within the time and in the manner required herein shall
be deemed an approval of the application in terms as presented
unless the applicant has agreed in writing to an extension of time
or change in the prescribed manner of presentation of
communication of the decision, in which case, failure to meet the
extended time or change in manner of presentation of
communication shall have like effect.
(4) The decision of the Borough Council shall be in writing and shall be
communicated to the applicant personally or mailed by certified
mail to him at his last known address not later than 15 days
following the decision. If delivered personally, the applicant shall
give the borough a receipt indicating he has received the decision.
(5) When the application is not approved in terms as filed, the decision
shall specify the defects found in the application and describe the
requirements which have not been met and shall, in each case, cite
the provisions of the ordinance relied upon.
(6) A final plan shall not be recorded, nor shall any zoning or building
permit be issued, until the requirements of § 195-13 of this chapter
have been met.
A. Subdivision improvements agreement. No final plan shall be endorsed
by the Borough Council unless an improvements agreement in a form
acceptable to the Borough Council and Borough Solicitor is executed. A
unit breakdown of all improvements required by this chapter pursuant
to Form 4149 shall be included within such agreement.
B. Completion and guarantee of improvements.
(1) No final plan shall be endorsed by the Borough Council unless all
the improvements required by this chapter and the improvements
agreement have been installed, inspected and approved in
accordance with this chapter and said agreement.
149. Editor's Note: Form 4 is included at the end of this chapter.
§ 195-12 SOLID WASTE § 195-13
185:505
(2) In lieu of the completion of any improvements as stated in
Subsection B(1) above, prior to endorsement of the record plan, the
subdivider shall deposit with the borough a financial security in an
amount sufficient to cover the cost of all improvements or common
amenities required by this chapter and the improvements
agreement and the cost of preparing as-built drawings of those
improvements. The financial security may be in the form of an
irrevocable letter of credit or restrictive or escrow account in a
federal or commonwealth chartered lending institution or other
type of financial security which the Borough Council approves. The
financial security shall guarantee the completion of all required
improvements on or before the date fixed in the formal action of
approval or accompanying improvements agreement for
completion of the improvements.
(3) The subdivider shall also submit a cash deposit to the borough to
cover the cost established by the borough for improvement
materials and labor to be provided by the borough pursuant to the
improvements agreement.
(4) When requested by the developer, in order to facilitate financing,
the Borough Council shall furnish the developer with a signed copy
of a resolution indicating approval of the final plan contingent upon
the developer obtaining a satisfactory financial security. The record
plan shall not be signed nor recorded until the improvements
agreement is executed. The resolution or letter of contingent
approval shall expire and be deemed to be revoked if the
improvements agreement is not executed within 90 days unless a
written extension is granted by the Borough Council; such
extension shall not be unreasonably withheld and shall be placed in
writing at the request of the developer.
(5) The amount of the financial security to be posted for the completion
of the required improvements shall be equal to 110% of the cost of
completion estimated as of 90 days following the date scheduled for
completion by the developer. Annually the borough may adjust the
amount of the financial security by comparing the actual cost of the
improvements which have been completed and the estimated cost
for the completion of the remaining improvements as of the
expiration of the 90th day after either the original date scheduled
for completion or a rescheduled date of completion. Subsequent to
said adjustment, the borough may require the developer to post
additional security in order to assure that the financial security
equals said 110%. Any additional security shall be posted by the
developer in accordance with this subsection.
(6) The amount of financial security required shall be based upon an
estimate of the cost of completion of the required improvements,
submitted by an applicant and prepared by an engineer and
certified by such engineer to be a fair and reasonable estimate of
such cost. Such estimate shall be submitted to the borough no less
§ 195-13 KUTZTOWN CODE § 195-13
185:506
than 14 days prior to the meeting of the Borough Council at which
such estimate is to be considered. The Borough Council, upon the
recommendation of the Borough Engineer, may refuse to accept
such estimate for good cause shown. If the applicant and the
Borough Council are unable to agree upon an estimate, then the
estimate shall be recalculated and recertified by another engineer
chosen mutually by the borough and the applicant. The estimate
certified by the third engineer shall be presumed fair and
reasonable and shall be the final estimate. In the event that a third
engineer is so chosen, fees for the services of said engineer shall
be paid equally by the borough and the applicant.
(7) If the party posting the financial security requires more than one
year from the date of posting of the financial security to complete
the required improvements, the amount of the financial security
may be increased by an additional 10% for each one-year period
beyond the first anniversary date of posting of financial security or
to an amount not exceeding 110% of the cost of completing the
required improvements as reestablished on or about the expiration
of the initial one-year period.
(8) The party posting the financial security may request the Borough
Council to release or authorize release, from time to time, such
portions of the financial security necessary for payment to the
contractors performing the work. Any such requests shall be in
writing addressed to the Borough Council, and the Council shall
have 45 days from receipt of such requests within which to allow
the Borough Engineer to certify, in writing, to the Borough Council
that such portion of the work upon the improvements has been
completed in accordance with the approved subdivision or land
development plan. Upon such certification, the Borough Council
shall authorize release by the bonding company or lending
institution of an amount as estimated by the Borough Engineer
fairly representing the value of the improvements completed. If the
Borough Council fails to act within said forty-five-day period, the
Council shall be deemed to have approved the release of funds as
requested. The Borough Council may, prior to final release at the
time of completion and certification by the Borough Engineer,
require retention of 10% of the estimated cost of the aforesaid
improvements.
(9) In the case where development is projected over a period of years,
the borough may authorize submission of final plans by sections or
stages of development, subject to such requirements or
improvement guaranties in the future sections or stages of
development as it finds essential for the protection and proper
development of any finally approved section of the development.
C. Remedies to effect completion of improvements. In the event that any
improvements which are required by this chapter have not been
installed as provided in this chapter or in accord with the approved final
§ 195-13 SOLID WASTE § 195-13
185:507
plan, the borough may enforce any improvements agreement by
appropriate legal and equitable remedies. If the proceeds of such
improvements guaranty are insufficient to pay the cost of installing or
making repairs or corrections to all the improvements covered by said
financial security, the borough may, at its option, install part of such
improvements in all or part of the subdivision or land development
and may institute appropriate legal or equitable action to recover the
moneys necessary to complete the remainder of the improvements. All
of the proceeds, whether resulting from the improvements guaranty
or from any legal or equitable action brought against the developer,
or both, shall be used solely for the installation of the improvements
covered by such financial security.
D. Release of improvements guaranty.
(1) When the developer has completed all of the necessary and
appropriate improvements, the developer shall notify the Borough
Council, by certified or registered mail, of the completion of the
improvements and shall send a copy of the notice to the Borough
Engineer.
(2) The Borough Council shall within 10 days after receipt of notice of
completion of improvements direct and authorize the Borough
Engineer to inspect the improvements. The Borough Engineer shall
then submit a written report regarding the improvements to the
Council and promptly mail a copy of the report to the developer by
certified or registered mail.
(3) The report shall be made and mailed by the Borough Engineer
within 30 days after receipt of authorization from the Borough
Council. The report shall be detailed and shall indicate approval or
rejection of the improvements, either in whole or in part. If the
improvements or any portion thereof shall not be approved or shall
be rejected by the Borough Engineer, the report shall contain a
statement of reasons for such nonapproval or rejection.
(4) The Borough Council shall notify the developer within 15 days of
receipt of the Engineer's report, in writing, by certified or
registered mail, of their action.
(5) If any portion of the improvements shall not be approved or shall be
rejected by the Borough Council, the developer shall proceed to
complete the improvements, and upon completion, the same
procedure of notification as outlined above shall be followed.
(6) When completed improvements have been approved by the
borough, the improvements guaranty shall be reduced by no more
than the amount which was estimated in the improvements
agreement for the approved improvements.
E. Preparation of as-built plans.
§ 195-13 KUTZTOWN CODE § 195-13
185:508
§ 195-14. Recording of final plan or sketch plan.
(1) As-built plans for all improvements within the subdivision or land
development listed in the subdivision improvements agreement
shall be submitted to the borough within 30 days after inspection
and approval of the improvements by the borough and prior to the
release of the improvements guaranty and acceptance of any such
improvements by the borough. Plans shall be in accordance with
the requirements of § 195-18 of this chapter, shall be Mylars in
reproducible form and shall be certified by the developer's
engineer to be in accordance with actual construction. The location
and elevation of all sewer laterals and water services shall also be
indicated. The developer shall be responsible for the preparation of
such plans.
(2) If any information relating to potential lot owners shown on the
recorded plan shall have been changed, such as lot boundaries,
easements and maintenance responsibilities, a revised subdivision
and/or land development plan shall be filed with the borough in
accordance with the procedures of this chapter.
F. Maintenance guaranty. Where the Borough Council accepts dedication
of all or some of the required improvements within a subdivision or land
development following completion, the Borough Council may require
the posting of a maintenance guaranty to secure structural integrity of
said improvements as well as the functioning of said improvements in
accordance with the design specifications as depicted on the final plan
for a term not to exceed 18 months from the date of acceptance of
dedication. The maintenance guaranty shall be of the same type as
permitted for installation of improvements, and the amount of the
maintenance guaranty shall not exceed 15% of the actual cost of
installation of the improvements.
A. Endorsement by Borough Council. After the procedures required by
this chapter have been completed and the Borough Council approves
the final plan, the Borough Planning Commission shall sign and the
Borough Council shall endorse at least seven copies of the final plan or
sketch plan for record.
(1) The endorsed plans shall be clear and legible black-on-white prints
on material acceptable to the Recorder of Deeds.
(2) Before any final plan is released for recording, a copy of any
permits required by the Pennsylvania Departments of
Environmental Resources and Transportation shall be submitted to
the borough.
(3) The borough shall receive one reproducible reproduction of the
final plan as approved and recorded within 15 days of recording.
The reproducible shall contain the Recorder of Deeds information
as to Deed Book Volume and date of recording.
§ 195-13 SOLID WASTE § 195-14
185:509
(4) All streets, parks or other improvements shown on the final plan
shall be deemed to be private until such time as they have been
offered for dedication to the borough and accepted by Borough
Council. The acceptance of any improvements shall be by a
separate action of the Council and shall not be effected by approval
of a subdivision or land development plan.
(5) The developer shall agree with the borough to tender, if requested,
a deed of dedication for any and all public improvements, including
easements. Upon completion of any public improvements shown on
an approved subdivision or land development plan and within 90
days after approval of such public improvements, as herein
provided, the borough may require that the developer offer such
public improvements for dedication. In such a case, the developer
shall prepare a deed of dedication and forward same to the
borough for review by the Borough Solicitor. The borough may
require that the developer supply a title insurance certificate from
a reputable title insurance company before any property is
accepted by the borough.
B. Filing with recorder of deeds.
(1) Upon approval of a final plan or sketch plan of record by the
Borough Council or the acceptance of the conditions of a
conditional approval by the applicant in case of a plan approved
subject to conditions, the developer shall within 90 days of such
final approval or acceptance of conditions complete all conditions
of approval and comply with all requirements of § 195-13. After the
applicant's completion of all conditions of approval and compliance
with all requirements of § 195-13, the Borough Council may
endorse the record plan. The developer shall within 90 days of such
endorsement record the plan in the office of the Recorder of Deeds.
The Recorder of Deeds shall not accept any plan for recording
unless the plan contains the endorsement of the Borough Council
and official notification of review by the County Planning
Commission. Endorsement of the Borough Council shall consist of
the signatures of the President of the Council and the Borough
Secretary and the Borough Seal on the plan. The developer should
contact the County Recorder of Deeds Office to determine all
applicable requirements for recording. If the subdivider falls to
record the plan within such period, the approval action of the
Borough Council shall be null and void. If the approval action
becomes null and void, then a preliminary plan must be submitted,
unless Borough Council for cause shown allows a final plan to be
submitted.
(2) All final plan sheets which contain restrictive notes, lot boundaries,
easements, maintenance responsibilities, other lot owner
responsibilities and such other information relating to potential lot
owners shall be recorded.
§ 195-14 KUTZTOWN CODE § 195-15
185:510
§ 195-15. Plans exempted from standard procedures.
A. Minor subdivision: sketch plan for record. In the case of any subdivision
in which all proposed lots will have frontage on and direct vehicular
access to an existing improved borough or state street, the parcel being
subdivided will be divided into a total of not more than three lots or
parcels after the effective date of this chapter, and the lots will be used
for only single-family detached dwellings, the developer may submit
only a sketch plan for record to the borough. The sketch plan shall
contain all information required by § 195-16 of this chapter and be
submitted and reviewed in accordance with § 195-10. The sketch plan
shall be submitted to the County Planning Commission for review. The
Borough Council may also require submission to and review by the
County Conservation District when recommended by the Borough
Engineer. Submission to and review by the Pennsylvania Department of
Transportation may be required if there is frontage on a state street.
Further subdivision from a tract subdivided under this section or
subdivision of a lot or tract created under this section will require a
review of plans in accordance with the standard procedures of this
chapter, and this shall be noted on the sketch plan for record.
B. Resubdivision: revised final plan.
(1) Any resubdivision of land, including changes to recorded plans,
shall be considered a subdivision and shall comply with all
requirements of this chapter; however, in those instances where
only lot lines shown on a recorded plan will be changed, all
resultant lots will conform to Chapter 225, Zoning, and this
chapter, easements will not be changed, street horizontal and
vertical alignment will not be changed, block sizes will not be
changed, utility sizes and locations will not be changed, open space
and recreation areas will not be changed and the number of lots
will not be increased, the Borough Council may at its discretion
permit the developer to submit only a revised final plan to the
borough for review.
(2) In addition to all items specified in § 195-18 of this chapter, the plan
shall graphically show the lot line changes being made. The revised
final plan shall be reviewed in accordance with § 195-12 and shall
be submitted to the County Planning Commission for review.
(3) If the revision of lot lines would result in the relocation of driveway
access points previously approved by PennDOT, the Borough
Council shall require submission of the revised final plan to
PennDOT for approval.
C. Auction sale. In the case of the proposed subdivision of land by process
of auction sale, the following procedure may be used by the developer:
(1) The developer shall prepare and submit a preliminary plan in
accordance with the requirements of this chapter.
§ 195-15 SOLID WASTE § 195-15
185:511
(2) The preliminary plan shall comply with the requirements of this
chapter and in addition contain the following notation:
This property is intended to be sold by auction on or about
___________ 19 _____, in whole or in part according to this plan.
Sale of lots at such auction shall be in the form of agreement
to purchase, and no actual transfer of ownership or interest in
such lots shall occur until a final plan showing such subdivision
of property is approved by the Borough Council in accordance
with the Borough subdivision and land development ordinance and
recorded in the office of the County Recorder of Deeds.
(3) After approval of the preliminary plan by the Borough Council, the
auction sale may proceed. After the auction sale, the developer
shall prepare and submit a final plan in accordance with this
chapter.
D. Lot annexations: sketch plan for record. Where the conveyance, sale or
transfer of land from one parcel to an adjacent parcel is proposed for
the sole purpose of increasing lot size, and not for the purpose of
creating a separate new lot or a land development, the developer may
submit only a sketch plan for record to the borough. The sketch plan
shall contain all information required by § 195-16 of this chapter and be
submitted and reviewed in accordance with § 195-10. Precise bearings
and distances from field survey shall be shown for the parcel being
transferred, and evidence shall be submitted that the parcel from which
a parcel is being transferred will not violate or further violate, as the
case may be, any requirement of Chapter 225, Zoning, or other borough
regulations. If development is subsequently proposed for the parcel
which has been increased in size, no building or zoning permit shall be
issued unless all applicable requirements of borough regulations are
complied with. The subdivision plan shall contain a notation that the
parcel being transferred is not to be considered a separate building lot.
E. Abbreviated subdivision: final plan. In the case of any subdivision in
which all proposed lots will have frontage on and direct vehicular
access to an existing improved borough or state street, the parcel being
subdivided will be divided into more than three but not more than six
lots or parcels, and the lots will be used for only single-family detached
dwellings, the Borough Council may at its discretion permit the
developer to submit only a final plan to the borough, rather than both
preliminary and final plans. The final plan shall contain all information
required by § 195-18 of this chapter and shall be submitted and
reviewed in accordance with § 195-12. The final plan shall be submitted
to the County Planning Commission for review. Submission to and
review from the County Conservation District shall be required when
recommended by the Borough Engineer. Submission to and review by
the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation may be required if
there is frontage on a state street. Further subdivision from a tract
subdivided under this section or subdivision of a lot or tract created
§ 195-15 KUTZTOWN CODE § 195-15
185:512
under this section will require a review of plans in accordance with the
standard procedures of this chapter, and this shall be noted on the final
plan.
F. Exempted land developments: final plan. In the case of a land
development consisting of a single nonresidential building or two
single-family detached dwellings on a lot or lots, the developer may
submit only a final plan to the borough. The final plan shall contain all
information required by § 195-18 of this chapter and shall be submitted
and reviewed in accordance with § 195-12. The final plan shall be
submitted to the County Planning Commission for review. Submission
to and review from the County Conservation District shall be required
when recommended by the Borough Engineer. Submission to and
review by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation may be
required if there is frontage on a state street.
G. Requirements pertaining to curb and sidewalk. The sketch plan for
record referred to in Subsection A above and the final plan referred to
in Subsections E and F above shall provide for the installation of curb
and sidewalk adjacent to all existing and proposed public streets within
the proposed subdivision in accordance with § 195-42D of this chapter.

A Highway Occupancy Permit is required pursuant to Section 420
of the Act of June 1, 1945 (P.L 1242, No. 428), known as the "State
Highway Law," _ before a driveway access to a state highway is
permitted. Access to the state highway shall only be as authorized
by a Highway Occupancy Permit.
The approval of this subdivision/land development plan shall in no
way imply that a state highway permit can be acquired or that
the borough will support, encourage or not oppose the granting
of such a permit. It is possible that access to the property from a
state highway will not be permitted by the Commonwealth and the
property therefore cannot be used for the purpose intended by any
purchaser.
Purchasers are accordingly warned and should govern themselves
accordingly, acquiring state and local Highway Occupancy Permits
before purchasing any premises.
F. Where a sketch plan shows the proposed subdivision or land
development of only a portion of the developer's total property, the
sketch plan shall be accompanied by a drawing showing the entire

§ 195-16 SOLID WASTE § 195-16
185:517
§ 195-17. Preliminary plans.
be shown on a separate sheet from the sketch plan.) The proposed
street system for the remainder of the property proposed for ultimate
subdivision or land development shall be shown so that the street
system in the submitted portion can be considered in relation to future
connections with the unsubmitted portion. In the case of extremely
large properties, the Borough Planning Commission may delimit the
area for which a prospective street system on adjacent property must
be shown. The developer shall also include a statement indicating
proposed future land use for the unsubmitted portion of his property.
A. The preliminary plan shall be clearly and legibly drawn to a scale of one
inch equals 20 feet or one inch equals 50 feet with all dimensions shown
in feet and hundredths of a foot, except that if the average size of the
proposed lots is two acres or larger, the plan may be drawn to a scale of
one inch equals one (100) hundred feet.
B. The preliminary plan shall be made on sheets no smaller than eighteen
by twenty-four (18 x 24) inches and no larger than thirty-six by fortyeight
(36 x 48) inches.

showing the relative location of all the sheets shall be drawn on each
sheet. In addition, a match line shall be drawn on each sheet, and the
developer shall indicate along each match line what sheet is adjoined at
that match line.
D. A plan index, listing the title of each sheet included in the submission,
shall be included on the plans intended for eventual recording.
E. The preliminary plan shall show:

(11) A copy of the deed(s) for the tract.
(12) The name, address and seal of the engineer or surveyor responsible
for the plan.
(13) The names of any abutting subdivisions and land developments and
the book and page numbers where recorded.
(14) The names of the owners of any adjacent unplatted land and the
book and page numbers where recorded.
(15) A location map for the purpose of locating the property being
subdivided or developed, drawn at a scale of one inch equals 800
feet, showing the relation of the property, differentiated by tone or

ARTICLE VI
Design Standards
§ 195-19. Application and general standards.
§ 195-20. Streets.
A. The standards and requirements contained in Articles VI and VII are
intended as the minimum for the promotion of the public health, safety
and general welfare and shall be applied as such by the Borough
Planning Commission and Borough Council in reviewing all subdivision
and land development plans.
B. Whenever other borough regulations impose more restrictive standards
and requirements than those contained herein, such other regulations
shall prevail; otherwise, the standards and requirements of this chapter
shall apply.
C. The layout or arrangement of the subdivision or land development shall
conform to the Comprehensive Plan, any regulations or maps adopted
in furtherance thereof and any other official plans of the borough which
have been adopted.
D. The plan of the proposed subdivision or land development shall be
coordinated with existing adjacent development in order to provide for
harmonious development of the area as a whole.
E. Land shall be suited to the purpose for which it is to be subdivided or
developed. Lands subject to hazards to life, health or property such as
may result from fire, flood, disease or other causes shall either be made
safe for the purpose for which such land is proposed to be used, or such
land shall be set aside for uses which shall not endanger life or property
or further aggravate or increase the existing menace.
F. All subdivisions and land developments shall be reviewed to assure that
all such proposals are consistent with the need to minimize flood
damage, that all utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and
water systems are located and constructed to minimize or eliminate
flood damage and that adequate drainage is provided so as to reduce
exposure to flood hazards.
G. All subdivisions and land developments shall comply with the Borough
Electric Ordinance, Ordinance No. 7 of 1977, as from time to time
amended and supplemented.153
A. General Standards.
(1) All design elements of all streets, including horizontal and vertical
alignment, sight distance and superelevation, are subject to review
and approval by the Borough Council. When reviewing the design
153. Editor's Note: See Ch. 107, Electrical Standards.
§ 195-19 SOLID WASTE § 195-20
185:537
of streets, in addition to the standards in this chapter, the Rural
Design Criteria in the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation
Design Manual Part 2, Highway Design, January 1990 edition, and
A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets, AASHTO,
1984 edition, as from time to time amended and supplemented,
shall be consulted to assure that the road design is in accordance
with acceptable engineering practice.
(2) For certain aspects of vertical and horizontal alignment discussed
below, standards are determined by design speed of the street
involved. For all proposed streets, the developer shall indicate the
proposed design speed. The designated design speed is subject to
the approval of the Borough Council. In general, the design speed
on Arterial streets shall be considered as 55 miles per hour (mph)
(to be determined in each individual case), on collector streets a
minimum of 35 mph (to be determined in each individual case) and
on minor streets 35 mph unless a lesser design speed is permitted
by the Borough Council.
(3) The speed limit proposed to be posted for streets shall not exceed
the design speed.
(4) Streets in and bordering a subdivision or land development shall be
coordinated and be of such widths and grades and in such locations
as deemed necessary to accommodate prospective traffic and
facilitate fire protection.
(5) The location and width of all proposed streets shall conform to the
official plans which have been adopted by the borough and shall be
properly related to all existing streets, recorded streets and official
plans which have been adopted or approved by the borough, county
or state.
(6) Streets within the subdivision or land development and adjacent
roads which will receive traffic from and distribute traffic to the
subdivision or land development shall be adequate in construction,
grade, width and capacity to accommodate traffic generated by the
subdivision or land development.
(7) The proposed street system shall extend existing or recorded
streets at the same width as the existing or recorded streets if
these streets meet or exceed the standards of § 195-20C(1). If the
existing or recorded streets do not meet or exceed the standards of
§ 195-20C(1), the proposed street extensions shall meet the
standards of § 195-20C(1).
(8) Where, in the opinion of the Borough Council, it is desirable to
provide for street access to adjoining property, streets shall be
extended by dedication to the boundary of such property. The
location and number of access points to adjoining properties are
subject to Borough Council approval.
§ 195-20 KUTZTOWN CODE § 195-20
185:538
(9) When streets will be extended to the boundaries of the subdivision
or land development to provide for access to potentially
developable tracts and sanitary sewer and/or water lines will be
constructed in the streets within the developer's tract, the Borough
Council may require extension of the sanitary sewer and/or water
lines to the tract boundary in order to facilitate future extensions to
abutting land.
(10) If a subdivision proposes lots, all of which front on existing public
streets, the Borough Council may require the developer to reserve
land adequate to provide for future street access from the public
streets on which the lots front to the land to the rear of the
proposed lots. Such reserved areas shall be of such dimensions to
permit the construction of streets meeting the standards of this
chapter.
(a) When reservations for future streets will adjoin lots to be
developed prior to the construction of the streets, the
developer shall establish the proposed grades of the future
streets and the extent of the area necessary for the
construction of those streets. If the area necessary for the
construction of the streets extends beyond the proposed street
right-of-way lines, all excavation and grading necessary for the
streets beyond the right-of-way lines shall be done as required
improvements in conjunction with the subdivision which
contains the adjoining lots, or else construction easements
shall be provided on the adjoining lots, sufficient to permit
construction of the future street.
(b) Where reservations for future streets intersect existing streets,
radii shall be provided for the reservations such that the
requirements of § 195-20H(6) and (7) of this chapter could be
met for a street to be constructed in the future.
(11) If lots or parcels in the subdivision are large enough for
resubdivision, or if a portion of the developer's property is not
proposed to be subdivided but could be subdivided in the future,
the Borough Council may require the reservation of land adequate
to provide for future street access to land which could be
resubdivided or subdivided in the future and require that the
location of land reserved for future streets be coordinated with the
street system shown on the subdivision plan.
(12) Connections shall be provided between streets within the
subdivision or land development to provide adequate access for
emergency vehicles, other vehicles and pedestrians.
(13)New minor streets shall be so designed as to discourage through
traffic, but the developer shall provide for the extension and
continuation of arterial and collector streets into and from
adjoining properties when required by the Borough Council. Minor
§ 195-20 SOLID WASTE § 195-20
185:539
streets shall be extended and continued into and from adjoining
properties when necessary for the proper development of and
traffic circulation in the borough.
(14) Where a subdivision or land development abuts an existing street
which does not meet the standards of this chapter, the Borough
Council may require the dedication of land sufficient to widen the
street to meet the standards of this chapter.
(15) Where a subdivision or land development fronts on and will provide
for vehicular access to and from an existing borough street which
does not meet the minimum cartway width requirements of this
chapter, the Borough Council may require the developer to improve
at his expense the borough street cartway to meet those
requirements. Pavement shall be constructed in accordance with
the requirements of this chapter. In addition, provision shall be
made for adequate drainage along the sides of the streets. Such
drainage provisions shall be approved by the Borough Council.
(16) Private streets (streets not to be offered for dedication) shall be
designed and constructed in accordance with the requirements of
this chapter and other borough regulations, including Ordinance
No. 4-1974, 154 as from time to time amended and supplemented,
except as follows:
(a) Private streets need not conform in width to the requirements
of § 195-20C(1) of this chapter; provided, however, that private
streets shall have a cartway of not less than 24 feet unless a
greater width is required by Chapter 225, Zoning; and
provided further that no parking shall be permitted on any
private street that does not contain the width requirements of
§ 195-20C(1) of this chapter.
(b) Private streets shall only be permitted in those subdivisions or
land developments intended to remain under single ownership.
(17) Where streets and other public improvements continue into
adjoining municipalities, evidence of compatibility of design,
particularly with regard to street widths, shall be submitted. The
applicant shall coordinate such design with both municipalities to
avoid abrupt changes in cartway width or in improvements
provided.
(18) The street system shall be designed with regard to:
(a) Consideration of existing topographical considerations.
(b) Providing buildable lots, or in the case of a mobile home park,
lots on which a mobile home can be placed in accordance with
all applicable requirements of Chapter 225, Zoning.

encouraging the use of three-way rather than four-way
intersections when intersections of minor streets are involved.
(d) Avoiding excessive lineal footage of street.
(19) All drives within multiple-family and nonresidential developments
which are intended for circulation within the development shall be
designed to the horizontal and vertical alignment standards for
streets contained within this chapter.
B. Partial and half streets. New half or partial streets will not be
permitted, but wherever a tract to be subdivided borders an existing
recorded half or partial street, the Borough Council may require the
developer to provide adjacent to such half or partial street a reservation
of land adequate to allow the construction of a street meeting the
standards of this chapter.
C. Street widths.

Council for the purpose of promoting the public safety and
convenience and for providing for proposed traffic volumes.
(3) The designation of streets as "minor," "collector" and "arterial" is
subject to Borough Council approval. The Borough Council may
prohibit parking along collector streets.
D. Restriction of access.
(1) Whenever a subdivision or land development abuts or contains an
existing or proposed arterial or collector street, the Borough
Council may require restriction of access to the street by:

J. Cul-de-sac streets.
(1) Dead-end streets are prohibited unless designed as cul-de-sac
streets, provided that in the case of streets which are planned for
future extension into adjoining tracts and will not be the primary
means of access to any lot or dwelling unit, a turnaround is not
required.
(2) Except as provided in Subsection J(1), any street dead-ended for
access to an adjoining property or because of authorized stage
development shall be provided with a turnaround within the
subdivision or land development, and the use of such turnaround
shall be guaranteed to the public until such time as the street is
extended.
(a) If a cul-de-sac turnaround is offset, it shall not be offset to the
right.
(b) Should a temporary cul-de-sac be proposed, arrangements
satisfactory to the Borough Council and Borough Solicitor shall
be made for construction and installation responsibilities of all
improvements when the temporary cul-de-sac is abandoned
and the street is extended.
(c) In the event that the Borough Council shall not consider
development of adjoining property to be imminent, the Council
may require that a permanent curbed cul-de-sac be
constructed.
(3) Cul-de-sac streets shall be at least 250 feet from the right-of-way of
the street intersected to the end of the turnaround. Cul-de-sac
streets shall not exceed 500 feet in length as defined in this chapter
and shall not furnish access to more than 20 dwelling units. The
Borough Council may permit temporary culs-de-sac longer than
500 feet at its discretion if future extension of the cul-de-sac is
likely In the opinion of the Council. At its discretion, the Council
may permit culs-de-sac to serve more than 20 dwelling units when
it believes adequate provision will be made for vehicular circulation
and parking.
(4) Unless future extension is clearly impractical or undesirable, the
turnaround right-of-way shall be placed adjacent to the tract
boundary with sufficient additional right-of-way width provided
along the boundary line to permit extension of the street at full
width.
(5) All cul-de-sac streets, whether permanently or temporarily
designed as such, shall be provided at the closed end with a fully
paved turnaround. Minimum radius to the pavement edge or
curbline shall be 50 feet, and minimum radius to the right-of-way

Council.
L. Service street (alleys).
(1) Service streets are prohibited in residential subdivisions except
where required by the Borough Council to avoid direct driveway
access to arterial or collector streets.
(2) Service streets may be permitted by the Borough Council in other
types of development, provided that the developer produces
evidence satisfactory to the Council of the need for such service
streets and provided that the service streets are not the primary
means of access.

proposed, zoning requirements, topography and requirements for safe
and convenient vehicular and pedestrian circulation, including the
reduction of intersections with arterial and collector streets.
B. Length.
(1) Blocks shall have a maximum length of 1,600 feet and a minimum
length of 500 feet. The Borough Council may decrease the
permitted maximum and/or minimum lengths of blocks if the
topography of land, proposed lot sizes or surface water drainage
conditions warrant such a decrease.
(2) Blocks along arterial streets shall not be less than 1,000 feet.
C. Depth. Residential blocks shall be of sufficient depth to accommodate
two tiers of lots, except where reverse frontage lots are required or
where prevented by the size, topographical conditions or other inherent
conditions of the property.
D. Nonresidential blocks. Blocks in nonresidential areas may vary from the
elements of design detailed above if required by the nature of the use.
In all cases, however, adequate provisions shall be made for off-street
parking and loading areas and pedestrian and vehicular circulation.
E. Crosswalks. Crosswalks may be required by the Borough Council
whenever necessary to facilitate pedestrian circulation and to give
access to community facilities. Such crosswalks shall have a minimum
width of 10 feet and contain a walkway, constructed of a material
approved by the Borough Council, with a minimum width of four feet.
A. General standards.
(1) The size, shape and orientation of lots shall be appropriate for the
type of development and use contemplated and be in accordance
with the provisions of Chapter 225, Zoning. Lots shall be capable of
being built upon, or in the case of a mobile home park, on which a
mobile home can be placed, in accordance with all applicable
requirements of Chapter 225, Zoning.
§ 195-21 KUTZTOWN CODE § 195-23
185:548
(2) Side lot lines shall be at right angles to straight street lines and
radial to curved street lines. Lot lines shall follow municipal
boundaries rather than cross them.
(3) The depth of lots for single-family detached dwellings shall not be
less than one nor more than three times their width at the street
line.
(4) Depth and width of parcels intended for nonresidential uses shall
be adequate for the use proposed and sufficient to provide
satisfactory space for on-site parking, loading and unloading,
setbacks, buffer yards and landscaping, etc.
(5) Subdivisions shall be designed to avoid the creation of remnants of
land. If remnants of land would result after subdividing, adequate
provision, which shall be approved by the borough, shall be made
for the disposition and maintenance of those remnants.
(6) Flag lots are prohibited, unless permission is granted by the
Borough Council upon recommendation of the Borough Planning
Commission. The Council may grant permission to utilize flag lots
when it deems flag lots appropriate because of topographical or
other conditions unique to the site. The access strip portions of a
flag lot must be wide enough to permit the construction of a street
with a right-of-way meeting the requirements of this chapter and
shall not be used for building purposes. In granting permission to
use flag lots, the Borough Council shall find:
(a) That the use of flag lots will not result in conditions which will
cause increased interruptions to traffic flow, accident hazards
and sedimentation and runoff problems onto public streets.
(b) That the use of an internal street system or marginal access
streets on which lots would front will not be more appropriate
for development of the tract than the use of flag lots.
(c) That the use of flag lots is necessary to permit utilization of a
tract of ground otherwise not feasible to utilize under the
applicable standards for lots found in this chapter.
(d) No more than one flag lot shall be created from the original
tract of land for each 10 lots created from the original tract of
land which meet the requirements of this chapter for lot
configuration.
(e) Should a flag lot be divided into two or more lots, the access
strip shall be constructed into a street complying with the
specifications of this chapter.
(f) All structures shall be located on the flag lot so as to provide
the required setback should the access strip be used for
construction of a street.
§ 195-23 SOLID WASTE § 195-23
185:549
(7) Where an ultimate right-of-way line has been provided, all setbacks
and lot areas shall be measured from such ultimate right-of-way
line.
(8) Wherever feasible, lots shall be designed so that buildings can be
constructed above street grade. Where this is not possible, the
developer shall indicate what measures are to be taken to assure
proper drainage away from the buildings.
(9) When only a portion of a tract is designed at a time and there exists
the potential for development of the remainder of the tract, lots
shall be designed such that they do not restrict access to the
remainder of the tract, do not unduly restrict the potential
development of the remainder of the tract, nor result in the
creation of awkward of difficult-to-develop parcels in the remainder
of the tract.
(10) The maximum slope utilized when grading lots or streets along an
adjoining tract of land not owned by the developer shall be a three
to one (3:1) slope ratio of horizontal distance to vertical distance.
B. Lot frontage and access.
(1) All lots shall abut and have direct driveway access to an existing or
proposed public street or private street meeting the requirements
of this chapter.
(2) Reverse frontage lots shall be avoided except where required by
the Borough Council to restrict access to existing streets or to
overcome specific disadvantages of topography or orientation. All
residential reverse frontage lots shall contain a landscape screen,
fence, earth mounding or similar screening device and barrier to
vehicular access subject to Borough Council approval within the
rear yard.
(3) Where access to land within a subdivision or land development will
be solely by proposed roads within an adjoining municipality, the
Borough Council may require assurance from the adjoining
municipality that adequate provisions have been made to ensure
construction of the proposed access roads.
(4) When the rear wall of a building will face a public street, the
Borough Council may require a landscape screen, fence, earth
mounding or similar screening device subject to Borough Council
approval between the building and the public street.
(5) After consideration of street speeds, traffic volumes, projected
traffic generated at a proposed land use and the location and
arrangement of existing and proposed driveways and intersections,
the Borough Council may require the developer to install at his
expense an acceleration or deceleration lane, or both, to serve a
proposed driveway or street. If additional street right-of-way is
§ 195-23 KUTZTOWN CODE § 195-23
185:550
required to construct the acceleration or deceleration lane, the
additional right-of-way shall be provided by the developer. When
required by the Borough Council, the developer shall furnish a
study to the borough which will provide the information necessary
to permit the determination as to whether an acceleration or
deceleration lane is required.
C. Lot size. The minimum lot size and width requirements set forth in
Chapter 225, Zoning, shall be met.
D. Off-street parking.
(1) Each proposed dwelling unit in a subdivision or land development
shall meet the off-street parking requirements of Chapter 225,
Zoning.
(a) In the case of single-family or two-family dwellings and
townhouses with on-lot parking, such off-street parking spaces
shall be provided behind the street right-of-way line and may
be provided in an attached or separate garage, carport or
driveway. The spaces shall not be located within any clear sight
triangle required by this chapter.
(b) In the case of multiple-family dwellings, such off-street parking
spaces shall be provided in common parking areas located
adjacent to, within or near the multiple-family dwellings.
Spaces shall not be located within a street right-of-way nor
within any clear sight triangle required by this chapter. The
size of parking spaces and the width of aisles shall be in
accordance with Chapter 225, Zoning. The grade of areas used
for parking shall not exceed 6%. The grade of areas used only
for access shall not exceed 10%.
(2) Nonresidential development shall meet the off-street parking
requirements of Chapter 225, Zoning.
E. Driveways.
(1) Subdivisions and land developments shall be provided with internal
streets to which the lots will have driveway access in order to
minimize the number of driveway intersections with existing public
streets. This reduction in driveway intersections will lessen
interruptions to traffic flow and accident hazards and minimize
sedimentation and runoff problems onto existing public streets.
The Borough Council may require the use of common driveways for
abutting lots.
(2) All driveways which provide access to arterial and collector streets,
if such driveways are permitted by the Borough Council, shall be
designed with turnaround areas so that cars will not back onto the
arterial and collector streets.
§ 195-23 SOLID WASTE § 195-23
185:551
(3) Provision shall be made at all intersections of driveways with
streets to ensure adequate stormwater drainage and erosion and
sediment control. The Borough Council may require subdivision
and land development plans to show a typical treatment of the
construction of driveways and handling of storm drainage where
the driveways intersect a street. The Council may require as a
condition to approval of a plan that prior to the issuance of zoning
or building permits the specific proposals for the construction of a
driveway and treatment of storm drainage and erosion and
sediment control for that driveway be submitted to the borough for
approval.
(4) Driveways shall be placed at locations at which sight distance is
adequate to safely allow each permitted movement to be made into
or out of the driveways; such that the free movement of normal
street traffic is not impaired; such that the driveways will not
create a hazard; and such that the driveways will not create an area
of undue traffic congestion on streets. Applicable safe sight
distance as established in the regulations of the Pennsylvania
Department of Transportation shall be provided.
(a) The Borough Council may require the driveway to a lot which
abuts two or more streets to be restricted to that street which
can more safely accommodate its traffic. The Borough Council
may also require a driveway to be located directly across from
a street or driveway on the opposite side of the street the
driveway intersects if the Council judges that offset driveways
will create a safety hazard.
(b) The Borough Council may require the permissible location of a
driveway for a lot to be shown on the subdivision or land
development plan, and further require that driveway locations
be subject to approval of the Council.
(c) At driveway intersections with streets, an isosceles triangle
shall be established for a distance of 20 feet at each side of the
point of intersection of the cartway lines. Within such clear
sight triangles, no vision-obstructing object shall be permitted
which obscures vision above the height of 30 inches and below
the height of 10 feet, measured from the center line grades of
the intersecting driveway and street.
(5) Entrances to private driveways serving multiple-family dwellings
shall be rounded at a minimum radius of 10 feet. The maximum
radius shall be 30 feet.
(a) Entrances to private driveways serving one- and two-family
dwellings shall be rounded at a maximum radius of four feet
eight inches; however, depressed curb may be used as
provided for in borough regulations, including Ordinance No.

185:552
14-1972, as amended by Ordinance No. 13-1974, and all
subsequent amendments thereto.155
(b) For nonresidential driveways, the width, excluding radii, of
driveways shall conform to the following:
Width in Feet
Minimum Maximum
One-way 12 24
Two-way 24 36
(c) Each lane provided shall be a minimum of 12 feet in width.
(d) The radius of the edge of the driveway apron shall be at least
15 feet and no more than 35 feet; however, depressed curb may
be used as provided for in borough regulations, including
Ordinance No. 14-1972, as amended by Ordinance No.
13-1974, and all subsequent amendments thereto.156
(6) The angle of a driveway as it intersects a street shall be such that a
vehicle entering the driveway may do so in an orderly and safe
manner with a minimum of interference to through street traffic
and such that a vehicle leaving the driveway may enter safely into
the lane of traffic moving in the desired direction. Driveways shall
intersect streets as nearly as possible at right angles, and in no
case at an angle of less than 75 degrees or more than 105 degrees;
provided, however, that the Borough Council may permit the use of
one-way driveways on a property, and such one-way driveways may
intersect streets at an angle of not less than 45°.
(7) Private driveways shall have such grades as to furnish safe and
convenient parking spaces and to provide a safe and convenient
means of access. The grades and construction materials of
driveways shall be such that the materials of the driveway will not
wash onto public streets. The maximum permissible grade shall be
7% on all driveways, except that driveway grades shall not exceed
5% within 20 feet of street cartway lines. The area between the
right-of-way line of the street and the cartway shall be paved. The
Borough Council may require the developer to submit with his
subdivision or land development plans evidence that the above, and
the other standards for driveways established in this section, can
be met for each lot where doubt exists as to the feasibility of
meeting the standards.
(8) The center line of entrances to private driveways serving one- and
two-family dwellings shall be located at least 40 feet from the point

proposed subdivision or land development, the developer shall submit
a copy of such approval to the borough prior to approval of a final plan.
F. New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems.
A. General principles for storm drainage systems. Storm sewers, culverts,
endwalls, inlets and related installations and improvements shall be
provided in order to:
(1) Permit unimpeded flow of natural watercourses;
(2) Ensure adequate drainage of all streets;
(3) Intercept stormwater runoff along streets at intervals related to the
extent and grade of the area drained;
(4) Provide positive drainage away from on-site sewage disposal
facilities and buildings;
(5) Accommodate runoff so that there shall be no increase in rate of
stormwater peak discharge leaving the subdivision or land
development during or after construction based on the design
rainfall frequency established in this chapter. Pre- and postdevelopment
runoff shall be evaluated for all drainage areas
discharging from the site.
(6) Ensure adequate drainage at intersections of driveways with
streets.
(7) Provide that where existing storm sewers are reasonably
accessible and of adequate capacity, subdivisions and land
developments shall connect to the existing storm sewers.
(8) Provide that when no existing storm sewer system is accessible and
of adequate capacity, stormwater runoff shall discharge to an
existing watercourse with defined bed and barriers. Runoff shall
not be increased or concentrated onto adjacent properties, nor
shall the velocity of flow be increased beyond that existing prior to
subdivision or land development unless written approval is given by
the adjacent property owners to the proposed discharge of surface
runoff and the written agreements are approved by the Borough
Council.
(9) Provide that when storm drainage will be directed into an adjacent
municipality, all provisions for accommodating such storm drainage
shall be submitted to the governing body of that municipality for
review.
B. Design of storm drainage systems.
§ 195-25 SOLID WASTE § 195-26
185:555
(1) Complete stormwater calculations in accordance with the design
standards and Appendices of this chapter and all designs for
drainage facilities shall be submitted to the borough for review.
(2) Where a subdivision or land development is traversed by or
contains a pond, lake, watercourse, drainageway, channel, storm
drainage system or stream, there shall be provided a drainage
easement that conforms substantially with the line of such pond,
lake, watercourse, drainageway, channel, storm drainage system or
stream of such width as will be adequate to preserve the
unimpeded flow of drainage (one-hundred-year flow) and to provide
for widening, deepening, relocating, improving or protecting such
features or drainage facilities. Minimum easement width shall be
10 feet from each side of the watercourse, water body, stream,
pond, lake or drainage facility, but the borough may require a
greater easement when necessary. Bearings and distances shall be
provided for the boundaries of easements.
(3) Any changes in an existing drainageway shall be subject to the
approval of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Resources, the Army Corps of Engineers and/or the Federal
Emergency Management Agency when each or all have
jurisdiction. All permits and approvals shall be issued prior to
construction of storm drainage-related improvements.
(4) The developer shall properly grade and seed slopes, and fence open
ditches when a safety hazard can result. Areas within easements
shall be kept as lawn or in natural conditions to allow maintenance
and entrance.
(5) All drainage facilities shall be designed to adequately handle
surface runoff and carry it to suitable outlets and shall be designed
in accordance with the minimum design standards in the
Appendices of this chapter.
(a) Subsurface drainage systems shall have manholes spaced at
intervals not exceeding 400 feet and located wherever
branches are connected or sizes are changed and wherever
there is a change in alignment or grade. Inlets or other means
of interconnection may be used instead of manholes when
approved by the Borough Council.
(b) For drainage lines of thirty-six-inch diameter or greater,
manholes may be spaced at intervals greater than 400 feet
with the approval of the Borough Council.
(c) Storm sewer lines within street rights-of-way shall be placed
immediately in front of the curb when parallel to the right-ofway.
Locating storm sewers under curbs in curves or at street
intersections will not be permitted.

rights-of-way shall be approved by the Pennsylvania
Department of Transportation, and a letter from that
Department indicating such approval shall be submitted to the
borough.
(e) Subsurface storm drainage systems shall have PennDOTapproved
inlets located as required by this chapter to intercept
runoff. Inlets shall be designed and located to prevent hazards
to vehicles, bicycles and pedestrians.
(f) PennDOT-approved endwalls or end sections shall be used in
lieu of inlets where feasible to minimize clogging of grates with
leaves, debris, etc.
(g) Reinforced concrete pipe shall be used for all storm sewer
lines, including retention/detention facilities. Alternate pipe
materials may be used with Borough Council approval;
however, alternate materials shall be backfilled with select
granular PennDOT (2-RC) material, solidly compacted in sixinch
lifts. All pipe materials shall meet PennDOT requirements
and shall have a minimum diameter of 15 inches.
(h) Provisions shall be made to minimize erosion within
watercourses and at points of discharge from storm drainage
facilities through the use of proper ground cover, riprap or
root-reinforcing systems.
(i) Where there is a change in pipe size through an inlet, the top
inside elevation of the outlet pipe shall be at or below the
elevations of all incoming pipes.
(6) Storm sewers, culverts, swales, channels and related facilities shall
be designed to accommodate and discharge all runoff from
adjacent upstream drainage areas, assuming the upstream area is
fully developed.
C. Standards for drainage of streets.
(1) All streets shall be designed to provide for the discharge of surface
water from their rights-of-way. The design storm shall be a ten-year
frequency for residential subdivisions with a gross density less than
six units per acre, and a twenty-five-year frequency for all other
subdivisions or land developments. The design storm shall be a
one-hundred-year frequency for sections conveying runoff directly
to detention facilities and in other instances when required by the
borough.
(2) The pavement cross slope on streets and the slope of sidewalk
areas shall be one-fourth (1/4) inch per foot.

185:557
(3) Surface cross drainage at intersections or other roadway sections
will not be permitted.
(4) Inlets shall be spaced to limit the gutter flow spread into the travel
lanes to one-half (1/2) the lane width during the design storm.
(5) Inlet efficiency and bypass flows, per PennDOT design charts, shall
be considered in the design of storm sewer systems.
(6) To ensure adequate drainage at low points along the line of streets,
overflow swales shall be designed to convey the full one-hundredyear
storm flows away from all street low points. These swales shall
be located to prevent flooding of the downslope lots.
D. Design of retention and detention facilities.
(1) General requirements.
(a) Where retention (permanent pool) and detention (dry bottom)
basins are required by the Borough Council, adequate
assurances of maintenance, indemnification, liability insurance

(b) Retention and detention facilities shall be designed and located
so as to not present a hazard to the public health or safety.
Their design shall be approved by the Borough Council.
(c) Such facilities shall be designed so that no adverse effects will
result from backwater flooding.
(2) General design considerations.
(a) The number and location of retention/detention facilities are
subject to the approval of the Borough Council.
(b) For detention basins, a method of carrying low flow through
the basin area shall be provided, and the basin shall be
provided with a positive gravity outlet to a natural channel or
storm sewer of adequate capacity.
(c) If percolation of runoff is considered as a method of runoff
abatement, percolation tests shall be taken at the site of the
proposed detention facilities and the results submitted to the
borough for review. At the discretion of the Borough Council,
percolation facilities may be prohibited.
(d) The storage duration of stormwater runoff shall not exceed 24
hours after rainfall has ceased. The Borough Council may
require the fencing of retention/detention basins when deemed
necessary for the public safety.
(e) The pipe spillway outletting from the retention/detention basin
shall be designed on the basis of a rainfall frequency that is
consistent with the requirements of this chapter. Basin
§ 195-26 KUTZTOWN CODE § 195-26
185:558
discharge velocities and quantities shall be consistent with
the need to protect the public health, safety and welfare and
to prevent turbulent conditions and erosive velocities in a
receiving watercourse.
(f) Minimum grades for turf areas inside detention basins shall be
1%, and maximum side slopes of retention/detention basins
shall be 33% (three units horizontally to one unit vertically).
Depending upon the location and the intended use of the
detention facilities during nonfunctioning times, a side slope of
less than 33% for one or both slopes may be required by the
Borough Council. Side slopes shall be kept as close to the
natural land contours as practical, but when a detention basin
is to be maintained by a future residential lot owner, the
maximum side slope shall be 25% (four units horizontally to
one unit vertically).
(g) Paved surfaces that are to serve as stormwater storage areas
shall have minimum grades of one-half percent (1/2%) and
shall be restricted to storage depths of six inches maximum.

tributary drainage area.
[2] Shoreline protection shall be provided to prevent erosion
from wave action.
[3] Facilities shall be provided to allow the pond level to be
lowered by gravity flow for cleaning purposes and
shoreline maintenance.
[4] Aeration facilities as may be required to prevent pond
stagnation shall be provided. Design calculations to
substantiate the effectiveness of these aeration facilities
shall be submitted with final engineering plans.
Agreements for the perpetual operation and maintenance
of aeration facilities shall be prepared to the satisfaction of
the Borough Council.
(3) Specific design considerations for retention/detention basins.

the guaranty or completion of the improvements, whichever is sooner.
A. When maximal provision is to be made for the use of solar energy by
structures, in general streets toward which buildings are to be oriented
should run in an east-west direction.
B. Section 195-23A(2) indicates that side lot lines shall be at right angles
to straight street lines and radial to curved street lines. The Borough
Council may allow variation from this requirement where provision is to
§ 195-32 KUTZTOWN CODE § 195-34
185:570
§ 195-35. Carbonate areas.
be made for maximal use of solar energy, in which case side lot lines
generally may run from due north to due south or with slight variation
east or west of this axis.
(1) When lot lines will not be provided, consideration should be given
to orienting buildings to maximize solar access. Generally,
buildings should be located with their long axes running east to
west, though in some high-density or townhouse developments a
north-south orientation for the long axes may be desirable.
(2) Consideration should be given to locating structures and open
spaces such that buildings will not cast shadows on other buildings.
C. Consideration should be given to reserving solar easements within lots
for protection of solar access.
A. Designation of area.

(2) In carbonate areas, alteration and development of land may be
hazardous with respect to foundation safety of structures, the
creation of unstable land as a result of changes in drainage and the
contamination of ground and surface waters. Within the limitations
of the information available at the time of review of individual
applications, the borough shall attempt to make reasonable
judgments as to the applicant's compliance with the standards of
§ 195-35B. Under no circumstances shall the borough or any officer
or employee of the borough assume any liability for any damages
that may result from an applicant's or any interested party's
reliance upon the regulations of § 195-35B or any decisions made
by the borough in the administration of such regulations.
B. Standards.
(1) Land grading or construction of buildings or other site
improvements shall not directly or indirectly diminish the flow of

data from observation wells shall be provided by the applicant.
(2) All buildings, structures, roads and other impervious surfaces and
storm drainage facilities and other utilities shall be so situated,
designed and constructed as to minimize the risk of structural
damage from existing or future sinkholes. A recognized
professional with competence in the field shall demonstrate that a
minimal risk of structural damage due to sinkholes will exist or
§ 195-34 SOLID WASTE § 195-35
185:571
indicate mitigating measures to be taken to minimize the risk of
structural damage.
(3) Whenever a detention or retention basin for the control of
stormwater will be located in a carbonate area, a geological
evaluation of the proposed location shall be conducted to
determine susceptibility to sinkhole formation. The design of all
facilities over limestone formations shall include measures to
prevent groundwater contamination and, where necessary,
sinkhole formation. Soils used for the construction of basins shall
have low-erodibility factors ("K" factors). The borough may require
the installation of an impermeable liner in basins. All detention
facilities shall be above ground unless otherwise approved by the
Borough Council.
(4) The following guidelines shall be considered during construction
activities:
(a) Care should be taken to prevent collection and drainage of
surface water into excavated or low-lying areas of the site
during excavation and construction.
(b) Soft and wet conditions should be located wherever they may
exist or be encountered.
(c) Soft areas should be removed and replaced with suitable fill
compacted in accordance with recognized standards, such as
ASTM.
(d) The bottom of all excavations should be inspected for soft or
unusually moist conditions. A visual inspection of the
excavated bearing surface, together with soundings or probes
of the soil at regular intervals, should be done. Any soft or
unusually moist soil should be further excavated and a
determination made of the extent of the problem. Remedial
measures should be adopted as necessary.
(e) The low points of swales and outlet locations for drainage pipes
should be lined with impermeable liners instead of stone riprap
in order to prevent infiltration of runoff.
(f) Excavation should be kept to a practical minimum.
(g) Water from roof drains or other drainage systems should be
collected and conveyed away from structures to prevent
infiltration near foundations. If possible, roof drains should
discharge directly into a storm sewer system or the street
gutter. Watertight pipe connections should be used for storm
sewers.
§ 195-35 KUTZTOWN CODE § 195-35
185:572
(h) Subsoil erosion/sinkholes that occur during the construction of
a project should be corrected as quickly as possible under the
supervision of a qualified geotechnical engineer.
(i) Blasting should be avoided.
(5) Should the Borough Council find that an applicant may create a
significant risk to the public's health or safety, in spite of taking all
reasonable actions to minimize such risks, or should the Council
determine that the applicant has not taken all reasonable actions to
minimize such risks, the Council may deny the application.
C. Submission requirements. The following information shall be
submitted:
(1) For areas proposed for grading, construction of buildings and other
improvements, the applicant shall indicate the presence of any of

§ 200-3. Exempt parties.

agencies or political subdivisions shall be exempt from payment of the tax

A. The tax imposed by § 200-2 shall not be imposed upon:
(1) A transfer to the commonwealth or to any of its instrumentalities,
agencies or political subdivisions by gift, dedication or deed in lieu

confirms a transfer previously recorded, but which does not extend
or limit existing record legal title or interest.
(5) A transfer of division in kind for no or nominal actual consideration
of property, passed by testate or intestate succession and held by
cotenants; however, if any of the parties take shares greater in

transfer was acquired by the husband and wife or husband or wife
prior to the granting of the final decree in divorce, between parent
and child or the spouse of such child, between brother or sister or
spouse of a brother or sister and brother or sister or the spouse of a

be imposed under this article. Where the document by which title is
acquired by a grantee or statement of value fails to set forth that
the property was acquired by the grantee from or for the benefit of
his principal, there is a rebuttable presumption that the property is
the property of the grantee in his individual capacity if the grantee
claims an exemption from taxation under this clause.

is made by the commonwealth.

not subject to tax under this article.

Each employer within the Borough of Kutztown is hereby charged with
the duty of collecting and paying over to the Tax Collector of the Borough
of Kutztown, or his approved nominee, from each employee engaged in
his services, a pro rata share of the said tax of $52 per year upon the

said employer within the Borough of Kutztown or who is engaged in an
occupation, as hereinbefore defined, for the benefit of the said employer or
in the service of said employer within the corporate limits of the Borough
of Kutztown. The pro rata share of the tax assessed by the employer shall
be determined by dividing the $52 tax by the number of payroll periods
established by the employer for the year. For purposes of determining the
pro rata share, the employer shall round down to the nearest 1/100 of
a dollar. Each employer shall make returns and payments of such tax as
required by this section and § 200-25 and is authorized to deduct the said
local services tax at the rates hereby imposed from each employee in his
service, whether said employee is paid by salary, wages, commission or
otherwise. Each employer within the corporate limits of the Borough of

returns as required by this section and § 200-25, and making payments
after deducting the tax from the salary, wages, commissions or other
compensations payable by him to his employees, shall be entitled to retain
a commission calculated at 1/2 of 1% on the gross tax due and payable by
each individual, provided that such tax is collected and paid over by the
employer within the one month next following the last day of the quarter
in which it is due. It is further provided that if the employer fails to file
said return and pay said tax, but makes collection thereof from the salary,
wages, commissions or other compensation paid by him to said employee,
the employer shall be responsible for payment of the tax in full without
any deductions or commissions as though the tax had originally been levied
against him. If said employer fails to file a return, deduct and remit the tax
imposed on his employees within four months of the due date, the applicable
penalty and interest shall be chargeable to the employer. It is the employer's
responsibility to file the return and remit the tax on behalf of his employee
whether or not he deducts the tax from the employee. It is further provided

other employer of such individual that said local services tax has been paid

employer receiving such original certificate of payment of the local services
tax by another employer shall not deduct or collect the local services tax
imposed by this article.
§ 200-25. Determination by employer as to which employees are
subject to tax; commission.

records as of the first day of January in determining the number of
employees from whom the said local services tax shall be deducted and

engages the services of any individual in an occupation to be performed
in the Borough of Kutztown on or after the first day of January 2008 shall

beyond the corporate limits of the Borough of Kutztown and said employee
is not liable for a similar tax in another municipality. Each employer whose
business location is beyond the corporate limits of the Borough of Kutztown
shall be required to furnish to the Tax Collector of the Borough of Kutztown,

local services tax shall rest upon the employer of the domestic on the next
succeeding date following the first day of January, and said employer shall
furnish to said domestic employee a certificate of payment of said local
services tax to be exhibited to all other employers of said domestic, and
the producing of said certificate to such other employers shall excuse them
from the deduction of any further local services tax from said domestic
employee for the taxable year.

ARTICLE V
Residential Permit Parking
§ 212-33. Purpose; enforcement.
The Council of the Borough of Kutztown considers it to be in the interest of
the citizens of the borough to provide for the establishment of a residential
permit parking program in order to alleviate the hardship experienced by
residents in certain areas of the borough in obtaining on-street parking
space, to preserve the residential quality of neighborhoods and to provide
for improvement in air quality. The powers and duties as contained in this
article shall be performed by the Mayor and the Police Department of the
borough as more fully described in this article.
§ 212-34. Authority to designate permit parking areas.
Certain streets and other public areas within the borough may be
designated, as provided for in this article, as permit parking areas in which
resident vehicles displaying valid parking permits may stand or be parked
without limitation by parking time restrictions established by this article.
Vehicles not displaying valid parking permits may stand or be parked for
a limited period of time not to exceed the time specified upon adequately
posted signs.
§ 212-35. Designation criteria.
No area within the borough shall be designated as a residential permit
parking area unless said area is within any one or more of the following
zoning districts within the Borough of Kutztown: R-1 Residential, R-2 Low
Density Residential, R-3 Medium Density Residential, R-4 Medium High
Density Residential or R-5 High Density Residential. In addition, in order
for an area to be eligible for residential permit parking designation, the
following additional criteria must be satisfied:
§ 212-36. Designation of permit parking areas.
A. At least 50% of the street level front footage use is non-businessrelated.
B. During any period between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. on
weekdays, except holidays, the number of vehicles parked and/or
standing, legally or illegally, at on-street parking spaces is equal to 70%
or more of the legal on-street parking capacity of the area. For purposes
of this evaluation, a legal parking space shall be 20 linear feet.
C. During the same period of time as specified in Subsection B above, 10%
or more of the vehicles parked and/or standing on the streets in the
area are not registered in the name of a person residing within a threeblock
distance of the location at which the vehicle is parked.
§ 212-33 SOLID WASTE § 212-36
185:653
§ 212-37. Issuance of permits.
Following Borough Council's approval of the Mayor's designation of a
residential permit parking area, the Police Department of the Borough
shall issue appropriate parking permits and shall cause parking signs to be
erected in the designated area indicating the times and conditions under
which parking shall be allowed. A parking permit shall be issued only upon
application and payment of the applicable fee and only to the owner or
operator of a motor vehicle who resides in the designated residential permit
parking area. Vehicles exceeding a gross weight of 10,000 pounds and/
or 20 or more feet in length are not eligible for parking permits. Two
parking permits shall be issued for each residence or dwelling unit within
a designated residential permit parking area for which a separate electric
meter has been installed if said residence or dwelling unit is situate within
A. Areas in residential zoning districts may from time to time be
designated by the Mayor of the Borough as residential permit parking
areas upon determination by the Mayor; provided, however, that said
designation shall not become effective until approved by resolution of
Borough Council.
B. If an area within a residential zoning district is not an approved
residential permit parking area, a majority of the residents within said
area may, by filing a petition with Borough Council, request said area to
be designated a residential permit parking area. The petition shall be
referred by Borough Council to the Mayor of the Borough who may
either act in accordance with Subsection A of this section or may refer
the petition to Borough Council for its consideration. If the Mayor of the
Borough refers the petition to Borough Council, the Mayor shall inform
Borough Council whether or not the signatories to the petition
constitute a majority of the residents, 18 years of age or older, who
reside within the area requested to be designated as a residential
permit parking area.
C. Under no circumstances shall the Mayor or Borough Council designate
an area as a residential permit parking area unless all of the
designation criteria hereinabove established in § 212-35 of this article
are met. In order to determine whether such designation criteria have
been met, Borough Council may designate the Mayor or any duly
appointed and designated representative of the Borough to make such
studies or surveys as may be appropriate under the circumstances to
make such determination and shall report the findings of such study or
survey to Borough Council.
D. Either the Mayor of the Borough or Borough Council may, prior to
acting upon a petition filed in accordance with Subsection B of this
section, request the Borough Planning Commission for its
recommendation as to whether or not the area in question should be
designated a residential permit parking area. Any such
recommendation by the Borough Planning Commission shall not be
binding upon either the Mayor of the Borough or Borough Council.

or dwelling unit is located within an R-3 Medium Density Residential Zoning
District, an R-4 Medium High Density Residential Zoning District or an
R-5 High Density Residential Zoning District of the Borough. The parking
permit shall be issued to the person in whose name the electric meter is
registered; provided, however, that the parking permit may only be issued
for a vehicle owned or used by a person residing within the residential
permit parking area. To be eligible for a parking permit, residents must
prove residency and vehicle ownership or evidence of having a leased or
company-owned vehicle. The Mayor of the Borough shall establish criteria
for proof of residence.
§ 212-38. Application for permit; duration.
Each parking permit issued shall be valid for the calendar year for which
such parking permit is issued, and in the event that such parking permit
is issued during the calendar year, then it shall be valid only for the
remainder of said calendar year for which the parking permit is issued.
Parking permits may be renewed annually upon reapplication in the manner
required by the Police Department of the Borough. Each application or
reapplication for a parking permit shall contain information sufficient to
identify the applicant, his residence address or address or real property
owned or leased by the applicant and located within a residential permit
parking area and the license number(s) on the motor vehicle(s) for which
application is made and such other information that may be deemed
relevant by the Mayor. If the holder of a parking permit acquires a motor
vehicle not included in the holder's initial application or transfers a motor
vehicle previously included in the holder's application, the holder shall
submit to the Police Department of the Borough information concerning the
transfer and/or acquisition deemed relevant by the Mayor.

On-Street Person With Disability Parking Spaces
[Added 4-17-2007 by Ord. No. 4-2007]
§ 212-78. Installation; marking.
An on-street person with disability parking space may be installed in front
of a residence to accommodate a disabled resident with limited mobility.
The on-street space is comprised of blue curb and a person with disability
parking sign and post at the parking area in accordance with Pennsylvania
statute.
§ 212-79. Intent.
§ 212-80. Policy for installation and use.
A. An on-street person with disability parking space is intended to provide
safe, close parking for a mobility-disabled resident in a residential highparking-
demand area where parking in front of his/her home may not
be readily available.
B. An on-street person with disability parking space is not intended to
replace parking in the resident's driveway or garage.
C. An on-street person with disability parking space is provided as a
courtesy to the disabled resident or family member living at that
residence who has mobility limitations getting to and from the vehicle.
D. Each on-street person with disability parking space displaces a general
parking space, which can create an impact where the residential
parking supply is limited. For this reason, the resident must
demonstrate a real need for an on-street person with disability parking
space.
A. If a mobility-disabled resident demonstrates a need for an on-street
person with disability parking space through the application process
and the criteria for an on-street person with disability parking space are
met, then the Borough shall install the person with disability parking
space, free of charge to the resident, as a courtesy to the disabled
resident.
B. The Mayor of the Borough of Kutztown shall approve or deny the
request. The resident may appeal the Mayor's decision to the Kutztown
Borough Council with a written letter of appeal. The Borough is not
required to provide an on-street person with disability parking space.
C. An on-street person with disability parking space remains open to the
public. The resident does not have exclusive use of the on-street person
with disability parking space. Any registered vehicle with a valid person
with disability placard or person with disability or severely disabled
§ 212-78 SOLID WASTE § 212-80
185:701
§ 212-81. Application and review process; approval; appeal;
installation.
veteran license plate may park in the on-street person with disability
parking space.
D. The Borough may periodically check to see if the person with disability
parking space is still required.
E. The Borough may remove the on-street person with disability parking
space at any time.
A. Application. A disabled resident may request an on-street person with
disability parking space in front of his/her home by submitting an
application to the Kutztown Borough Police Department. The requestor
may obtain an application form from the Kutztown Borough Police
Department or submit an on-line application.
B. Criteria. In order for an application for an on-street person with
disability parking space to be approved, the following conditions must
be met:
(1) The applicant is a resident of the Borough of Kutztown and is
permanently disabled, or will be disabled for a period of time
exceeding one year, or resides with a disabled person who is
permanently disabled or will be disabled for a period of time
exceeding one year and the applicant is responsible for his or her
transportation; and
(2) The applicant must be able to demonstrate, by providing
documentation from a treating physician, that the disabled
person's mobility is impaired to the extent that ambulation is
severely restricted; and
(3) The requested location is on a public street; and
(4) The applicant resides at the address where the on-street handicap
space is requested; and
(5) The applicant supplies the vehicle's license plate number and/or
disabled parking placard number with expiration date for
verification; and
(6) The applicant, or resident being cared for, has a currently valid
person with disability or severely disabled veteran registration
plate on his/her vehicle, or has been issued a currently valid person
with disability placard; and
(7) The applicant must be able to demonstrate that off-street parking is
inaccessible; and
(8) The requested on-street person with disability parking space must
be installed in front of the property of the applicant's property,
§ 212-80 KUTZTOWN CODE § 212-81
185:702
§ 212-82. Removal.
unless deemed unfeasible by the Borough, and then such space
should be placed as near to the requested property as possible; and
(9) The requested parking space does not conflict with any parking
restrictions already in place and the parking width in front of the
residence is at least 22 feet; and
(10) The applicant agrees to advise the Kutztown Borough Police
Department when the person with disability parking space is no
longer required.
C. Staff review. The Kutztown Borough Police Department reviews the
application to determine if an on-street person with disability space is
justified based on the criteria as specified under § 212-81B. The
Kutztown Borough Police Department will make a recommendation to
the Mayor of the Borough of Kutztown regarding the installation of a
person with disability parking space at the location of the request.
D. Approval. The Mayor of the Borough of Kutztown or the Mayor's
designated representative shall approve or deny the request based
upon the recommendation of the Police Department. If the Mayor
approves the request, the Mayor shall issue a proclamation pursuant to
§§ 212-7 and 212-8 of § 212 of the Code of the Borough of Kutztown.
E. Appeal. If the request is denied, the applicant shall be notified of the
decision in writing. The applicant shall have 30 days from receipt of
said notice to appeal the decision to the Council of the Borough of
Kutztown. The Kutztown Borough Police Department shall submit a
copy of the report of the prior recommendation to the Council of the
Borough of Kutztown.
F. Installation. If the request is approved, the Borough of Kutztown shall
mark the space and install the on-street person with disability parking
space as prescribed in Chapter 212, § 212-78.
A. The Kutztown Borough Police Department may follow up with the
resident annually to ensure the space is still needed. If the resident has
moved or if at the discretion of the Mayor the space is no longer
needed, the Borough of Kutztown will remove the space.
B. Additionally, should a determination be made by the Police Department
that the space is being misused by the applicant, or that the on-street
person with disability parking space is not in conformance with this
chapter, then the Police Department may make recommendation to the
Mayor to have the on-street person with disability parking space
removed.
C. If the decision is made to remove the on-street person with disability
parking space, the applicant will be notified in writing of the decision.
The applicant has 30 days from receipt of notice to appeal the decision

studies or surveys as may be appropriate under the circumstances to
make such determination and shall report the findings of such study or
survey to the Borough Council.

Commonwealth of Pennsylvania on December 19th, 1990, is hereby
imposed, in the amount set forth in § 218-8 of this article, against the owner
of any improved property as to which the service point of connection for
sewer service is located within the corporate boundary limits of the borough
and which improved property is required to be connected to the sewer
system pursuant to the term and provisions of the ordinances, codes and
regulations of the borough then in effect requiring such connection.
§ 218-8. Sewer tapping fee amount.
The total dollar amount of the sewer tapping fee payable by the owner of
an improved property regarding such improved property, as described in
§ 218-7 of this article, shall be the product of the sum of $3,676 and the
number of equivalent dwelling units and fractions thereof made applicable

§ 218-5 KUTZTOWN CODE § 218-8
218:732
of sewer equivalent dwelling units applicable to any improved property shall
be one).
§ 218-9. Water tapping fee imposed.
A tapping or tap-in fee (hereinafter referred to as the "water tapping fee")
(the sewer tapping fee and the water tapping fee, herein after collectively
the "tapping fees"), as said term is described in Act 203, as amended by Act
57 and as authorized by Section 507-A of the Pennsylvania Municipalities
Planning Code, as enacted by Act 209 of 1990 of the Commonwealth of

to which the service point of connection for water service is located within
the corporate boundary limits of the borough at which improved property
is required to be connected to the water system pursuant to the terms and
provisions of the ordinances, codes and regulations of the Borough then in
effect requiring such connection.
§ 218-10. Water tapping fee amount.
The total dollar amount of the water tapping fee payable by the owner
of an improved property regarding such improved property, as described
in § 218-9 of this article, shall be the product of the sum of $1,143 and
the number of equivalent dwelling units and the fractions thereof made
applicable to such improved property by § 218-11 of this article. (The
minimum number of water equivalent dwelling units applicable to any
improved property shall be one).
§ 218-11. Manner of determining equivalent dwelling units;
borough's refusal to accept tapping fee.
A. The number of equivalent dwelling units (or fraction thereof) applicable
to any property, for purpose of the sewer tapping fee and/or water
tapping fee, shall be equal to one plus such additional equivalent
dwelling units (or fraction thereof) which shall be determined in the
discretion of the borough by any one of the following methods: Method
1: in accordance with the EDU Schedule attached hereto, marked as
Exhibit A and incorporated herein by reference thereto;194 Method 2: at
the discretion of the borough, based upon the estimated annual water
usage and/or sewage discharge (calculated as number of gallons per
day) of an improved property; or Method 3: in accordance with actual
metered flow as hereinafter provided. For each improved property
consisting of a single-family residential attached or detached dwelling
unit, notwithstanding the actual or estimated amount of water
consumed or sewage discharged by such improved property, the
equivalent dwelling units shall be one.
194. Editor's Note: Exhibit A is on file in the Borough offices.
§ 218-8 WATER AND SEWERS § 218-11
218:733
B. In the event that the owner of any improved property, other than the
owner of an apartment complex or a multifamily residential structure, is
required by the borough to pay a sewer tapping fee or water tapping fee
so determined, then such owner shall have the right to challenge the
amount of the tapping fees and thereafter have the tapping fees
calculated based upon the actual metered volume of water used at the
owner's improved property at full design occupancy and utilization, as
determined by the water meter connected to such improved property,
and thereafter meter the water usage for the improved property for a
period of one year. All costs of installing such a water meter shall be
paid for by owner, and the type of water meter to be installed and the
installation thereof shall be approved and performed by the borough.
After such water usage has been metered at full design occupancy and
utilization for a period of one calendar year, should the number of
equivalent dwelling units actually consumed at such improved property
be greater than the number of equivalent dwelling units previously
determined by the borough, the owner shall pay the borough additional
tapping fees based upon the actual metered water usage. In the
alternative, should the amount of equivalent dwelling units, as
determined by the actual metered water usage, be less than originally
determined by the borough, then in such event the owner shall be
entitled to a refund of the portion of the tapping fees the owner initially
paid which was in excess of the tapping fees subsequently calculated
using the actual metered water usage. Any challenge to the amount of
tapping fees initially determined to be due by the borough at time of the
owner's application must be made by such owner in writing within five
days of the date the borough determines the amount of the initial
tapping fees; provided, however, that in no event shall any challenge be
allowed to minimum tapping fees based upon one equivalent dwelling
unit or to tapping fees determined for apartment complexes or
multifamily residential structure purposes. The borough reserves the
right to utilize devices and methods, in the alternative to the metering
of water being supplied to an improved property, which are, in the
opinion of the borough more suitable for the purpose of measuring the
quantity and/or type of water usage and/or sewer discharge. Such
alternative devices and methods shall be utilized at the expense of the
owner of the improved property.
C. In the event that the borough discovers or has reason to believe, within
one year following the date of payment by any owner of any tapping
fees for any improved property, that the application filed by any owner
of such improved property seeking connection to the water system and/
or sewer system was grossly inaccurate or contained
misrepresentations of material facts as to the full design occupancy and
utilization of the improved property which would have affected the
borough's determination of the tapping fees, then the borough shall be
permitted to utilize the Method 3 described in Subsections A and B
hereinabove to determine actual metered water usage and/or sewage
discharge and may thereupon redetermine the amount of tapping fees
applicable to the improved property. If the amount of the applicable
§ 218-11 KUTZTOWN CODE § 218-11
218:734
tapping fees is thereby increased, then the owner shall immediately pay
to the borough a sum equal to the amount of increase in such tapping
fees.
D. Until such time as the borough has accepted tapping fees pursuant to
an owner's application, no availability of sewer and/or water capacity
shall be deemed guaranteed with respect to any improved property.
Further, the borough reserves the right to refuse to accept any tapping
fees for the reason of lack of capacity and/or for the reason that the
application submitted by the owner indicates that the applicable
connections to the sewer system and/or water system will not be made
within one year from the date of application submission.
E. In the event that a commercial or industrial customer increases its
discharge into the sewer system or its consumption of water in the
measured year, as measured in terms of water or sewer EDU's, above
its base year use or above the highest level of use subsequent to the
base year, and higher than the base year use, the owner of the improved
property shall be responsible to pay to the borough a tapping fee in
conjunction with the additional EDU's allocable to such property as a
result of the increased discharge into the sewer system or the increase
consumption of water.
F. In the event that any owner of any improved property changes the use
of said property in such a manner as to require the issuance of a new
zoning permit, the Code Office will review the proposed use, with
reference to the Exhibit A, EDU Schedule, to this Chapter 218, to
determine:
(1) Whether the proposed new use of said property constitutes a
change in the description of improved property set forth on such
Exhibit A applicable to said property and a change in the number of
EDU's allocable to said property as a result of the proposed new
use; and
(2) The additional number, if any, of EDU's allocable to such property
as a result of the proposed new use, in excess of the number of
EDU's allocable to said property as a result of prior use.
G. In the event that the Code Office determines that the conversion of use
will cause an increase in the number of EDU's allocable to the property
in question under the proposed new use, then no zoning, housing,
building, occupancy or other permits for the new proposed use shall be
issued by the borough unless and until the owner of said property shall
have paid to the borough the respective additional sewer tapping fee
amount and additional water tapping fee amount, calculated pursuant
to §§ 218-8 and 218-10 of this chapter, respectively, on account of the
additional EDU's determined to be applicable to the new proposed use
in accordance with the preceding Subsection E.
H. Notwithstanding changes from time to time in the use of a particular
property, the present and subsequent owners thereof shall be entitled

A. The tapping fees shall be due and payable at the time a determination of
the tapping fee is made by the borough following receipt of the owner's
application to make any connection to the sewer system and/or water
system as provided in this article or, if the borough so permits, the time
when the borough causes the connection of any such improved property
to the sewer system and/or water system, at the cost and expense of the
owner pursuant to the provisions of the ordinances of this borough then
in effect.
B. The tapping fees shall be due and payable within 30 days after the

§ 220-1. Purpose and intent; authority.
§ 220-2. Establishment and delineation of Wellhead Protection
Overlay District and wellhead protection zones.
The Wellhead Protection Overlay District shall be defined as that area
within the corporate boundaries of the borough as is set forth on the
map attached hereto, marked as "Exhibit A" and incorporated herein by
A. The borough and its residents depend exclusively on groundwater for a
safe drinking water supply. The borough has developed and owns the
drinking water wells utilized by the borough, which are located upon a
parcel of land adjacent to the corporate boundary of the borough.
Certain land use practices and activities outside and within the borough
can seriously threaten or degrade groundwater quality. The purpose of
this chapter is to protect the public health, safety and welfare through
the preservation of the groundwater resources of the borough public
water supplies and to ensure a future supply of safe and healthful
drinking water for the residents of the borough. The designation of the
Wellhead Protection Overlay District, as provided hereinbelow, and the
regulation of activities within such Wellhead Protection Overlay District
will reduce the potential for ground and surface water contamination of
the borough-owned water wells and thereby preserve irreplaceable
groundwater resources. The delineation of the Wellhead Protection
Overlay District and the development of the provisions of this chapter
are based upon a professional study of the hydrogeologic and other
features of the borough and contiguous areas conducted for the benefit
of the borough and certain nearby municipalities.
B. This chapter is enacted pursuant to the authority contained in Article I,
Section 27, of the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
and Sections 501, 503, 601, 604(1), and 603(b) of the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code, Act 247 of 1968, as amended by Act 170
of 1988, as amended by Act 209 of 1990, and as further amended by Act
131 of 1992, which provisions authorize the borough to enact
ordinances regulating development and land uses to ensure the public
health and safety, provide a safe, reliable and adequate water supply
and preserve natural values and aquifers.

(a) All outdoor parking spaces and access drives shall be at least
15 feet from any multifamily dwelling building on the lot and
15 feet from all exterior lot lines of the development or project.
(b) Common parking lots shall not be designed or located so as to

220:816
(c) Entrance- and exitways shall have a minimum width of 12 feet

high-rise apartment or townhouse development is not restricted by
virtue of a deed restriction, covenant or agreement restricting use of
land, or by any master deed bylaw or other document applicable to a
common interest ownership community, so as to prevent such low-rise
apartment, high-rise apartment or townhouse development from being
utilized as a "student home," as defined in § 225-251B, then the
following additional requirements shall be met: [Added 7-20-2006 by
Ord. No. 14-2006]
(1) An on-site property manager shall be present on the property at all
times.
§ 225-25 WELLHEAD PROTECTION § 225-25
220:817
§ 225-25.1. Student home. [Added 5-9-1995 by Ord. No. 5-1995])
(2) An office or other suitable permanent facility shall be provided on
the property.
(3) An appropriate electronic security system shall be sufficient to
permit the on-site manager to monitor the security of the entire
property, both interior and exterior public areas on a real-time
basis.
A. Findings of fact regarding student home use. The Council of the
Borough of Kutztown makes the following findings of fact in support of
and as the basis for the enactment of this § 225-25.1 of the Code of the
Borough of Kutztown, Chapter 225, Zoning:
(1) Immediately adjacent to the boundary of the Borough is Kutztown
University ("university"), an institution of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania system of higher education which offers both
undergraduate and graduate degree programs.
(2) In addition to those university students who live in housing located
upon the university campus, many of the students attending the
university obtain housing accommodations located within the
Borough.
(3) Forty-seven and six-tenths percent of the total dwelling units in the
Borough are currently rental dwelling units.
(4) Approximately 87.6% of the total rental dwelling units in the
Borough are currently utilized to house individual students or
groups of students.
(5) Approximately 41.7% of the total dwelling units in the Borough are
currently utilized as rental dwelling units for the housing of student
groups or individual students.
(6) A comparison of Borough Police Department records of incidents
investigated during the period from December 21, 1990, to
December 21, 1991, with records for the period from December 21,
1993, to December 21, 1994, for the purpose of identifying those
police responses to residential addresses which are known to have
been utilized at that time for student and student group housing
revealed the following:
(a) During the 1990-1991 period, 957 incidents were recorded, of
which 557 were responses to dwelling units housing students
as described above.
(b) During the 1993-1994 period, 749 incidents were recorded, of
which 513 were responses to dwelling units housing students
as described above.
§ 225-25 KUTZTOWN CODE § 225-25.1
220:818
(c) A comparison of the two time periods in question indicates that
a twenty-two-percent reduction in overall incidents occurred,
while the percentage of such incidents attributable to dwelling
units housing students increased by 10.5%.
(d) The persistent occurrence at student housing addresses of the
types of incidents studied in this analysis of police records,
particularly incidents of disturbing the peace, public
drunkenness, drinking or possession of open containers of
alcohol in restricted areas, underage drinking, and/or driving
under the influence of alcohol or controlled substances
presents a danger to public health and safety and undermines
the quality of life for the owners and occupants of the other
land uses in the vicinity of such dwelling units housing
students.
(7) The enrolled student population of the university was 4,891 in
1970, 5,154 in 1980, 7,609 in 1990 and 7,762 in 1994, while the
U.S. Census count of the population of the borough was 4,166 in
1970, 4,040 in 1980 and 4,704 in 1990.
(8) The on-campus housing capacity of the university is currently 2,850
students.
(9) Approximately 1,800 university students live in housing in the
borough.
(10) Based upon information received from the university, it is
anticipated that no new on-campus student housing facilities will
be constructed by the university for a period of at least 10 years.
(11) The borough anticipates continued pressure on its housing supply
for the purpose of providing student housing.
(12) The borough previously found it necessary to enact off-street
parking requirements for group dwelling unit uses and permit
parking requirements on borough streets in those areas having the
greatest density of dwelling units housing students and those areas
closest to the university.
(13) In many neighborhoods of the borough, any further increase in the
density of the number of dwelling units devoted to student housing
will detrimentally and irretrievably alter the character of such
neighborhoods and render such neighborhoods to be largely
student dormitory districts which are no longer residential singlefamily
dwelling unit neighborhoods.
(14) The preservation of the character and integrity of the borough's
residential areas, as well as the prevention of undue concentrations
of population and traffic congestion, require the imposition of
restrictions upon any further increase in the density of dwelling
units devoted to student housing.
§ 225-25.1 WELLHEAD PROTECTION § 225-25.1
220:819
(15) The borough has determined that a student housing density
restriction and separation requirement of 500 feet will not prevent
the establishment of a number of additional dwelling units housing
students in the borough.
(16) The borough has determined that application of the student
housing density restriction and separation requirement to portions
of the C-C Business Commercial Central District and C-1 Business
Commercial District bordering the R-1, R-2 and R-3 residential
districts is necessary to prevent a further erosion of the residential
character of those residential districts. [Added 7-10-2001 by
Ord. No. 6-2001]

ARTICLE VI
Nonconforming Lots, Uses, Structures and Buildings
§ 225-34. Statement of intent.
§ 225-35. Nonconforming lots of record.
A. Within the districts established by this chapter or subsequent
amendments thereto, there exist or will exist certain nonconformities
which, if lawful before this chapter was passed or amended, may be
continued, subject to certain limitations, although such
nonconformities would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under the
terms of this chapter or subsequent amendments thereto.
B. To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to
require a change in the plans, construction or designated use of any
building or structure on which actual construction was lawfully begun
prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter and
on which building construction has been diligently carried on in
conformity with § 225-43B of this chapter.
A. Except as hereinafter provided for in this section, structures or
buildings and uses permitted in the district may be erected or
established on any nonconforming lot, notwithstanding limitations
imposed by other provisions of this chapter. This provision shall apply
even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for area or width,
or both, that are applicable in the district, provided that yard
requirements, other than those applying to area or width, or both, shall
conform to the requirements of the district in which the lot is located.
B. In those districts requiring different minimum lot requirements for
different permitted uses, when a nonconforming lot does not comply
with any minimum lot requirements for the district in which the lot is
located, then only the use which requires the minimum deviation from
the existing nonconforming lot dimensions may be used by right under
this provision. Any other use on a nonconforming lot or any variance of
yard requirements shall be obtained only through action of the Zoning
Hearing Board.
C. If two or more lots, combination of lots and portions of lots with
continuous frontage in single ownership are of record at the time of
passage or amendment of this chapter, and if all or part of the lots does
not meet the requirements established for lot width and/or area, the
land involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for the
purpose of this chapter, and no portion of said parcel shall be used or
sold in a manner which diminishes compliance with lot width and/or
area requirements established by this chapter, nor shall any division of
any parcel be made which creates a lot with width and/or area below
the requirements stated in this chapter. No division of any parcel shall
be made which creates a lot with a width or area below the
requirements stated in this chapter, as from time to time amended.
§ 225-34 WELLHEAD PROTECTION § 225-35
220:867
§ 225-36. Nonconforming uses of land.
Lawful use of land which at the effective date of this chapter or as a result of
subsequent amendments thereto becomes nonconforming, and when such
use involves no individual structure or building with a replacement cost
exceeding $1,000, may be continued by the present or any subsequent
owner so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following
provisions:
§ 225-37. Nonconforming structures or buildings.
A structure or building which at the effective date of this chapter or
subsequent amendments thereto becomes nonconforming by reason of
restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, its location on the lot or
other requirements concerning the building or structure may be continued
to be used so long as such structure or building remains otherwise lawful,
subject to the following provisions:
D. When an application for approval of a subdivision, whether preliminary
or final, has been approved, or approved subject to conditions
acceptable to the applicant, no subsequent amendment to this chapter
shall be applied to affect adversely the right of the applicant to
commence and to complete any aspect of the approved subdivision in
accordance with the terms of such approval within five years of such
approval. When final approval is preceded by preliminary approval, the
five-year period shall be counted from the date of preliminary approval.
A. Extension. No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased
or extended to occupy a greater area of land than was owned or leased
by the user at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this
chapter; provided, however, that no extension of a nonconforming use
of land shall exceed 50% of the area occupied by said nonconforming
use of land at the time such nonconforming use of land became
nonconforming.
B. Discontinuance. Whenever a nonconforming use has been discontinued
for a period of 12 consecutive months, such use shall not thereafter be
reestablished. Any further use shall be in conformity with the provisions
of this chapter.
C. Changes of use. A nonconforming use, if changed to a conforming use,
shall not thereafter be changed back to any nonconforming use. A
nonconforming use may, by special exception, be changed to another
nonconforming use, provided that the Zoning Hearing Board shall find
that the proposed use is equally appropriate or more appropriate in the
district than the existing nonconforming use.
D. Additional structures or buildings. No additional structures or buildings
shall be erected in connection with such nonconforming use of land.

by any means may be reconstructed as long as the basic structural

shall not increase the nonconformity with the zoning district in
which it is located.

fire, explosion, acts of God or acts of the public enemy shall be
permitted to be reconstructed pursuant to the following provisions:

Official and the Zoning Officer, the size, architecture and
design of the reconstructed building or structure is not
appreciably changed from the way it existed before it was

significant building that could be reconstructed under the
Historic Building Code or is otherwise determined by the
Building Official, the structure shall meet the current Uniform
Construction Code requirements in place at the time that a
building permit for the reconstruction of the building or
structure is sought.

building shall be, for any reason, moved for any distance unless it shall
thereafter conform to the zoning regulations for the district in which it
is located after it is moved.

220:869
§ 225-38. Nonconforming uses of structures or buildings.

nonconforming, may be continued so long as such use remains otherwise
lawful, subject to the following provisions:
A. Extension. A nonconforming use may be extended throughout any part
of an existing structure or building or a new addition may be
constructed, provided that any extension or addition shall comply with
all provisions of this chapter with respect to height, area, width, yard
and lot coverage requirements for the district in which the structure or
building is located and that such addition shall not exceed 50% of the
gross floor area of the existing building or structure.
B. Change of use. A nonconforming use, if changed to a conforming use,
shall not thereafter be changed back to any nonconforming use. A
nonconforming use may, by special exception, be changed to another
nonconforming use, provided that the Zoning Hearing Board shall find
that the proposed use is equally appropriate or more appropriate in the
district than the existing nonconforming use.
C. Discontinuance. Whenever a nonconforming use of a structure or
building or portion thereof has been discontinued or abandoned for 12
consecutive months, such structure or building or portion thereof shall
not thereafter be used for a nonconforming use.
D. Removal, destruction or renovation. [Amended 6-16-2015 by Ord.
No. 4-2015]

any means may not be rebuilt and used for a nonconforming use,
unless said structure or building is reconstructed pursuant to the
requirements herein below set forth.
(2) A building or structure in which a non-conforming use exists which
is partially destroyed by any means may be reconstructed and used
for the same nonconforming use as long as the basic structural
elements of the original building or structure are retained. Such
determination shall be made by the Borough Building Code Official.
The reconstructed portions of the building or structure shall not
increase the nonconforming use of the building or structure with
the zoning district in which it is located.
(3) A nonconforming building or structure which is totally destroyed by
fire, explosion, acts of God or acts of the public enemy shall be
permitted to be reconstructed pursuant to the following provisions:

§ 225-41. Special exception uses not deemed nonconforming uses.
Any use which is permitted as a special exception in a district under the
terms of this chapter (other than a change through Zoning Hearing Board
action from one nonconforming use to another nonconforming use) shall not
be deemed a nonconforming use in such district but shall without further
action be considered a conforming use.
(b) The reconstruction of the building or structure will not
increase the nonconformity of the building or structure from
the way it existed before it was destroyed.
(c) Based on plans and evidence submitted to the Building Code
Official and the Zoning Officer, the size, architecture and
design of the reconstructed building or structure is not

is in such conformity, the certificate of use and occupancy shall be
issued. [Amended 3-26-1996 by Ord. No. 3-1996]
(2) A certificate of use and occupancy shall be granted or refused in
writing, within 10 days from the date that the application is
submitted to the Zoning Officer, unless said time period is extended
in writing by the applicant.
(3) In districts in which performance standards are imposed, no
certificate of use and occupancy shall become permanent until 30
days after the facility is fully operating and only after, upon
reinspection by the Zoning Officer, it is determined that the facility
is in compliance with all performance standards. After said
reinspection, the Zoning Officer shall notify the applicant that the
facility is in full compliance with all performance standards and
that the certificate of use and occupancy is permanent or that the
facility does not comply and that the certificate of use and
occupancy is still temporary and will be revoked by the Zoning
Officer if such facility is not in compliance within an additional
thirty-day time period, unless, because of the particular
circumstances, said additional time period is extended in writing by
the Zoning Officer.

charges and expenses and collection procedures for zoning permits,
certificates of use and occupancy, special exceptions, variances and
appeals and other matters pertaining to this chapter.
B. The schedule of fees shall be available for inspection in the office of the
Zoning Officer and may be altered or amended by the governing body
by resolution.238
C. Until all application fees, charges and expenses have been paid in full,
no action shall be taken on any application or appeal.
A. Procedure. The following procedures shall be observed prior to making
any amendment to or change of this chapter or the Official Zoning Map:

§ 225-44 WELLHEAD PROTECTION § 225-46
220:877
(1) Every such proposed change not initiated by the Planning
Commission shall be referred to the Planning Commission at least
30 days prior to the governing body holding a public hearing to
provide the Planning Commission opportunity to submit
recommendations.
(2) The recommendations of the Planning Commission shall be
submitted in writing to the governing body.
(3) At least 30 days prior to the public hearing, the governing body
shall submit the proposed ordinance to the Berks County Planning
Commission for recommendation.
(4) Public hearing; notice. [Amended 7-20-2006 by Ord. No.
14-2006]
(a) Before voting on the enactment of an amendment, the Borough
Council shall hold a public hearing thereon, pursuant to public
notice. In addition, if the proposed amendment involves a
change on the Official Zoning Map, notice of said public
hearing shall be conspicuously posted by the Borough at points
deemed sufficient by the Borough along the perimeter of the
tract to notify potentially interested citizens. The affected tract
or area shall be posted at least one week prior to the date of
the public hearing.
(b) In addition to the requirement that notice be posted, where the
proposed amendment involves a Zoning Map change, notice of
the public hearing shall be mailed by the Borough at least 30
days prior to the date of the hearing by first class mail to the
addressees to which real estate tax bills are sent for all real
property located within the area being rezoned, unless the
rezoning constitutes a comprehensive rezoning as evidenced
by tax records within the possession of the Borough. The notice
shall include the location, date and time of the public hearing.
A good-faith effort and substantial compliance shall satisfy the
requirements of this subsection. Proposed action shall not be
taken until Planning Commission and Berks County Planning
Commission recommendations are made. If, however, the
Planning Commission and Berks County Planning Commission
fail to act within 30 days, the governing body shall proceed
without such recommendation.
(5) Procedure for landowner curative amendments.
(a) A landowner who desires to challenge on substantive grounds
the validity of this Zoning Chapter or the Official Zoning Map
or any provision thereof which prohibits or restricts the use or
development of land in which he has an interest may submit a
curative amendment to the governing body with a written
request that his challenge and proposed amendment be heard
§ 225-46 KUTZTOWN CODE § 225-46
220:878
and decided as provided in Section 916.1 of the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code, as amended.240 The governing
body shall commence a public hearing thereon within 60 days
of the request, as provided for in Section 916.1 of the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, as amended. The
curative amendment and challenge shall be referred to the
Berks County Planning Commission and the Planning
Commission, and notice of the hearing thereon shall be given
as provided in Section 610 and Section 916.1 of the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, as amended.241
(b) The public hearing shall be conducted in accordance with
Section 908 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning
Code,242 as amended, and all references therein to the Zoning
Hearing Board shall, for purposes of this section be references
to the governing body; provided, however, that the deemed
approval provisions of Section 908(9) of the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code, as amended, shall not apply and
the provisions of Section 916.1(f)243 of the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code, as amended, shall control. If the
Borough does not accept a landowner's curative amendment
brought in accordance with this subsection and a court
subsequently rules that the challenge has merit, the courts
decision shall not result in a declaration of invalidity for the
entire Zoning Ordinance and Official Zoning Map, but only for
those provisions which specifically relate to the landowner's
curative amendment and challenge. Section 908(1.2) of the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, as amended,
pertaining to hearing procedures, and Section 908(9) of the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, as amended,
pertaining to decision, findings and deemed approval, shall not
apply to landowner curative amendments and that the
corresponding provisions in Section 916.1(c), (d) and (f) of the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, as amended, shall
control. [Amended 7-20-2006 by Ord. No. 14-2006]
(c) If the governing body determines that a validity challenge has
merit, the borough may accept a landowner's curative
amendment, with or without revisions, or may adopt an
alternative amendment which will cure the challenged defects.
The governing body shall consider the curative amendment,
plans and explanatory material submitted by the landowner
and shall also consider:

water supplies, schools and other public service facilities;
[2] If the proposal is for residential use, the impact of the
proposal upon regional housing needs and the
effectiveness of the proposal in providing housing units of
a type actually available to and affordable by classes of
persons otherwise unlawfully excluded by the challenged
provisions of this Zoning Chapter and Official Zoning Map;
[3] The suitability of the site for the intensity of use proposed
by the site's soils, slopes, woodlands, wetlands,
floodplains, aquifers, natural resources and other natural
features;
[4] The impact of the proposed use on the site's soils, slopes,
woodlands, wetlands, floodplains, natural resources and
natural features, the degree to which these are protected
or destroyed, the tolerance of the resources to
development and any adverse environmental impacts;
[5] The impact of the proposal on the preservation of
agriculture and other land uses which are essential to
public health and welfare; and
[6] The impact of the proposal upon existing conditions within
the area; the health, safety, morals and general welfare of
the residents and occupants within the forenoted area; and
the essential character of the neighborhood or district.
(6) Procedure for borough curative amendments. If the Borough
determines that this Zoning Chapter or any portion thereof is
substantially invalid, it shall take the following actions:
(a) The Borough shall, by formal action, declare this Zoning
Chapter or appropriate portions thereof substantively invalid
and propose to prepare a curative amendment to overcome
such invalidity. Within 30 days following such declaration and
proposal the governing body of the borough shall:
[1] By resolution, make specific findings setting forth the
declared invalidity of this Zoning Chapter or applicable
portions thereof, which may include:
[a] References to specific uses which are either not
permitted or not permitted in sufficient quantity;
[b] Reference to a class of use or uses which require
revision; or
[c] Reference to this Zoning Chapter which requires
revisions.
§ 225-46 KUTZTOWN CODE § 225-46

§ 225-47. Procedure to obtain preliminary opinion.
In order not to unreasonably delay the time when a landowner may secure
assurance that this Zoning Chapter or Official Zoning Map is free from
challenge, and recognizing that the procedure for preliminary approval
[2] Begin to prepare and consider a curative amendment to
this Zoning Chapter to correct the declared invalidity.
(b) Within 180 days from the date of the declaration and proposal,
the borough shall enact a curative amendment to validate, or
reaffirm the validity of, this Zoning Chapter pursuant to the
provisions required by Section 609 of the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code, as amended,244 in order to cure
the declared invalidity of this Zoning Chapter.
(c) Upon the initiation of the procedures as set forth in Subsection
A(6)(a) above, the governing body shall not be required to
entertain or consider any landowner's curative amendment
filed under § 225-46A of this Zoning Chapter, nor shall the
Zoning Hearing Board be required to give a report requested
under Sections 909.1 and 916.1 of the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code, as amended,245 subsequent to
the declaration and proposal based upon the grounds identical
to or substantially similar to those specified in the resolution
required by Subsection A(6)(a)[1] above. Upon completion of
the procedures as set forth in Subsection A(6)(a) and (b) above,
no rights to a cure pursuant to the provisions of Sections 609.1
and 916.1 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, as
amended,246 shall, from the date of the declaration and
proposal, accrue to any landowner on the basis of the
substantive invalidity of the unamended Zoning Ordinance for
which there has been a curative amendment pursuant to this
section.
(d) The borough, having utilized the procedures as set forth in
Subsection A(6)(a) and (b) above, may not again utilize said
procedure for a thirty-six-month period following the date of
the enactment of a curative amendment, or reaffirmation of the
validity of this Zoning Chapter, pursuant to Subsection A(6)(b)
above; provided, however, that if after the date of declaration
and proposal there is a substantially new duty or obligation
imposed upon the borough by virtue of a change in statute or
by virtue of a Pennsylvania Appellate Court decision, the
borough may utilize the provisions of this section to prepare a
curative amendment to this Zoning Chapter to fulfill said duty
or obligation.

preliminary, tentative or final approval or for the issuance of a building
permit so long as they provide reasonable notice of the proposed use or
development and a sufficient basis for a preliminary opinion as to its
compliance.
B. If the Zoning Officer's preliminary opinion is that the use or
development complies with this Zoning Chapter and other applicable
ordinances and Official Zoning Map, notice thereof shall be published

unless notice of proposed enactment is given in the manner set forth in
this section, and shall include the time and place of the meeting of the
governing body at which passage will be considered and a reference to
a place within the borough where copies of the proposed amendment
may be examined without charge or obtained for a charge not greater
than the cost thereof. The governing body shall publish the proposed
amendment once in one newspaper of general circulation in the
borough not more than 60 days nor less than seven days prior to
passage. Publication of the proposed amendment shall include either
the full text or the title and a brief summary, prepared by the borough's
Solicitor and setting forth all the provisions in reasonable detail. If the

circulation in the borough at the time the public notice is
published.

Berks County Law library or other county office designated by the
§ 225-47 KUTZTOWN CODE § 225-48
220:882
Berks County Commissioners, who may impose a fee no greater
than that necessary to cover the actual costs of storing said
ordinance.
B. In the event that substantial amendments are made in the proposed
amendment, before voting upon enactment the governing body shall, at
least 10 days prior to enactment, readvertise, in one newspaper of
general circulation in the borough, a brief summary setting forth all the
provisions in reasonable detail together with a summary of the
amendments.

findings on the application within 45 days after the last hearing

Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code,250 as amended, or of
this Zoning Chapter or of any other ordinance, rule or regulation of
the Borough shall contain a reference to the provisions relied on
and the reasons why the conclusion is deemed appropriate in the

decision shall be deemed to have been rendered in favor of the
applicant unless the applicant has agreed in writing to or on record
to an extension of time. When a decision has been rendered in favor
of the applicant because of the failure of the Board to meet or
render a decision as hereinabove provided, the Board shall give
public notice of said decision within 10 days from the last day it
could have met to render a decision in the same manner as
provided in Subsection A of this section. If the Board shall fail to

this Zoning Chapter.
(6) Appeals from the determination of the Zoning Officer or Borough

(1) The Board shall hear requests for variances where it is alleged that
the provisions of this Zoning Chapter inflict unnecessary hardship
upon the applicant. The Board may by rule prescribe the form of
application and may require preliminary application to the Zoning
Officer. The Board may grant a variance, provided that all of the
following findings are made where relevant in a given case:
251. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. §§ 10609.1 and 10916.1(a)(2).
§ 225-51 WELLHEAD PROTECTION § 225-51
220:889
(a) That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity, narrowness or shallowness of lot size, of
shape or exceptional topographical or other physical
conditions peculiar to the particular property, and that the
unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions and not
circumstances or conditions generally created by the
provisions of this Zoning Chapter in the neighborhood or
district in which the property is located.
(b) That because of such physical circumstances or conditions
there is no possibility that the property can be developed in
strict conformity with the provisions of this Zoning Chapter
and that the authorization of a variance is therefore necessary
to enable the reasonable use of the property.
(c) That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
appellant.
(d) That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property
is located nor substantially or permanently impair the
appropriate use or development of adjacent property nor be
detrimental to the public welfare.
(e) That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance that will afford relief and will represent the least
modification possible of the regulations in issue.
(2) In granting any variance, the Board may attach such reasonable
conditions and safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement
the purposes of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, as
amended,252 and this Zoning Chapter.
(3) No nonconforming use of neighboring lands, structures or
buildings in the same district, and no permitted or nonconforming
use of land, structures or buildings in other districts, shall be
considered grounds for the granting of a variance.
(4) The jurisdiction of the governing body shall not be infringed upon
by action of the Board in any matter which should appropriately be
the subject for an amendment to this Zoning Chapter or Zoning
Map. No variance shall be granted under this section to allow a
structure or use in a district restricted against such structure or
use.
C. Special exceptions.
(1) The Board shall grant or deny such special exceptions to the terms

of the governing body, the Zoning Officer or any aggrieved owner or tenant
of real property who shows that his property or person will be substantially
affected by the alleged violation, in addition to other remedies, may institute
any appropriate action or proceeding to prevent, restrain, correct or abate
such building, structure, landscaping or land or to prevent, in or about such
premises, any act, conduct, business or use constituting a violation. When
any such action is instituted by a landowner or a tenant, notice of that action
shall be served upon the borough at least 30 days prior to the time the
action is begun by serving a copy of the complaint on the governing body.
No such action may be maintained until such notice has been given.

all court costs, including reasonable attorneys fees incurred by the
borough as a result thereof. No judgment shall commence or be
imposed, levied or payable until the date of a determination of the

proceeding is instituted. If the defendant in the civil enforcement
proceeding neither pays nor timely appeals the judgment, the borough
may enforce the judgment pursuant to the applicable rules of civil
procedure. Each day that a violation continues shall constitute a
separate violation, unless the District Justice determining that there
has been a violation further determines that there was a good faith
basis for the person, partnership or corporation violating this Zoning
Chapter to have believed that there was no such violation, in which
event there shall be deemed to have been only one such violation until
the fifth day following the date of the determination of the violation by
the District Justice, and thereafter each day that a violation continues
