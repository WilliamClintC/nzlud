PREFACE 
    This volume constitutes a publication of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Corvallis, Oregon. This Code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The Code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. 
Title. 
    A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. For example, the first title is Title 1, Government, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. 
Chapter. 
    Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. 
Section. 
    Each section of the code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering. 
Ordinance History Note 
    At the end of each code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) Beginning with Supplement No. 1, newly added ordinances can be cross referenced to the Code Comparative Table appearing at the back of the volume preceding the Index. 
Code Comparative Table. 
    A Code Comparative Table has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, and the disposition within the code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table, the reader can locate any section of the code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
TITLE T1:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLE CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CODE INDEX I:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Tassy Spinks, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Kathy Louie, Recorder, for her cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that her efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs. 
SUPPLEMENT HISTORY TABLE 
    The table below allows users of this Code to quickly and accurately determine what ordinances have been considered for codification in each supplement.

Council in such an instance shall not determine whether it agrees with the decision and shall not seek to substitute its judgment for that of the board, commission, committee, hearings officer or official. A decision is arbitrary or capricious if it is not supported by competent evidence. If Council finds that a decision is arbitrary and/or capricious, then Council may reverse or modify the decision as a final disposition; or it may return the matter to the board, commission, committee, hearings officer or official for further proceeding in accordance with instructions from Council.

Chapter 1.13 - EMPLOYER-EMPLOYEE RELATIONS 

Section 1.13.010 - Title. 
    This Chapter shall be known as the Corvallis Employer-Employee Relations Chapter. 
(Ord. 75-69 § 1, 1975) 
Section 1.13.020 - Purpose. 
    Council finds and declares that: 
1)  The people of the City have a fundamental interest in the development of harmonious and cooperative relationships between the governing body and its employees. 
2)  Recognition by the City of the rights of the employees to organize and full acceptance of the principle and procedure of collective negotiation between the City and public employee organizations can alleviate various forms of strife and unrest. Experience in the private and public sectors of our economy has proved that unresolved disputes in the public service are injurious to the public, the governmental agencies and the employees. 
3)  Experience in private and public employment has also proved that protection by law of the right of employees to organize and negotiate collectively safeguards the employees and the public from injury, impairment and interruptions of necessary services and removes certain recognized sources of strife and unrest by encouraging practices fundamental to the peaceful adjustment of disputes arising out of differences as to wages, hours, terms and other working conditions and by establishing greater equality of bargaining power between public employers and public employees. 
4)  It is recognized that the State collective bargaining law found in ORS 243.650, et. seq., adequately lays out the general rules and guidelines which this Chapter will attempt to incorporate and follow with the exception of those areas that are determined to be of strictly local concern for the City. Any deviations from the State collective bargaining law are made only after a determination that the matter in question is of local concern. 
5)  This Chapter and any agreement pursuant hereto shall not impair any constitutional, common law, Charter, statutory or traditional right or responsibility of the City to act unilaterally: 
a)  To determine the overall mission of the City as a unit of government; 
b)  To maintain and approve the efficiency and effectiveness of City operations; 
c)  To determine the services to be rendered, the operations to be performed, the technology to be utilized or the programs to be budgeted; 
d)  To determine the overall methods, processes, means, job classifications or personnel by which City operations are to be conducted; 
e)  To direct, supervise or hire employees; 
f)  To promote, suspend, discipline, discharge, transfer, assign, schedule, retain or lay off employees; 
g)  To relieve employees from duties because of lack of work or funds or under conditions where the City determines continued work would be inefficient or nonproductive; 
h)  To take whatever other actions may be necessary to carry out the wishes of the public not otherwise specified herein or limited by a collective bargaining agreement; or 
i)  To take actions to carry out the missions of the City as the governmental unit in situations of emergency. 
    Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to limit the discretion of the City to voluntarily confer with City employees in the process of developing policies to effectuate or implement any of the above-enumerated rights.

e)  Conditionally waive or suspend the regulation subject to the receipt of a defined amount of contributions towards compensation by a specified date from persons opposed to the waiver or suspension, such as persons who believe they would be negatively affected by the waiver or suspension, with the waiver or suspension being granted, if the defined amount of contribution is not received by the specified date, as set by the City. 
f)  Acquire the affected property through negotiation or eminent domain. 
g)  Take such other actions as the City Council deems appropriate, consistent with Measure 37. 
2)  A decision by the Council to waive or modify a land use regulation shall be personal to the claimant, and shall automatically become invalid and void upon the transfer of any ownership interest in the affected property by the claimant to anyone. Upon waiver or modification of the land use revocation, the claimant shall record a deed restriction that runs with the property that automatically invalidates and voids the modification or waiver upon transfer of any ownership interest in the affected property by the claimant to anyone other than a family member, if development has not occurred. 
3)  The claimant shall bear the burden of proof relating to the claim, and entitlement to just compensation. The City shall bear the burden of proof to show that the regulation is exempt under Measure 37, and the standard of proof by both parties shall be by a preponderance of the evidence. 
4)  A copy of the City Council decision shall be sent by mail to the claimant and to each individual or entity that participated in the City Council public hearing, and provided a mailing address to the City. The City Council may establish any relevant conditions of approval for compensation, should compensation be granted, or for any other action taken under this subsection. 
5)  Failure to comply with any condition of approval is grounds for revocation of the approval of the compensation for the claim, and is grounds for recovering any compensation paid and grounds for revocation of any other action taken pursuant to this Ordinance. 
(Ord. 2005-03 § 1, 02/22/2005) 
Section 1.27.070 - Private cause of action. 
    If the City Council's approval of a claim by removing or modifying a land use regulation causes a reduction in value of other property located in the vicinity of the property, the owners of other property shall have a cause of action in the appropriate Oregon Circuit Court to recover from the owners of the property subject to the claim the amount of such reduction in value. A person who recovers for a reduction in value of property under this section shall also be entitled to recover attorney's fees and disbursements from the owner of the property, subject to the claim. This section does not create a cause of action against the City of Corvallis. 
(Ord. 2005-03 § 1, 02/22/2005) 
Section 1.27.080 - Availability of funds to pay claims. 
    Compensation can only be paid based on the availability and appropriation of funds for this purpose. 
(Ord. 2005-03 § 1, 02/22/2005) 
Section 1.27.090 - Severability. 
    If any phrase, clause, or other part or parts of this Ordinance is found to be invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining phrases, clauses, and other part or parts shall remain in full force and effect. 
(Ord. 2005-03 § 1, 02/22/2005) 
Section 1.27.100 - Applicable State law. 
    For all claims filed with the City of Corvallis, the applicable State law is Measure 37, as amended, modified or clarified by subsequent amendments or regulations adopted by the Oregon State legislature or Oregon State administrative agencies. Any claim that has not been processed completely under this Ordinance, shall be subject to any such amendments, modifications, clarifications, or other actions taken at the state level, and this Ordinance shall be read in a manner so as not to conflict with such amendments, modifications, clarifications or other actions taken at the state level. This Ordinance is adopted solely to address claims filed under the authority of those provisions of Measure 37. 
(Ord. 2005-03 § 1, 02/22/2005) 
Section 1.27.110 - Emergency clause. 
    This Ordinance is necessary for the preservation of the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of Corvallis, due to the fact that the amendments to Chapter 197 of the Oregon Revised Statutes from ballot Measure 37 passed November 2, 2004, and became effective on December 2, 2004. It is essential to have a procedure for processing written claims for compensation under that Measure as quickly as possible to establish an orderly review of the written claims which would have a fiscal impact on the City. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and this Ordinance is effective upon its adoption.

Section 2.08.040 - Reimbursement fee rate setting methodology. 
    The methodology used to establish the reimbursement fee shall consider the cost of then-existing facilities, prior contributions by then-existing users, the value of unused capacity, rate-making principles employed to finance publicly owned capital improvements, and other relevant factors identified by Council. The methodology shall promote the objective that future systems users shall contribute no more than an equitable share of the cost of then-existing facilities. 
    The methodology used to establish the reimbursement fee shall be as follows: 
1)  For Water. 
a)  City asset records identify the original cost of existing water system general facilities within a number of asset categories. To the total of these asset costs, the cost of current-year construction work in progress has been added. In addition, the costs of prior non-SDC contributions and debt outstanding to be paid by monthly service charges have been deducted. The resulting net system cost constitutes the initial cost basis for the reimbursement fee. 
b)  Within each asset category, the amount and cost of unused system capacity has been determined. The total of net unused capacity costs constitutes the reimbursement fee cost basis. 
c)  The Oregon Plumbing Specialty Code (1996) lists the equivalent fixture units used to determine loading on the water system created by various water-using fixtures. These units will be used to determine the water reimbursement fee by dividing the total water fixture units projected to serve growth from the current year total of population equivalents to 80,000 population equivalents into the reimbursement fee cost basis. 
d)  The Water Reimbursement Fee shall be determined by multiplying the actual number of water fixture units installed in the development by the rate per fixture unit as determined in subsection c) above. 
2)  For Sewer. 
a)  City asset records identify the original cost of existing sewer system general facilities within a number of asset categories. To the total of these asset costs, the cost of current-year construction work in progress has been added. In addition, the costs of prior non-SDC contributions and debt outstanding to be paid by monthly service charges have been deducted. The resulting net system cost constitutes the initial cost basis for the reimbursement fee. 
b)  Within each asset category, the amount and cost of unused system capacity has been determined. The total of net unused capacity costs constitutes the reimbursement fee cost basis. 
c)  The Oregon Plumbing Specialty Code (1996) lists the equivalent fixture units used to determine loading on the sewer system created by various water-using fixtures. These units will be used to determine the sewer reimbursement fee by dividing the total sewer fixture units projected to serve growth from the current year total of population equivalents to 80,000 population equivalents into the reimbursement fee cost basis. 
d)  The Sewer Reimbursement Fee shall be determined by multiplying the actual number of sewer fixture units installed in the development by the rate per fixture unit as determined in subsection c) above. 
3)  For Streets. 
a)  City asset records identify the original cost of existing transportation system general facilities within a number of asset categories. To the total of these asset costs, the cost of current-year construction work in progress has been added. In addition, the costs of prior non-SDC contributions and debt outstanding to be paid by monthly service charges have been deducted. The resulting net system cost constitutes the initial cost basis for the reimbursement fee. 
b)  Within each asset category, the amount and cost of unused system capacity has been determined. The total of net unused capacity costs constitutes the reimbursement fee cost basis. 
c)  The Corvallis Transportation Master Plan (1996) lists the projected number of daily trips to be generated by 80,000 population equivalents to determine the impact of development on the transportation system. These units will be used to determine the streets reimbursement fee by dividing the total projected number of daily trips generated by growth from the current year total of population equivalents to 80,000 population equivalents into the reimbursement fee cost basis. 
d)  The Streets Reimbursement Fee shall be determined by multiplying the rate per daily trip as determined in subsection c) above by the number of average daily trips estimated in the current edition of Trip Generation (Institute of Traffic Engineers) as summarized and revised by resolution of Council. For purposes of calculating the Streets Reimbursement Fees for residential development in the Central Business District, the number of average daily trips estimated in the current edition of Trip Generation (Institute of Traffic Engineers) shall first be reduced by 15%, then multiplied by the rate per daily trip as determined in subsection c) above. 
4)  For Drainage. 
a)  City asset records identify the original cost of existing drainage system general facilities within a number of asset categories. To the total of these asset costs, the cost of current-year construction work in progress has been added. In addition, the costs of prior non-SDC contributions and debt outstanding to be paid by monthly service charges have been deducted. The resulting net system cost constitutes the initial cost basis for the reimbursement fee. 
b)  Within each asset category, the amount and cost of unused system capacity has been determined. The total of net unused capacity costs constitutes the reimbursement fee cost basis. 
c)  Impervious surface area has been determined to be an adequate measure of contribution of runoff. Therefore, impervious surface area will be used to determine the drainage reimbursement fee by dividing the total impervious surface area projected to serve growth from the current year total of population equivalents to 80,000 population equivalents into the reimbursement fee cost basis. 
d)  The Drainage Reimbursement Fee shall be determined by multiplying the total square footage of impervious surface area contained in the development by the charge per square foot of impervious surface area determined in subsection c) above. 
5)  For Parks and Recreation. 
a)  A reimbursement fee shall not be applied to Park SDC rate structure. 
(Ord. 2007-05 § 1, 03/19/2007; Ord 2006-18 § 2, 07/05/2006; Ord. 2000-23 § 3, 8/21/2000; Ord. 91-33 § 4 (part), 1991) 
Section 2.08.050 - Improvement fee rate setting methodology. 
    The methodology used to establish the improvement fee shall consider the cost of projected extra-capacity facilities needed to increase the capacity of the systems to which the fee is related as identified pursuant to Section 2.08.150. The methodology used to establish the improvement fees shall be as follows: 
1)  For Water. 
a)  From the City's adopted Water Plan, its periodic updates, and an ongoing evaluation of system needs, a project list which includes the total cost of extra-capacity improvements needed to increase the capacities of the first level, second level, and third level systems has been compiled. Previous planning has shown that, to adequately serve the third level, supplemental first and second level improvements must be constructed. Similarly, to adequately serve the second level, supplemental first level improvements are needed. 
b)  From this project list, the project portions eligible for improvement fee funding hereunder have been determined. The total of these funding needs, plus the balance of SDC credits outstanding and less the existing improvement fee fund balance, is the improvement fee cost basis. 
c)  The Oregon Plumbing Specialty Code (1996) lists the water equivalent fixture units (WEFUs) used to determine loading on the water system created by various water using fixtures. These units will be used to determine the water improvement fee by dividing the total WEFUs projected to serve growth from the current year total of population equivalents to 80,000 population equivalents into the improvement fee cost. 
d)  The Water Improvement Fee shall be determined by multiplying the total number of water fixture units installed in the development by the rate per fixture unit as determined in subsection c) above. 
2)  For Sewer. 
a)  From the City's adopted Sewer Plan, its periodic updates, and an ongoing evaluation of system needs, a project list which includes the total cost of extra-capacity improvements needed to increase the capacity of the system has been compiled. 
b)  From this project list, the project portions eligible for improvement fee funding hereunder have been determined. The total of these funding needs, plus the balance of SDC credits outstanding and less the existing improvement fee fund balance, is the improvement fee cost basis. 
c)  The Oregon Plumbing Specialty Code (1996) lists the sewer equivalent fixture units (SEFUs) used to determine loading on the sewer system created by various water-using fixtures. These units will determine the sewer improvement fee by dividing the total SEFUs projected to serve growth from the current year total of population equivalents to 80,000 population equivalents into the improvement fee cost basis. 
d)  The Sewer Improvement Fee shall be determined by multiplying the total number of sewer fixture units installed in the development by the charge per fixture unit determined in subsection c) above. 
3)  For Streets. 
a)  From the adopted Transportation Plan, its periodic updates, and an ongoing evaluation of system needs, a project list which includes the total cost of extra-capacity improvements needed to increase the capacity of the system has been compiled. 
b)  From this project list, the project portions eligible for improvement fee funding hereunder have been determined. The total of these funding needs, plus the balance of SDC credits outstanding and less the existing improvement fee fund balance, is the improvement fee cost basis. 
c)  The Corvallis Transportation Master Plan (1996) lists the projected number of daily trips to be generated by 80,000 population equivalents to determine the impact of development on the transportation system. These units will be used to determine the streets improvement fee by dividing the total projected number of daily trips generated by growth from the current year total of population equivalents to 80,000 population equivalents into the reimbursement fee cost basis. 
d)  The Streets Improvement Fee shall be determined by multiplying the rate per daily trip as determined in subsection c) above by the number of average daily trips estimated in the current edition of Trip Generation (Institute of Traffic Engineers) as summarized and revised by resolution of Council. For purposes of calculating the Streets Reimbursement Fees for residential development in the Central Business District, the number of average daily trips estimated in the current edition of Trip Generation (Institute of Traffic Engineers) shall first be reduced by 15%, then multiplied by the rate per daily trip as determined in subsection c) above. 
e)  A partial rebate of the Street Improvement Fee shall be available, upon application by the property owner, to non-single family residential developments that demonstrate long-term, ongoing, reduced infrastructure impacts. This partial rebate must be approved by City Council. Under no circumstances shall the amount of the rebate exceed the amount of the Streets Improvement Fee. Eligibility for the rebate shall be contingent upon meeting all of the following conditions: 
1]  The difference between the demonstrated number of average daily trips and the number of average daily trips used to calculate the improvement fee is more than ten percent. 
2]  The difference between the demonstrated number of average daily trips and the number of average daily trips used to calculate the improvement fee is documented and certified by a professional engineer. 
3]  The improvements or activities used by the development to reduce the demonstrated number of average daily trips are consistent with adopted City transportation system objectives. 
4]  The property owner has submitted a plan, accepted by the City, for demonstrating the ongoing effectiveness of the measures taken by the development to reduce its infrastructure impacts, and is meeting the conditions of that plan. 
f)  The rebate shall be determined by multiplying the improvement fee determined in subsection d) above by the percentage difference between the number of demonstrated average daily trips and the number of average daily trips used to calculate the improvement fee. At the discretion of the City, the rebate may be paid in up to ten annual installments. 
g)  The rebate shall be revoked if any of the conditions in subsection e) above are not met, using any one or more of the following mechanisms to be selected at the discretion of the City: 
1]  At the time the rebate is granted, a performance bond in the amount of the rebate is purchased by the developer allowing the City to obtain compensation upon the failure of the development to meet the conditions specified in subsection e) above. 
2]  At the time the rebate is granted, the developer contracts with the City to repay all or an agreed-upon portion of the rebate amount upon the failure of the development to meet the conditions specified in subsection e) above. 
3]  If the rebate is being paid in installments, the City may cease payment upon the failure of the development to meet the conditions specified in subsection e) above. 
4)  For Drainage. 
a)  From the City's adopted Drainage Plan, its periodic updates, and an ongoing evaluation of system needs, a project list which includes the total cost of extra-capacity improvements needed to increase the capacity of the system has been compiled. 
b)  From this project list, the project portions eligible for improvement fee funding hereunder have been determined. The total of these funding needs, plus the balance of SDC credits outstanding and less the existing improvement fee fund balance, is the improvement fee cost basis. 
c)  Impervious surface area has been determined to be an adequate measure of contribution of runoff. Therefore, impervious surface area will be used to determine the drainage improvement fee by dividing the total impervious surface area projected to serve growth from the current year total of population equivalents to 80,000 population equivalents into the improvement fee cost basis. 
d)  The Drainage Improvement Fee shall be determined by multiplying the total square footage of impervious surface contained in the development by the charge per square foot determined in subsection c) above. 
5)  For Parks and Recreation. 
a)  The planned level of service shall be determined by the City based on the facility needs as set forth in the City's Park and Recreation Facilities Plan, herein referred to as the Plan. 
b)  The charge shall be calculated based on the adopted methodology, as identified in the Parks and Recreation System Development Charges Methodology Update Report, dated April 10, 2006. 
(Ord. 2007-05 § 2, 03/19/2007; Ord 2006-18 § 3, 07/05/2006;Ord. 2000-23 § 4, 8/21/2000; Ord. 92-17 § 5, 1992; Ord. 91-33 § 4 (part), 1991) 
Section 2.08.060 - Charge due and payable. 
1)  The SDC is immediately due and payable upon receipt of an application for a building permit, or upon receipt of an application for connection to the sewer system or water system or drainage system, or upon receipt of an application for a permit to create an access to the street system of the City, or upon receipt of an application for the consolidation or partition of a parcel or parcels of land as provided herein, whichever occurs first. The SDC for all systems shall be due and payable whenever any application, permit, or event described herein shall occur. If the SDC is paid in full at the time of the receipt of the application(s), the net SDC shall be discounted 3 percent. 
2)  If development is commenced or connection is made to the sewer, water, drainage, or street system without an appropriate permit, the SDC is immediately due and payable upon the earliest date that any such permit was required. The developer shall pay, and the City Manager shall collect, the applicable SDC before issuing any building or development permit or before permitting any connection to the water, sewer, drainage, or street systems of the City. The City Manager shall decline to issue such a permit or to permit such a connection until that charge has been paid in full.

Section 2.08.065 - Assistance to low income home buyers. 
    City of Corvallis Administrative Policy 00-8.07 establishes a City-funded financial assistance program to provide loans to low income purchasers of new homes. Loans funded in accordance with Administrative Policy 00-8.07 are intended to offset the costs of a newly constructed home that are attributable to building related fees or charges, including Systems Development Charges. Loans are available through the Housing Division of the Community Development Department. 
(Ord. 2000-34 § 1, 12/04/2000) 
Section 2.08.070 - Payment deferral. 
    Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, whenever a SDC of $100.00 or more would otherwise be due and collectable, the developer may apply upon forms provided by the City Manager for payment of the charge in not more than 20 semi-annual installments plus interest. Upon receipt of such an application, the City Manager shall compute the amount of the SDC, the date upon which that charge is due, the name or names of the developer(s) of the development for which the SDC is imposed, and the description of the property upon which the development is occurring or has occurred. The total amount of the charge shall be subject to interest at the rate of 10 percent per annum, which interest shall be the full and only compensation to the City for its administrative costs and shall be secured by property, bond(s), deposits, letter of credit or other security acceptable to the City Manager. If the developer elects to secure the charge(s) with real property, the developer shall obtain the consent of the owner or owners of record or of the contract purchaser or purchasers of record of the real property. The burden of showing the identity of the owner or owners of record or of the contract purchaser or purchasers of record of the parcel shall be upon the developer. Any deferred payment secured with real property shall become a lien upon the property and the City Manager shall docket the lien in the docket of liens; and from the time that docketing is completed, the City shall have a lien upon that described property for the total amount of the charge. That lien may be enforced in the manner provided in ORS Chapter 223. That lien herein shall have priority over all other liens and encumbrances of any character. 
(Ord. 91-33 § 7, 1991) 
Section 2.08.075 - No interest payment deferral. 
    As an alternative to the Payment Deferral in section 2.08.070, developers may choose to make full payment of SDCs upon selling the affected property or within the first six months from issuance of permits, whichever occurs first. Should the full SDC payment be made, no interest would be charged. Regardless of the deferred payment option utilized, the developer still needs to meet all requirements of section 2.08.070. 
(Ord. 2000-35 § 1, 12/04/2000) 
Section 2.08.080 - Collection. 
1)  Whenever the full and correct SDC has not been paid and collected or any payment deferred in accordance with Section 2.08.070 has not been paid when due for any reason, the City Manager shall report to Council the amount of the uncollected charges, the description of the real property upon which the development occurred, the date upon which the charge was due, and the name or names of the developer(s), and, if the property was secured by a lien upon real property, a description of the real property and the owner or owners of record or the purchaser or purchasers of record of the property. Council by motion shall then set a public hearing and shall direct the City Manager to give notice of that hearing to each of those developers, owners or contract purchasers together with a copy of that City Manager's report concerning the unpaid charge(s) either in person or by certified mail. Upon public hearing, Council may accept, reject, or modify the Manager's report. If Council finds that any charge or installment payment is unpaid and uncollected, Council, by motion, may direct the City Attorney to file an action to collect the charge(s). If the payment of the charge is secured by real property, Council may direct the City Manager to foreclose the lien as provided by law for the full amount of unpaid charge(s), interest and the City's actual costs of serving notice upon the developer(s), owners and/or contract purchasers. That lien may be enforced in the manner provided in ORS Chapter 223. That lien herein shall have priority over all other liens and encumbrances of any character. 
2)  The owner(s) or contract purchaser(s) of any real property used to secure SDCs shall have cause of action against the developer liable for the SDC if the owner(s) or contract purchaser(s) elects to pay delinquent charges. 
(Ord. 91-33 § 7, 1991)

Chapter 2.09 - STORM WATER SYSTEM[5] 

Footnotes: 
--- (5) --- 
Editor's note- Title amended by Ord. 2006-07. 

Section 2.09.010 - Findings. 
1)  Many of the costs of handling storm water runoff have, in the past, been charged to the sanitary sewer user, while these costs should more appropriately be charged to those who contribute to storm water runoff. The amount of impervious area is an appropriate measure of storm water contributions from property. 
2)  The growing drainage problems brought about by increasing levels of development within the City has had a direct effect on the City's storm water system and shown the need not only for planning, design and maintenance of existing and future contributing storm water systems, but also for measures to lessen the demand of development upon such systems. 
3)  All premises improved for use as single-family dwellings place approximately the same demand upon the City's storm water system. Premises not used for single-family dwelling purposes use storm water services in proportion to the amount of the improved premises' impervious surface, and for each 2,750 square feet of impervious surface such premises are furnished service equivalent to that furnished a single-family unit. The minimum charge for storm water service shall be that established for a single-family unit. 
4)  Even premises from which storm water is drained via non-public facilities, or have no direct runoff from a developed parcel, benefit from the City's planning, maintenance, and operation of a storm water system. 
(Ord. 2000-10 § 1, 05/15/2000; Ord. 94-30 § 1, 1994; Ord. 91-20 § 6, 1991; Ord. 78-64 § 6, 1978) 
Section 2.09.020 - Definitions. 
1)  Developer. Any person, including a governmental agency, undertaking any development. 
2)  Development. Any alteration in the appearance of property by removal of vegetation, grading of the ground surface or construction of a structure or impervious surface, or any property so altered. 
3)  Impervious surface. Hard-surface areas located upon real property which either prevent or retard saturation of water into the land surface and/or cause water to run off the land surface in greater quantities or at an increased rate of flow than under natural conditions prior to development. Common impervious surfaces include, but are not limited to, rooftops, concrete or asphalt sidewalks, walkways, patio areas, driveways, parking lots or storage areas and graveled, oiled, macadam or other surfaces which similarly impact the natural saturation or runoff patterns which existed prior to development. 
4)  Improved premises. Any area which has been altered such that the runoff from the site is greater than that which could historically have been expected. Such a condition shall be determined by the City Engineer. 
5)  Open drainageway. A natural or human-made path which has the specific function of transmitting natural stream water or storm runoff water from a point of higher elevation to a point of lower elevation. 
6)  Runoff control. Any means approved by the utility by which the peak rate of storm water runoff from developed land surfaces is reduced.

2)  The improvement of both public and private storm water facilities through or adjacent to a new development shall be the responsibility of the developer. Improvements shall comply with all applicable Chapters and City ordinances, policies and standards. 
3)  No portion herein or statement herein, or subsequent Council interpretation policies, shall relieve the property owner of assessments levied against their property for public facility improvement projects. 
4)  It is the policy of the City to participate in improvements to storm water facilities when authorized by Council. To be considered for approval by Council, a facility must:

Chapter 2.12 - SALE OF CITY-ACQUIRED PROPERTY 

Section 2.12.010 - Background. 
    Under the State Bancroft Bonding Act, land owners have the option of financing street and utility improvements through bonded liens upon the individual lots. To protect the integrity of the Bancroft Bond Redemption Fund and the taxpayers of Corvallis generally, the City enforces collection of delinquent liens through the process of foreclosure authorized by ORS 223.505 to 223.595. Either by foreclosure or by obtaining a deed in lieu of foreclosure, the City has acquired, and in the future will acquire, individual subdivision lots and unplatted parcels of land for which streets and sewer and water services are in place but which are otherwise unimproved. The City, desiring to sell these properties held a public hearing on July 18, 1988, to consider a procedure for the sale of these properties. This Chapter establishes the procedure for such sale. 
(Ord. 89-38 § 1, 1989; Ord. 88-38 § 1, 1988)

    Council adopts the following procedure for the sale of that City-owned real property described in Section 2.12.010 herein. 
1)  The City Manager shall establish a list price for each lot, to be set at or near fair market value as determined by professional real estate appraisal or opinion of value. In June and December of each year, the list price shall be increased by the percentage of increase in the fair market value of comparable lots sold, based on the Multiple Listing Service Directory. 
2)  The City Manager may select individual lots to be advertised and listed for sale. 
3)  The City Manager is authorized to sell single or multiple lots on the following terms: 
a)  The purchaser shall make a down payment of no less than 20% of the purchase price or the amount of outstanding real property taxes, whichever is greater; 
b)  The balance of the purchase price shall be paid in monthly installments together with interest at a fixed annual rate consistent with commercial mortgage lending rates but in no event less than 10% per annum; 
c)  Installment payments may be amortized over a period of no more than 10 years; provided, however, that the outstanding balance shall be due in full upon the purchaser's obtaining home construction financing; 
d)  The City, as seller, and the purchaser shall document and secure the sale of any lot by means of a promissory note and trust deed, on forms approved by the City Attorney; 
e)  The purchaser shall pay any periodic collection charges imposed by the escrow agent or trustee servicing the transaction; 
f)  Prepayment of the outstanding balance, or any portion thereof, shall be encouraged, and no prepayment penalties shall be charged; 
g)  The outstanding balance of the purchase price, together with unpaid interest, shall immediately be due and payable at the option of the City upon any of the following occurrences: 
1]  The purchaser sells the property; 
2]  Purchaser assigns or permits the assumption of the purchaser's obligations of the promissory note or trust deed without the City's prior written consent; 
3]  The purchaser fails to pay the current year's real property taxes; or 
4]  The purchaser fails to comply with any provision contained in the promissory note or trust deed; 
h)  The City Manager may decline to offer City financing as provided in this subsection if, in the City Manager's judgment, a prospective purchaser lacks satisfactory credit; 
i)  City financing as provided in this subsection shall not be offered, in respect to a particular lot, to any prospective purchaser from whom the City acquired the lot by foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure. 
4)  Council may, by motion, authorize and direct the City Manager to negotiate the sale of single or multiple lots at a price less than the price established in subsection 1) or upon terms other than those specified in subsection 3). In conducting such negotiations, the City Manager shall consider the integrity of the Bancroft Bond Redemption Fund. In addition, the City Manager, when negotiating a sale, may also take into consideration the sale's potential for the creation of affordable housing, or other issues identified by Council to be of significant importance. 
5)  All net proceeds received by the City upon the sale of property hereunder shall be deposited in the Bancroft Bond Redemption Fund. 
6)  The procedure described in this Chapter applies to property now owned or hereafter acquired by the City.

Chapter 2.13 - REIMBURSEMENT TO DEVELOPERS UNDER PRIVATE CONTRACT 

Section 2.13.010 - Purpose. 
    The extra-capacity elements of public improvements are eligible for funding from the appropriate Systems Development Charge (SDC) fund. These improvements are installed through private contracts, under permit to the City. Where privately constructed public improvements have extra-capacity features, reimbursement to the developer funding the improvements is equitable and reasonable. 
(Ord. 94-02 § 1, 01/18/94) 
Section 2.13.020 - Definitions. 
1)  Developer. Any person or persons, including a governmental agency, undertaking any development. 
2)  Development. Making a material change in the use or appearance of a structure or land, dividing land into two or more parcels, and creating or terminating a right of access. Where appropriate to the context, development refers to the act of developing or the result of development. 
3)  Eligible public improvement. A capital improvement that is: 
a)  Required as a condition of development approval as determined under Comprehensive Plan Policy 10.2.11 or an equivalent provision; and 
b)  Identified in one or more of the following: 
1]  Project lists developed from the City's established facilities plans, periodic reviews and updates of those plans, and ongoing evaluation of system needs; 
2]  The July 1991 City SDC Program Guide; or 
3]  The City's Capital Improvement Program. 
4)  Extra-capacity facilities. Eligible public improvements providing greater capacity than is necessary for the particular development project, including but not limited to: 
a)  For water. Public water transmission mains typically over eight inches in diameter, pump stations, reservoirs, and drinking water plants. 
b)  For sewers. Public sewer mains typically over eight inches in diameter, lift stations, and wastewater treatment plants. 
c)  For streets. Signalization, channelization, extra pavement strength, extra pavement width, bridges, and railroad crossing protective devices. 
d)  For drainage. Culvert upgrades, storm water detention facilities, and other flood control activities, including grass-lined and European channel construction, except service laterals. 
    The developer seeking reimbursement shall have the burden of demonstrating that the facilities for which reimbursement is sought are extra-capacity facilities. 
5)  Service lateral. Public or private sewer, water, and storm drain mains or service lines of any size that provide service solely to an individual property or subdivision that satisfy storm, sewage, or domestic and fire flow water requirements. 
(Ord. 2003-45 § 2, 12/15/2003; Ord. 94-02 § 1, 01/18/94) 
Section 2.13.030 - Reimbursement allowed. 
1)  Developers constructing eligible public improvements with extra-capacity facilities may be reimbursed by the City in an amount determined in accordance with Section 2.13.040, when approved by City Council, for the installation of the improvements. 
2)  When a developer seeks reimbursement for an eligible public improvement, City Council must approve the request prior to issuance of a construction permit for the eligible public improvements. Upon written request to the City Engineer, the Engineering Services Division will review and report to the City Council. The developer's written request shall indicate whether a cash payment or a credit to SDC fees is being sought. Reimbursement agreement amounts may be based on Engineer's Estimates provided by the developer's engineer and verified by the City Engineer. The basis for establishing actual reimbursement amounts shall be as described in Section 2.13.040 of this Chapter. 
3)  Reimbursement in the form of cash payment to the developer may be made provided that the City SDC funds contain adequate monies to cover the reimbursement amount and meet all pending or planned system-wide extra-capacity priorities, as defined by the City Council. 
4)  At the option of the City, reimbursement may be made in the form of a credit against SDC improvement fees which would otherwise be collectible with development approval. Credits may only be applied toward the improvement fee for the type of eligible public improvement constructed. If credits exceed the improvement fee for any type of improvement, they may be applied against improvement fees for that type of improvement accruing in subsequent phases of the development. Credits shall expire unless used no later than ten years from the date granted. 
5)  Criteria for evaluating all reimbursement requests include the following: 
a)  Projected impacts to the fund balances in the SDC funds if reimbursements are made; 
b)  Conformance of a proposed development with the City's objective of converting lands to urban uses based on orderly, economic provision of public facilities; and 
c)  Expected timeframe for return on the City's investment in the form of SDC fees collected from new development. 
(Ord. 94-02 § 1, 01/18/94) 
Section 2.13.040 - Amount. 
1)  The actual reimbursement amount for privately constructed extra-capacity public improvements shall not exceed the amount the City would customarily pay for a similar installation. 
2)  Actual reimbursement amount: 
a)  The actual reimbursement amount shall include the incremental cost difference between a standard improvement and the required extra-capacity improvement. The developer shall initially provide supporting documentation of estimates to form the basis of a reimbursement agreement, and actual materials cost differentials as the basis for an actual reimbursement agreement. This documentation shall be in the form of written engineering estimates and subsequent invoices. The actual reimbursement amount shall not exceed the developer's incurred cost. If the actual extra-capacity costs exceed the reimbursement agreement estimate, the City shall be liable for the estimated amount only, but can elect to pay the higher actual cost with City Council approval. 
b)  Items such as engineering costs, overhead, labor costs, extra trenching, and similar non-material costs shall be eligible for reimbursement when the project is competitively bid and meets all the requirements for public contracts and purchasing as outlined in ORS 279. In addition, all wage rates shall comply with the schedule of hourly wage rates as determined by the Commissioner of Bureau of Labor of the State of Oregon for public projects. SDC reimbursements for projects in which public contracting guidelines and prevailing wage rates are not followed will be eligible for materials cost reimbursement only. 
3)  For reimbursement requests on projects scheduled for 100% SDC expense, all labor and materials costs are eligible for reimbursement plus engineering and construction management costs limited to 15% of construction costs and legal and administrative costs limited to 3% of construction costs. For reimbursement requests on projects not scheduled for 100% SDC expense, all proportionate labor and materials costs plus a share of the total engineering, legal, and administrative costs, as limited above, will be eligible for reimbursement at a share equal to the percentage of SDC reimbursable labor and materials costs to the total labor and materials construction costs. 
4)  For SDC reimbursement requests that include non-material costs, the applicant's contractor and subcontractors shall file copies of the Contractor's Wage Certification with the State as required by the Bureau of Labor. Prior to reimbursement of actual costs, the project Engineer of Record will provide certification that the requirements stated in section 2) have been met, including copies of all Contractor's Wage Certification forms submitted to the State.

(99-01, Amended, 02/01/1999) 
Section 2.13.050 - Timing. 
1)  Cash payment reimbursements allowed under this Chapter and approved by City Council will be made after the eligible improvements are completed and accepted by the City for use, operation, and maintenance. Interest will be paid on reimbursements approved by Council if payment by the City is made more than thirty (30) days past the date the final and acceptable materials invoice from the developer is received by the City following acceptance of the improvements. The rate of interest shall be equal to the average rate of return on all current City investments. 
2)  Credits against SDC fees which would otherwise be collected shall be used to offset SDC fees at the time of fee payment with building permits. The City will not pay interest on amount credited to developers.

Chapter 2.16 - RECOVERY CHARGE FOR PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS 

Section 2.16.010 - Purpose. 
1)  The City of Corvallis requires developers to construct and install all water, sanitary sewer, storm sewer, and street improvements necessary to serve proposed developments. These improvements are constructed in accordance with City design and construction standards and later dedicated to the City as "public improvements." Often these street, water, sanitary sewer, and storm sewer improvements, particularly those constructed off-site, can and will benefit other property owners when they develop their property. Therefore, these improvements represent a benefit to those property owners. 
2)  The purpose of this Chapter is to provide a mechanism where property which benefits from the construction of public improvements by another person will share in the cost of those improvements through payment of a recovery charge at the time of connection or initiation of development activity that would otherwise require extension of public utilities and transportation improvements per the Land Development Code. This Chapter provides a mechanism for the City to examine the improvements which are constructed, their cost, the properties which are specially benefitted by them, and will provide a reasonable method of apportioning the reimbursable costs among benefitted properties. The purpose of this Chapter of the Municipal Code is not to encourage development, but to ensure that development pays for its share of benefits. 
3)  Property owners whose property would be subject to the recovery charge fee will be provided an opportunity to review and comment on pertinent information prior to the City establishing a recovery charge pursuant to this Chapter. The City will collect recovery charges and, upon receipt, will forward such funds to the person who constructed the improvements. 
4)  The recovery charges established under this Chapter are intended to become due and payable at the time of connection or initiation of development activity that would otherwise require extension of public utilities and transportation improvements per the Land Development Code. Such charges are fees for service because they contemplate a development's receipt of essential municipal services based upon the nature of that development. The timing and extent of any development are within the control and discretion of the developer. Furthermore, the recovery charges imposed by this Chapter are not intended to be a tax on property or on a property owner as a direct consequence of ownership of property within the meaning of Section 11b, Article XI, of the Oregon Constitution or the legislation implementing that section. 
5)  The recovery charges established hereby are in addition to, and not in-lieu-of, other charges which may be required of developers, including system development charges, building permit fees, inspection fees, and any other development-related charges. 
(Ord. 99-09 § 1, 06/21/1999; Ord. 94-42 § 1, 1994) 
Section 2.16.020 - Definitions. 
    As used herein, the following shall mean: 
1)  Development or develop. Making a material change in the use or appearance of a structure or land, dividing land into two or more parcels, creating or terminating a right of access or connection to a street or other utility. Where appropriate to the context, development refers to the act of developing or the result of development. The purpose of this Code is to ensure that a development that has been relieved of a requirement to construct all or a portion of an improvement benefitting that development will pay that development's fair share of the improvement to the person or persons who paid the cost of the improvement. Any development proposal (such as a minor land partition, a subdivision, a planned development, construction of a new building, etc.) that is reviewed by the City and required as a condition of approval, per the Land Development Code, to install or connect to a street or utility improvement which has already been constructed by a previous developer will pay for the portion of the existing improvement that it would otherwise have been required to provide. Improvements which are required to comply with existing State or local health, sanitary, or safety regulations, or any alterations to structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places are exempted from payback agreements, until the property is developed. Properties requiring service or annexation to resolve failed on-site systems would be obligated to pay for the failed utility portion of the payback upon connection to the utility, but would be exempt from the remaining payback until further development. 
2)  Parcel of land or parcel. A platted lot or any other tract of land which is occupied or may be occupied by a structure or structures or other use, including the yard and other open spaces required under the Land Development Code, or reasonably attributable to an existing or proposed use. 
3)  Person. Any individual, firm, partnership, unincorporated association, public or private corporation, government or government instrumentality. 
4)  Property owner. The owner of the title to real property or the contract purchaser of real property of record as shown on the most recent assessment roll in the office of the County Assessor. 
5)  Sanitary sewer or sewer improvement. One or more pipes, conduits and, where necessary, related pumping facilities or combination thereof located within a public right-of-way and/or City utility easement, which are designed, constructed, and installed in accordance with City design and construction standards, and which are intended to accommodate sanitary sewage from more than a single parcel of real property. 
6)  Special benefit. Value associated with a capital improvement which relates to a particular parcel of land to the extent such parcel is, or may be, partially relieved of a cost or expense associated with development, and which is different in degree from the value or benefit received by the general public. 
7)  Storm sewer improvement. One or more pipes, conduits, or artificial drainageways or improvements or combinations thereof, located within public right-of-way and/or City utility easement which is designed, constructed, and installed in accordance with City design and construction standards to provide channeling, collection, filtration, or discharge of storm and surface water or some combination thereof or other water quality improvements of a size and location to serve more than a single parcel of real property. 
8)  Street improvement. A street, road, or associated improvement or portion thereof within a public right-of-way which is designed and constructed in accordance with City design and construction standards and which provides a special benefit to more than a single parcel of real property including but not limited to some or all of the following: streets, storm drains, curbs, gutters, sidewalks, bike ways, and traffic control devices. 
9)  Water improvement. One or more pipes, conduits and, where necessary, related pumping facilities, or combinations thereof, located within a public right-of-way and/or City utility easement which are designed, constructed, and installed in accordance with City standards, and which are intended to provide water for use to more than a single parcel of real property. 
10)  Zone of benefit. The area or parcels of real property which are determined by the City Engineer to derive a special benefit from the design and construction of street, water, sanitary sewer, or storm sewer improvements which are financed or constructed by a person other than the parcel owner, or which are financed or constructed by the City without formation of a local improvement district. 
11)  Zone of benefit recovery charge or recovery charge. The fee required to be paid by an owner of property within a delineated zone of benefit and determined by the City Council to be the amount which is necessary or appropriate to reimburse another person or the City for financing or causing the construction of utility improvements. Recovery charges shall be treated as a single fee, and shall not be segregated into separate fees for sewer, water, storm, or street. 
(Ord. 99-09 § 2, 06/21/1999; Ord. 94-42 § 1, 1994) 
Section 2.16.030 - Formation of the zone of benefit. 
1)  Any person who is required by the City to finance construction of street, sewer, water, or storm drain improvements or some combination thereof that will provide special benefit to parcels other than those for which the person has obtained development approval may request that the City establish a zone of benefit recovery charge. 
2)  A written request to establish a zone of benefit recovery charge shall be submitted to the City Engineer within one year of the City's acceptance of the improvements of special benefit. The request shall consist of the following information: 
a)  Detailed plans showing the actual location, nature, and extent of all improvements for which a zone of benefit recovery charge is sought. These plans shall be used to determine the basis of the recovery charge, however, the actual recovery charge shall be based on final approved as-built plans; 
b)  The parcels of property identified by tax lot number which the applicant asserts are specially benefitted by the improvements, and from which a recovery charge is sought; 
c)  The name and mailing address of the owner of each parcel identified in paragraph b) of this subsection, according to the County Assessor's most recent property tax assessment rolls; 
d)  Detailed engineering estimates and material costs. These estimates shall be used to determine the basis of the recovery charge, however, the actual recovery charge shall be based on the developer's actual incurred costs as indicated by detailed invoices for labor and materials devoted exclusively to the improvements for which a recovery charge is sought to be established. Costs shall not include any amount of "profit" or "overhead" of the person making the application. The applicant shall certify the accuracy of the costs which are submitted to the City and that the applicant has actually paid or financed such costs. The applicant shall have the burden of establishing the cost of improvements. Should the City Engineer determine the contract amounts exceed prevailing market rates for a similar project, the recovery charge shall be based upon market rates. No more than 15% of the total eligible construction cost shall be creditable for survey, engineering, construction management, and administrative costs. No more than 3% of the total eligible construction cost shall be creditable for legal and financial costs; 
e)  Any other relevant information required by the City Engineer; and 
f)  A non-refundable application fee shall be made. The purpose of the application fee is intended to cover the City's costs in providing notification to affected property owners and the City Engineer's examination, review, and administration of approved agreements. This fee is subject to review and adjustment as necessary to ensure coverage of the City's costs in administering payback agreements. The application fee may not be included in the computation of the recovery charge. 
3)  The City Engineer shall review each application for the establishment of a zone of benefit recovery charge and shall determine whether a recovery charge should be established. The City Engineer's recommendation to City Council shall be in writing and shall address the following factors: 
a)  The extent to which the improvements have relieved another person(s) of the future requirement to construct all or a portion of the same improvements; 
b)  The area or parcels which are specially benefitted by the improvement, and whether or not such parcels would, as a condition of future development be required to construct all or any portion of the same improvement for which a recovery charge is sought; 
c)  That portion of the cost of the improvement within the area of the proposed zone of benefit which is appropriate for reimbursement by the owners of property identified in paragraph b) of this subsection; 
d)  A rational formula for apportioning the cost of the improvement among properties within the proposed zone of benefit; 
e)  The results of applying the formula referred to in paragraph d) of this subsection to the parcels identified in paragraph b) of this subsection, which becomes the proposed recovery charge; 
f)  The ten year time frame in which to administer the cost recovery request. 
(Ord. 99-09 § 3, 06/21/1999; Ord. 94-42 § 1, 1994) 
Section 2.16.040 - Cost recovery from zone of benefit. 
1)  In addition to those more specific limitations set forth in subsection 2) of this section, the amount of improvement costs which may be reimbursed to the person making such improvements through a zone of benefit recovery charge shall be limited as follows: 
a)  No reimbursement shall be made for the costs of that portion of the improvements which specially benefits property owned or being developed by the applicant. Reimbursement shall be allowed only for those expenditures and in amounts which the City Engineer determines are based upon improvement construction contract documents or other appropriate information provided by the applicant, but not exceeding prevailing market rates for a similar project; 
b)  No reimbursement shall be allowed for improvements until those improvements have been dedicated to and accepted by the City as "public improvements;" 
c)  No reimbursement shall be allowed for the cost or value of real property which the applicant was required to dedicate or reserve for public use as a condition of development; 
d)  Except as otherwise provided, reimbursable costs and expenses shall be limited to the actual cost of construction, engineering, legal, financial, and administrative services as shown by invoice, and the estimated increase in such costs over the ten (10) years, plus 5-year extensions if applied for by the developer in advance of expiration, and acknowledged by the City Engineer 60 days prior to expiration of the current payback agreement, following completion and acceptance of the utility improvement. Reimbursable costs adjustments will be determined by the Engineering News Record Construction Cost Index. Zones of benefit established for public improvements completed by the City shall remain in effect until such time as the reimbursement fee has been collected from all properties within the zone of benefit; 
e)  No reimbursement shall be allowed for improvements which have been constructed by the applicant, accepted by the City and for which no application for zone of benefit recovery charge pursuant to this Chapter has been received within one (1) year from the date of City acceptance of such improvements; 
f)  No reimbursement shall be allowed for that portion of the cost for which the applicant has received a credit against a systems development charge or other development or connection fee for the same improvement; 
g)  No reimbursement shall be allowed for the costs of extending improvements serving a development to the edge of such development; 
h)  No reimbursement shall be allowed for electrical, telephone, cable television, or natural gas utility relocation; 
i)  Except as otherwise specifically provided by the City Council, the obligation to pay a recovery charge shall not apply to that portion of a parcel which is developed by the City for public purposes, such as parks, fire stations, or similar community service facilities. If a zone of benefit charge exists for such a parcel and that parcel is subsequently sold, then the purchaser of the property shall assume the charge. 
    No reimbursement shall be allowed for costs of oversizing improvements that are eligible for SDC reimbursement under Municipal Code Chapter 2.13. 
2)  Reimbursement for street improvements shall be further limited as follows: 
a)  Except for the cost of traffic control signals, reimbursement shall be recoverable only from those properties which lie adjacent or contiguous to a street improvement and which, but for such improvement, would otherwise be required upon development to construct all or a portion of such improvement. 
(Ord. 99-09 § 4, 06/21/1999; Ord. 94-42 § 1, 1994) 
Section 2.16.050 - Action on the application. 
1)  Upon receipt of a zone of benefit application, the City Engineer shall notify owners of parcels within the requested zone of benefit that the application has been filed. The notice shall state that all comments concerning the proposed recovery charge must be in writing and received by the City Engineer within fourteen (14) calendar days from the date of mailing the notice. The notice shall contain at least the following information: 
a)  A statement that an application for a zone of benefit recovery charge has been submitted to the City and the name of the applicant; 
b)  A general description of the improvement and the estimated costs for which a zone of benefit recovery charge is sought; 
c)  A statement that the City Engineer will review the application and make a determination to establish or not establish the requested zone of benefit recovery charge; 
d)  A statement that the failure of the owner of property subject to such proposed recovery charge to object in writing will be treated and relied upon as a waiver of objection to the establishment of the proposed zone of benefit recovery charge. 
2)  The notice shall be mailed to property owners at addresses on the latest County assessment roll. Any mistake, error, omission, or failure with respect to the mailing of notices shall not be jurisdictional or invalidate the proceedings with respect to the establishment of the recovery charge. 
3)  The City Engineer shall conduct a review of the application in accordance with the criteria outlined in section 2.16.030 and shall consider any written comments and evidence presented concerning the application. 
4)  After review, the City Engineer may modify the proposed zone of benefit or recovery charge or both by adjusting the area or the particular properties from which recovery charges will be collected, or by adjusting the amount of reimbursable costs. If additional parcels are added to the zone of benefit, then notice shall be given to the property owners, as outlined in section 2.16.050 1). Once a final decision has been reached regarding the zone of benefit and the recovery charge, property owners shall be notified in writing of the estimated charge, and the opportunity to appeal the decision. 
5)  Upon the City's acceptance of the public improvements for which reimbursement was sought, the City Engineer shall use the final approved as-built plans, together with the construction contract documents and detailed final invoices, to adjust the estimated recovery charge to reflect the developer's actual incurred costs. 
6)  After the actual recovery charge has been determined, the City Engineer shall notify all of the affected property owners, stating the amount of the recovery charge that has been apportioned to them. 
7)  The City Council shall formally adopt their findings in regard to the zone of benefit and recovery charge. 
8)  The apportioned recovery charges approved by City Council shall be recorded, at the applicant's cost, in the Benton County Assessor's Office in order to put subsequent property owners on notice. For informational purposes, the recording document shall list the amount of the recovery charge owed by the subject property, explain how the Engineering News Record Construction Cost Index will be applied at the time recovery charge payments are made, contain a brief explanation of the establishment of the recovery charge, the conditions that must exist or occur in order for the charge to become due and payable, and the expiration date for the recovery charge. 
(Ord. 94-42 § 1, 1994) 
Section 2.16.060 - Obligation to pay zone of benefit recovery charge. 
1)  The obligation to pay a zone of benefit recovery charge shall not begin unless and until it is approved by City Council and an owner of property within the zone of benefit applies for or permits an application to be submitted and receives approval from the City and utilizes such approval for any of the activities referred to in 2.16.060 subsection 2). Should a single property be included in two separately established zones of benefit, the obligation to pay each reimbursement fee shall be considered separately under the provisions of section 2.16.060 subsection 2). 
2)  An owner of property within any zone of benefit shall pay the zone of benefit recovery charge, in addition to any other applicable fees and charges, as established by the City Engineer and approved by City Council. The recovery charge shall be adjusted to reflect the Engineering News Record Construction Cost Index multiplier but in no case shall the adjusted recovery charge exceed the value of providing the improvement(s) were the zone of benefit not in place. Value is established by an Engineer's estimate paid for by the property owner and approved by the City Engineer. The zone of benefit recovery charge will become due and payable if within ten (10) years (plus 5-year extensions if requested by the developer) from the date on which the zone of benefit recovery charge is established by the City, the property owner applies for or permits an application to be submitted and receives approval from the City and utilizes such approval for the earliest of any of the following activities: 
a)  A permit for connection to, or actual connection to, a particular utility improvement or street improvement for which a recovery charge has been established; 
b)  Initiation of any development activity for which the Land Development Code would require connection to or construction of utility and/or transportation facilities for which the zone of benefit has been established; or 
c)  When the zone of benefit includes transportation improvement costs, a permit for any alteration, modification, or change in the use of real property, which increases the number of parking spaces required under the Corvallis Land Development Code as in effect at the time of permit application, as determined by the Land Development Review process. For purposes of determining increases in the parking requirement, the number of required spaces for the use which existed at the time the zone of benefit recovery charge was established shall be compared with the number of required spaces for the altered, modified, or changed use or uses of the property. 
3)  Failure on the part of the City to collect the zone of benefit recovery charge at the time the property owner applies for permits or applications for development will not relieve the property owner of the obligation. Should an error or omission be discovered, payment of the zone of benefit charges will be due upon notification by the City. 
4)  Except as otherwise expressly provided, neither the City nor any officer or employee of the City, acting in an official capacity, shall be liable for payment of any recovery charge. Only those payments which the City has received on behalf of properties within the particular zone of benefit shall be payable to the applicant for the zone of benefit. The City's general fund or other revenue sources shall not be liable for outstanding and unpaid recovery charges imposed on private property. 
5)  The right to reimbursement under this Chapter may be assigned or transferred by the applicant upon written notice to the City. 
6)  Payment of the zone of benefit recovery charge shall be in the form of a cashier's check payable to the person upon whose request the zone of benefit recovery charge was established or that person's assignee. 
7)  Upon receipt of a zone of benefit recovery charge or portion thereof, the City shall cause a record to be made of the property for which such payment is received and remit such funds to the person upon whose request the zone of benefit recovery charge was established or that person's assignee. 
8)  The owner of property subject to a zone of benefit recovery charge may apply for apportionment of the recovery charge in accordance with City procedures applicable in the case of apportionment of special assessments. 
9)  The City Building Official shall not issue a building permit or allow water, sanitary, or storm sewer connection until any applicable recovery charge has been paid in full or until provision for installment payments has been made and approved. 
(Ord. 99-09 § 5, 06/21/1999; Ord. 94-42 § 1, 1994) 
Section 2.16.070 - Prohibited conduct. 
1)  No person may cause, maintain or use a connection to a utility improvement for which a zone of benefit recovery charge has been established and which is due and payable, unless such recovery charge has first been paid or financed with installment payments. 
2)  Violation of this section is a civil infraction, punishable by a fine not to exceed $500. Each day that a prohibited connection or use exists constitutes a separate violation. 
3)  The remedies provided under this section are cumulative to any other remedies provided by law. 
(Ord. 94-42 § 1, 1994) 
Section 2.16.080 - Severability. 
1)  The invalidity of any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, or phrase of this Chapter shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions thereof. 
2)  Nothing contained herein shall be construed as limiting the authority of the City to levy an assessment or assessments for connection charges imposed under Chapters 2.06 and 2.08, where a court of competent jurisdiction determines the agreements entered into pursuant to such Chapters are unenforceable. 
3)  In the event that a zone of benefit expires or is invalidated by future Municipal Code provisions, owners of property within a zone of benefit may petition the City Manager to cause a document to be recorded with the Benton County Assessor's Office, at the property owner's expense, which verifies the dissolution of the zone of benefit.

Chapter 2.18 - INFRASTRUCTURE COST RECOVERY 

Section 2.18.010 - Purpose. 
    After appropriate public hearings and review, the City Council has determined it is reasonable to enact and impose a cost recovery mechanism to collect for the initial cost of providing a basic level of public infrastructure from developers when they apply for connection and did not previously pay their share of the cost for construction of the basic infrastructure. 
(Ord. 2000-27 § 1, 11/06/2000) 
Section 2.18.020 - Definitions. 
1)  Developer. Any person, including a governmental agency, undertaking any development. 
2)  Development. Making any alteration or material change in the use or appearance of a structure or land by grading of the ground surface or construction of a structure or impervious surface. Where appropriate to the context, development refers to the act of developing or the result of development. 
3)  Basic Level Public Infrastructure. 
a)  Water: Public water transmission lines typically eight inches in diameter except service laterals. 
b)  Sanitary sewers: Public sewer lines typically eight inches in diameter except service laterals. 
c)  Streets: Local streets, sidewalks, curbs, gutters and drainage, park strips, street lighting and right-of-way acquisition. 
d)  Drainage: Public storm sewers typically ten inches in diameter. 
4)  Parcel of land. A platted lot or any other tract of land which is occupied or may be occupied by a structure or structures or other use, including the yard and other open spaces required under the Land Development Code, or reasonably attributable to an existing or proposed use. 
5)  Total project cost. All costs of right-of-way acquisition, materials, labor, contractual fees, construction, engineering fees, administrative fees, current and future financing costs, and other actual expenses of the improvement. 
(Ord. 2000-27 § 1, 11/06/2000) 
Section 2.18.030 - Cost recovery imposed; review. 
1)  A cost recovery charge is established, and rates shall be calculated by the City Engineer using the methodology set by Chapter 2.18.040. 
2)  A cost recovery charge is imposed upon all development within the City, on development of all lands owned by the City but outside the boundary of the City, and all development outside the boundary of the City which utilizes utility or transportation infrastructure when they apply for connection to a utility or street and did not previously pay their share of the construction of said infrastructure. 
(Ord. 2000-27 § 1, 11/06/2000) 
Section 2.18.040 - Methodology. 
1)  The methodology used to establish the cost recovery charge shall consider the cost of then-existing facilities, prior contributions by then-existing users, the value of the facilities, rate-making principles employed to finance publicly owned capital improvements, and other relevant factors identified by City Council. The methodology shall promote the objective that future systems users shall contribute no more than an equitable share of the cost of then-existing facilities. 
2)  The methodology used to establish the cost recovery charge shall be as follows: 
a)  A cost recovery shall be charged when a developer applies for connection to a City system and the property being developed did not previously bear the cost of construction or installation of the system and was not assessed for the construction or installation of the system. System, as used herein, refers to the basic level of public infrastructure including water, sewer, street, or drainage improvement. 
b)  The cost recovery charge shall be calculated in one of the following ways: 
1]  If a local improvement district was used to finance a system, the original total project cost shall be indexed to the current Engineering News Record (ENR) Construction Cost Index, with the year of construction constituting the "base year," to determine what the current cost of constructing the system would be. The indexed cost of the system shall at no time be less than the actual cost of construction. The original assessment formula employed for the system shall be applied to the indexed cost of the system to determine the cost recovery charge for the development. 
2]  If construction cost records for the system exist but no local improvement district was formed to fund its construction, the original total project cost shall be indexed to the current ENR Construction Cost Index, with the year of construction constituting the "base year," to determine what the current cost of constructing the system would be. The indexed cost of the system shall at no time be less than the actual cost of construction. The cost of the proportionate share of the system attributable to the development shall be determined and shall become the cost recovery charge. 
3]  If no construction cost records for a system exist, the current estimated total project cost of constructing the system shall be determined. The cost of the proportionate share of the system attributable to the development shall be determined and shall become the cost recovery charge. 
(Ord. 2000-27 § 1, 11/06/2000) 
Section 2.18.050 - Collection. 
1)  The cost recovery charge is immediately due and payable upon application or utilization of the utility or transportation facilities as determined by a request for a water meter, request for sewer services or approval of an extension of services request. 
2)  If development is commenced or connection is made to the water, sewer or drainage system without an appropriate permit, the cost recovery charge is immediately due and payable upon the earliest date that any such permit was required. The developer shall pay, and the City Manager shall collect, the applicable cost recovery charge before issuing any building or development permit or before permitting any connection to any infrastructure system of the City. The City Manager shall decline to issue such a permit or to permit such a connection until that charge has been paid in full. 
3)  Whenever the full and correct cost recovery charge has not been paid and collected for any reason, the City Manager shall report to the City Council the amount of the uncollected charge, the description of the real property on which the development has occurred to which the development charge is attributable, the date upon which the charge was due, and the name or names of the developer(s) responsible. Following notification to the offender, the City Manager shall cite into Municipal Court, for violation of this Chapter, the developer of the development for which the cost recovery charge is imposed. 
4)  Whenever a cost recovery charge of $100.00 or more would otherwise be due and collectable, the developer may apply upon forms provided by the City Manager for payment of the charge in not more than 20 semi-annual installments plus interest. Upon receipt of such an application, the City Manager shall compute the amount of the cost recovery charge and shall report the amount of the cost recovery charge, the date upon which the charge is due, the name or names of the developer or developers of the development for which the cost recovery charge is imposed, and the description of the property upon which said development is occurring; the obligation to pay the amount of the charge and interest upon the charge at the rate of 10% per annum, which interest shall be the full and only compensation to the City for its administrative costs, shall be secured by property, bond, deposits, letter of credit, or other security acceptable to the City Manager.

    It is the policy of the City to operate the water, wastewater, and storm water utilities as business enterprises that benefit the community by providing clean water and sanitary wastewater service, and by providing storm water run-off management. User charges for service are set to cover the full costs of operating and maintaining the utilities; as such, accuracy and timeliness in billing and collecting user charges is important. The City bills for all three utilities, other services requested by the customer, and other fees required by ordinance (transportation maintenance fee, transit operations fee, sidewalk maintenance fee, urban forest management fee, police service fee, and fire service fee) on a single monthly bill. Rates for each service area are separately calculated but are combined and printed on a single bill to facilitate billing and payment processing. The City maintains separate funds to account for specific revenues and expenditures. Monies paid for water service are accounted for in the Water Fund; monies paid for wastewater service are accounted for in the Wastewater Fund; monies paid for storm water service are accounted for in the Storm Water Fund; monies paid for the other fees required by ordinance are accounted for as described in their respective Municipal Code chapters.

a)  Date of application. 
b)  Location of premises to be served. 
c)  Date on which applicant will be ready for service. 
d)  Address to which bills are to be mailed or delivered. 
e)  Whether the applicant is an owner, tenant of, or agent for, the premises. 
f)  Social Security number or valid driver's license number. 
g)  Agreement to abide by all rules, regulations and ordinances of the utility, as now existing or as hereafter changed or amended. 
h)  Such other information as the utility may reasonably request including a valid landlord-tenant agreement to establish proof of occupancy. 
2)  Individual liability for joint service. Two or more parties who join to make application for service shall be jointly and individually liable and shall be sent a single periodic bill. 
3)  Multi-family utility service accounts must remain in the name of the Landlord (per Title 3, Utilities/Public Rights of Way, Section 3.01.100 Multiple Units) and may be placed "in care of" the Landlord's property manager. Under no condition shall the "in care of" party be the tenant. 
4)  Changes in customer's equipment. Customers making any material change in the size, character or extent of the equipment or operation utilizing water service, or whose change in operation results in a large increase in the use of water, shall immediately give the utility written notice of the nature of the change and, if requested by the utility, amend their application. 
5)  Special contracts. Contracts, other than application, may be required prior to service where, in the opinion of the utility, special circumstances warrant special consideration. 
6)  A new account fee of $25.00 will be collected for each new account application if the turn-on is during regular working hours. A new account fee of $60.00 will be collected for each new account requiring a turn-on other than during regular working hours. Working hours are defined as 8:00 am to 5:00 pm Monday through Friday excluding holidays. 
7)  Landlords and their agents may forego the $25 new account fee if the landlord or landlord's agent agrees in writing to have service put into the landlord's or landlord's agent's name when service for a tenant is discontinued by either the tenant, landlord, or landlord's agent. The landlord or landlord's agent will be billed for all services received until service for the landlord is stopped by the landlord or landlord's agent or service is started by a tenant in the tenant's name. 
8)  When the service has not previously been provided at the address, service shall be initiated as follows: 
a)  For water, storm water, and other City services, service shall be initiated and billings commence when the water meter is connected to the City's water main; 
b)  For wastewater service, service shall be initiated and billings commence when the wastewater connection passes inspection. 
(Ord. 2013-01 § 1 01/07/2013; Ord. 2011-04 § 1, 02/07/2011; Ord. 2007-13 § 1, 06/18/2007; Ord. 2006-07 § 1, 04/03/2006) 
Section 3.06.040 - Discontinuation of service. 
1)  Customer request for service discontinuance. 
a)  A customer may have City services discontinued during normal business hours by notifying the City in advance of the desired date of discontinuance. The customer will be required to pay all City services charges until the date of such discontinuance.

2)  Nonpayment of bills. A customer's water service may be discontinued if the bill is not paid in accordance with the procedures as listed in Section 3.06.080 herein. 
(Ord. 2011-04 § 1, 02/07/2011; Ord. 2006-07 § 1, 04/03/2006) 
Section 3.06.050 - Billing and payments. 
1)  Bills. 
a)  Bills for City services will be rendered monthly. Customers may be billed for any combination of the four services on each month's bill depending on which services are used. 
1]  Water service is considered to be used if the customer's property is connected to the water system, and the customer has not notified the utility that the property is vacant and water service is no longer required. Consumption of water is based on the meter reading on the utility's meters. 
2]  Wastewater service is considered to be used if the customer's property is connected to the water and wastewater system, and the customer has not notified the utility that the property is vacant and wastewater service is no longer required. Consumption for wastewater service is generally based on the water used as measured on the utility's water meter. If the customer does not have utility provided water service, and the wastewater system is connected to the property, the wastewater service is considered to be used. 
3]  Storm water service is considered to be used if the customer's property has any kind of development or impervious surface on it, and the property is being used, regardless of whether water or wastewater service is being used. 
4]  Other City services are considered to be used if a utility services account is active. 
b)  Water consumption via meter readings is the best available measure of wastewater usage. Therefore, the amount of water used each month will be used to determine the wastewater consumption and associated charges. 
c)  Meter readings. 
1]  Meters will be read at regular intervals for the preparation of bills and as required for the preparation of opening, closing, and special bills. 
2]  It may not always be possible to read meters on the same day of each period. Should a monthly billing period contain less than 26 days or more than 34 days, a pro rata correction will be made. 
3]  Where all water used is derived from the Corvallis water system, the metered amount of water delivered to the unit from the Corvallis water system for each month shall be the amount of water used for determining the water and wastewater bill, except for summer wastewater averaging (Section 3.06.050(2)). 
4]  Where part of the water used is derived from the Corvallis water system and part of the water used is derived from other sources, the amount of water used to determine the wastewater bill shall be the combination of the amounts determined under subsections 3] and 5] of this Section. 
5]  Where all water used is derived from sources other than Corvallis' water system and the unit is other than a single family or multi-family served by the Corvallis wastewater treatment system, the amount of water used shall be determined by the City Manager using records and data furnished to her or him by the wastewater user or gathered from the City Manager's own investigation, or both, at the discretion of the City Manager. In lieu of such determination by the City Manager of the amount of water used, a wastewater user may be required to provide, install, and maintain a meter to measure the amount of water used at the wastewater user's expense; and the City Manager may accept the measurement of water used as determined by such meter if the City Manager is reasonably satisfied as to the accuracy of such measurement. 
6]  Where all water used is derived from sources other than Corvallis' water system and the unit is a single family or multi-family unit served by the Corvallis wastewater system, the wastewater charge shall be a flat rate based on single family residential rates (Section 3.06.140(6)). 
7]  Exceptions. 
a)  In those cases where commercial or industrial customers can demonstrate that water used is not directly returned to the wastewater treatment system, an adjustment shall be made on the wastewater consumption charge proportionate to the non-returned usage. In order to qualify for this exemption, the customer shall install a wastewater exemption meter per Section 4.03.020.010, Use of Public Sewers Required, to measure water not returned to the wastewater treatment system. 
8]  Estimations. In rare circumstances the City is unable to read a water meter due to inaccessibility of the meter, and must estimate the read to calculate a bill. Estimate calculations are based on the amount of water used in the same month in the prior year. If there was no usage data for the customer for the prior year, then the prior month's data is used. Bills that are rendered based on an estimated read will indicate that information. 
d)  City Services billings will be prorated for partial month billings. Prorated billings shall be computed by the following formula: 
1]  For Water and wastewater: 
A]  Consumption × the current consumption rate = Consumption Charge. 
B]  Consumption × the current applicable high-level surcharge, if any = High Level Surcharge. 
C]  Base Rate ÷ 30 × number of days service = Prorated Base Rate Charge. 
D]  Consumption Charge + High-Level Surcharge + Prorated Base Rate Charge = Total Charge. 
2]  For Storm Water and other City services: 
A]  Base Rate ÷ 30 × number of days service = Prorated Base Rate Charge. 
2)  Summer Wastewater Average. The utility recognizes that some water is used in the summer for irrigation that is not measured through a meter designated for irrigation purposes. Since this water does not go through the utility's wastewater system, summer wastewater bills are calculated in the following method: 
a)  Single-family units will be charged the base rate and the consumptive rate for any consumption on bills rendered the prior December through April. For bills rendered May through November, the monthly billing will be computed upon the average metered water consumption for the preceding months of December through April or computed upon the actual consumption whichever is less. 
b)  Multi-family units and 509J classroom facilities will be billed the basic minimum and the consumptive rate for any consumption rendered December through April. For bills rendered May through November, billing will be computed upon the average metered water consumption for the preceding months of December through April or computed upon the actual consumption, whichever is less. 
c)  Where by reason of new construction, a single-family unit was not connected to water and wastewater service on February 1 of a year, such unit shall be billed for the period May through November following construction, for an amount not to exceed eight units per month. 
d)  Where by reason of new construction, a multi-family unit was not connected to water and wastewater service on February 1 of a year, such unit shall be billed for the period May through November following construction, on the basis of actual consumption. 
e)  Commercial customers (all other customers not described in the above categories) will be billed the basic minimum and the appropriate consumptive rate for all consumption based on their wastewater strength designation. There will be no seasonal exceptions made except for measured amounts proven not to be discharged to the sanitary or storm water systems. 
3)  Bill payment. 
a)  All bills are generated for services already rendered. Balances are due upon receipt and must be paid on or before the 25th day following the billing date, or the payment will be considered delinquent. Payment may be made at the City's Utility Billing office. 
b)  Final bills will be processed at the time of discontinuance of service. 
c)  When bills are delinquent, the utility will follow the procedures as outlined in Section 3.06.080. 
4)  Billings of separate meters not combined. Each meter on customer's premises will be considered separately, and the readings of two or more meters will not be combined unless specifically provided for in the rate schedule, or unless the utility's operating convenience required the use of more than one meter or of a battery of meters. The minimum monthly charge for such combined meters will be based on the diameter of the total combined discharge areas of the meters. 
5)  All payments for services rendered may be remitted on a single check or on separate checks. The utility shall deposit monies equal to the billings for each service into the respective fund for the service rendered. Payment shall be applied first to the police service fee, then to the fire service fee, then to the urban forest management fee, then to the sidewalk maintenance fee, then to the transit operations fee, then to the transportation maintenance fee, then to storm water charges, then to wastewater charges, and finally to the water charges. 
(Ord. 2018-31 § 3(Exh. A), 11/19/2018, eff. 07/01/2019; Ord. 2011-04 § 1, 02/07/2011; Ord. 2008-03 § 1, 01/22/2008; Ord. 2006-07 § 1, 04/03/2006) 
Section 3.06.060 - Meter test. 
1)  Meter test. 
a)  Prior to installation, each meter will be tested and no meter found to register more than three percent fast or slow under conditions of normal operation will be placed in service. 
b)  On customer request. 
1]  A customer may, giving not less than one week's notice, request the utility to test the meter serving her or his premises. 
2]  For each additional test after the first performed in a calendar year, the utility may charge the customer an amount to cover the reasonable cost of test, as follows: 
a]  For 3/4" meters: $25.00. 
b]  For 1" - 1.5" meters: $50.00. 
c]  For larger than 1.5" meters: Estimated cost. 
3]  The charge will be refunded if the meter is found to register more than three percent fast. The customer will be notified not less than five days in advance of the time and place of the test. 
4]  A customer or representative shall have the right to be present when the test is made. 
5]  A written report giving the results of the test shall be available to the customer within 10 days after completion of the test. 
2)  Leak Test. The City will assist customers who have higher than expected usage to test for leaks. If an underground leak is discovered, the City will adjust the customer's bill as identified in section 3.06.070 Adjustments. 
(Ord. 2011-04 § 1, 02/07/2011; Ord. 2006-07 § 1, 04/03/2006) 
Section 3.06.070 - Adjustments. 
1)  Adjustment of bills for meter error. 
a)  Fast meters. When, upon test, a meter is found to be registering more than three percent fast, under conditions of normal operation, the utility will refund to the customer the full amount of the overcharge based on corrected meter readings for a period not exceeding three months that the meter was in use. 
b)  Slow meters. 
1]  When, upon test, a meter used for domestic or residential service is found to be registering more than 25 percent slow, the utility may bill the customer for the amount of the undercharge, based upon corrected meter readings for a period not exceeding three months that the meter was in use. 
2]  When, upon test, a meter used for other than domestic or residential service is found to be registering more than five percent slow, the utility may bill the customer for the amount of the undercharge, based upon correct meter readings for a period not exceeding six months that the meter was in use. 
c)  Non-registering meters. The utility may bill the customer for water consumed while the meter was not registering. The bill will be at the minimum monthly meter rate, or will be computed upon an estimate of consumption based either upon the customer's prior use during the same season of the year or upon a reasonable comparison with the use of other customers receiving the same class of service during the same period and under similar circumstances and conditions. The bill will be for the period of time that the meter was not registering. 
2)  Adjustments due to underground leaks. Where a leak exists underground between the meter and the building or where the leak is otherwise undetectable and the same is repaired within a reasonable time after the owner, agent or occupant of the premises has been notified of such leakage, the utility may allow an adjustment of 50 percent of the estimated excess water consumption for a period not exceeding two months that the meter was in use. When the nature of the leak is such that the leak drained into the wastewater system, then the wastewater charges may be adjusted for 50 percent of the estimated excess wastewater consumption for a period not exceeding two months that the meter was in use. When the leak does not drain into the wastewater system, then 100 percent of the estimated excess wastewater consumption may be adjusted for a period not exceeding two months. The adjustment will be computed upon an estimate of consumption based either upon the customer's use during the same season of the year prior or upon a reasonable comparison with the use of other customers receiving the same class of service during the same period and under similar circumstances and conditions. 
3)  Adjustment for other causes. From time-to-time an over- or under- billing error is discovered by the utility or the customer. For these errors, corrections will be calculated for a period of no more than one year. 
a)  For amounts owed by the utility to the customer, the customer shall have the option of taking the amount as a credit or as a refund of monies. 
b)  For amounts owed by the customer to the utility, if the amount owed is less than the customer's average monthly bill, the amount shall be due and payable no later than the next regular payment due date. If the amount owed is more than the average monthly bill, the customer may arrange a time-payment agreement to re-pay the amounts owed. The customer must maintain all current bills and pay the amounts owed on the time-payment agreement each month. The City shall not charge a penalty or interest on the past-due amount as long as the payment terms are met. In no case may the customer take more than one year to re-pay the amounts owed. 
(Ord. 2006-07 § 1, 04/03/2006) 
Section 3.06.080 - Delinquent accounts. 
1)  Policy. To keep costs of operations as low as possible, the City's policy is to pursue collection of all accounts. Prompt payment is expected. 
2)  Procedure. 
a)  A City services account shall be deemed a delinquent account if it is not paid on or before the 25th day following the account's billing date. For purposes of this section, "paid" means received in the City Finance Department. Payments placed in the drop boxes provided by the City shall be deemed as received as of the next business day. 
b)  The subsequent month's bill will serve as the first notice of delinquency and the second notice of when payment must be received in order to avoid turn-off for non-payment. 
c)  The City shall serve notice of delinquency to both the tenant and the landlord when the person responsible for paying the bill is not the resident of the service address. Notice to the tenant shall consist of a door-hanger affixed to the primary entry door of each dwelling unit associated with the service address. A fee of $5 per door-hanger will be charged to the owner of the account at the service address where notification occurs. Service to a tenant when the tenant is not responsible for payment will not be terminated for a period of six days after notice to discontinue service was served to the tenant and person responsible for payment. 
d)  The City will transfer any delinquent amount owed on a final account by a customer at a previous location to that customer's new address when payment is not received within 26 days of the final bill. Payments of the delinquent amount shall apply as set forth in subsections 2) a) and b) of this section. The City may also transfer to any active account of a customer, a delinquent amount owed by that customer on any property owned by that customer who does not have utility provided water service but has connection to the utility's wastewater services. 
e)  Subject to the appeal procedure provided in Section 3.06.090, the City Manager is authorized to turn off water service at any location for which there exists a delinquent City services account no earlier than the 46th day after the date of billing on that account. Discontinuance of water service shall be in addition to any other remedies or penalties provided herein or any other ordinance of the City or by any other applicable law. 
f)  For services subject to disconnection, the City may charge a $25 penalty fee to the owner of the account if the City incurs a trip for a delinquency turn-off but leaves the service active as a courtesy to the customer. If the service remains active, the customer is required to pay the additional $25 fee and bring the account to a $0 balance the same business day. 
3)  Application for service renewal due to delinquency turn-off. 
a)  A service that has been disconnected for non-payment will be required to bring the account to a $0 balance including service fees prior to service reconnection. 
b)  Service renewal. 
1]  To renew service that has been disconnected due to non-payment, where the request is made during regular office hours of 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM, a service fee of $35 will be charged. 
2]  To renew service that has been disconnected due to non-payment, where the request is made after regular working hours, a service fee of $100 will be charged. 
3]  Water or wastewater service shall not be restored until all charges, including the expense of removal, closing, and restoration if incurred have been paid. 
4)  Recovery of unpaid charges. Any charge due hereunder which shall not be paid when due may be recovered in an action at law by the City. 
5)  The City Manager of the City is hereby empowered and directed to enforce this provision as to all delinquent accounts, using the procedures provided in this Section. The employees of the City shall at all reasonable times have access to any premises served by the City for inspection, repair or the enforcement of the provisions herein. 
(Ord. 2013-01 § 1, 01/07/2013; Ord. 2011-04 § 1, 02/07/2011; Ord. 2006-07 § 1, 04/03/2006) 
Section 3.06.090 - Appeals. 
a)  Upon written request by the customer, a hearing concerning computation of the amount owed and/or whether the service should be terminated shall be held before a hearings officer appointed by the City Manager. Service shall not be discontinued before the hearing has been conducted, unless service was disconnected before the hearing was requested. If the Hearings Officer finds that the computation was in error, the Hearings Officer shall adjust the amount of the service charge. If the Hearings Officer finds that the computation was correct, the Hearings Officer shall determine the service charges to be correct and shall set a date for payment. If the Hearings Officer determines that the amount owed on the account has not been paid by the time set after the hearing, then the Hearings Officer shall determine when services shall be terminated. The decision of the Hearings Officer is final. 
    If the person requesting the hearing does not appear at the scheduled hearing, the Hearings Officer shall enter an order declaring the service charges to be correct and when the service will be terminated if unpaid. 
b)  The City Manager or authorized representative, in cases where the customer is unable to pay the bill because of short term problems or an emergency circumstance, shall have the discretion of renewing or continuing service to a delinquent account upon acceptance of an acceptable plan for the payment of past-due amounts in installments. 
c)  The City Manager is hereby empowered and directed to enforce these procedures as to any and all delinquent accounts and to establish appropriate procedures for provision of reasonable notice and the opportunity for a hearing. Council shall set and review cost recovery fees or charges for delinquent City services accounts and for restoring water service after it has been turned off. 
(Ord. 2011-04 § 1, 02/07/2011; Ord. 2006-07 § 1, 04/03/2006) 
Section 3.06.100 - Notices. 
1)  Notices to customers. The following notices are required to be given to customers: 
a)  a first monthly billing stating current charges due upon receipt; 
b)  the second notice will include the current charges due upon receipt plus the date payment for the previous month's billing must be received to avoid turn-off. 
2)  Notice from customers. Notice from the customer other than request for hearing (3.06.090 subsection a)) to the utility shall be given by the customer or the customer's authorized representative orally or in writing to the Finance Department or the City Manager. 
(Ord. 2006-07 § 1, 04/03/2006) 
Section 3.06.110 - Utility service outside the City. 
1)  Outside City. The City does not extend services outside the City limits. However, some properties that abut or are in reasonable proximity to the City's water line from the Marys Peak watershed may connect to the City's water line, with approval by the City Council. Rates for water service rendered outside the City shall be double the rates provided herein for service inside the City. The high-level surcharge shall be applied uniformly inside and outside the City. 
(Ord. 2011-04 § 1, 02/07/2011; Ord. 2006-07 § 1, 04/03/2006) 
Section 3.06.120 - Special storm water rates and fees. 
1)  Any person responsible for storm water charges may apply for a permit designating their property as a special user unit. In order to obtain a permit, the applicant must demonstrate that the storm water runoff from the property is discharged directly into the Willamette River via an approved system consisting entirely of non-public facilities. As a condition of granting a special user unit permit, the City shall require that the applicant comply with all applicable federal, State or local laws, ordinances, regulations or orders. The fee for a special user unit permit shall be as prescribed in Section 8.03.270 of this Code. 
2)  Storm water rates may be reduced for improved premises where approved runoff control measures have been taken unless those measures have been required as part of a development permit. Analysis shall be on a case by case basis. No such rate-reduction shall apply to improved premises where other financial incentives for runoff control have been given. 
(Ord. 2011-04 § 1, 02/07/2011; Ord. 2010-24 § 1, 11/15/2010; Ord. 2006-07 § 1, 04/03/2006) 
Section 3.06.130 - Utility services rate setting. 
1)  Annual rate review. Just and equitable charges for water, wastewater, and storm water services will be reviewed annually and set by resolution of Council periodically to reflect actual operation and maintenance costs, including replacement and extension of the various collection, distribution, and treatment systems. 
2)  Water rates consist of a base rate plus a consumption rate for each hundred cubic feet of water used. Rates vary based on the classification of user, the size of the water meter, and the level (altitude) for service. Surcharges shall be determined by reference to the official water map on file at the offices of the Department of Public Works. 
3)  Wastewater service rates are based on a base rate, plus a consumptive rate for each hundred cubic feet of water used. Consumptive rates vary based on the strength of discharge. 
a)  The discharge of non-domestic wastewater shall be subject to additional charges. Wastewater of higher strength than domestic requires more treatment, which results in higher costs to the City. These additional charges will be based on the average treatment cost related to treating biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and total suspended solids (TSS). These costs will be recovered from customers who are designated as having either Medium, High, or Very High strength wastewater. 
1]  Strength Categories. Four strength categories were created with the adoption of an equity rate structure in June 1998 and are based on the levels of BOD and TSS in the wastewater. 
Strength Category Strength Range of BOD and/or TSS Domestic < 200 mg/l Medium 201-500 mg/l High 501-1000 mg/l Very High > 1000 mg/l  
2]  Assignment of Strength Category. To be assigned to a strength category, the commercial or industrial wastewater discharger must indicate their North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code. This code identifies the type of business to be conducted at the site. The NAICS code is then applied to the national survey data to determine the industry-standard wastewater effluent strength for this business type. 
3]  Appeal of Assignment. If a commercial or industrial wastewater customer disputes the assignment made, they can pursue an appeal process described by a Public Works Department administrative procedure. 
4]  New Business or Change in Business Type. New businesses will be assigned a strength category during the permit process or when they establish a new utility services account. Businesses operating within the City that change the type of business conducted at a site will be assigned a strength category during the "Change of Occupancy" process. 
4)  Storm water service rates are based on impervious surface area. A user of storm water services is any person who discharges, or who causes or permits the discharge of, storm water runoff into the City's storm water system or who benefits from the City's storm water system as a special user. Any person occupying or having a right to occupy premises which are improved with impervious surfaces shall be presumed to be a user of storm water services. A person responsible for storm water charges under this Chapter may avoid incurring those charges by removing all impervious surfaces from any improved premises. The basis for calculating fees is the Equivalent Service Unit (ESU). Single family homes are all assumed to be one ESU and are billed as such; all other classes of customer have the property measured for the number of ESUs and are billed according to the number of ESUs, rounded to the nearest 0.10 ESU. 
5)  Fire Service Detector Meters. Fire Service Detector Meters are used to detect water flow. There are no consumption charges associated with fire service meters; however, the meters shall be read monthly, and when there is repeated flow through the meter the City shall investigate to determine the cause of the flow, and will charge the base and consumptive rates for the class of customer for usage for other than fire service purposes. 
6)  Properties without a Water Meter: 
a)  Single family property that does not have utility provided water service and therefore has no water meter, but that has connection to the utility's wastewater service shall pay the single family customer base rate for a 3/4 inch meter, six units at the wastewater consumption rate, plus the applicable storm water and other City Services fees per month.

Chapter 3.10 - POLICE SERVICE FEE[1] 

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2018-29 , § 1(Exh. A), adopted November 19, 2018, is effective July 1, 2019. 

Section 3.10.010 - Purpose. 
1)  The City Council has determined that funding to maintain core city services at the current levels and to address deficiencies in the core public safety services requires funding from a local option levy and the formation of a 911 Service District. Revenue from service fees will be devoted to the provision of supplemental and additional law enforcement services and fire services above and beyond the core levels and types of services currently provided. 
2)  The City Council has determined that these supplemental and additional law enforcement services should not be paid for by property taxes when this regulatory burden is partially imposed by the intensity of development and use of property by tax exempt entities. 
3)  The City Council has determined that community-oriented policing is the approach that best addresses the community's need for additional and supplemental police services in a manner that directly benefits each member of the community in a manner directly related to the service demands created by the intensity of development and use of property. 
4)  The City Council has determined that a Police Service Fee provides a stable, long-term funding source ensuring resources are available to provide community-oriented law enforcement services that are in addition to and supplement basic police services and that therefore directly benefit each member of the Corvallis community based on the proportion of the need for the supplemental service that each community member directly generates and receives. 
5)  The City Council has determined that a Police Service Fee is the best mechanism to fund additional and supplemental Police staff needed to achieve the goal of community-oriented policing. 
6)  The City Council has determined that Residential Meter Equivalent is an equitable and accurate measure of the intensity of use of a property and the corresponding need for additional and supplemental Police services throughout the City that is directly generated by that intensity of use. Particular service demands and risks created by intense development that will be best addressed by additional and supplemental community-oriented police services include traffic and parking, alcohol and drug use, noise, disorderly conduct, and nuisance behavior. 
(Ord. 2018-29 § 1(Exh. A), 11/19/2018)

1)  The Police Service Fee for each developed property shall be based on the Residential Meter Equivalent (RME) methodology. 
2)  The RME is determined by following the American Water Works Association's methodology that reflects differences in demand for water service based on the size of the meter. 
3)  Most single family residential units have ? or 3/4 inch meters. As a result, the RME treats this size of meter as a single RME. The higher the RME, the higher the demand for additional and supplemental police services generated by the development served by the utility account. 
4)  Specific RME calculations are as follows: 
Size of Meter RME No meter 1 ? inch to 3/4 inch 1 1 inch 2 1.5 inch 4 2 inch 7 3 inch 16 4 inch 28 6 inch 64 10 inch 178  
5)  The monthly bill will be based on a calculation of the RME times a rate per RME. The rate per RME will be set by Resolution.

Chapter 3.11 - FIRE SERVICE FEE[2] 

Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2018-30 , § 1(Exh. A), adopted November 19, 2018, is effective July 1, 2019. 

Section 3.11.010 - Purpose. 
1)  The City Council has determined that funding to maintain core city services at the current levels and to address deficiencies in the public safety services requires funding from a local option levy and the formation of a 911 Service District. Revenue from service fees will be devoted to the provision of supplemental and additional law enforcement services and fire services above and beyond the core levels and types of services currently provided. 
2)  The City Council has determined that these supplemental and additional fire services should not be paid for by property taxes when this regulatory burden is partially imposed by the intensity of development and use of property by tax exempt entities. 
3)  The City Council has determined that maintaining the current level of Fire and EMT services so that crews at three of the five stations can either respond to calls for Fire service or can respond to calls for EMT services, but cannot respond to both, is not the approach that best addresses the community's needs. Additional and supplemental Fire services that allow all stations to respond to both Fire calls and EMT calls directly benefits each member of the community in a manner that is directly related to the intensity of development and use of property. 
4)  The City Council has determined that a Fire Service Fee provides a stable, long-term funding source ensuring resources are available to provide Fire and EMT services that are in addition to and supplement basic Fire services and therefore directly benefit each member of the Corvallis community based on the proportion of the need for the supplemental service that each community member directly generates and receives. 
5)  The City Council has determined that a Fire and EMT Service Fee is the best mechanism to fund additional and supplemental Fire and EMT staff needed to achieve the goal of providing both Fire and EMT services from all stations. 
6)  The City Council has determined that Residential Meter Equivalent is an equitable and accurate measure of the intensity of use of a property and the corresponding need for additional and supplemental Fire and EMT services throughout the City that is directly generated by that intensity of use. Particular service demands and risks that will be best addressed by these additional and supplemental Fire and EMT services include the increased life hazard due to the density of people in apartment buildings and dorms. For instance, multi-story structures operated by a Utility Account Owner with greater RME that require specialized equipment (aerial ladder) and which require additional personnel per National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) standards (16 personnel are required for residential structure fire, but 27 personnel are required for apartments and 42 for high rises). 
(Ord. 2018-30 § 1(Exh. A), 11/19/2018) 
Section 3.11.020 - Definitions. 
    As used in this chapter, the following means: 
1)  Developed property. A parcel or legal portion of real property, on which an improvement exists or has been constructed. Improvement on developed property includes, but is not limited to buildings, parking lots, outside storage, and other uses that increase demand for Fire Services. 
2)  Undeveloped Property. A parcel or legal portion of real property, on which no improvement exists or has been constructed. 
3)  Utility account customer. The person in whose name a water, wastewater and/or storm water account exists and who is responsible for payment of charges for said account. The Utility Account Customer is responsible for the demand for fire services generated by activity on the property served by the account 
4)  Utility Billing Office. The City Office responsible for issuing City Services bills and collecting payment of monies due. The Utility Billing Office maintains a database of meter sizes. 
(Ord. 2018-30 § 1(Exh. A), 11/19/2018) 
Section 3.11.030 - Revenue. 
1)  The Fire Service Fee revenue shall be used only for Fire Services, including funding payroll costs for additional staff and the materials and equipment necessary for staff to operate. 
2)  All funds collected pursuant to this chapter shall be deposited in the City's General Fund for the sole benefit of the Fire Department. 
(Ord. 2018-30 § 1(Exh. A), 11/19/2018) 
Section 3.11.040 - Fire Service Fee. 
1)  A Fire Service Fee is imposed upon the owners of all developed property within the City. The fee shall be based on the Residential Meter Equivalent, which corresponds to the direct and indirect demand for and use of Fire services generated by the utility account customer. The fees imposed under this chapter shall become due and payable from and after the effective date of this chapter, and for property developed after the effective date of this chapter, from and after the date the property becomes developed. 
2)  The Fire Service Fee imposed under subsection (1) of this section may be paid by the owner, occupant or anyone designated by the owner or occupant; however if the Fire Service Fee is not paid promptly, when due, the City shall proceed to collect such charges in any manner provided by law. No lien will attach to property in the event of nonpayment of the Fire Service Fee. 
3)  The fees imposed under this chapter shall begin with City Services bills issued on or after July 1, 2019. 
(Ord. 2018-30 § 1(Exh. A), 11/19/2018) 
Section 3.11.050 - Exceptions to the Fire Service Fee. 
    The following shall not be subject to the Fire Service Fee: 
1)  City-owned parking lots, which are not associated with public services other than parking. 
2)  Publicly owned parkland, open spaces, and greenways, 
3)  Areas encompassed by railroad and public rights-of-way, except for developed railroad property such as maintenance areas, non-rolling storage areas and areas used for the transfer of rail-transported goods to non-rail transport. 
4)  Undeveloped properties. 
(Ord. 2018-30 § 1(Exh. A), 11/19/2018) 
Section 3.11.060 - Determination of Fire Service Fee. 
1)  The Fire Service Fee for each developed property shall be based on the Residential Meter Equivalent (RME) methodology. 
2)  The RME is determined by following the American Water Works Association's methodology that reflects differences in demand for water service based on the size of the meter. 
3)  Most single family residential units have ? or 3/4 inch meters. As a result, the RME treats this size of meter as a single RME. The higher the RME, the higher the demand for supplemental and additional fire services generated by the development served by the utility account. 
4)  Specific RME calculations are as follows: 
Size of Meter RME No meter 1 ? inch to 3/4 inch 1 1 inch 2 1.5 inch 4 2 inch 7 3 inch 16 4 inch 28 6 inch 64 10 inch 178  
5)  The monthly bill will be based on a calculation of the RME times a rate per RME. The rate per RME will be set by Resolution. 
(Ord. 2018-30 § 1(Exh. A), 11/19/2018) 
Section 3.11.070 - Billing and Collection of Fees. 
1)  The Fire Service Fee shall be billed and collected monthly with and as part of the combined City Services billing which includes water, wastewater, and storm water fees. 
2)  If the Fire Service Fee is not paid when due, the City shall proceed to collect such charges in any manner provided by law. 
(Ord. 2018-30 § 1(Exh. A), 11/19/2018) 
Section 3.11.080 - Alternate Contribution Allowance. 
1)  The City Manager may enter into an agreement with a Utility Account Customer with an RME greater than 200 allowing the Utility Account Customer to make an alternate contribution to Fire services in a manner and for an amount greater than or equal to the amount to be billed annually, if the City Manager determines it is in the best interest of the City. 
(Ord. 2018-30 § 1(Exh. A), 11/19/2018) 
Section 3.11.090 - Appeal. 
1)  Any person responsible for a property who disputes the size of their water meter may present the reason for their dispute to the City's Utility Billing Office who will inspect the meter to confirm its size and render a decision, along with an explanation of how that decision was reached. 
2)  If the person responsible for a property is not satisfied at this point, they may appeal such decision to the City Manager by filing a written notice of appeal within 30 days of the date of the notice of customer group or monthly billing rate, together with payment of an appeal fee of $100. 
3)  The City Manager shall notify the appellant not less than 10 days prior to the date of the consideration of the appeal. The decision of the City Manager shall be limited to whether the appellant's property has been assigned the appropriate meter size. 
4)  In the event that the City Manager changes or otherwise overturns the Utility Billing Office's decision on appeal, any appeal fee paid by the appellant shall be refunded.

5)  Non-detectable sample results may only be used as a demonstration that a pollutant is not present if the EPA approved method from 40 CFR part 136 with the lowest minimum detection level for that pollutant was used in the analysis. 
6)  Any grant of the monitoring waiver by the City must be included as a condition in the User's permit. The reasons supporting the waiver and any information submitted by the User in its request for the waiver must be maintained by the City for 3 years after expiration of the waiver. 
7)  Upon approval of the monitoring waiver and revision of the User's permit by the City, the Industrial User must certify on each report with the statement below, that there has been no increase in the pollutant in its wastestream due to activities of the Industrial User: 
Based on my inquiry of the person or persons directly responsible for managing compliance with the Pretreatment Standard for 40 CFR _______ [specify applicable National Pretreatment Standard part(s)], I certify that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, there has been no increase in the level of ______ [list pollutant(s)] in the wastewaters due to the activities at the facility since filing of the last periodic report under 40 CFR 403.12(e)(1). 
8)  In the event that a waived pollutant is found to be present or is expected to be present based on changes that occur in the User's operations, the User must immediately: Comply with the monitoring requirements of paragraph (A) of this section or other more frequent monitoring requirements imposed by the City; and notify the City. 
9)  This provision does not supersede certification processes and requirements established in categorical Pretreatment Standards, except as otherwise specified in the categorical Pretreatment Standard. 
C.  If a Significant Industrial User subject to the reporting requirement in this section monitors any regulated pollutant at the appropriate sampling location more frequently than required by the City, using the procedures prescribed in Section 4.03.030.106 of this municipal code, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report.

2)  If the owner fails to respond or to demonstrate to the Police Chief that further action should not be taken, the Police Chief shall issue a determination of chronic nuisance and direct the owner to abate the nuisance within thirty days, or show good cause to the Police Chief why the owner cannot meet the deadline. The notice shall state that: 
a)  If the nuisance is not abated within the thirty-day period, and good cause for failure to abate is not shown, the Hearings Officer may order abatement or closure of the property with appropriate conditions. The Hearings Officer may also employ any other remedy deemed by it to be appropriate to abate the nuisance, including but not limited to authorizing a civil complaint in a court of competent jurisdiction;

1)  If the Police Chief determines that the owner has failed to abate the chronic nuisance or demonstrate good cause as to why the owner cannot do so, the Police Chief may refer the matter to the Hearings Officer for a hearing. The Hearings Officer shall give notice of the hearing to the owner and occupants, if different from the owner, and post notice of the hearing on the main entrance of the property. At the time set for hearing the owner and occupants may appear and be heard. The Hearings Officer shall determine de novo whether the property is chronic nuisance property, whether the nuisance has been abated and whether the owner has shown good cause or otherwise has a valid defense. 
2)  The City has the initial burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that the property is chronic nuisance property. If the City is relying on an incident that occurred on property other than the property that is the subject of the chronic nuisance determination, the City shall demonstrate some causal relationship between activities occurring on the property and the incident. The activities must have contributed to, but need not be the sole or predominate cause of the incident. Evidence demonstrating a causal connection may include, but is not limited to: 
a)  That the owner knew or reasonably should have known that the resident or other person associated with the property would engage in conduct listed in Section 5.07.030 2); or 
b)  Activities on the subject property that encouraged, engendered, promoted, contributed to or otherwise made the incident more likely to occur. 
3)  It shall be an affirmative defense to an action under this Chapter that the owner could not, in spite of the exercise of reasonable care and diligence, control the activities on the subject property that constituted the incident or made the incident more likely to occur or otherwise remedy the situation leading to the finding that the property is chronic nuisance property. The owner has the burden of proving this defense by a preponderance of the evidence. The action shall be dismissed if the Hearings Officer determines that the owner has proven this defense. 
4)  If the owner can prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the owner is unable to remedy the chronic nuisance within the time frames required by this Chapter, the Hearings Officer may elect to grant more time and continue its final determination as the Hearings Officer determines is just. 
(Ord. 2008-22 § 1, 12/15/2008) 
Section 5.07.060 - Remedies.

2)  Prior to issuing any order of abatement or closure, the Hearings Officer shall consider the following factors: 
a)  The actions taken by the owner(s) to mitigate or correct the problem at the property; 
b)  The financial condition of the owner; 
c)  Whether the problem at the property was repeated or continuous; 
d)  The magnitude or gravity of the problem; 
e)  The level of cooperation of the owner in addressing the problem, including whether the owner reported the incidents; 
f)  The time and cost to the City in attempting to correct the problem; and 
g)  Any other factor deemed relevant by the Hearings Officer. These factors are guidelines to inform the decision-making process, but the presence or absence of any factors shall not control the decision by the Hearings Officer. 
3)  The order may include conditions under which abatement or closure is to occur. 
4)  Upon a determination by the Hearings Officer that the property is a nuisance property, the Police Chief may file a notice of the proceedings to be placed with the property records of Benton County. 
5)  The remedies in this section are in addition to those otherwise provided by law. The City may also employ any other remedy deemed by it to be appropriate to abate the nuisance, including but not limited to authorizing a civil complaint in a court of competent jurisdiction.

Section 5.07.070 - Multi-unit property. 
1)  Except as provided in Section 5.07.070 2), in the case of multi-unit residential property, such as apartment complexes under one ownership, the chronic nuisance determination and closure remedy shall be directed only to the unit or units that are the source or location of the incidents. 
2)  A chronic nuisance determination and remedy may be applied to multiple units, up to and including the entire property, if the Hearings Officer determines that: 
a)  The incidents occurred in the common areas of the property or otherwise are not reasonably attributable to a particular unit; 
b)  The nature or scope of the incidents is such that they cannot reasonably be attributed to a particular unit; or 
c)  Incidents continue to occur despite previous imposition of remedies on specific units and the owner has demonstrated an inability or unwillingness to mitigate or correct the nuisance.

2)  If the Hearings Officer orders the owner to abate the nuisance, the Hearings Officer may impose upon the owner a civil penalty of five hundred dollars per incident for subsequent incidents, as defined by Section 5.07.030 2), occurring on the property within six months of the order. 
3)  A civil penalty is assessed by issuing written notice of penalty to the owner of chronic nuisance property and the owner's registered agent, if any is known. The notice shall contain the following information: 
a)  The street address or description sufficient for identification of the property; 
b)  That the Hearings Officer has found the owner has failed to take the action required by the Hearings Officer, or that after an order to abate the nuisance, a subsequent nuisance activity has occurred, with a concise description of the conditions leading to the Hearings Officer's findings; 
c)  That the owner may request a hearing on the validity of the assessment of the penalty by filing a request with City Council within fourteen days of the mailing of the notice. The request must specifically state the grounds upon which the owner believes that the penalty is not valid; 
d)  The penalty is final when fourteen days have elapsed from the date of mailing the notice if a request for hearing is not filed, or upon entry of an order upholding the penalty by the City Council after hearing. 
4)  The Hearings Officer shall not impose more than ten days of civil penalties at a time. The Hearings Officer may impose additional civil penalties after ten days by reissuing notice of imposition of penalties.

3)  The request for a review by the City Council must be received by the City Recorder by four thirty p.m. on the fourteenth day after the order was issued. Failure to file the request with the City Recorder within the time limit shall be a failure to exhaust remedies and the civil penalty or closure order shall become final.

5)  The City Council may order the City to pay the costs of the review, including the property owner's filing fee, if the City Council finds that the order or penalties are not valid.

Section 8.03.300.065 - Rental housing program fees. 
    For the purpose of offsetting costs to the City associated with the operation of a Rental Housing Program, there is hereby imposed an annual fee, to be set by the City Council, for each dwelling unit covered by a rental agreement. 
1)  Rental Property Registry. Owners of residential rental units located within the Corvallis city limits shall register said units with the City of Corvallis through City-determined methods before allowing the property to be occupied by a tenant. The property owner shall furnish the following information and notify the City within 30 days of any change: rental property address; total number of units per property; owner's name and primary contact information including mailing address and phone or email address. A property owner may designate an agent as the primary contact for registration purposes. 
2)  Fraternities & Sororities. The total annual fee for fraternities, sororities, and other similar group living structures shall be calculated based on the occupancy capacity of each structure divided by the five-year American Community Survey-determined average household size of renter- occupied units, multiplied by the annual per-unit fee. 
3)  Program Fee. The fee applied to units of rental housing, defined as any dwelling unit covered by a rental agreement, and not otherwise exempt under Subsection 4, shall be $14.00 per unit per fiscal year for the period beginning July 1, 2017, and shall increase by $1.00 per unit per fiscal year in every odd-numbered year thereafter. 
4)  Fee Exemptions. The following unit types, while subject to the requirements of Chapter 9.02, shall be exempt from the fee payment requirements of this Section: rentals with a recorded deed restriction requiring the units to be rented affordably to households at or below 50% of the Area Median Income; and rentals designated as senior or disabled housing by a public agency. Rentals under contract with a public agency that requires the rental to be inspected and verifies that the dwelling is rented to a low income household are exempt upon request of the property owner or their agent and after confirmation by city staff. 
5)  Fee Collection. The property owner is responsible for paying the annual fee. The information provided in the Rental Property Registry will be used for invoicing purposes. The Director shall maintain policies and procedures that include written or electronic communications with property owners or their agents before assessing a penalty. 
6)  Findings on Penalties. The City Council finds that it is in the best interest of the public for City staff to facilitate collaborative solutions to conflicts between landlords and tenants within the City of Corvallis and for City staff to provide education for these landlords and tenants with respect to their rights and responsibilities under City Ordinances and State law. The City Council finds that part of the costs for the City to provide this program are intended to be paid for by the annual fees, but the City Council does not desire this program to greatly increase the cost of renting residential property within the City. The City Council finds that an artificially lower annual fee that encourages timely payment is more likely to provide reliable funding that somewhat offsets the costs of this essential program than is a higher fee which could spread the actual administrative costs of enforcement and collection across all of the annual fee payers, but could require more enforcement. The City Council has balanced raising the amount of the annual fee to completely pay the cost of the program against the desire for landlords to pay the annual fee in a timely manner. The City finds that the staff charged with administration of this program spend a grossly disproportionate portion of their time attempting to collect fees or to collect late fees from a relatively few property owners or their agents. The City Council finds that if the City assessed relatively low penalties for failing to pay the annual fee or for failing to pay the annual fee in a timely manner, the lower penalty would encourage some property owners or agents to fail to pay fees or to pay late fees. The City Council finds that relatively low penalties for failing to pay the annual fee or for late payment of the fee would therefore unfairly require other landlords, property owners, agents, and property taxpayers at large to pay for the cost of this service and to subsidize the additional administration and cost required by the failure of these relatively few landlords, property owners or their agents to pay the required fees. The City Council concludes that low penalties would threaten the City's ability to provide the service for the low annual fee. Accordingly, the Council finds that the amounts of the penalties established in this Chapter are calculated to recover all of the real administrative costs of collection and enforcement of this Chapter without requiring people who comply with the requirements of this Chapter to subsidize these few violators. 
Failure to report a residential rental property or to pay the program fee will result in a penalty fee. 
7)  Penalties. 
(a)  Failure to report a residential rental property. Rental properties not registered with the City of Corvallis by July 1, 2018, and on an ongoing basis thereafter, will incur a civil penalty fee per unit, which shall be assessed to the property owner as such units are confirmed by the City. The amount of the penalty fee shall be based on the City Manager's fee schedule. 
(b)  Failure to pay the annual program fee. Failure to pay the annual program fee by the date specified in the invoice or statement will result in a civil penalty fee per unit assessed to the property owner. The amount of the penalty fee shall be based on the City Manager's fee schedule. 
(c)  The City will initiate appropriate action to collect the fees due and all costs associated with these actions will be assessed to the property owner. Appropriate action may include sending the account to a collection agency for action or placing a lien on the subject property.

The City Manager or person designated by the City Manager is authorized to issue a citation or written notice of violation to any person violating the provisions herein. In addition: 
1)  Any operator of a sidewalk café operating without a valid permit for the year shall be notified by the City that it is in violation of Section 8.08.020, and will be allowed up to ten business days to file an application. 
a)  If no application is filed within 10-days, the operator of the café shall be notified of continued operation in violation and a civil penalty of $500 per day shall be levied on the operator.

6)  Rules of conduct for hearing and final order. The Municipal Judge shall develop any rules, procedures or regulations that may be necessary for the proper conduct of the appeal. The only issue to be decided by the Municipal Judge is a determination of whether or not the café was in violation of CMC 8.08.120(1) or (2) as alleged in the notice of penalty. If the Municipal Judge finds that it is more likely than not that the café was in violation as specified in the notice of penalty, the Municipal Judge shall issue an order affirming the levy of penalty and enter a judgment for the amount of the levy of penalty into the register of the Municipal Court. The order and judgment shall contain a provision for court costs to be paid by the violator in the amount of $250. If the Judge finds that it is more likely than not that the café was in compliance and not in violation as specified in the notice of penalty, the Judge shall void the notice of penalty. The Judge's order is final and is not subject to appeal. It shall not be a defense that the café owner or operator did not receive notice of the penalty if mailed to the address of the café or delivered to an employee of the café. It shall not be a defense that the café owner or operator was not aware of the permit requirements. The Judge may not reduce or suspend any portion of the amount of the levy of penalty if the Judge finds that it is more likely than not that the café was in violation as specified in the notice of penalty. 
7)  Failure to pay levy of penalty. Unless the full amount of the levy of penalty is paid within ten days after notice of penalty or the order becomes final by operation of law, or after appeal, each day that the penalty is not paid shall constitute a further violation.

Section 8.09.010 - Purpose. 
    This Chapter regulates business activities that the Council finds present an extraordinary risk of being used as a means of concealing criminal behavior involving the theft of property.

The Council finds that the regulations provided herein are necessary, and the need for the regulations outweighs any anti-competitive effect that may result from their adoption.

If the Judge finds that it is more likely than not that the property owner was in compliance and not in violation as specified in the notice of penalty, the Judge shall void the notice of penalty.

It shall not be a defense that the property owner did not receive notice of the penalty if mailed to the address of the property owner, as obtain from Benton County Assessor's records or an application for permit. It shall not be a defense that the property owner was not aware of the permit requirements. The Judge may not reduce or suspend any portion of the amount of the levy of penalty if the Judge finds that it is more likely than not that the property owner was in violation as specified in the notice of penalty. 
7)  Failure to pay levy of penalty. Unless the full amount of the levy of penalty is paid within ten (10) days after notice of penalty or the order becomes final by operation of law, or after appeal, each day that the penalty is not paid shall constitute a further violation.

1)  In addition to, and not in lieu of, any other enforcement mechanism authorized by this code, upon a determination by the building official that a person has violated a provision of this chapter or a rule adopted thereunder, the building official may impose upon the violator and/or any other responsible person an administrative civil penalty as provided by subsections (1) to (12) of this section. For purposes of this subsection, a responsible person includes the violator, and if the violator is not the owner of the building or property at which the violation occurs, may include the owner as well. 
2)  Prior to imposing an administrative civil penalty under this section, the building official shall pursue reasonable attempts to secure voluntary correction, failing which the building official may issue a notice of civil violation to one or more of the responsible persons to correct the violation. Except where the building official determines that the violation poses an immediate threat to health, safety, environment, or public welfare, the time for correction shall be not less than 5 calendar days. 
3)  Following the date or time by which the correction must be completed as required by an order to correct a violation, the building official shall determine whether such correction has been completed. If the required correction has not been completed by the date or time specified in the order, the building official may impose a civil penalty on each person to whom an order to correct was issued. 
4)  Notwithstanding subsection (2) above, the building official may impose a civil penalty without having issued an order to correct violation or made attempts to secure voluntary correction where the building official determines that the violation was knowing or intentional or a repeat of a similar violation. 
5)  In imposing a penalty authorized by this section, the building official shall consider: 
a)  The person's past history in taking all feasible steps or procedures necessary or appropriate to correct the violation; 
b)  Any prior violations of statutes, rules, orders, and permits; 
c)  The gravity and magnitude of the violation; 
d)  Whether the violation was repeated or continuous; 
e)  Whether the cause of the violation was an unavoidable accident, negligence, or an intentional act; 
f)  The violator's cooperativeness and efforts to correct the violation; and 
g)  Any relevant rule of the building code or the City code. 
6)  The notice of civil penalty shall either be served by personal service or shall be sent by registered or certified mail and by first class mail. Any such notice served by mail shall be deemed received for purposes of any time computations hereunder 3 days after the date mailed if to an address within this state, and 7 days after the date mailed if to an address outside this state. A notice of civil penalty shall include: 
a)  Reference to the particular code provision or rule involved; 
b)  A short and plain statement of the matters asserted or charged; 
c)  A statement of the amount of the penalty or penalties imposed; 
d)  The date on which the order to correct was issued and time by which correction was to be made, or if the penalty is imposed pursuant to subsection (4), a short and plain statement of the basis for concluding that the violation was knowing, intentional, or repeated; and 
e)  A statement of the party's right to appeal the civil penalty to the City Manager or designee. 
7)  Any person who is issued a notice of civil penalty may appeal the penalty to the City Manager or designee. The City Manager's designee shall not be the building official or building inspector. The provisions of Section 9.01.210.020 of this code shall govern any requested hearing, except that the burden of proof shall be on the building official. 
8)  A civil penalty imposed hereunder shall become final upon expiration of the time for filing an appeal, unless the responsible person appeals the penalty to the City Manager or designee pursuant to, and within the time limits established by, Section 9.01.210.020. If the responsible person appeals the civil penalty to the City Manager or designee, the penalty shall become final, if at all; upon issuance of the City Manager or designee's decision affirming the imposition of the administrative civil penalty. 
9)  Each day the violator fails to remedy the code violation shall constitute a separate violation. 
10)  Failure to pay a penalty imposed hereunder within 10 days after the penalty becomes final as provided in subsection (8) shall constitute a violation of this code. Each day the penalty is not paid shall constitute a separate violation. The building official also is authorized to collect the penalty by any administrative or judicial action or proceeding authorized by subsection (11) below, other provisions of this code, or state statutes. The civil administrative penalty authorized by this section shall be in addition to: 
a)  Assessments or fees for any costs incurred by the City in remediation, cleanup, or abatement; and 
b)  Any other actions authorized by law. 
11)  If an administrative civil penalty is imposed on a responsible person because of a violation of any provision of this code resulting from prohibited use or activity on real property, and the penalty remains unpaid 30 days after such penalty become final, the building official shall assess the property the full amount of the unpaid fine and shall enter such an assessment as a lien in the municipal lien docket. At the time such an assessment is made, the building official shall notify the responsible person that the penalty has been assessed against the real property upon which the violation occurred and has been entered in the municipal lien docket.

a)  The name and address of the appellant; 
b)  The nature of the determination being appealed; 
c)  The reason the determination is incorrect; and 
d)  What the correct determination of the appeal should be. 
    An appellant who fails to file such a statement within the time permitted waives the objections, and the appeal shall be dismissed. Except as provided in subsection (5) of this section, the appeal fee is not refundable. 
2)  If a notice of revocation of a license or permit is the subject of the appeal, the revocation does not take effect until final determination of the appeal. Notwithstanding this paragraph, an emergency suspension shall take effect upon issuance of, or such other time stated in, the notice of suspension. 
3)  Unless the appellant and the City agree to a longer period, an appeal shall be heard by the City Manager or designee within 30 days of the receipt of the notice of intent to appeal. At least 10 days prior to the hearing, the City shall mail notice of the time and location thereof to the appellant.

At the hearing, the appellant may present testimony and oral argument personally or by counsel. The rules of evidence as used by courts of law do not apply. 
5)  The City Manager or designee shall issue a written decision within 10 days of the hearing date. The decision of the City Manager or designee after the hearing is final and may include a determination that the appeal fee be refunded to the applicant upon a finding by the City Manager or designee that the appeal was not frivolous.

Section 9.01.220 - Lien. 
1)  There shall be a lien created and it shall be done in accordance with this Section. 
2)  Any fine, assessment or civil penalty imposed pursuant to Chapter 9 of the Uniform Code for the Abatement of Dangerous Buildings as adopted by Section 9.01.170.010, or any administrative civil penalty imposed under the terms of Chapter 9 of the Municipal Code, which remains unpaid 30 days after the penalty is imposed (or after the fine, assessment or civil penalty has been affirmed on appeal), shall be filed as a lien against the lot, lots or parcels of land involved in the Municipal Lien Docket. At the time of filing in the Municipal Lien Docket, notice shall be provided to the responsible person. If the responsible person is not the owner of the property shown in the electronic records of the Benton County Assessor on that date, then notice shall also be sent to the owner of the property. Failure to provide notice shall not in any way effect the validity of the lien. The notice shall state that the amounts imposed as penalties shall be payable and due, and that the penalties shall be liens against the lots or parcels of land involved, respectively. All such liens remaining unpaid after 30 days from the date of recording on the municipal lien docket shall become delinquent and shall bear interest at the rate of 10 percent per annum from and after that date. The liens shall be enforced in the manner provided in ORS Chapter 223 and shall have priority over all such other liens and encumbrances of any character. Pursuant to Chapter 9 of the Uniform Code for the Abatement of Dangerous Buildings as adopted by Section 9.01.170.010 of this chapter, and 9.01.210 of this chapter, the City Council, as the legislative body of the City, elects to treat costs associated with the abatement of dangerous buildings, and any fine, assessment or administrative civil penalties, as a routine obligation of property owners. Therefore, any municipal costs incurred in the abatement of any dangerous building and/or any fine, assessment or administrative civil penalty not paid within 30 days shall be an assessment and lien against the property where the building is located.

Chapter 10.03 - RECORDING OF EASEMENTS 

Section 10.03.010 - Purpose. 
    The City routinely receives easements and right-of-way deeds for a variety of reasons which must be accepted by the City before they can be recorded. Often acceptance by Council is delayed because of infrequency of meetings which delays the public recording of these deeds and easements. A delay in the recording of an easement can result in the property being sold without knowledge of the easement, which is detrimental to all parties. For these reasons, Council adopts this Chapter.

2)  All easements for utilities, sidewalks, slopes, etc. secured for approved assessment districts. 
3)  All right-of-way deeds secured as a result of an approved subdivision, planned development, zone change or assessment district. 
4)  Routine easements or right-of-way deeds shall not include any which are secured at a cost or for special considerations from the City. Deeds secured as a part of a minor or major land partition shall not be considered routine.

All applicable contract issues shall be resolved before activities are terminated. In the event of early termination, funds remaining from assessments for the district, following payment of all obligations and costs of administration incurred on behalf of the district, shall be returned to the owners of subject properties in amounts proportionate to the amounts of the assessments paid by those owners. In the event of early termination of only a part of the activities of the district, the Council may elect to apply remaining funds on a proportionate basis as a credit against future assessments for the district, with any remaining funds being returned to the property owners as otherwise provided herein.

Section 10.09.020. - Required legislative determinations and findings. 
    As required by ORS 457.095, the City Council makes the following legislative determinations and findings: 
1)  The process for the adoption of the Plan, has been conducted in accordance with the applicable provisions of Chapter 457 of the Oregon Revised Statutes and all other applicable legal requirements; 
2)  The area designated in the Plan as the South Corvallis Urban Renewal Area ("Area") is blighted, as defined by ORS 457.010(1) and is eligible for inclusion within the Plan because of conditions described in the Report in the Section "Existing Physical, Social, and Economic Conditions and Impacts on Municipal Services", including the existence of inadequate streets and other rights of way, open spaces and utilities and underdevelopment of property within the Area (ORS 457.010(1)(e) and (g); 
3)  The rehabilitation and redevelopment described in the Plan to be undertaken by the Agency is necessary to protect the public health, safety or welfare of the City because absent the completion of urban renewal projects, the Area will fail to contribute its fair share of property tax revenues to support City services and will fail to develop and/or redevelop according the goals of the City's Comprehensive Plan; 
4)  The Plan conforms to the Corvallis Comprehensive Plan and provides an outline for accomplishing the projects described in the Plan, as more fully described in Section XII of the Plan and in the Corvallis Planning Commission determination of compliance with the Comprehensive Plan; 
5)  The Plan conforms to the Corvallis Economic Development Plan as more fully described in Section XII of the Plan; 
6)  No residential displacement will occur as a result of the acquisition and disposition of land and redevelopment activities proposed in the Plan and therefore the Plan does not include provisions to house displaced persons; 
7)  The Plan authorizes Agency acquisition of any interest in property within the Area that the Agency finds is necessary for private redevelopment, but only in those cases where the property owner wishes to convey such interest to the Agency; and 
8)  Adoption and carrying out the Plan is economically sound and feasible in that eligible projects and activities will be funded by urban renewal tax revenues derived from a division of taxes pursuant to section 1c, Article IX of the Oregon Constitution and ORS 457.440 and other available funding as more fully described in the Sections III, IV, V, VI VII and VIII of the Report; 
(Ord. 2018-26 , § 2(Exh. A), 10/15/2018) 
Section 10.09.030. - Plan implementation. 
    The City shall assume and complete any activities prescribed in the Plan. 
(Ord. 2018-26 , § 2(Exh. A), 10/15/2018)

(Ord. 2018-26 , § 2(Exh. A), 10/15/2018) 
Section 10.09.050. - Maximum indebtedness. 
    Maximum indebtedness is the total amount of money that can be spent on projects, programs and administration throughout the life of the South Corvallis Urban Renewal Plan. This amount is the principal of such indebtedness and does not include interest or indebtedness incurred to refund or refinance existing indebtedness, or interest earned on bond proceeds. It does include initial bond financing fees and interest earned on tax increment proceeds, separate from interest on bond proceeds. 
1)  The maximum amount of indebtedness is $62,377,000 (Sixty-Two Million Three Hundred Seventy-Seven Thousand).

as described in Ordinance No. 1980-100 (repealed by Ordinance 1993-20). Major amendments to the 1980 LDC
include:

designee, as applicable, under one of the following classifications:
a. Type I - Violations which represent a serious threat to public health,
safety, and welfare, or those unapproved actions deemed potentially to
create serious adverse environmental or land use consequences as the
result of continued development activity; or
b. Type II - Violations which do not pose a serious threat to public health,
safety, and welfare, but do violate provisions of this Code, including any
Conditions of Approval, as described in Section 1.3.60 above.
1.3.60.02 - Notice of Violation
a. Type I - After receiving a report of an alleged Type I violation, the Director
or Floodplain Administrator or designee, as applicable, will determine
whether the violation requires that a citation be issued immediately or
whether to provide notice of the violation prior to the issuance of a citation.
Notice shall be in writing and shall be provided to the owner of record for
tax purposes or to the person in charge of the property. Such a notice
shall indicate the following:
1. Location and nature of the violation; and
2. Provision or provisions of this Code or Conditions of Approval
which allegedly have been violated; and
3. Whether immediate enforcement will be sought or if a specified
time period will be allowed to correct or remove the violation.
b. Type II - After receiving a report of an alleged Type II violation from the
Director or Floodplain Administrator or designee, as applicable, the City
Attorney shall, if he/she determines that probable cause exists, promptly
give notice of the alleged violation by certified first-class mail, return
receipt requested, or by personal service to the owner of record for tax
purposes and to the person in charge of the property. Such a notice shall
indicate the following:

be allowed to correct or remove the violation; and
4. The date when the notice was personally served or, if the notice
was sent by first-class mail, the date three days after mailing if the
address to which it was mailed is within this state and seven days
after mailing if the address to which it was mailed is outside this
State. However, a defect in the notice of violation with respect to
this notice delivery provision shall not prevent enforcement of this
Code.
1.3.60.03 - City Attorney to Pursue Enforcement
When the compliance deadline expires, the City Attorney shall proceed with any
legal or equitable action deemed appropriate unless:
a. It has been demonstrated to the City Attorney that the violation has been

b. A court of competent jurisdiction has halted enforcement pending the
outcome of a proceeding concerning the violation.
1.3.60.04 - Penalties
Code violations may be subject to criminal, civil, or other sanctions authorized
under ordinance of the City.
a. Criminal Penalties - Unless specified otherwise, every violation of the
terms of this Code is a Class A infraction, punishable by a fine of up to
$500.00. Each day such violation continues shall be considered a
separate offense. Sign Code violations are addressed in Chapter 4.7-
Sign Regulations.
b. Civil Penalties and Remedies - In addition to, or in lieu of, criminal
actions, a violation of this Code or a permit issued hereunder may be the
subject of a civil action in the nature of a debt or of any appropriate
remedy issuing from a court of competent jurisdiction, including mandatory
and prohibitory injunctions and orders of abatement. Sign Code violations
are addressed in Chapter 4.7- Sign Regulations.
1. The Director or Floodplain Administrator or designee, as applicable,
is authorized to impose a civil penalty of up to $1,000.00 for any
violation of this Code.
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 1.3  Enforcement Page 5 of 7
2. In imposing a penalty amount pursuant to the schedule authorized
by this section, the Director or Floodplain Administrator or
designee, as applicable, shall consider the following factors:
a) The history of the person incurring a penalty in taking all
feasible steps or procedures necessary or appropriate to
correct any violation;
b) Any prior violations of statutes, rules, orders, and permits
pertaining to development regulations;
c) The economic and financial conditions of the person
incurring a penalty;
d) The gravity and magnitude of the violation,
e) Whether the violation was repeated or continuous; and
f) Whether the cause of the violation was an unavoidable
accident, negligence, or an intentional act.
3. Imposition and enforcement of civil penalties is not an exclusive
remedy, but shall be in addition to any other procedures or
remedies provided by law. Imposition or payment of a civil penalty
under this section shall not bar any criminal proceeding authorized
under this ordinance.
4. A civil penalty shall be imposed under this section by issuance of a
notice of penalty. A civil penalty may be imposed for each 30 days
the condition continues. The notice of penalty shall be provided in
the manner as described under "5," below.
5. Any civil penalty imposed under this section shall become due and
payable when the notice of penalty is served upon the person
incurring the penalty. Service shall be by personal service or by
certified mail, return receipt requested, to the last known address of
the person incurring the penalty. The notice of penalty shall include
a:
a) Reference to the particular provision or law violated;
b) Statement of the matters asserted or charged;

required under "10," below, the penalty and any costs of
service and recording fees shall be recorded by the City
Recorder in the City Lien Docket and shall become a lien on
the property of the person incurring the penalty.
6. If the notice of penalty is returned to the City without service upon
the named person, the Director or Floodplain Administrator or
designee, as applicable, shall post a notice of penalty on the
premises where the violation has occurred. The notice shall be
posted so as to be visible from the public right-of-way and shall be
delivered to a person, if any, occupying the premises. The posted
notice shall be affixed to the premises and shall also indicate that
tampering or removal of the notice shall constitute a misdemeanor.
7. The person to whom the notice of penalty is issued shall have 20
days from the date of service of the notice in which to appeal the
penalty before the municipal judge, after which time the notice of
penalty becomes a final order. The appeal shall be as provided in
"8," and "9," below.
8. Any appeal shall be in writing and signed by the person against
whom the penalty has been assessed or the attorney for that
person. The appeal shall state the grounds of the appeal. The
appeal shall be accompanied by a deposit in the amount of the civil
penalty assessed and an appeal fee of $50.00. The appeal shall
be filed with the municipal court and served upon the City Attorney.
Failure to comply with these provisions shall result in the appeal's
dismissal.
9. The only issues to be decided by the municipal judge are
determinations of whether the condition of the property was as
alleged in the notice of penalty and if so, whether that condition
violated this Code. If the judge finds that the alleged condition
existed at the time and date specified on the notice of penalty, and
that the condition violated this Code, the municipal judge shall issue
an order affirming the penalty. The order shall contain a provision
for court costs to be paid by the violator in the amount of $100.00.
If the judge finds that the condition alleged in the notice of penalty
did not exist at the time and date specified on the notice, the
municipal judge shall void the notice of penalty. The order voiding
the notice of penalty shall provide for return of the deposit, including
the appeal fee. The judge's order is final.

Chapter 1.3  Enforcement Page 7 of 7
10. Unless the amount of penalty imposed under this Section is paid
within 10 days after the notice of penalty or the order becomes final
by operation of law or after appeal, the order shall constitute a lien
on the owner's subject property and shall be recorded in the City
Lien Docket. Where the service has been made by certified mail or
other means providing a receipt, the returned receipt shall be
attached to and made a part of the recorded order. The penalty
and any added costs imposed by the order become a lien upon the
real property. That lien shall have priority over all other liens and
encumbrances of any form. The lien shall accrue interest at the
rate applicable for municipal assessment liens from the date of
docketing until clearance. The lien may be foreclosed on and the
property sold as may be necessary to discharge the lien in the
manner specified in ORS 223.505 through 223.650, as amended.
11. Any lien for a civil penalty shall be released when the full amount
determined to be due has been paid to the City, the owner or
person making such payment shall receive a receipt stating that the
full amount of penalties, interest, recording fees, and service costs
have been paid, and that the lien is thereby released and the record
of the lien satisfied.

a. No person shall remove or tamper with a notice posted on property
pursuant to the provisions of this chapter unless authorized by the Director
or Floodplain Administrator or designee, as applicable.

CHAPTER 1.4
NONCONFORMING DEVELOPMENT
Section 1.4.10 - BACKGROUND
As used in the Code, Legal Nonconforming Development includes Legal Nonconforming
Structures and Legal Nonconforming Uses. A Legal Nonconforming Structure does not
fully comply with zoning provisions for setbacks, building height, and/or off-street
parking, or does not fully comply with some other standard of the zone. A Legal
Nonconforming Use is not permitted outright or has not received conditional approval in
the zone in which it exists, but was lawfully begun prior to its becoming nonconforming.
Within the development zones established by this Code, development may exist that
was lawful at the time it began, but would be nonconforming and prohibited in the future
under the terms of this Code or future amendments.
In order to avoid undue hardship to developers, nothing in this Code shall be deemed to
require a change in the plans, construction, or designated use of any building on which
actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this Code and upon which actual building construction has been carried
out diligently. Construction is considered to have started if excavation, demolition, or
removal of an existing building has begun in preparation for rebuilding, and a Building
Permit has been acquired, prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment of this
Code.
[Section 1.4.10 amended by Ordinance 2012-18, effective December 13, 2012]
Section 1.4.20 - PURPOSES
a. Permit Legal Nonconforming Development to continue, but not to encourage its
perpetuation.
b. Ultimately bring development into conformance with this Code and the Comprehensive
Plan.
[Section 1.4.20 amended by Ordinance 2012-18, effective December 13, 2012]
Section 1.4.30  LEGAL NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES
1.4.30.01 - Alteration of a Legal Nonconforming Structure
Where the use of a structure is permitted by the applicable zone but the structure
is legally nonconforming, an alteration, expansion, or relocation may be
Ministerially approved if the improvement, evaluated separately from the existing
structure, would be in compliance, and is not within a Vision Clearance Area as
defined in Chapter 1.6 - Definitions, and/or as determined by the City Engineer.
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 1.4  Nonconforming Development Page 2 of 5
For structures in existence prior to December 31, 2006, reconstruction of
structures (both residential and nonresidential) may occur consistent with how
the structures previously existed in their legal nonconforming state, except for
the following:
a. Any Substantial Improvement to a Legal Nonconforming Structure located
within the 100-year Floodplain shall conform to the provisions of Chapter
2.11 - Floodplain Development Permit and Chapter 4.5 - Floodplain
Provisions and shall be accompanied by bringing the entire structure into
conformance with those provisions. These requirements apply to all Legal
Nonconforming Structures within the 100-year Floodplain, regardless of
when the structure(s) was originally constructed, and irrespective of any
prior improvements to the Legal Nonconforming Structures; and
b. Where a structure is designated as Designated Historic Resource, any
alteration, expansion, enlargement, extension, reconstruction, relocation,
or demolition shall be consistent with the provisions in Chapter 2.9 -
Historic Preservation Provisions.
1.4.30.02 - Damage to a Nonconforming Structure within the 100-Year
Flood Plain
If a Nonconforming Structure within the 100-year Floodplain is Substantially
Damaged, then the provisions of Chapter 2.11 - Floodplain Development Permit
and Chapter 4.5 - Floodplain Provisions apply and shall be accompanied by
bringing the entire structure into conformance with those provisions. These
provisions apply to all Nonconforming Structures within the 100-year Floodplain,
regardless of when the structure(s) was originally constructed, and irrespective of
any prior damage to the Nonconforming Structures. See Chapter 1.6 -
Definitions for a definition of Substantial Damage.

Section 1.4.40  LEGAL NONCONFORMING USES
1.4.40.01 - Alterations of a Legal Nonconforming Use
No building, structure, or land area devoted to a Legal Nonconforming Use shall
be expanded. Reconstruction, relocation, or structural alteration shall conform to
the provisions of this Code. Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed as
prohibiting normal repair, maintenance, and nonstructural alterations to such
development, nor the alteration, strengthening, or restoration to safe condition as
may be required by law.
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 1.4  Nonconforming Development Page 3 of 5

on a site, its Use Type may continue to exist, provided it is in accordance with the
provisions of this Code.
1.4.40.03 - Discontinuance of a Legal Nonconforming Use
Whenever a Legal Nonconforming Use is discontinued for more than 18 months,
further use shall conform with the provisions of this Code. For purposes of this
Code, rental payments or lease payments and taxes shall not be considered a
continued use. Discontinued shall mean non-use and shall not require a
determination of the voluntary or involuntary nature of the discontinuance or the
intent to resume the Legal Nonconforming Use.
1.4.40.04 - Damage to a Legal Nonconforming Use
If a structure containing a Legal Nonconforming Use is Substantially Damaged,
any future development on the site shall use a Use Type conforming to those
allowed within the applicable zone in which it is located. See Chapter 1.6 -
Definitions for a definition of Substantial Damage.
1.4.40.05 - Reclassification to Conditional Development
Whenever a Legal Nonconforming Use is permitted conditionally, it shall be
reclassified as conforming upon receipt of an approved Conditional Development
application in accordance with Chapter 2.3 - Conditional Development.

Setback, where:
AS = Average Setback
y = Percent of wall length at a particular distance from property line
SD = Setback Distance (actual distance from the property line)
Figure 1.6-2  Average Setback
Example: Average Setback = 40.34 ft.
y1 = 40 ft. ÷ 82 ft. = 0.4878% = 49%
SD1 = 30 ft.
y2 = 16 ft. ÷ 82 ft. = 0.1951% = 19%
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 1.6 - Definitions Page 5 of 80
SD2 = 44 ft.
y3 = 26 ft. ÷ 82 ft. = 0.3171% = 32%
SD3 = 54 ft.
(0.4878 X 30) + (0.1951 X 44) + (0.3171 X 54) = 40.34 ft. Average Setback

Section 1.2.110.03 - Special Development and Chapter 2.1 - Comprehensive Plan Amendment
Procedures.
Conceptual Development Plan - Land use process that is a type of Conditional Development
and that provides a mechanism for achieving greater flexibility and improved design where the
scope of the proposed modifications to this Code's pre-stated standards exceeds that permitted
through Chapter 2.12 - Lot Development Option. This type of land development project is
comprehensively planned as an entity via a unified site plan. Often it is proposed to allow for
better preservation of Significant Natural Features and/or for innovation in site planning and
architectural design. Approval requires compensating benefits that off-set the requested
development standard modifications. The request must be followed by or processed
concurrently with a Detailed Development Plan and the issuance of Building Permits is withheld
until a Detailed Development Plan is approved. Procedures for this type of land use application
are outlined in Section 1.2.110.03 - Special Development, Chapter 2.5 - Planned Development,
and Section 2.5.40 - Conceptual Development Plan Review Procedures.
Conditional Development - Land use process that provides an opportunity to allow a use when
potential adverse effects can be mitigated or deny a use if concerns cannot be resolved to the
satisfaction of the hearing authority. Procedures for this type of land use application are
outlined in Section 1.2.110.03 - Special Development and Chapter 2.3 - Conditional
Development.
Conditional Development Modification - Land use process that provides an opportunity to
allow a limited amount of flexibility with regard to site planning and architectural design for a
previously approved Conditional Development and provides benefits within the development
site that compensate for requested variations from approved Conditional Development such
that the intent of the original approval is still met. Procedures for this type of land use
application are outlined in Section 1.2.110.02 - General Development and Section 2.3.40 -
Conditional Development Modification.
Conditions of Approval - Requirements placed on a development for a number of purposes,
which include but are not limited to:

d. Bringing the development into compliance with applicable criteria and regulations,
including but not limited to Comprehensive Plan Policies and/or this Code's standards;
e. Helping to assure that negative impacts of a development are mitigated up front,
particularly in the case of Conditional Development approvals; and
f. Assisting applicants by identifying some of the requirements that will affect subsequent
related application requests such as Final Plats, Building Permits, construction permits,
Public Improvement by Private Contract (PIPC) Permits, etc.

Density - Number of dwelling units per acre of land, calculated in accordance with the
definition for Density Calculation.
2 Harris, Cyril M. Dictionary of Architecture and Construction, Fourth Edition 2006
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 1.6 - Definitions Page 16 of 80
Density Calculation -
a. Density, Gross - Number of dwelling units per gross area, in acres. See definition for
Area, Gross.
b. Density, Net - Number of dwelling units per net area, in acres. See definition for Area,
Net.
c. Maximum Density -
As specified in Chapter 2.14, in relation to Minor Partitions, Minor Replats, and Property
Line Adjustments, and also in conjunction with development proposals on existing
properties, maximum density is determined based on the Minimum Lot Size
requirements established within a Zone. For each proposed dwelling unit, the subject
property must contain at least the Minimum Lot Size specified within the Zone.
As specified in Chapter 2.4, in relation to Subdivisions and Major Replats, maximum
density is determined based on the Gross Density of the proposed development.
Consequently, resultant lot sizes may be less than the Minimum Lot Size otherwise
specified in a zone. When a fractional result is equal to or greater than 0.5, an additional
dwelling unit shall be allowed, but shall not be allowed when a fractional result is less
than 0.5. The formula will be as follows:
Gross Area (expressed in acres) X Maximum Density per Acre established for the
Zone = Maximum Density
d. Minimum Density - Minimum Density shall be calculated based on the Net Area within a
development site, per the definition of Area, Net in this Chapter. The formula shall be as
follows:
Net Area (expressed in acres) X Minimum Density per Acre established for the
Zone = Minimum Density
Fractional results from this calculation shall be treated as follows:
When the sum of the dwelling units is a fraction of a dwelling unit, the following
adjustments to the Density Calculation apply:
1. Development occurring on properties within the established City Limits on or
before January 1, 1950 (see Figure 1.6-12): When the fraction is equal to or
greater than 0.5, an additional dwelling unit is allowed, but not required. If the
fraction is less than 0.5, an additional dwelling unit shall not be allowed.
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 1.6 - Definitions Page 17 of 80
2. In All Other Areas: When the sum of the dwelling units is a fraction of a dwelling
unit, and the fraction is equal to or greater than 0.5, an additional dwelling unit
shall be required (minimum density). If the fraction is less than 0.5, an additional
dwelling unit shall not be required (minimum density).
Density Transfer - Permits residential density under a single development application to be
shifted from one part of a development site and added to another part of the same site. It can
be used to protect Significant Natural Features that are on the development site without losing
overall density in the development. Density transfer does not permit an increase in the gross
density for the entire development site.
Dentil - See Figure 1.6-13 - Dentils. One of a band of small, square, tooth-like blocks forming
part of the characteristic ornamentation of the Iconic, Corinthian, and Composite orders, and
sometimes Doric.

Dentils in classical architecture.
b. Course of masonry that resembles a row of
Dentils; for example, in brickwork, the toothlike
effect produced by the projection of
alternate headers and smaller blocks.3
Designated Historic Resource - Historic resource that has been determined through an official
action to meet criteria for Historic Significance, resulting in the resource being Locallydesignated
and/or Nationally-designated, as more specifically defined below. Chapter 2.9 -
Historic Preservation Provisions applies to all Designated Historic Resources, regardless of
whether they are Locally- or Nationally-designated. Some Designated Historic Resources are
listed in both the Local Register and the National Register of Historic Places.
a. Locally-designated - Locally-designated Historic Resource is listed in the Corvallis
Register of Historic Landmarks and Districts (Local Register). To list a property in the
Local Register, a property owner must obtain approval for a Zone Change to apply a
Historic Preservation Overlay to the subject property. A Historic Preservation Overlay
denotes the Locally-designated Historic Resource on the City's Zoning Map. Property
owner approval for local designation is required.
b. Nationally-designated - Nationally-designated Historic Resource is listed in the National
Register of Historic Places. To list a property in the National Register of Historic Places,
approval must be obtained in accordance with state and federal processes and criteria
listed in 36 CFR 60. Local level input regarding a proposed National Register of Historic
Places nomination normally is solicited; however, official local action does not occur.
Because Nationally-designated Historic Resources are subject to the Historic
Preservation Provisions of Chapter 2.9, a notation indicating that a property is listed in
the National Register of Historic Places is included on the City's Zoning Map.
DSL - Oregon Department of State Lands.
Detailed Development Plan - Land use process that is a type of Conditional Development and
that provides a mechanism for achieving greater flexibility and improved design where the

scope of the proposed modifications to this Code's pre-stated standards exceeds that permitted
through Chapter 2.12 - Lot Development Option. This type of land development project is
comprehensively planned as an entity via a unified site plan and must be based on a previously
or concurrently approved Conceptual Development Plan. Such Plans are often proposed to
allow for better preservation of Significant Natural Features and/or for innovation in site
planning and architectural design. Approval requires compensating benefits that off-set the
requested modifications to development standards. A Detailed Development Plan provides
sufficient information for the issuance of building permits. Procedures for this type of land use
application are outlined in Section 1.2.110.03 - Special Development, Chapter 2.5 - Planned
Development, and Section 2.5.50 - Detailed Development Plan Review Procedures.
Detention Basin - Constructed pond and/or underground facility that is designed to temporarily
collect runoff from a development to maintain the runoff rate to a specified pre-development
flow.

of developing or the result of development. For the definition of Development as applied to
the 100-year Floodplain regulations contained in Chapter 2.11 - Floodplain Development Permit
and Chapter 4.5 - Floodplain Provisions, please see Section 1.6.40, below.
Development Constraints - Conditions that limit or preclude development of an area or site
such as location within: a Natural Hazard on the Natural Hazards Map; a Riparian Corridor or
Wetlands on the Riparian Corridors and Wetlands Map; an area of Significant Vegetation on the
Significant Vegetation Map; a 4th-level water service area (not served by City water); and/or an
area that is permanently preserved via a conservation easement or a drainageway
easement/dedication.
Development Constraints - Former - Development Constraints that no longer preclude
development due to the application of the Minimum Assured Development Area (MADA)
provisions. A formerly constrained area is one which would be protected through the
Development Constraints in Chapters 4.5, 4.11, 4.12, 4.13, or 4.14, but can be developed by
applying the MADA provisions in Chapter 4.11. Development can occur on the site and the
constraining factors such as significant vegetation, etc. may be removed or reduced to
accommodate the development. However, for MADA development in Floodway Fringe Areas,
there are default standards required and they are the Partial Protection Floodplain Provisions.
See Section 4.5.20.03 and Formerly Constrained Areas.
Development, Intensity of - Relative measure of development impact as defined by
characteristics such as the number of dwelling units per acre, amount of traffic generated, and

the controlling land use planning instrument for the City and, as such, land development
regulations and related actions are required to conform with the Plan.
This chapter pertains to lands within the City limits. Those portions of the
Comprehensive Plan that apply to areas outside the City limits but within the Urban
Growth Boundary shall be amended in accordance with the provisions of the Corvallis
Urban Fringe Management Agreement.
Section 2.1.20 - PURPOSES
This Chapter describes the review criteria and procedural requirements to accomplish
the following:
a. Respond to changing conditions and community attitudes;
b. Ensure flexibility while maintaining the integrity of the Comprehensive Plan; and
c. Establish procedures by which the Plan text and map may be amended.
Section 2.1.30 - PROCEDURES
2.1.30.01 - Initiation
Comprehensive Plan Amendments shall be initiated by one of the following:
a. An application submitted by the property owners or their authorized

Chapter 2.2  Zone Changes Page 1 of 28
CHAPTER 2.2
ZONE CHANGES
Section 2.2.10 - BACKGROUND
The Official Zoning Map is consistent with the adopted Comprehensive Plan, as
amended, and as such is a reflection of the City's land use planning goals. The map has
also been adopted as part of this Code. Frequent and piecemeal amendments to the
Official Zoning Map can threaten the integrity of the Comprehensive Plan and the
likelihood of its successful implementation. Nevertheless, it may be necessary to amend
the Official Zoning Map from time to time to correct errors or to respond to changing
conditions or unforeseen circumstances, or to provide an incentive for the protection of
Natural Resources and Natural Hazards.
When a zone is amended, there often must be a corresponding change to the
Comprehensive Plan Map. There are, however, instances where more than one zone
corresponds to a site's Comprehensive Plan designation. In these situations, the zone
can be amended without a Comprehensive Plan Map Amendment. Table 2.2-1 -
Comprehensive Plan and Corresponding Zoning Map Designations, below illustrates
the relationship between the Comprehensive Plan and the Official Zoning Map
designations in the City.
Zone Changes are classified as legislative or quasi-judicial, depending on the number of
properties involved. While only the City Council makes legislative decisions regarding
Zone Changes, quasi-judicial decisions may be made by the:
a. Community Development Director in the case of Administrative Zone
Changes to:
1. Remove a Historic Preservation Overlay in cases where a public
hearing is not required. See Section 2.2.50;
2. Apply a Conservation - Open Space Zone on lands that meet one or
more of the conditions in Section 2.2.50.06.a; and
3. Remove a residential Planned Development Overlay as mandated by
the state. See Section 2.2.55.
b. Planning Commission;
c. Land Development Hearings Board;
d. Historic Resources Commission in the case of Zone Changes that require a
public hearing and involve the application or removal of a Historic
Preservation Overlay; and
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 2.2  Zone Changes Page 2 of 28
e. Upon appeal, by the City Council, depending on the nature of the
proposed Change.
When a Zone Change application is reviewed along with a Comprehensive Plan Map
Amendment or other land use application, the Planning Commission approves or denies
the request. However, when no other request is under consideration, the Zone Change
request is reviewed and approved or denied by the Land Development Hearings Board,
with the exception of Administrative Zone Changes described in "a," above, and with the
exception of Zone Change requests involving the application or removal of a Historic
Preservation Overlay in cases where a public hearing is required. The City Council
designates the Director as having the authority to make Administrative Zone Change
decisions and designates the Historic Resources Commission as having the authority to
make Zone Change decisions regarding the application or removal of a Historic
Preservation Overlay in cases where a public hearing is required.
[Section 2.2.10 amended by Ordinance 2018-27, effective November 5, 2018]
Section 2.2.20 - PURPOSES
This Chapter describes review criteria and procedural requirements for legislative and
quasi-judicial Official Zoning Map changes to accomplish the following:
a. Maintain sound, stable, and desirable development within the City;
b. Permit changes in zone boundaries where appropriate;
c. Ensure Zone Changes are consistent with the community's land use policies
and goals;
d. Lessen the influence of individual economic interests in the land use
decision- making process;
e. Establish procedures and criteria for applying Historic Preservation Overlays
to, or removing Historic Preservation Overlays from, Designated Historic
Resources; and
f. Establish procedures and criteria for reclassifying a Designated
Historic Resource in a National Register of Historic Places Historic
District.

Section 2.2.30 - LEGISLATIVE CHANGE PROCEDURES
A Zone Change is considered a legislative act if the change applies uniformly to all
properties in the City or to a sufficiently large number of properties as determined by
contemporary legal principles.
2.2.30.01- Initiation
a. A legislative Zone Change may be initiated by a majority vote of the
City Council or a majority vote of the Planning Commission upon
finding sufficient cause to initiate a change.
b. Property owners may petition the Planning Commission for a hearing
by submitting the following:
1. A petition representing a majority (over 50 percent) of
property owners within the area of the proposed Zone
Change; and
2. A description and map of the area to be affected and information
as may be necessary for an adequate review.
If the Planning Commission determines that there is sufficient
cause, it shall initiate the Zone Change in accordance with Chapter
2.0  Public Involvement.
c. Where a motion by either the City Council or Planning Commission
involves a Planned Development designation, the motion by either body
need not include a Conceptual or Detailed Development Plan.
However, residential Planned Development Overlays may not be
unilaterally initiated by the City Council or the Planning Commission.
See Chapter 3.33  Residential Planned Development Overlays.
2.2.30.02 - Staff Evaluation
City staff shall prepare a report that evaluates whether the proposal complies with
the review criteria in Section 2.2.30.03 below. The report should include a
recommendation for approval or denial.
2.2.30.03 - Review Criteria
Legislative Zone Changes shall be reviewed to determine how they affect City
facilities and services, and to ensure consistency with the policies of the
Comprehensive Plan, including compliance with the Transportation System Plan and
the Transportation Planning Rule, and any other applicable policies and standards
adopted by the City Council.
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 2.2  Zone Changes Page 6 of 28
2.2.30.04  Action by the Planning Commission
The Planning Commission shall conduct a public hearing in accordance with the
provisions of Chapter 2.0  Public Involvement. Following the close of the public
hearing, the Commission shall make a recommendation to the City Council
concerning the proposed Zone Change. The Commissions recommendation shall
include findings that specify how the proposal has or has not complied with the
above review criteria.
2.2.30.05  Action by the City Council
Upon receipt of the Planning Commissions recommendation, the City Council shall
set a public hearing in accordance with Chapter 2.0  Public Involvement. Following
the close of the public hearing, the City Council shall either deny the petition or
adopt an ordinance approving the proposed Zone Change or a modification thereof.
The City Councils decision shall include findings that specify how the proposal has
or has not complied with the above review criteria.
2.2.30.06 - Notice of Disposition
The Director shall provide a Notice of Disposition in accordance with Chapter 2.0
- Public Involvement that includes a written statement of the City Council's decision,
a reference to findings leading to it, and the appeal period deadline. A Notice of
Disposition shall also be mailed to persons who presented oral or written testimony
at the public hearing.
[Section 2.2.30 amended by Ordinance 2012-18, effective December 13, 2012; Sections 2.2.30.01,
2.2.30.04, 2.2.30.05, and 2.2.30.06 amended by Ordinance 2018-01, effective January 26, 2018; Section
2.2.30 amended by Ordinance 2018-36, effective January 1, 2019]
Section 2.2.40 - QUASI-JUDICIAL CHANGE PROCEDURES FOR ZONE
CHANGES SUBJECT TO A PUBLIC HEARING
a. Quasi-judicial Zone Changes - All Zone Changes not deemed legislative
shall be quasi-judicial. Administrative Zone Changes are quasi-judicial Zone
Changes that are not subject to a public hearing and are defined by and
subject to the provisions of Section 2.2.50. All other quasi-judicial Zone
Changes are subject to a public hearing and the provisions below.
b. Adding a Historic Preservation Overlay - A Zone Change process
involving a public hearing is required to add a Historic Preservation Overlay
to a historic resource. Establishment of a Historic Preservation Overlay
requires property owner concurrence and approval by the Historic Resources
Commission. Once a Historic Preservation Overlay is applied, the Historic
Resource is listed in the Local Register, is defined as a Designated Historic
Resource, and is subject to the City's Historic Preservation Provisions in
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 2.2  Zone Changes Page 7 of 28
Chapter 2.9 - Historic Preservation Provisions.
Historic Resources are listed in the National Register of Historic Places
consistent with state and federal processes and criteria. Official action at the
local level is not required as part of the National Register of Historic Places
designation process. However, if a property owner wishes to list a Nationallydesignated
Historic Resource in the Local Register, a Zone Change to add a
Historic Preservation Overlay is required. In all cases, a Nationallydesignated
Historic Resource also is defined as a Designated Historic
Resource and is subject to the City's Historic Preservation Provisions in
Chapter 2.9 - Historic Preservation Provisions, unless as otherwise specified
under state and federal law.
c. Removing a Historic Preservation Overlay - A Zone Change process
involving a public hearing is required to remove a Historic Preservation
Overlay from a Designated Historic Resource, with the single exception that
an Administrative Zone Change process shall be used to remove a Historic
Preservation Overlay under the circumstances outlined in Section 2.2.50.
Once a Historic Preservation Overlay is removed, the historic resource is
automatically removed from the Local Register, is no longer defined as a
Designated Historic Resource, and is no longer subject to the Historic
Preservation Provisions in Chapter 2.9 - Historic Preservation Provisions,
unless it is still Nationally-designated. If the Designated Historic Resource
remains Nationally-designated, it is still subject to Chapter 2.9 - Historic
Preservation Provisions, but is not listed in the Local Register and does not
show a Historic Preservation Overlay.
d. Decisions Regarding National Register of Historic Places De-listings -
Official action at the local level to de-list a National Register of Historic Places
Designated Historic Resource is not required. National Register of Historic
Places de-listings are state and federal issues. If a National Register of
Historic Places Designated Historic Resource is de-listed, and that Resource
is not also listed in the Local Register, the Resource shall no longer be defined
as a Designated Historic Resource and shall no longer be subject to the
Historic Preservation Provisions in Chapter 2.9 - Historic Preservation
Provisions. If a National Register of Historic Places Designated Historic
Resource is de-listed per state and federal procedures, but that Resource also
has a Historic Preservation Overlay and is, therefore, listed in the Local
Register, the Resource shall continue to be defined as a Designated Historic
Resource and shall continue to be subject to the Historic Preservation
Provisions in Chapter 2.9 - Historic Preservation Provisions, unless an
Administrative Zone Change removing the Historic Preservation Overlay is
approved per Section 2.2.50.
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 2.2  Zone Changes Page 8 of 28
2.2.40.01  Initiation
a. Initiation of a District Change that is quasi-judicial in nature may
be accomplished by one of the following ways:
1. Filing of an application by the owner(s) of the subject property(ies);
2. A majority vote of the City Council or Planning Commission.
However, for District Changes involving the application or
removal of a Historic Preservation Overlay, property owner
consent shall be required in accordance with state law. If the
historic resource is owned by more than one property owner,
the consent of all owners shall be required; or
3. District Changes involving the application or removal of a
Historic Preservation Overlay may also be initiated by the
Director. Property owner consent shall be required in
accordance with state law. If the historic resource is owned by
more than one property owner, the consent of all owners shall
be required.
b. Where a motion by either the City Council or Planning Commission
involves a Planned Development designation, the motion need not
include a Conceptual or Detailed Development Plan. However,
residential Planned Development Overlays may not be unilaterally
initiated by the City Council or the Planning Commission. See Chapter
3.33  Residential Planned Development Overlays.
2.2.40.02 - Application Requirements
When the Director deems any requirement below unnecessary for the proper
evaluation of a proposed application, it may be waived.
Prior to formal submittal of an application, the applicant is encouraged to
participate in an informal pre-application conference with Community
Development Department staff to discuss the proposal, the applicant's

d) The immediate setting of the historic resource retains
land uses, or landscaping and relationship with
associated structures, consistent with the Period of
Significance;
e) The historic resource contributes to the
architectural continuity of the street or
neighborhood;
f) The site is likely to contain artifacts related to prehistory
or early history of the community; or
g) The historic resource is now one of few remaining
prime examples of an architectural style or design, or
a type of construction that was once common.
2. Historic Significance or contribution to historic and
cultural resources of the community -
To meet this criteria, the applicant shall demonstrate that the
resource is 50 years old or older and that at least one of the
additional criteria listed below applies to it. Resources that are
less than 50 years old may be considered eligible for historic
designation if they are of exceptional importance, based on
National Register of Historic Places Criteria for Evaluation (36
CFR 60).
a) It is associated with events that have made a
significant contribution to the broad patterns of
political, economic, cultural, or industrial history of
the City, County, State or nation;
b) The resource is fundamentally related to the work,
achievements, or life story of a person, group,
organization, or institution that has made a significant
contribution to the City, County, State or nation;
c) It embodies distinctive characteristics of a type,
Period of Significance, or method of construction;
d) It may be a prime example of an architectural style or
design, or may represent a type of construction that
was once common and is now one of few remaining

a noteworthy example of the work of a craftsman,
builder, architect or engineer significant in City,
County, State, or national history;
f) It demonstrates high artistic values in its
workmanship or materials;
g) It yields or is likely to yield information important in
prehistory or history;
h) It is a visual landmark; or
i) It contributes to the continuity or the historic character of
the street, neighborhood, and/or community, or
contributes to the Historic Integrity of the Period of
Significance represented.
c. Review Criteria for Public Hearing Zone Changes to Remove a
Historic Preservation Overlay
1. Removal of the Historic Preservation Overlay shall not
adversely impact properties in the surrounding area or the
Historic Integrity of the affected Local Register Historic District, if
applicable.
2. At least one of the following has occurred since the
Historic Preservation Overlay was established -
a) A re-evaluation of the original Designated Historic Resource
determination, with the results being that, under current
criteria, the Resource is no longer considered Historically
Significant, and the change in the Historic Significance of
the Resource was not the result of action or inaction by the
property owner. The determination of Historic Significance
in this case shall be based on National Register of Historic
Places Criteria for Evaluation (36 CFR 60);
b) The Historic Integrity of the Resource has been substantially
reduced or diminished due to unavoidable circumstances
that were not a result of action or inaction by the property
owner; and/or
c) An evaluation of maintaining or removing the Historic
Preservation Overlay demonstrates that removing the
Overlay substantially outweighs maintaining the Overlay.
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 2.2  Zone Changes Page 18 of 28
d. Buildable Land Supply Factor
For Zone Change requests to a Conservation - Open Space (C-OS)
Zone on lands that are not located on lands already designated with a
Natural Resource and/or Natural Hazard Overlay, the applicant shall
demonstrate the following:
1. That the area requested for the Zone Change to C-OS is part of
a larger development site;
2. What the development potential is for the proposed C-OS land.
This development potential shall be calculated using the same
development per acre calculations specified in Tables 4.11-1
and 4.11-2 of Chapter 4.11 - Minimum Assured Development
Area (MADA); and
3. That the development potential associated with the proposed COS
land is transferred to other land that:
a) Will not be zoned C-OS;
b) Is located on the same development site; and
c) Is proposed for development concurrent with the Zone
Change request so that it can be verified that the transfer of
development potential is feasible.
2.2.40.06  Action by the Hearing Authority
The hearing authority shall conduct a public hearing in accordance with the
provisions of Chapter 2.0  Public Involvement. Following the close of the public
hearing, the hearing authority shall by motion either approve the proposed Zone
Change, or deny the petition. The hearing authoritys decision shall include findings
that specify how the application has or has not complied with the above review
criteria. If the request is to apply a Historic Preservation Overlay to a property, the
Historic Resources Commission also shall identify in its findings the specific historic
resource(s) that is Historically Significant and subject to future regulation under
Chapter 2.9  Historic Preservation Provisions.
2.2.40.07  Notice of Disposition
The Director shall provide the applicant with a Notice of Disposition in accordance
with Chapter 2.0  Public Involvement that includes a written statement of the
hearing authoritys decision, a reference to findings leading to it, and the appeal

CONDITIONAL DEVELOPMENT
Section 2.3.10 - BACKGROUND
Certain Use Types listed in each zone require a public hearing to determine how they
affect surrounding properties, neighborhoods, and the community as a whole. The
Conditional Development review process provides an opportunity to allow a Use when
potential adverse effects can be mitigated, or deny a Use if concerns cannot be
resolved to the satisfaction of the hearing authority. It is the intent of this Chapter to
permit Conditional Developments and Conditional Development Modifications
consistent with the Comprehensive Plan, subject to procedures and criteria intended to
mitigate potentially negative impacts.
Section 2.3.20 - PURPOSES
Procedures and review criteria for Conditional Developments are established for the
following purposes:
a. Permit certain types of public and private development that provide a community
service in locations related to their service areas;
b. Permit commercial development in locations related to its service area;
c. Ensure that Conditional Development is compatible with its immediate area and
the affected part of the community;

Chapter 2.4  Subdivisions and Major Replats Page 1 of 30
CHAPTER 2.4
SUBDIVISIONS AND MAJOR REPLATS
Section 2.4.10 - BACKGROUND
The division of land is the first step toward establishing a community's ultimate
development pattern. Land Divisions can occur through either a Subdivision,
Partition, or an Expedited Land Division procedure. A Subdivision procedure is used
when four or more units (generally called lots) of land are created in a calendar year.
Residential Subdivision applications are reviewed by the Director and do not go
through a public hearing, except upon appeal. Nonresidential Subdivision applications
are reviewed by the Planning Commission. For the purposes of this Chapter,
Residential Subdivisions are those involving lands with a Zoning Designation of RS-
1, RS-3.5, RS-5, RS-6, RS-9, RS-12, RS-20, and MUR. Nonresidential Subdivisions
are those with a Zoning Designation other than those for Residential Subdivisions.
Subdivision applications may include requests for Planned Developments to permit
greater flexibility in design. Procedural provisions for Planned Developments are
addressed in Chapter 2.5 - Planned Development.
A Partition procedure is used when three or fewer units (generally called parcels) are
created in a calendar year. Partitions may or may not involve creation of a street.
Partition applications are reviewed by the Director and do not go through a public
hearing, except upon appeal. Partitions, in addition to procedures for Minor Replats
and Property Line Adjustments, are addressed in Chapter 2.14 - Partitions, Minor
Replats, and Property Line Adjustments.
An Expedited Land Division procedure shall be used for any qualifying residential
project per ORS 197.360 through 197.380 unless the applicant requests in writing to
have the application reviewed according to the LDC Subdivision or Partition
procedures.
This Chapter presents the review process and plat requirements for Subdivisions and
Expedited Land Divisions involving the creation of four or more lots. Chapter 4.4 -
Land Division Standards discusses lot and street design requirements and therefore
must be reviewed in conjunction with this Chapter in creating and developing a
Subdivision.
Section 2.4.20 - PURPOSES
Land Division review procedures are established in this Chapter for the following
purposes:
a. Ensure that building sites are of sufficient size and appropriate design for
their intended uses and that lots to be created are within density ranges
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 2.4  Subdivisions and Major Replats Page 2 of 30
permitted by the Comprehensive Plan;
b. Minimize negative effects of development upon the natural environment
and incorporate natural features into the proposed development where
possible;
c. Ensure economical, safe, and efficient routes for pedestrians, bicycles, and
motor vehicles;
d. Create residential living environments that foster a sense of neighborhood
identity and that are protected from the adverse effects of heavy traffic and
more intensive land uses; and
e. Promote energy efficiency.
Section 2.4.30 - TENTATIVE PLAT REVIEW PROCEDURES
When an application is filed for a Subdivision, it shall be reviewed in accordance
with the following procedures.
2.4.30.01 - Application Requirements

that the intent of the original approval is still met.
2.4.80.02 - Thresholds Separating a Tentative Subdivision Plat Modification
from the Requirement for a New Tentative Subdivision Plat
Within one calendar year, up to three factors identified in "a," through "i,"
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 2.4  Subdivisions and Major Replats Page 28 of 30
below, which do not exceed the thresholds outlined in these provisions, may
be proposed for modification under this Section. If more than three such
factors are proposed for modification within a calendar year, or if modifications
are proposed that exceed the thresholds outlined in "a," through "i," below, the
changes shall be processed as a new Tentative Subdivision Plat and shall
follow the procedures outlined in Section 2.4.30.
No modifications to specific requirements established at the time of Tentative
Subdivision Plat approval, including Conditions of Approval, this Code's
requirements, and all aspects of the Tentative Subdivision Plat proposal, can
be made as a Tentative Subdivision Plat Modification, unless they are less
than the thresholds outlined in items "a," through "i," below. The thresholds
for a Tentative Subdivision Plat Modification are as follows:
a. Increase in the number of lots;
b. Decrease in the number of lots resulting in a decrease in dwelling unit
density by more than three units for development sites one acre or
smaller in size; or resulting in a decrease in dwelling unit density by
more than five units or more than 10 percent, whichever is less, for
development sites larger than one acre; in no case shall density fall
below the minimum density required for the zone;
c. Change in the ratio of different types of lots;
d. Change in lot pattern that would result in a less pedestrian-friendly
environment (e.g., a pedestrian walk is eliminated, a parking lot is
placed to separate, or further separate, a building from pedestrian
facilities, etc.);
e. Change in the type and location of accessways and parking areas
where off-site traffic would be affected or which result in a less
pedestrian- friendly environment;
f. Change in lot pattern that adversely affects Significant Natural Features
or pedestrian amenities, or is inconsistent with a condition of approval
or an applicable development standard, such as required Green Area;
g. Increase by more than 10 percent in the potential floor area
for nonresidential use;
h. Decrease by more than 10 percent in the common and/or usable
Green Area; and
i. Decrease by more than 10 percent in project amenities for
pedestrians and/or bicycles, recreational facilities, screening,
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 2.4  Subdivisions and Major Replats Page 29 of 30
and/or landscaping provisions.
2.4.80.03 - Procedures for a Tentative Subdivision Plat Modification
a. An applicant may petition for review of previously approved plans for
purposes of modifying a Tentative Subdivision Plat, stating reasons for
the changes.
b. Where the Director determines that the proposed changes qualify as a
Tentative Subdivision Plat Modification in accordance with the
thresholds outlined in Section 2.4.80.02, the Director shall
administratively process the application as a Tentative Subdivision Plat
Modification. The Tentative Subdivision Plat Modification may be
approved, conditionally approved, or denied by the Director. If the
proposed changes exceed the thresholds outlined in Section 2.4.80.02,
the changes shall be processed as a new Tentative Subdivision Plat
and the applicant shall follow the procedures outlined in Section 2.4.30.
c. In reviewing the proposed Modification, the Director shall follow the
procedures herein required for Tentative Subdivision Plat
Modification.
d. To determine whether to authorize a Tentative Subdivision Plat
Modification, the Director shall consider the review criteria in
Section
2.4.30.04 and the following additional review
criterion:
New elements are provided that functionally compensate for any
negative effects cause by the requested variations from the
original project design. New elements used to compensate for a
negative effect shall be of at least equal value to the elements
proposed to be changed. Applicants shall provide the Director
with information substantiating the value of the new elements in
comparison to the value of the elements to be changed. The
value information shall be developed by a qualified professional
in the field relevant to the elements being exchanged.
e. Upon finding that the application qualifies as a Tentative Subdivision
Plat Modification, the Director may consider the redesign in whole or
in part of any Tentative Subdivision Plat, to the extent that the
redesign still falls within the thresholds outlined in Section 2.4.80.02.
f. Notice, action on the application, the Notice of Disposition, appeals,
the effective date, and the effective period of the Tentative
Subdivision Plat Modification shall be in accordance with Sections
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 2.4  Subdivisions and Major Replats Page 30 of 30
2.14.30.03 and 2.14.30.06 through 2.14.30.10 of Chapter 2.14 -
Partitions, Minor Replats, and Property Line Adjustments.
2.4.80.04 - Determining Compliance with a Tentative Subdivision Plat
Modification
A Final Subdivision Plat or other site development permit request shall be
reviewed to determine whether the request is in compliance with any approved
Tentative Subdivision Plat Modification. It shall be deemed to be in compliance
if it does not involve deviations from this Code's development standards, other
than those that have been approved in association with an approved Planned
Development, and does not involve changes to any specific requirements
established at the time of Tentative Subdivision Plat Modification approval.
Specific requirements include Conditions of Approval, this Code's
requirements, and all aspects of the applicant's proposal that were approved
as part of the Tentative Subdivision Plat Modification.
Section 2.4.90  EXPEDITED LAND DIVISION
An expedited land division, as defined by ORS 197.360(1), provides an alternative to
the standards and procedures for a land division set forth in LDC Chapter 2.4. When an
applicant requests an expedited land division, and an application meets the provisions
in ORS 197.360, the application shall be processed in accordance with ORS 197.360
through ORS 197.380.

Chapter 2.5  Planned Development Page 1 of 34
CHAPTER 2.5
PLANNED DEVELOPMENT
Section 2.5.10 - BACKGROUND
It is the intent of this Chapter to establish procedures that permit flexibility in the land
development process, allow for better preservation of Significant Natural Features,
and allow for innovation in site planning and architectural design.
The Planned Development process is established to allow the review and approval
of Conceptual and Detailed Development Plans, to provide the mechanism for
achieving greater flexibility and improved design in cases where the scope of
proposed modifications to pre-stated standards exceeds that permitted through a Lot
Development Option. A Lot Development Option allows minor modifications to
required specification standards on an individual lot of record. The procedures for a
Lot Development Option are identified in Chapter 2.12 - Lot Development Option.
a. The Procedures of this Chapter are Applicable When -
1. A property owner requests a Conceptual and/or Detailed
Development Plan concurrent with a specific project review; or
2. A Nonresidential or Residential Planned Development Overlay,
established in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 3.32 -
Nonresidential PD (Planned Development) Overlay or Chapter 3.33
- Residential PD (Planned Development) Overlay, respectively,
exists on the site and is shown on the City's Official Zoning Map.
Depending on the level of detail provided in a Planned Development
application, a Planned Development project proposal is called a Conceptual
Development Plan or a Detailed Development Plan. A Conceptual
Development Plan provides general concepts for development on a site. A
Detailed Development Plan provides the specifics for development on a site
and is required following or simultaneously with approval of a Conceptual
Development Plan. When a Detailed Development Plan is processed
simultaneously with a Conceptual Development Plan, it is called a Conceptual
and Detailed Development Plan.
Upon Planning Commission approval of a Detailed Development Plan or a
Conceptual and Detailed Development Plan, Building Permits are issued
consistent with that Plan.
b. Restrictions on Variations -
1. Development Standards -
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 2.5  Planned Development Page 2 of 34
a) The Conceptual and Detailed Development Plan process
permits modifications to the site development standards of the
underlying zone; and
b) Approval of a Detailed Development Plan for a residentially
designated site must provide a clear and objective set of
standards, through the approved plan and related Conditions of
Approval, for development to follow.
2. Uses -
a) The Conceptual and Detailed Development Plan process does
not permit an expansion of Uses beyond those specified by the
underlying zone;
b) In cases where a property's underlying zoning designation was
changed prior to December 31, 2006, and a valid (still active)
Planned Development existed and was approved before
December 31, 2006, the Conceptual and Detailed Development
Plan process may be used to allow the Uses permitted by the
new underlying zone; and
c) The Conceptual and Detailed Development Plan process may
also be used to modify the Use size limitations contained in
Chapter 3.19 - Mixed Use Community Shopping (MUCS) Zone.
c. On Residentially Designated Properties - Upon approval of a Conceptual
Development Plan on residentially designated land, a Residential Planned
Development Overlay is placed on the site and shown on the Official Zoning
Map for as long as the property owner desires to keep the Conceptual
Development Plan active, up to the expiration period defined in Section
2.5.40.09. Upon approval of a Detailed Development Plan on residentially
designated land, a Residential Planned Development Overlay is placed on the
site and shown on the Official Zoning Map for as long as the property owner
desires to keep the Detailed Development Plan active, up to the expiration
period defined in Section 2.5.50.09. In cases where an approved Conceptual
and/or Detailed Development Plan is no longer active, the associated
Residential Planned Development Overlay is automatically removed from the
Official Zoning Map.
d. On Nonresidentially Designated Properties - Upon approval of a Conceptual
Development Plan on nonresidentially designated land, a Nonresidential
Planned Development Overlay is placed on the site and shown on the Official
Zoning Map for as long as the Conceptual Development Plan remains active
(unexpired). Upon approval of a Detailed Development Plan on nonresidentially
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 2.5  Planned Development Page 3 of 34
designated land, a Nonresidential Planned Development Overlay is placed on
the site and shown on the Official Zoning Map for as long as the Detailed
Development Plan remains active, as defined in Section 2.5.50.09.c. In cases
where an approved Conceptual and/or Detailed Development Plan is no longer
active, the associated Nonresidential Planned Development Overlay is
automatically removed from the Official Zoning Map.
e. Applying a Nonresidential or Residential Planned Development Overlay
Without a Conceptual or Detailed Development Plan -
Without approval of a Conceptual and/or Detailed Development Plan, a
Nonresidential or Residential Planned Development Overlay can only be applied
through the use of Chapter 3.32 - Nonresidential PD (Planned Development)
Overlay and Chapter 3.33 - Residential PD (Planned Development) Overlay,
respectively.
[Section 2.5.10 amended by Ordinance 2018-27, effective November 5, 2018]
Section 2.5.20 - PURPOSES
Planned Development review procedures are established in this Chapter for the
following purposes:
a. Promote flexibility in design and permit diversification in location of structures;
b. Promote efficient use of land and energy, and facilitate a more
economical arrangement of buildings, circulation systems, land uses,
and utilities;
c. Preserve, to the greatest extent possible, existing Significant Natural
Features and landscape features and amenities, and use such features in a
harmonious fashion;
d. Provide for more usable and suitably located pedestrian and/or
recreational facilities and other public and/or common facilities than would
otherwise be provided under conventional land development procedures;
e. Combine and coordinate architectural styles, building forms, and
building relationships within the Planned Development;
f. Provide the applicant with reasonable assurance of ultimate approval before
expenditure of complete design monies, while providing the City with
assurances that the project will retain the character envisioned at the time of
approval;
g. Provide greater compatibility with surrounding land uses than would otherwise
be provided under conventional land development procedures; and
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 2.5  Planned Development Page 4 of 34
h. Provide benefits within the development site that compensate for the
variations from development standards such that the intent of the
development standards is still met.
Section 2.5.30 - GENERAL PROVISIONS
Planned Development is an alternative development process that provides an
avenue for a developer to request variations from development standards while
maintaining the purposes stated in Section 2.5.20 and meeting the review criteria
outlined in Section 2.5.40.04.
The following procedures allow for Planning Commission review of a Conceptual
Development Plan and/or Detailed Development Plan. An applicant may either elect
to process a development proposal under a Detailed Development Plan when
sufficient information has been submitted in accordance with Section 2.5.50, or may
request approval of a Conceptual Development Plan in accordance with Section
2.5.40 and later apply for a Detailed Development Plan. However, prior to the
issuance of any Building or Construction Permits, a Detailed Development Plan must
be approved by the Planning Commission.
Section 2.5.40 - CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN REVIEW PROCEDURES
An application filed for a Conceptual Development Plan shall be reviewed in
accordance with the following procedures.
2.5.40.01 - Application Requirements
When the Director deems any requirement below unnecessary for proper
evaluation of a proposed application, it may be waived.
Prior to formal submittal of an application, the applicant is encouraged to

c. In reviewing the proposed Modification, the Director shall follow the
procedures herein required for Minor Planned Development
Modification submittal and review.
d. The Director shall approve, approve with conditions, or deny a
Minor Planned Development Modification based on the following
criteria:
1. With the proposed change(s), the Planned Development is compliant
with Section 2.5.50.04;
2. With the proposed change(s), the Planned Development provides
new benefits that compensate for any negative effects caused by the
requested Minor Modification(s). New elements used to compensate
for a negative effect shall be of at least equal value to the elements
proposed to be changed;
3. The proposed change(s) does not increase a previously approved
variation. The change(s) may reduce or eliminate a previously
approved variation(s); and
4. The proposed change(s) does not eliminate or reduce a
compensating benefit(s) provided as part of the original Planned
Development approval.
e. Upon finding that the application qualifies as a Minor Planned
Development Modification, the Director may consider the
redesign in whole or in part of any Planned Development,
provided the redesign still qualifies as a Minor Planned
Development Modification.
f. Notice for a Minor Planned Development Modification shall be
provided in accordance with Chapter 2.16 - Request for Interpretation.
g. The Director's action on the application, including issuance of the

Chapter 2.6  Annexations Page 1 of 24
CHAPTER 2.6
ANNEXATIONS
Section 2.6.10 - BACKGROUND
The process of land Annexation allows for the orderly expansion of the City and
adequate provision for public facilities and services. The City Charter requires voter
approval of an Annexation unless an Annexation is mandated by state law. For
example, Health Hazard Annexations are mandated by state law and do not require
voter approval.
Section 2.6.20 - PURPOSES
The procedures and review criteria for proposed Annexations are established for the
following purposes:
a. Maximize citizen involvement in the Annexation review process;
b. Establish a methodology to evaluate need, serviceability, and the economic,
environmental, and related social effects of proposed Annexations;
c. Provide adequate public information and sufficient time for public review before
an Annexation election;
d. Ensure adequate time for City staff review; and
e. Allow for simultaneous review of multiple Annexation proposals.
Section 2.6.30 - PROCEDURES
An application filed for Annexation shall be reviewed in accordance with the following
procedures:
2.6.30.01 - Determination of Annexation Type
The Director shall determine whether an application is for a Minor or Major
Annexation as follows:
a. Minor Annexation - Intended to address situations where properties are
proposed for Annexation and, by virtue of their size and development
potential, have negligible impacts on surrounding properties and
neighborhoods, and on the community as a whole. These Annexations
are typically proposed to gain access to public services, such as sanitary
sewer and water facilities, before actual Health Hazards are declared; to
incorporate infill sites into the City; and/or to allow a limited level of urban
development to occur on existing parcels. Minor Annexation provisions
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 2.6  Annexations Page 2 of 24
are not intended to provide for piecemeal Annexations whereby a property
owner within the county partitions a small piece of land specifically to be
classified as a Minor Annexation, and then continues to partition small
sites and propose multiple Minor Annexations.
An Annexation shall be considered Minor if all of the following conditions
exist:
1. No more than one parcel is involved;
2. For residential Annexations, the parcel is capable of providing not
more than 10 dwelling units (at maximum allowed density per gross
acre). For commercial and industrial Annexations, the parcel is no
greater than one acre; and
3. City services are contiguous to the parcel.
When addressing the review criteria in Section 2.6.30.06.a and Section
2.6.30.06.b, a Minor Annexation proposal need not provide the same level
of detail as a Major Annexation proposal. See Section 2.6.30.06 and
Section 2.6.30.07 for specifics. All other submittal requirements and
review criteria, however, are applicable.
b. Major Annexation - An Annexation shall be considered Major if it does
not meet all three conditions for a Minor Annexation as outlined in "a",
above.
2.6.30.02 - Application Filing Deadlines
Annexation elections are scheduled for May and November of each year and
application deadlines are established accordingly as follows: applications for
Minor and Major Annexations must be filed with the Community Development
Department before 5:00 p.m. on the last working day in September for a ballot
election in May, and on the last working day in March for a ballot election in
November.
2.6.30.03 - Application Requirements
When the Director deems any requirement below unnecessary for proper
evaluation of a proposed application, it may be waived.
Prior to formal submittal of an application, the applicant is encouraged to
participate in an informal pre-application conference with Community
Development Department staff to discuss the proposal, the applicant's
requirements, and the applicant's materials developed in response to this
Code's applicable requirements.
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 2.6  Annexations Page 3 of 24
Applications for Annexation shall be made on forms provided by the Director and
shall be accompanied by the following:
a. Location and description of the subject property(ies), including all of the
following, as relevant: address; tax assessor map and tax lot number;
parcel number; written description of the boundaries of the proposal; and
one set of assessor's maps of the subject site and surrounding area, with
the subject site outlined in red;
b. Signed consent by the subject property's owner(s) and/or the owner's
legal representative(s) to dispense with an election of the area to be
Annexed as provided by state law. If a legal representative is used as a
signatory, written proof of ability to be a signatory shall be furnished to the
City. The owner's name(s) and address(es), and the applicant's name,
address, and signature shall also be provided. Because Health Hazard
Annexations do not involve an election, signed consent to the Annexation
by the property owner(s) and/or the owners' legal representative(s) shall
suffice;
c. Fifteen copies of the narrative, on 8.5- by 11-in. sheets, and 15 copies of
graphics at an 8.5- by 11-in. size. The Director may request additional
copies of the narrative and/or graphics for routing purposes, if needed.
Related names/numbers must be legible on the graphics. The Director
may also require some or all graphics at an 11- by 17-in. size if, for
legibility purposes, such a size would be helpful;
d. Six sets of full-scaled black line or blueprint drawings of the graphic(s),
with sheet size not to exceed 24- by 36-in. Where necessary, an overall
plan with additional detail sheets may be submitted;
e. An electronic version of these documents (both text and graphics, as
applicable) if an applicant has produced part or all of an application in an
electronic format. The applicant shall coordinate with the City regarding
compatible electronic formats, to the greatest extent practicable;
f. Boundary survey of the property to be Annexed, certified by a registered
surveyor; and a legal description of the property and associated rights-ofway
to be Annexed that includes the road or street right-of-way adjacent to
the property. Copies of the legal description shall be provided in both
written and electronic format; and
g. If the Annexation proposal includes areas planned for open space, general
community use, or public or semi-public ownerships, the Annexation
request shall be accompanied by a Comprehensive Plan Map Amendment

for comment; and
c) Archaeological sites recorded by the State Historic
Preservation Office (SHPO).
6. Graphics for Annexation applications shall be drawn to scale and
shall contain a sheet title, date, north arrow, and legend placed in
the same location on each sheet and contain the following
information:
a) Vicinity Map - A map of the area to be Annexed that shows
adjacent City and county territory at least 300 ft. beyond the
boundaries of the Annexation site for Minor Annexations,
and at least 1,200 ft. beyond the boundaries of the site for
Major Annexations. The map shall include features such as
existing streets and parcel boundaries; existing structures;
driveways; utilities; Significant Natural Features regulated by
Chapter 2.11 - Floodplain Development Permit, Chapter 4.2

would be helpful, such as in cases where an adjacent
property is large and a view of the whole parcel would be
helpful, or when existing infrastructure is far away from the
site.
b) General Land Use Plan - A map that illustrates the following,
at a minimum, in sufficient detail to apply the review criteria
in Section 2.6.30.06:
1) Proposed land use zones and densities;

Chapter 2.6  Annexations Page 13 of 24
2.6.30.07 - Methodologies for Some of the Review Criteria in Section
2.6.30.06
All of the provisions within this Section are required for Major Annexation
proposals except for proposals or portions of proposals that include land with
Comprehensive Plan designations of Public Institutional, Open Space-
Conservation, or Open Space-Agriculture. Lands with these map designations
are exempt from the provisions within "a," and "b," below. Minor Annexation
proposals are subject only to the provisions within "c," below.
a. Determining Five-Year Supply of Serviceable Land - Serviceable land
is land within the City limits capable of being served by public facilities.
When calculating a five-year supply of serviceable land, applicants shall
refer to and follow the Council Policy addressing the five-year supply, as
amended from time to time. This Policy outlines the accepted
methodology and will result in more uniform application submittals.
b. Providing information on land availability to ensure choices in the
market place - Comprehensive Plan Policy 14.3.6 states that "factors to
be considered in evaluating public need for Annexation may include... the
availability of sufficient land of this type to ensure choices in the market
place." Minor Annexation applications are not required to include
information on market choice. However, Major Annexation applications
shall provide this information. Appropriate and encouraged market choice
topics include, but are not limited to:
1. Information regarding a housing/jobs balance;
2. Housing rental rates and prices;
3. Vacancy rates; and
4. A comparison of housing costs related to incomes, land prices, and
land availability.
The City does not independently review and verify documentation of this
nature. Therefore, an applicant's market choice arguments shall be
developed by a recognized professional in the field. Additionally, the
applicant shall identify the methodologies used and the sources of
information.
The Director will summarize the applicant's arguments and methodologies
in the staff report provided to the hearing authority, and identify them as
the applicant's arguments. The hearing authority shall determine the
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 2.6  Annexations Page 14 of 24
validity of the arguments based on the information provided by the
applicant and on public comments during the public hearing process. The
hearing authority shall also determine to what extent these arguments
affect the criteria in Section 2.6.30.06.b.
c. Providing information on community-wide livability indicators and
determining compliance with adopted community-wide benchmarks -
1. The City has just begun the process of identifying livability
indicators to ultimately assist in the development of communitywide
benchmarks. Additionally, many of the community-wide
livability indicators are not applicable to Annexation proposals.
2. Table 2.6-1- Livability Indicators and Benchmark Criteria provides
interim direction to applicants in addressing livability indicator and
benchmark criteria. As the community further develops these
livability indicators and benchmarks, this Section of this Code shall
be updated accordingly.
a) The livability indicators and benchmarks in the following
table are intended to be balanced and identified as
advantages and disadvantages relative to an Annexation
proposal. Compliance with all benchmarks is not required.
However, when balanced and viewed in aggregate, the
decision-makers need to find that the advantages to the
community outweigh the disadvantages.
b) The number of applicable livability indicators and
benchmarks varies, depending on the Comprehensive Plan
Map designation(s) of the property involved in the
Annexation request, as well as whether the Annexation is
categorized as a Minor Annexation or a Major Annexation.
c) For those livability indicators and benchmarks that require
distance measurements from an amenity to a proposed
Annexation site, measurements shall be taken from the
average point within the Annexation site.

and
d. Expedite provision of services needed to alleviate an identified Health Hazard.

CHAPTER 2.9
HISTORIC PRESERVATION PROVISIONS
Section 2.9.10 - BACKGROUND AND APPLICABILITY
The City of Corvallis recognizes that historic resources located within its boundaries
contribute to the unique character of the community and merit preservation. The City's
Historic Preservation Provisions implement the policies in Comprehensive Plan Article
5, Section 5.4 - Historic and Cultural Resources. In doing so, the City's Historic
Preservation Provisions establish procedures and standards for the review of
development on properties involving Designated Historic Resources as defined in
Chapter 1.6 - Definitions, and development on or within public rights-of-way and private
street rights-of-way located within and adjacent to a National Register of Historic Places
Historic District. These properties include those subject to a Historic Preservation
Overlay (HPO) and historic resources listed in the National Register of Historic Places.
As defined in Chapter 3.31 - Historic Preservation Overlay, the Overlay applies to all
historic resources listed in the Corvallis Register of Historic Landmarks and Districts
(Local Register). As a Certified Local Government, the City has authority delegated
from the state and federal governments to evaluate Historic Preservation Permit
changes to Designated Historic Resources listed in the National Register of Historic
Places. Accordingly, the City's Historic Preservation Provisions apply to: historic
resources listed in the Corvallis Register of Historic Landmarks and Districts (Local
Register); historic resources listed in the National Register of Historic Places; and public
rights-of-way and private street rights-of-way located within and adjacent to a National
Register of Historic Places Historic District. These provisions also conform with
Statewide Planning Goals and other state land use requirements.
Section 2.9.20 - PURPOSES
The purposes of the City's Historic Preservation Provisions are as follows:
a. Implement historic and cultural resource policies of Comprehensive Plan Article
5, Section 5.4 - Historic and Cultural Resources
b. Encourage, effect, and accomplish the protection, enhancement, and
perpetuation of historic resources, historic resource improvements, and of
historic districts that represent or reflect elements of the City's cultural, social,
economic, political, and architectural history;
c. Complement any National Register of Historic Places Historic sites and/or
Districts in the City;
d. Foster civic pride in the beauty and noble accomplishments of the past;
e. Promote the use of historic districts and landmarks for education, pleasure,
energy conservation, housing, and the public and economic welfare of the City;
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 2.9  Historic Preservation Provisions Page 2 of 43
f. Provide processes and criteria for the review of Historic Preservation Permit
applications for Designated Historic Resources for the following actions:
1. Alteration or New Construction;
2. Demolition; and
3. Moving;
g. Provide a clear and objective listing of activities exempt from the Historic
Preservation Permit process;
h. Provide procedures for addressing emergency actions affecting the historic
resources in the City; and
i. Adequately implement the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation1
and the Secretary of Interior's Standards for Preservation,2 since they were used
in the development of review criteria for Historic Preservation Permit requests.
The review criteria contained herein implement these standards in a manner that
adequately protects Designated Historic Resources consistent with Secretary of
the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation and the Secretary of Interior's
Standards for Preservation.

Section 2.9.60 - DETERMINING APPLICABILITY AND APPROPRIATE HISTORIC
PRESERVATION PERMIT REVIEW PROCEDURE(S)
A Historic Preservation Permit is required for certain Alteration or New Construction,
Demolition, or Moving activities affecting Designated Historic Resources, even if no
Building Permit is required by the Building Official. Accordingly, the City's Historic
Preservation Provisions apply to: historic resources listed in the Corvallis Register of
Historic Landmarks and Districts (Local Register); historic resources listed in the
National Register of Historic Places; and public rights-of-way and private street rightsof-
way located within and adjacent to a National Register of Historic Places Historic
District. Different review procedures and criteria apply, depending on the nature of the
permit request, and if the Designated Historic Resource is located in a National Register
of Historic Places Historic District, the classification of the resource.
a. Exempt Activities - Section 2.9.70 outlines activities affecting a Designated
Historic Resource that are exempt from the requirement for a Historic
Preservation Permit.
b. Types of Historic Preservation Permits -
1. Director-level Historic Preservation Permit - The Director-level Historic
Preservation Permit addresses Alteration or New Construction activities
that are minor in nature and not covered in Section 2.9.70 - Exemptions
from Historic Preservation Permit Requirements. Specific procedures and
clear and objective review criteria for this type of permit are listed in
Sections 2.9.60.c, 2.9.90, and 2.9.100. The Director-level Historic
Preservation Permit is classified as General Development in Chapter 1.2 -
Legal Framework, is a staff-level review, and acts as a double-check for
compliance with Sections 2.9.90 and 2.9.100.
2. HRC-level Historic Preservation Permit - The HRC-level Historic
Preservation Permit addresses Alteration or New Construction,
Demolition, and Moving activities not covered by "1," above, and not
covered in Section 2.9.70 - Exemptions from Historic Preservation Permit
Requirements. Specific procedures and discretionary review criteria for
this type of permit are listed in Sections 2.9.60.c, 2.9.90, 2.9.100, 2.9.110,
and 2.9.120. The HRC-level Historic Preservation Permit is classified as a
quasi-judicial land use decision in Chapter 1.2 - Legal Framework,
involves public notice, and requires a Historic Resources Commission
public hearing review for compliance with Sections 2.9.90, 2.9.100,
2.9.110, and 2.9.120.

b) Be compatible with the historic characteristics of the
Designated Historic Resource and/or District, as applicable,
based on a consideration of the historic design or style,
appearance, or material composition of the resource.
3. Compatibility Criteria for Structures and Site Elements -
Compatibility considerations shall include the items listed in "a -n,"
below, as applicable, and relative to the applicable Period of
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 2.9  Historic Preservation Provisions Page 31 of 43
Significance. Alteration or New Construction shall complement the
architectural design or style of the primary resource, if in existence
and proposed in part to remain; and any existing surrounding
comparable Designated Historic Resources. Notwithstanding these
provisions and "a-n," below, for Nonhistoric/Noncontributing
resources in a National Register of Historic Places Historic District
or resources within such Historic District that are not classified
because the nomination for the Historic District is silent on the
issue, Alteration or New Construction activities shall be evaluated
for compatibility with the architectural design or style of any existing
Historic/Contributing resource on the site or, where none exists,
against the attributes of the applicable Historic District's Period of
Significance.
a) Facades - Architectural features, such as balconies,
porches, bay windows, dormers, or trim details shall be
retained, restored, or designed to complement the primary
structure and any existing surrounding comparable
Designated Historic Resources. Particular attention should
be paid to those facades that are significantly visible from
public areas, excluding alleys. Architectural elements
inconsistent with the Designated Historic Resource's existing
building design or style shall be avoided.
b) Building Materials - Building materials shall be reflective of,
and complementary to, those found on the existing primary
Designated Historic Resource, if in existence and proposed
in part to remain, and any existing surrounding comparable
Designated Historic Resources. Siding materials of vertical
board, plywood, cement stucco, aluminum, exposed
concrete block, and vinyl shall be avoided, unless
documented as being consistent with the original design or
style, or structure of the Designated Historic Resource.
c) Architectural Details - Retention and repair of existing
character-defining elements of a structure, such as molding
or trim, brackets, columns, cladding, ornamentation, and
other finishing details and their design or style, materials,
and dimensions, shall be considered by the property owner
prior to replacement. Replacements for existing architectural
elements or proposed new architectural elements shall be
consistent with the resource's design or style. If any
previously existing architectural elements are restored, such
features shall be consistent with the documented building
design or style. Conjectural architectural details shall not be
applied.
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 2.9  Historic Preservation Provisions Page 32 of 43
d) Scale and Proportion - The size and proportions of the
Alteration or New Construction shall be compatible with
existing structures on the site, if in existence and proposed
in part to remain, and with any surrounding comparable
structures. New additions or New Construction shall
generally be smaller than the impacted Designated Historic
Resource, if in existence and proposed in part to remain. In
rare instances where an addition or New Construction is
proposed to be larger than the original Designated Historic
Resource, it shall be designed such that no single element is
visually larger than the original Designated Historic
Resource, if in existence and proposed in part to remain, or
any existing surrounding comparable Designated Historic
Resources.
e) Height - To the extent possible, the height of the Alteration or
New Construction shall not exceed that of the existing
primary Designated Historic Resource, if in existence and
proposed in part to remain, and any existing surrounding
comparable Designated Historic Resources. However,
second story additions are allowed, provided they are
consistent with the height standards of the underlying zoning
designation and other chapters of this Code, and provided
they are consistent with the other review criteria contained
herein.
f) Roof Shape - New roofs shall match the pitch and shape of
the original Designated Historic Resource, if in existence and
proposed in part to remain, or any existing surrounding
compatible Designated Historic Resources.
g) Pattern of Window and Door Openings - To the extent
possible window and door openings shall be compatible with
the original features of the existing Designated Historic
Resource, if in existence and proposed in part to remain, in
form (size, proportion, detailing), materials, type, pattern,
and placement of openings.
h) Building Orientation - Building orientation shall be compatible
with existing development patterns on the Designated
Historic Resource site, if in existence and proposed in part to
remain, and any existing surrounding comparable
Designated Historic Resources. In general, Alteration or
New Construction shall be sited to minimize impacts to
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 2.9  Historic Preservation Provisions Page 33 of 43
facade(s) of the Designated Historic Resource that are
significantly visible from public areas, excluding alleys.
i) Site Development - To the extent practicable, given other
applicable development standards, such as standards in this
Code for building coverage, setbacks, landscaping, sidewalk
and street tree locations, the Alteration or New Construction
shall maintain existing site development patterns, if in
existence and proposed in part to remain.
j) Accessory Development/Structures - Accessory
development as defined in Chapter 4.3 - Accessory
Development Regulations and items such as exterior
lighting, walls, fences, awnings, and landscaping that are
associated with an Alteration or New Construction Historic
Preservation Permit application, shall be visually compatible
with the architectural design or style of the existing
Designated Historic Resource, if in existence and proposed
in part to remain, and any comparable Designated Historic
Resources within the District, as applicable.
k) Garages - Garages, including doors, shall be compatible
with the Designated Historic Resource site's primary
structure, if in existence and proposed in part to remain,
based on factors that include design or style, roof pitch and
shape, architectural details, location and orientation, and
building materials. In a National Register of Historic Places
Historic District, the design or style of Alteration or New
Construction involving an existing or new garage, visible
from public rightsof-way or private street rights-ofway,
shall also be compatible with the design or style of other
garages in the applicable Historic District that were
constructed during that Historic District's Period of
Significance.
l) Chemical or Physical Treatments - Chemical or physical
treatments, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the
gentlest means possible. Treatments that cause damage to
historic materials shall not be used.
m) Archeological Resources - Activities associated with
archeological resources shall be carried out in accordance
with all State requirements pertaining to the finding of
cultural materials, including ORS 358.905, as amended,
which pertains to the finding of cultural materials; ORS
390.235, as amended, which describes steps for State
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 2.9  Historic Preservation Provisions Page 34 of 43
permits on sites where cultural materials are found; and
OAR 736.051.0080 and OAR 736.051.0090, as amended,
which describe requirements for cultural materials found on
public verses private land, respectively.
n) Differentiation - New freestanding buildings and additions to
buildings shall be differentiated from the portions of the site's
existing Designated Historic Resource(s) inside the
applicable Period of Significance. However, they also shall
be compatible with said Designated Historic Resource's
Historically Significant materials, design or style elements,
features, size, scale, proportion, and massing to protect the
Historic Integrity of the Designated Historic Resource and its
environment. The differentiation may be subtle and may be
accomplished between the Historically Significant portions
and the new construction with variations in wall or roof
alignment, offsets, roof pitch, or roof height. Alternatively,
differentiation may be accomplished by a visual change in
surface, such as a molding strip or other element that acts
as an interface between the Historically Significant and the
new portions.
4. Additional Review Criteria for the Installation of a Designated
Historic Resource on a New Site, Following a Moving - To
complete its review of a request to install a Designated Historic
Resource on a new site following its being moved, the Historic
Resources Commission shall receive from the Director a finding
that indicates the following:
a) The zone designation for the proposed site is appropriate to
accept the Designated Historic Resource that was moved, in
terms of land use(s) and development standards;
b) Legal vehicular and Fire Department access to the proposed
new site is available or can be provided; and
c) Required infrastructure improvements for or adjacent to the
proposed new site have been or will be provided.
2.9.100.05 - Status of Properties for Which an Alteration or New
Construction HRC-level Historic Preservation Permit has been
Approved to Install a Moved Historic Resource
a. Local Register Historic Resources - If approval has been granted for
the installation of a moved Designated Historic Resource that was a Local
Register-Designated Historic Resource at its previous location, a Historic
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 2.9  Historic Preservation Provisions Page 35 of 43
Preservation Overlay may be applied to the new site to which the
Designated Historic Resource is being moved through use of the
provisions of Chapter 2.2 - Zone Changes, following the effective date of
the approved Alteration or New Construction Historic Preservation Permit
associated with the Moving. Once the City's Historic Preservation Overlay
has been applied, future modifications affecting the Designated Historic
Resource at its new site shall be subject to the provisions of this Chapter.
b. Historic Resources listed in the National Register of Historic Places -
The City shall notify the State Historic Preservation Office when a Historic
Preservation Permit authorizing the installation of a moved Designated
Historic Resource listed in the National Register of Historic Places
becomes effective. A proposed listing or the maintenance of an existing
listing of a National Register of Historic Places Historic Resource at its
new site shall be processed through state and federal procedures. Upon
receipt of official notification from SHPO that a listing has occurred or has
been maintained and is in effect and when the affected Designated
Historic Resource is not listed in the Local Register, the affected
Designated Historic Resource at its new site shall be subject to the
Historic Preservation Provisions of this Code. In such cases, a Historic
Preservation Overlay may be added to the new site to which the
Designated Historic Resource is being moved through use of the
provisions of Chapter 2.2 - Zone Changes, following the effective date of
the approved Alteration or New Construction Historic Preservation Permit.
Section 2.9.110 - DEMOLITION INVOLVING A DESIGNATED HISTORIC
RESOURCE
2.9.110.01 - Definition of a Demolition of a Designated Historic Resource
An activity is considered a Demolition of a Designated Historic Resource when
the activity:
a. Is not an exempt activity as defined in Section 2.9.70;
b. Is not an Alteration or New Construction as defined in Section 2.9.100;
c. Is not a Moving as defined in Section 2.9.120;
d. Involves destruction of a Designated Historic Resource; and/or
e. Involves the removal of a Historically Significant Tree as defined in
Chapter 1.6 - Definitions, unless the tree is officially sanctioned for
removal via Section 2.9.70.y.
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 2.9  Historic Preservation Provisions Page 36 of 43
2.9.110.02 - Historic Preservation Permit Required for Demolition of a
Designated Historic Resource
An HRC-level Historic Preservation Permit is required for all activities meeting
the definition for Demolition of a Designated Historic Resource, as outlined in
Section 2.9.110.01 above.
2.9.110.03 - Review Criteria 
An HRC-level Historic Preservation Permit for the Demolition of a Designated
Historic Resource other than a Historically Significant Tree shall be evaluated
against the criteria in "a" through "c," below. Approval may be granted for a
Demolition only where a proposal has been demonstrated to have met criterion
"a," and either "b" or "c." Criteria "a-c" do not apply to requests to remove a
Historically Significant Tree. Removal of a Historically Significant Tree that does
not qualify as an exempt activity via Section 2.9.70.y is addressed in "d," below.
a. The Historic Integrity of the Designated Historic Resource has been
substantially reduced or diminished due to unavoidable circumstances that
were not a result of action or inaction by the property owner. Historic
Integrity is defined in Chapter 1.6 - Definitions.
b. If the proposed Demolition involves one of the structures identified in "1 -
2," below, and is not exempt per Section 2.9.70, it may be allowed,
provided the applicant submits evidence documenting the age of the
affected structure and documentation that the Demolition will not damage,
obscure, or negatively impact any Designated Historic Resource on the
property that is classified as Historic/Contributing or that is called out as
being Historically Significant, based on any of the sources of information
listed in Section 2.9.60.c. To be considered under this criteria, the
Demolition shall involve only the following:
1. A Nonhistoric structure on an individually Designated Historic
Resource listed in the Local Register or National Register of
Historic Places; or
2. A Nonhistoric structure on a Designated Historic Resource property
listed in a National Register of Historic Places Historic District, even
if the approved National Register of Historic Places nomination for
the District is silent on the issue.
c. If the Demolition involves a Designated Historic Resource other than the
structures outlined in "b," above, the Demolition may be allowed provided:
1. The physical condition of the Designated Historic Resource is
deteriorated beyond Economically Feasible Rehabilitation and
either:
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 2.9  Historic Preservation Provisions Page 37 of 43
a) Moving of the Designated Historic Resource is not feasible;
or
b) If within a National Register of Historic Places Historic
District, Demolition of the Designated Historic Resource will
not adversely affect the Historic Integrity of the District. To
address this criterion, the applicant shall provide an
assessment of the Demolition's effects on the character and
Historic Integrity of the subject Designated Historic Resource
and District. Historic Integrity is defined in Chapter 1.6 -
Definitions.
2. Three of the following alternatives to Demolishing the Designated
Historic Resource have been pursued, including the following, as
appropriate:
a) Public or private acquisition of the Designated Historic
Resource with or without the associated land has been
explored;
b) Alternate structure and/or site designs that address the
property owner's needs, and which would avoid Demolition
of the Designated Historic Resource, have been explored
and documented;
c) A For-Sale sign and a public notice have been posted on the
Designated Historic Resource site. The sign and public
notice shall read: "HISTORIC RESOURCE TO BE
DEMOLISHED -- FOR SALE." The sign's lettering line height
shall be at least five in. and line width shall be at least one
half in. The sign and public notice shall be posted within two
ft. of any street sidewalk abutting the property. Signs shall be
posted for a minimum of 40 days prior to the public hearing;
d) The Designated Historic Resource has been listed for sale in
local and state newspapers for a minimum of five days over
a five-week period;
e) The Designated Historic Resource has been listed for sale in
at least two preservation publications for at least 30 days;
f) A press release has been issued to newspapers of local and
state circulation describing the Historic Significance of the
resource, the physical dimensions of the property, and the
reasons for the proposed Demolition; and/or
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 2.9  Historic Preservation Provisions Page 38 of 43
g) Notification through other means of advertisement has been
accomplished (e.g. internet, radio).
d. Trees - A Historic Preservation Permit to remove a Historically Significant
Tree as defined in Chapter 1.6 - Definitions, shall meet at least one of the
criteria in "1-5," below. Removal of Historically Significant Trees that
qualify as Hazardous Trees are addressed in Section 2.9.70.y. If removal
of a Historically Significant Tree is approved through the provisions of this
section (2.9.110.03.d), a replacement tree(s) may be required as
mitigation if, in the opinion of the decision-maker, there is an opportunity
either on the subject site, or within 750 ft. of the site, to plant an additional
tree(s):
1. The Historically Significant Tree, in the opinion of the City's Urban
Forester and City Engineer, negatively impacts existing public
infrastructure, and both officials recommend removal of the tree;
2. The Historically Significant Tree, in the opinion of the Building
Official and the City's Urban Forester, negatively impacts existing
structures on the development site that are intended to remain, and
both officials recommend removal of the tree;
3. The location of the Historically Significant Tree precludes the
reasonable use of the property because the area needed to ensure
preservation of the Historically Significant Tree, in the opinion of a
certified arborist and the City's Urban Forester, encompasses an
area that does not allow for the property owner to make
improvements on up to 75 percent of the otherwise buildable
portion of the lot - the area excluding required setback areas, after
consideration of lot coverage and landscaping standards;
4. For the determination of buildable area in "3," above, an automatic
15 percent reduction in setbacks and 10 percent increase in height
limitation shall be allowed and used to assist a property owner in
achieving reasonable use of property; and/or
5. In the case of public infrastructure, the location of the Historically
Significant Tree precludes construction of necessary public
infrastructure improvements and, in the opinion of the City Engineer
and the City's Urban Forester, design alternatives to accomplish the
necessary public infrastructure and preservation of the tree are not
feasible.

Historic Resource
a. Documentation of a Designated Historic Resource that has been approved
for Demolition through the issuance of a Historic Preservation Permit shall
occur using one or more of the methods outlined in "1-3," below. The
method(s) of documentation shall be specified in the Historic Preservation
Permit. The required documentation must be approved by the Director
prior to the issuance of a Building Permit for Demolition.
1. Documentation using guidelines in the Historic American Buildings
Survey, including architectural drawings, photographs, and
historical narrative;
2. Documentation by cataloging historic and contemporary
photographs of the Designated Historic Resource and site; or
3. Documentation by salvaging Historically Significant architectural

site.
b. Dispensation of Documentation Materials:
1. Original documentation materials shall remain the property of the
owner of the Designated Historic Resource being demolished;
2. Copies of documentation materials identified in Sections "a.1" and
"a.2," above, shall be submitted to the Director for storage by the
City or its designee; and
3. The Director may require an applicant to submit a plan for
dispensing of the documentation materials identified in Section
"a.3," above. The plan shall describe all re-use, sale, donation, or
other actions investigated by the applicant.
2.9.110.05 - Status of Properties for Which Demolition Approved
a. Local Register Designated Historic Resources - If approval has been
granted for the Demolition of a Locally-designated Historic Resource, the
Historic Preservation Overlay may be removed through use of the
provisions of Chapter 2.2 - Zone Changes, following the effective date of
the approved Historic Preservation Permit, and provided the applicable
provisions of Chapter 2.2 - Zone Changes are met. Once the City's
Historic Preservation Overlay has been removed, the affected resource
shall no longer be subject to the provisions of this Chapter, provided it is
not listed in the National Register.
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 2.9  Historic Preservation Provisions Page 40 of 43
b. Historic Resources listed in the National Register of Historic Places -
The City shall notify the State Historic Preservation Office when a Historic
Preservation Permit authorizing the Demolition of a Designated Historic
Resource listed in the National Register of Historic Places becomes
effective. A proposed delisting of such a Designated Historic Resource
shall be processed through state and federal procedures. Upon receipt of
official notification from the Oregon State Historic Preservation Office
(SHPO) that a delisting has occurred and is in effect, and when the
affected Designated Historic Resource is not also listed in the Local
Register, the affected Designated Historic Resource shall no longer be
subject to the Historic Preservation Provisions of this Code. Upon receipt
of official notification from SHPO that a delisting has occurred and is in
effect, and when the affected resource is still listed in the Local Register, a
Zone Change consistent with the provisions in Chapter 2.2 - Zone
Changes, pertaining to the removal of the related Historic Preservation
Overlay will need to be approved for the Designated Historic Resource to
no longer be subject to the Historic Preservation Provisions of this Code.
See "a," above.
2.9.110.06 - Temporary Stay of Demolition Building Permit for Publiclyowned
Historic Resources Subject to a Pending Nomination
for Listing in the National Register of Historic Places
a. If the Director has received from the State Historic Preservation Office
official notification that a publicly-owned historic resource is the subject of
a nomination application to list the resource in the National Register of
Historic Places, and the nomination application is currently being reviewed
by the State Historic Preservation Office and/or the National Park Service,
a Building Permit shall not be issued for the Demolition of that publiclyowned
historic resource for the period that the nomination application is
under review, provided:
1. The Director's receipt of official notification of the pending
nomination of the publicly-owned historic resource for listing in the
National Register of Historic Places occurred prior to the Director's
receipt of an application for a Building Permit for Demolition of the
affected publicly-owned resource;
2. For a pending National Register of Historic Places Historic District
nomination, if applicable, the temporary stay of the Demolition
Building Permit applies only to any publicly-owned resources
proposed for classification as Historic/Contributing or
Historic/Noncontributing in the nomination application. Any
publicly-owned resources proposed for classification as
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 2.9  Historic Preservation Provisions Page 41 of 43
Nonhistoric/Noncontributing in the nomination application are not
subject to this Section's stay requirement;
3. For a pending nomination for a Historic Resource proposed to be
individually listed in the National Register of Historic Places, if
applicable, this Section's temporary stay does not apply to the
issuance of a Demolition Building Permit for any publicly-owned
resources on the subject site that are Nonhistoric as defined in
Chapter 1.6 - Definitions; and
4. The affected Historic Resource is owned by the City of Corvallis,
Benton County, the Corvallis School District, a publicly-owned
special district, the State of Oregon, and/or the federal government.
b. Removal of a Temporary Stay - The temporary stay of the Demolition
permit shall end upon the Director's receipt of official notification from the
Keeper of the National Register, the National Park Service, and/or the
State Historic Preservation Office regarding the final outcome of the
proposed National Register of Historic Places listing. If the Historic
Resource has been approved for listing in the National Register of Historic
Places, the Demolition provisions of this chapter apply in addition to any
required Building Permits.
Section 2.9.120 - MOVING A DESIGNATED HISTORIC RESOURCE
2.9.120.01 - Definition of Moving a Designated Historic Resource
An activity is considered to be Moving a Designated Historic Resource when the
activity:
a. Is not an exempt activity as defined in Section 2.9.70.i;
b. Is not an Alteration or New Construction to a Designated Historic
Resource as defined in Section 2.9.100;
c. Is not a Demolition as defined in Section 2.9.110; and
d. Involves relocating the Designated Historic Resource, in whole or in part,
from its current site to another location. Review of the Moving request
shall be limited to an evaluation of the removal of the Designated Historic
Resource from its current location. Evaluation of the installation of the
Designated Historic Resource at its new location is considered an
Alteration or New Construction, and shall occur in accordance with the
provisions of Section 2.9.100, if the new site is within the City limits. If the
proposed new site of the Designated Historic Resource is outside the City
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 2.9  Historic Preservation Provisions Page 42 of 43
limits, no City evaluation of the resource's installation at that new site will
occur because the City has no jurisdiction over such locations.
2.9.120.02 - Historic Preservation Permit Required for Moving a Designated
Historic Resource
An HRC-level Historic Preservation Permit is required for all activities meeting
the definition for Moving a Designated Historic Resource, per Section 2.9.120.01,

b. The review criteria in Section 2.9.110.03.b, but with respect to Moving
instead of Demolition.
c. Moving the Designated Historic Resource will save it from Demolition.
d. Moving the Designated Historic Resource has benefits that outweigh the
detrimental impact of removing the resource from its designated site.
2.9.120.04 - Documentation Required Prior to Moving for an HRC-level
Historic Preservation Permit Issued for Moving a Designated
Historic Resource
A Designated Historic Resource that has been approved for Moving through the
issuance of an HRC-level Historic Preservation Permit shall be documented in
accordance with Section 2.9.110.04, but with respect to Moving instead of
Demolition, as applicable.
2.9.120.05 - Status of Properties for Which Moving is Approved
a. Local Register Historic Resources - If approval has been granted for
Moving a Locally-designated Historic Resource, the Historic Preservation
Overlay may be removed from the site from which the Designated Historic
Resource is being moved, through use of the provisions of Chapter 2.2 -
Zone Changes, following the effective date of the approved Historic
Preservation Permit for Moving. Once the City's Historic Preservation
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 2.9  Historic Preservation Provisions Page 43 of 43
Overlay has been removed, the affected resource site shall no longer be
subject to the provisions of this Chapter.
b. Historic Resources listed in the National Register of Historic Places -

a. Violations of these regulations shall be remedied in accordance with
Chapter 1.3 - Enforcement. Additionally, if an after-the-fact Historic
Preservation Permit is required to address a violation of these regulations,
the decision-maker for that Historic Preservation Permit shall have full
authority to implement these regulations, regardless of what
improvements have been made in violation of these regulations. This
includes requiring the Designated Historic Resource to be restored to its
appearance or setting prior to the violation, unless this requirement is
amended by the decision-maker. This civil remedy shall be in addition to,
and not in lieu of, any other criminal or civil remedy set out in this Chapter
and/or Chapter 1.3 - Enforcement.
b. Where the Alteration or New Construction, Demolition, or Moving of a
Designated Historic Resource within a National Register of Historic Places
Historic District or on any individually-listed property is in violation of these
regulations, that Designated Historic Resource is protected by these
regulations. Any person who intentionally causes or negligently allows the
Alteration or New Construction, Demolition, or Moving of any Designated
Historic Resource shall be required to restore or reconstruct the
Designated Historic Resource in accordance with the pertinent
architectural characteristics, guidelines and standards adopted by this
chapter. These remedies are in addition to any other civil or criminal
penalty set out in this Chapter and/or Chapter 1.3 - Enforcement.

Chapter 2.10  Major Neighborhood Center Master Site Plan Requirements Page 1 of 14
CHAPTER 2.10
MAJOR NEIGHBORHOOD CENTER
MASTER SITE PLAN REQUIREMENTS
Section 2.10.10 - BACKGROUND
As the core of a comprehensive neighborhood and as a site serving community-wide
shopping and office needs, a Major Neighborhood Center is envisioned to encompass
several acres of land and contain relatively intense commercial and residential
development. Development of a new Major Neighborhood Center, and particularly
major redevelopment of an existing Major Neighborhood Center, may ultimately involve
multiple property owners and businesses that become involved in the development of
the Center at different times. Consequently, the coordinated planning and development
of a Major Neighborhood Center is important not only to the neighborhood, but also to a
broader area.
The Master Site Plan review process is established to provide the mechanism for
achieving compatibility between Uses and the surrounding area, as well as to facilitate
future developments and redevelopment consistent with established requirements. The
procedures of this Chapter are applicable when a property owner requests a Master
Site Plan review prior to and/or concurrent with review of a specific project within a
Major Neighborhood Center. Upon Planning Commission approval of the Master Site
Plan, Building Permits may be issued consistent with that Plan.
Section 2.10.20 - PURPOSES OF MASTER SITE PLAN
Master Site Plan review procedures are established in this Chapter for the following
purposes:
a. Ensure that the requirements of the Neighborhood Center Zone are implemented
and coordinated with respect to Major Neighborhood Centers;
b. Establish a logical framework for development on the applicants property(ies);
c. Promote compatibility with surrounding land uses by identifying the relationships
of proposed and future development with existing surrounding development and
open spaces;
d. Promote the efficient use of land and energy;
e. Promote development patterns at a human scale and that meet the needs of
pedestrians through the arrangement of buildings, circulation systems, land uses,
and utilities;
f. Provide the applicant with reasonable assurance of ultimate approval before
expenditure of complete design monies, while providing the City and nearby
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 2.10  Major Neighborhood Center Master Site Plan Requirements Page 2 of 14
property owners and occupants with assurances that the project will retain the
character envisioned at the time of approval; and
g. Provide a basis for discretionary review of an overall plan of development that
can subsequently be developed in phases over time through ministerial
approvals.
Section 2.10.30 - APPLICABILITY

degree of modification proposed. These include the Minor and Major Master Site Plan
Modification processes described below.
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 2.10  Major Neighborhood Center Master Site Plan Requirements Page 11 of 14
2.10.50.01 - Purposes of a Master Site Plan Modification
a. Provide a limited amount of flexibility with regard to site planning and
architectural design for approved Master Site Plans; and
b. Provide elements within the development site that compensate for
requested variations from approved Master Site Plans such that the intent
of the original approvals is still met.
2.10.50.02 - Thresholds that Separate a Minor Master Site Plan
Modification from a Major Master Site Plan Modification
a. The factors identified in Section 2.3.40.02 - Thresholds of a Conditional
Development Modification describe the thresholds that separate a Minor
Master Site Plan Modification from a Major Master Site Plan Modification.
b. A Modification that equals or exceeds the thresholds identified in Section
2.3.40.02 - Thresholds of a Conditional Development Modification shall be
processed as Major Master Site Plan Modification.
c. A Modification that falls below the thresholds identified in Section
2.3.40.02 - Thresholds of a Conditional Development Modification or that
decreases the amount of variation from a standard that was previously
approved shall be processed as a Minor Master Site Plan Modification.
d. In addition, only three such Minor Master Site Plan Modifications may be
processed within one calendar year for any approved Master Site Plan. If
more than three such Modifications are proposed within a calendar year,
the Modifications, or any single such Modification proposed following the
third, shall be processed as a Major Master Site Plan Modification and
shall follow the procedures contained in Section 2.10.50.03.
e. A Modification to specific requirements established at the time of Master
Site Plan approval, including Conditions of Approval, this Codes
requirements, and all aspects of the Master Site Plan proposal, may be

Chapter 2.11  Floodplain Development Permit Page 1 of 14
CHAPTER 2.11
FLOODPLAIN DEVELOPMENT PERMIT
Section 2.11.10 - BACKGROUND
To participate in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), a community must adopt
and enforce a Floodplain management ordinance that regulates Development in the
Floodplain. This Floodplain management ordinance is housed primarily in Chapter 4.5 -
Floodplain Provisions, but is in part addressed in other chapters of this Code. One of
the basic Federal requirements for regulating Development in the Floodplain is a
requirement for a Floodplain Development Permit before construction or other
Development begins within any Special Flood Hazard Area (100-yr. Floodplain). In this
context, the term "Development" is defined in Section 1.6.40 of Chapter 1.6 -
Definitions. This chapter contains provisions for the Federally required Floodplain
Development Permit and is consistent with the National Flood Insurance Program
(NFIP) regulations.
Section 2.11.20 - PURPOSES
Procedures and standards for the review of Floodplain Development Permits are
established in this Chapter for the following purposes:
a. Protect human life, health and property;
b. Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water purification and
sewage treatment plants, water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer
lines, streets and bridges located in Floodplains;
c. Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and Development
of flood-prone areas;
d. Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
e. Minimize the need for rescue and emergency services associated with flooding
and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
f. Minimize unnecessary disruption of commerce, access and public service during
times of flood;
g. Facilitate the notification of potential buyers that property is in an Special Flood
Hazard Area;
h. Compel those who occupy property within the Special Flood Hazard Area to
assume responsibility for their actions; and
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 2.11  Floodplain Development Permit Page 2 of 14
i. Manage the alteration of Special Flood Hazard Areas, stream channels and
shorelines to minimize the impact of Development on the natural and beneficial
functions of the Floodplain.
Section 2.11.30 - APPLICABILITY
Unless exempt per Section 2.11.40, below, approval of a Floodplain Development
Permit is required prior to initiating Development activities in any Special Flood Hazard
Areas (SFHAs) established through Section 4.5.20.01.b. As defined in Section 1.6.40,
Development means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including but not limited to buildings or other structures, fencing, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations, or storage of equipment or
materials located within a Special Flood Hazard Area.
2.11.40 - EXEMPTIONS

RS-20 and MUR Zones, provided it is consistent with other applicable provisions
of this Code and provided all of the following are met:
1. The fill is used solely for the purpose of constructing a sandbox, a raised
gardening bed, or other similar landscape feature;
2. There are no undeveloped portions of the site that are outside the
Floodway Fringe that can accommodate the items described in "a.1,"
above;
3. The fill does not occupy an area that is greater than 10 percent of the
minimum lot size of the corresponding zone or 10 percent of the area of
the subject lot that is within the Floodway Fringe, whichever is less; and
4. The average depth of the fill does not exceed six in. over the area
described in "a.3," above;

applicant's burden to show that the Variance is warranted and meets said criteria.
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 2.11  Floodplain Development Permit Page 11 of 14
a. Variances shall not be issued within a designated Floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the Base Flood discharge would result.1
b. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the Variance is
the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
c. Variances shall only be issued upon a:
1. Showing of good and sufficient cause;
2. Determination that failure to grant the Variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant;
3. Determination that the granting of the Variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, or creation of nuisances; and
4. Determination that the granting of the Variance will not cause fraud
on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws
or ordinances.
d. Variances shall consider the following additional factors:
1. The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others as a result of approving the Variance request;
2. The potential to endanger life and property due to flooding or
erosion damage caused by approval of the Variance request;
3. The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage, and the effect of such damage on the individual owner
and adjacent properties;
4. The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community;
5. The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
6. The availability and viability of alternate locations for the proposed
use that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
1 There are unique circumstances under which the Floodplain Administrator or designee may allow a rise in
Base Flood Elevation in the Floodway  see Sections 4.5.50.04 and 4.5.80.05. However, these exceptions are
granted via the provisions of those two Code sections and not through the Variance provisions of this chapter.
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 2.11  Floodplain Development Permit Page 12 of 14
7. The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
Development. This criteria shall be considered to be met if the
proposed application meets the review criteria in Section
2.11.50.04.e;
8. The relationship of the proposed use to the Floodplain
management program for that area;
9. The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
10. The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment
transport of the flood waters, and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and
11. The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and
streets and bridges.

The Land Development Hearings Board shall conduct a public hearing in
accordance with Chapter 2.0 - Public Involvement. Following the close of the
public hearing, the Board shall approve, conditionally approve, or deny the
Floodplain Development Permit Variance. The Board's decision shall include
findings that specify how the application has or has not complied with the review
criteria in Section 2.11.60.06. The Board's decision shall also include findings
that specify the extent to which the application has or has not complied with the
original Floodplain Development Permit review criteria in Section 2.11.50.04.
2.11.60.08 - Notice of Disposition
The Floodplain Administrator or designee shall provide the applicant with a
Notice of Disposition in accordance with Chapter 2.0 - Public Involvement that
includes a written statement of the Land Development Hearings Board's decision,
a reference to findings leading to it, any Conditions of Approval, and the appeal
period deadline.
If a Variance is granted to allow the construction of a building below the Base
Flood level, the property owner shall be put on notice along with the written
decision that the permitted building will have its Lowest Floor below the Base
Flood Elevation or flood depth, and that the cost of flood insurance likely will be
commensurate with the increased flood damage risk.
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)

a. A Floodplain Development Permit Variance shall expire 180 days after
issuance unless:
1. Start of Construction for the permitted activity has occurred and
thereafter is pursued to completion;
2. An extension consistent with Building Permit extension procedures
is granted by the Floodplain Administrator or designee, in cases
where Start of Construction has not yet occurred. However, the
granting of such extension shall also require the Floodplain
Administrator or designee to review the Floodplain Development
Permit Variance activity(ies) relative to the applicable Code
requirements to ensure that the scope of the Variance activities has
not deviated further from Code provisions as a result of any
subsequent Land Development Code Text Amendment(s). If the
Floodplain Administrator or designee finds that the Floodplain
Development Permit Variance has not deviated further from the
applicable Code requirements, then the extension may be granted
by the Floodplain Administrator or designee. If the Floodplain
Administrator or designee finds that the Floodplain Development
Permit Variance does indeed vary further from applicable Code
requirements, then the Floodplain Administrator or designee shall
deny the extension request.

Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 2.12  Lot Development Option Page 1 of 16
CHAPTER 2.12
LOT DEVELOPMENT OPTION
Section 2.12.10 - BACKGROUND
A Lot Development Option provides a means to obtain, within specified thresholds,
variations from some clearly measurable, numerically quantifiable development
standards. The Lot Development Option exists for those circumstances where uniform,
unvarying rules would prevent a more efficient use of a lot or parcel, prevent better
preservation of Significant Natural Features, and/or prevent innovation in site planning
and architectural design. A typical example is permitting a structure to be located closer
to a property boundary than normally allowed by the zone regulations.
A Lot Development Option applies only to existing individual lots or parcels or to
individual lots or parcels that are approved, or requested for approval, as part of a
Tentative Subdivision Plat or Minor Land Partition process. Proposed modifications that
exceed the allowed scopes of Minor and Major Lot Development Options as outlined in
this Chapter need to be sought through the Planned Development process described in
Chapter 2.5 - Planned Development.
Unless otherwise stated in the following chapters, the Lot Development Option process
shall not be used to vary from the minimum and maximum density specified in each
zone, standards in Chapter 2.11 - Floodplain Development Permit, Chapter 4.5 -
Floodplain Provisions, Chapter 4.11 - Minimum Assured Development Area (MADA),
Chapter 4.12 - Significant Vegetation Protection Provisions, Chapter 4.13 - Riparian
Corridor and Wetland Provisions, and Chapter 4.14 - Landslide Hazard and Hillside
Development Provisions. Requests for variations to the requirements in Chapter 4.0 
Improvements Required with Development shall be processed as a Major Lot
Development Option.
[Section 2.12.10 amended by Ordinance 2012-17, effective December 13, 2012]
Section 2.12.20 - PURPOSES
Procedures and standards for the review of Lot Development Options are established in
this Chapter for the following purposes:
a. Permit efficient use of land;
b. Provide flexibility and innovation in site planning and architectural design on
individual lots;
c. Encourage construction techniques and allow building locations that conserve
energy;
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 2.12  Lot Development Option Page 2 of 16
d. Minimize procedural delays and ensure due process in the review of unique
development situations;
e. Provide an avenue for better preservation of Significant Natural Features; and
f. Provide benefits within the development that compensate for the variations from
development standards such that the intent of the development standards is still
met.

PLAN COMPATIBILITY REVIEW
Section 2.13.10 - BACKGROUND
Each zone is intended for a predominant type of land use. Certain other Uses are
permitted, but the intensity and characteristics of those Uses require review to ensure
their compatibility with the site and with nearby land uses. For example, any of the
following may indicate the need for an individual review of the circumstances of
development:
a. Building's size in relation to other buildings in the area;
b. Residential, commercial, or industrial aspects of a proposed development;
c. Character of surrounding development;
d. Traffic capacity of adjacent streets; and
e. Potential environmental effects.
Uses requiring Plan Compatibility Review are specified for each zone. For such Uses,
Plan Compatibility Review is required before a Building Permit can be issued.
Section 2.13.20 - PURPOSES
Procedures and review criteria for Plan Compatibility Review are established for the
following purposes:
a. Encourage originality, flexibility, and innovation in site planning and development,
including architectural, engineering, and landscaping design;
b. Protect neighboring property owners and residents by ensuring reasonable
provisions have been made regarding surface water drainage; suitable sound
and sight buffers; preservation of views, light, and air; and other aspects of
design that may have substantial effects on neighboring land uses;
c. Preserve the City's natural beauty and the quality of its visual character by
ensuring proposed structures or improvements are compatible with the terrain
and existing development; by preventing unnecessary and inappropriate
destruction or blighting of natural landscapes or existing improvements; and by
requiring that proper attention be given to the exterior appearance of structures,
signs, parking areas, landscaping, and other improvements;

CHAPTER 2.14
PARTITIONS, MINOR REPLATS, AND PROPERTY LINE
ADJUSTMENTS
Section 2.14.10 - BACKGROUND
The division of land through a Subdivision process is addressed in Chapter 2.4 -
Subdivisions and Major Replats. A Subdivision occurs where four or more lots are
created in a calendar year, and requires review and approval as specified in Chapter
2.4 - Subdivisions and Major Replats.
This Chapter provides procedural requirements for Residential and Nonresidential
Partitions and Minor Replats (all of which involve the creation of three or fewer parcels
in a calendar year) in addition to Property Line Adjustments and Expedited Land
Divisions involving the creation of three or fewer parcels.
For the purposes of this Chapter, Residential Partitions, Minor Replats, and Property
Line Adjustments are those involving lands with a Zoning Designation of RS-1, RS-3.5,
RS-5, RS-6, RS-9, RS-12, RS-20, and MUR. Nonresidential Partitions, Minor Replats,
and Property Line Adjustments are those with a Zoning Designation other than those for
Residential Partitions, Minor Replats, and Property Line Adjustments. Except on
appeal, each of these is reviewed through a General Development process without a
public hearing. As with Subdivisions, Partitions, Minor Replats, and Property Line
Adjustments are subject to design requirements contained in Article IV of this Code.
An Expedited Land Division procedure shall be used for any qualifying residential
project per ORS 197.360 through 197.380 unless the applicant requests in writing to
have the application reviewed according to the LDC Subdivision or Partition procedures.
[Section 2.14.10 amended by Ordinance 2018-21, effective August 6, 2018]
Section 2.14.20 - PURPOSES
Land Division procedures are established in this Chapter for the following purposes:
a. Ensure that building sites are of sufficient size and appropriate design for their
intended uses and that lots to be created are within density ranges permitted by
the Comprehensive Plan;
b. Minimize negative effects of development upon the natural environment and
incorporate Significant Natural Features into the proposed development where
possible;
c. Ensure economical, safe, and efficient routes for pedestrians, bicycles, and
motor vehicles;
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 2.14  Partitions, Minor Replats, and Property Line Adjustments Page 2 of 17
d. Ensure appropriate levels of urban facilities and services including provisions for
water, drainage, and sewage;
e. Create residential living environments that foster a sense of neighborhood
identity and are protected from the adverse effects of heavy traffic and more
intensive land uses; and
f. Promote energy efficiency.

outright within a zone are considered to be
compatible and not to conflict. Between zones,
compatibility is addressed at the time the zone
is established. A Residential Use permitted
outright within an existing zone is considered to
be compatible with Uses permitted outright
within existing neighboring zones;
c. For Residential Partitions, each proposed
phase must meet all required clear and
objective standards for access, parking,
transportation facilities, utilities, Green Areas,
and drainage without reliance on any
uncompleted phase. Each proposed phase,
and the proposal as a whole, must be designed

LOW DENSITY (RS-6) ZONE
Section 3.3.10 - PURPOSE
This is the primary zone that implements the Low Density Residential Comprehensive
Plan designation, which allows from two to six dwelling units per acre. The RS-6 Zone
is intended to accommodate a broad range of lot sizes and varied Housing Types within
the established density range. This variety is consistent with Comprehensive Plan
policies that support comprehensive neighborhoods and affordable housing.
The RS-6 Zone also permits smaller lots than generally allowed in the RS-3.5 and RS-5
zones, and encourages greater efficiencies in the provision of streets, utilities, and
usable Green Area.
The RS-6 Zone shall be applied to all lands zoned RS-6 as of the adoption of this Code.
Additionally, the RS-6 Zone applies to single-family residential areas that are unplatted,
greater than one acre in size, and that were zoned RS-5 at the time of adoption of this
Code. With the exception of properties indicated on the Comprehensive Plan Map as
being eligible for the RS-1 (Extra-low Density) Residential Zone, all Low Density
Residential lands shall be zoned RS-6 (Low Density) Residential upon their annexation.

Section 3.4.50 - CONVERSION OF A STRUCTURE TO A PROFESSIONAL AND
ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES USE TYPE
The predominate purpose of the RS-9 Zone is to retain residential unit availability;
however, within the zone there are structures that, due primarily to their size, condition,
or age, should not be restricted to residential use only. Therefore, the City may allow
conversion through a Conditional Development in accordance with Chapter 2.3 -
Conditional Development, to the Professional and Administrative Services Use Type,
using the review criteria below.
3.4.50.01 - Size Limitation
a. Structures must be 4,000 sq. ft. or more and built before December 31,
2006;
OR
b. Structures must meet all the locational criteria associated with a Major or
Minor Neighborhood Center zone outlined in Section 3.14.20.a, with the
exception of 3.14.20.a.4 (no Shopping Street frontage is required).
3.4.50.02 - Burden of Proof
The developer shall prove that:
a. The structure cannot feasibly be used for the uses permitted in Section
3.4.20.01 without creating undue financial hardship for both tenants and
owners. This may be proved by meeting both of the following:
1. Providing factual data and information on the potential costs of
using the structure for residential use compared to estimated
potential rent or purchase prices for tenants or owners. Factual
data and information on the potential costs of using the structure for
residential use shall pertain to items such as heating and cooling
bills, costs of renovation and repair, continued maintenance, costs
for acquisition of additional land, construction for parking, etc.; and
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 3.4  Medium Density (RS-9) Zone Page 10 of 12
2. Demonstrating that an earnest effort has been made to retain the
structure for residential use through established marketing
procedures such as advertising, brochures, telephone contact,
contact with real estate and marketing professionals, etc.
OR
b. It is in the best interest of the community to convert the structure to the
Professional and Administrative Services Use Type. This may be proved
by meeting either of the following:
1. Showing that the structure is included on the Corvallis Register of
Historic Landmarks and Districts; and, demonstrating that
substantial alterations would be necessary to retain the structure for
residential use and that alterations would result in the loss or
reduction of Historical Significance or architectural significance.
OR
2. Showing that the structures, or portions of structures, proposed to
be converted meet the locational criteria from 3.4.50.01.b; and
demonstrating that the proposed conversion is consistent with the
Zone Change Review Criteria in LDC Section 2.2.40.05. If all
applicable criteria are met, a proposed conversion would be
considered to be consistent with Comprehensive Plan Policies
8.10.5 and 8.12.4; however, proposed conversions in the North 9th
Street area will not be allowed, consistent with the direction of
Comprehensive Plan Policy 8.12.1.
3.4.50.03 - Development Site Design
To ensure that the character of the structure and site will be preserved after
conversion, the applicant shall be required to submit plans, in addition to the site
plan required in Chapter 2.3 - Conditional Development, that indicate the
following:
a. Proposed exterior facade treatment;
b. Interior remodeling with respect to major structural changes;
c. Landscaping;
d. Proposed signage;
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 3.4  Medium Density (RS-9) Zone Page 11 of 12
e. Changes resulting from the conversion that will upgrade the structure and
site and aid in the retention of Historically Significant or architecturally
significant elements; and
f. Any other structural or site changes that would affect the structure's
character.
3.4.50.04 - Required Off-Street Parking
The City recognizes that Section 3.4.50 sometimes applies to structures with little
or no property for off-street parking either on or off the site. Where it is found that
the review criteria of Chapter 2.3 - Conditional Development have been met, offstreet
parking is allowed in any adjoining blocks where adequate parking can be
made available.

previously existed; however, current parking standards in Chapter 4.1 - Parking,
Loading, and Access Requirements shall be met even if these requirements interfere
with reestablishment of the original structure.
Section 3.4.70 - REDEVELOPMENT OF EXISTING OFFICES IN NORTH CAMPUS
AREA
Existing offices are Permitted Uses and may be redeveloped if desired. The
redeveloped building may occupy the existing building envelope and shall meet the

the site, especially as large areas rather than as isolated smaller areas,
where there is an opportunity to provide a recreational or relaxation use in
conjunction with the natural resource site;
b. Protecting lands where development more intensive than a Green Area
use may have a downstream impact on the ecosystem of the vicinity. The
ecosystem in the vicinity could include stands of mixed species and
conifer trees, natural hydrological features, wildlife feeding areas, etc.;
c. Enhancing park sites adjacent to the convergence of sidewalks and/or
multi-use paths;
d. Enhancing recreational opportunities near neighborhood commercial
activity centers; and
e. Enhancing opportunities for passive relaxation and recreation for
residents, employees, and/or visitors within a development site.

Section 3.6.60 - CONVERSION OF A STRUCTURE TO A PROFESSIONAL AND
ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES USE TYPE
The predominant purpose of the RS-12 Zone is to retain residential unit availability;
however, within the zone there are structures that, due primarily to their size, condition,
location, or age, should not be restricted to residential use only. Therefore, the City
may allow conversion through a Conditional Development, in accordance with Chapter
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 3.6  Medium-High Density (RS-12) Zone Page 12 of 14
2.3 - Conditional Development, to the Professional and Administrative Services Use
Type, using the review criteria below.
3.6.60.01 - Size Limitation
a. Structures must be 4,000 sq. ft. or more and built before December 31,
2006.
OR
b. Structures must meet all the locational criteria associated with a Major or
Minor Neighborhood Center zone outlined in Section 3.14.20.a, with the
exception of 3.14.20.a.4 (no Shopping Street frontage is required).
3.6.60.02 - Burden of Proof
The developer shall prove that:
a. The structure cannot feasibly be used for the Uses permitted in Section
3.6.20.01 without creating undue financial hardship for both tenants and
owners. This may be proved by meeting both of the following:
1. Providing factual data and information on the potential costs of
using the structure for Residential Use compared to estimated
potential rent or purchase prices for tenants or owners. Factual
data and information on the potential costs of using the structure for
Residential Use shall pertain to items such as heating and cooling
bills, costs of renovation and repair, continued maintenance, costs
for acquisition of additional land, construction for parking, etc.; and
2. Demonstrating that an earnest effort has been made to retain the
structure for Residential Use through established marketing
procedures such as advertising, brochures, telephone contact,
contact with real estate and marketing professionals, etc.
OR
b. It is in the best interest of the community to convert the structure to the
Professional and Administrative Services Use Type. This may be proved
by meeting either of the following:
1. Showing that the structure is included on the Corvallis Register of
Historic Landmarks and Districts; and demonstrating that
substantial alterations would be necessary to retain the structure for
Residential Use and that alterations would result in the loss or
reduction of Historical Significance or architectural significance;
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 3.6  Medium-High Density (RS-12) Zone Page 13 of 14
OR
2. Showing that the structures, or portions of structures, proposed to
be converted meet the locational criteria from 3.4.50.01.b; and
demonstrating that the proposed conversion is consistent with the
Zone Change Review Criteria in LDC Section 2.2.40.05. If all
applicable criteria are met, a proposed conversion would be
considered to be consistent with Comprehensive Plan Policies
8.10.5 and 8.12.4; however, proposed conversions in the North 9th
Street area will not be allowed, consistent with the direction of
Comprehensive Plan Policy 8.12.1.
3.6.60.03 - Development Site Design
To ensure that the character of the structure and site will be preserved after
conversion, the applicant shall be required to submit plans in addition to the site
plan required in Chapter 2.3 - Conditional Development that indicate the
following:
a. Proposed exterior facade treatment;
b. Interior remodeling pertaining to major structural changes;
c. Landscaping;
d. Proposed signage;
e. Changes resulting from the conversion that will upgrade the structure and
site and aid in the retention of Historically Significant or architecturally
significant elements; and
f. Any other structural or site changes that would affect the structure's
character.
3.6.60.04 - Required Off-Street Parking
The City recognizes that Section 3.6.60 sometimes applies to structures with little
or no property for off-street parking either on or off the site. Where it is found that
the review criteria of Chapter 2.3 - Conditional Development have been met, offstreet
parking is allowed in any adjoining blocks where adequate parking can be
made available.

Section 3.8.60 - CONVERSION OF A UNIT TO A PROFESSIONAL AND
ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES USE TYPES
The predominant purpose of the RS-20 Zone is to retain residential unit availability;
however, within the zone are structures that, due primarily to their size, condition, or
age, should not be restricted to residential use only. Therefore, the City may allow
conversion through a Conditional Development, in accordance with Chapter 2.3 -
Conditional Development, to the Professional and Administrative Services Use Type,
using the review criteria below.
3.8.60.01 - Size Limitation
a. Structures must be 4,000 sq. ft. or more and built before December 31,
2006.
OR
b. Structures must meet all the locational criteria associated with a Major or
Minor Neighborhood Center zone outlined in Section 3.14.20.a, with the
exception of 3.14.20.a.4 (no Shopping Street frontage is required).
3.8.60.02 - Burden of Proof
The developer shall prove that:
a. The structure cannot feasibly be used for the uses permitted in Section
3.8.20.01 without creating undue financial hardship for both tenants and
owners. This may be proved by meeting both of the following:
1. Providing factual data and information on the potential costs of
using the structure for Residential Use compared to estimated
potential rent or purchase prices for tenants or owners. Factual
data and information on the potential costs of using the structure for
Residential Use shall pertain to items such as heating and cooling
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 3.8  High Density (RS-20) Zone Page 14 of 16
bills, costs of renovation and repair, continued maintenance, costs
for acquisition of additional land, construction for parking, etc.; and
2. Demonstrating that an earnest effort has been made to retain the
structure for Residential Use through established marketing
procedures such as advertising, brochures, telephone contact,
contact with real estate and marketing professionals, etc.
OR
b. It is in the best interest of the community to convert the structure to the
Professional and Administrative Services Use Type. This may be proved
by meeting either of the following:
1. Showing that the structure is included on the Corvallis Register of
Historic Landmarks and Districts; and demonstrating that
substantial alterations would be necessary to retain the structure for
Residential Use and that alterations would result in the loss or
reduction of Historical Significance or architectural significance.
OR
2. Showing that the structures, or portions of structures, proposed to
be converted meet the locational criteria from 3.4.50.01.b; and
demonstrating that the proposed conversion is consistent with the
Zone Change Review Criteria in LDC Section 2.2.40.05. If all
applicable criteria are met, a proposed conversion would be
considered to be consistent with Comprehensive Plan Policies
8.10.5 and 8.12.4; however, proposed conversions in the North 9th
Street area will not be allowed, consistent with the direction of
Comprehensive Plan Policy 8.12.1.
3.8.60.03 - Development Site Design
To ensure that the character of the structure and site will be preserved after
conversion, the applicant shall be required to submit plans in addition to the site
plan required in Chapter 2.3 - Conditional Development, that indicate the
following:
a. Proposed exterior facade treatment;
b. Interior remodeling pertaining to major structural changes;
c. Landscaping;
d. Proposed signage;
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 3.8  High Density (RS-20) Zone Page 15 of 16
e. Changes resulting from the conversion that will upgrade the structure and
site and aid in the retention of Historically Significant or architecturally
significant elements; and
f. Any other structural or site changes that would affect the structure's
character.
3.8.60.04 - Required Off-street Parking
The City recognizes that Section 3.8.60 sometimes applies to structures with little
or no property for off-street parking either on or off the site. Where it is found that
the review criteria of Chapter 2.3 - Conditional Development have been met, offstreet
parking is allowed in any adjoining blocks where adequate parking can be
made available.

Existing offices are Permitted Uses and may be redeveloped if desired. The
redeveloped building may occupy the existing building envelope and shall meet the
parking standards contained in Chapter 4.1 - Parking, Loading, and Access
Requirements, even if these requirements interfere with the redevelopment.
Section 3.8.80 - MIX OF HOUSING TYPES
A mix of permitted Housing Types is encouraged in the RS-20 Zone and shall be
required for larger development projects in the zone. To promote such a mix,
developments greater than five acres in size shall comply with the variety of Housing
Types requirements outlined in Chapter 4.9 - Additional Provisions.

CHAPTER 3.9
MIXED USE RESIDENTIAL (MUR) ZONE
Section 3.9.10 - PURPOSE
The Mixed Use Residential (MUR) Zone is established to increase housing
opportunities in close proximity to designated commercial zones. The MUR Zone is
intended primarily for development of multi-family housing at densities high enough to
support the retail uses of the adjacent commercial zones and to provide residents with
direct and convenient access to commercial services.
Varied Housing Types are encouraged in the MUR Zone. Small-scale retail, office, and
service uses are also allowed when they are developed as part of a mixed-use building.
Design standards for the MUR Zone emphasize intensive development with building
orientation to the street, as described in Chapter 4.10 - Pedestrian Oriented Design
Standards. These design standards are tailored to the type of use proposed, such as
townhouse, multi-family, and/or mixed use.
Section 3.9.20 - GENERAL PROVISIONS - Establishment of the MUR Zone
The MUR Zone designation shall apply to lands identified as MUR on the Official Zoning
Map as of December 31, 2006, except as amended in accordance with the provisions of
this Chapter and Chapter 2.2 - Zone Changes. Through a legislative or quasi-judicial
process consistent with Chapter 2.2 - Zone Changes and Chapter 2.0 - Public
Involvement, the MUR Zone may also be applied to properties designated Medium-high
Density or High Density Residential on the Comprehensive Plan Map.
The following locational and dimensional criteria apply to the MUR Zone.
a. Locational Criteria
The following locational criteria shall be applied to Zone Changes, in conjunction
with Chapter 2.2 - Zone Changes and Chapter 2.0 - Public Involvement.
1. The MUR Zone designation shall be applied only to properties that are
contiguous with property designated Commercial on the Comprehensive
Plan Map;
2. The outer boundary of the MUR Zone shall extend no farther than 450 ft.
(1.5 to 2 blocks) from the edge of the adjacent commercially designated
property. Variations from this locational criteria may be requested through
the Planned Development process outlined in Chapter 2.5 - Planned
Development; and
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 3.9  Mixed Use Residential (MUR) Zone Page 2 of 15
3. Unless designated on the Transportation Plan Map, streets shall not make
up the boundaries of an MUR Zone when the zone abuts a Low Density
Residential zone, except for existing situations as of December 31, 2006.
b. Dimensional Criteria
A new MUR Zone shall consist of at least one whole legal lot or parcel if the lot or
parcel is one acre or smaller in size. When multiple tax lots or parcels are
included, portions of individual lots or parcels at least one acre in size may be
included, provided the size of the remainder of each lot or parcel is developable
under its zoning designation. Existing public street rights-of-way shall not count
toward the total area of a zone.

Chapter 3.14  Neighborhood Center (NC) Zone Page 1 of 18
CHAPTER 3.14
NEIGHBORHOOD CENTER (NC) ZONE
Section 3.14.10 - PURPOSE
The Neighborhood Center (NC) Zone implements the Minor and Major Neighborhood
Center Comprehensive Plan designations. The Neighborhood Center Zone is intended
to provide for concentrations of Civic Uses, retail businesses, commercial and personal
service activities, and residential/commercial mixed use developments in the core of
comprehensive neighborhoods, as envisioned by the Comprehensive Plan.
Commercial Uses in Minor Neighborhood Centers are intended to serve neighborhood
shopping and office needs. Commercial uses in Major Neighborhood Centers are
intended to serve broader community shopping and office needs in addition to the
needs of the nearby neighborhood. Both Minor and Major Neighborhood Centers are
encouraged to the maximum extent possible to include Civic uses that support the
nearby comprehensive neighborhood. In Major Neighborhood Centers, such civic uses
may also serve a larger population.
The Neighborhood Center Zone also serves these purposes:
a. Locates a range of businesses within convenient walking and cycling distance of
residential areas;
b. Ensures human-scale development oriented to pedestrian-friendly Shopping
Streets;
c. Supports the use of alternative modes of transportation, including walking, riding
transit, and bicycling;
d. Develops neighborhood cores at an appropriate human scale, while minimizing
hazards, noise, traffic congestion, and other related effects of commercial
concentrations;
e. Implements the Comprehensive Plan provisions for development of Minor and
Major Neighborhood Commercial Centers by establishing Minor NC and Major
NC Zones on the Official Zoning Map; and
f. Provides useful public spaces serving the neighborhood core and surrounding
uses.
Section 3.14.20 - GENERAL PROVISIONS - Establishment of the NC Zone
The NC Zone designation shall apply to lands identified as NC on the Official Zoning
Map as of December 31, 2006, except as amended in accordance with the provisions of
this Chapter, Chapter 2.2 - Zone Changes, and applicable Comprehensive Plan
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 3.14  Neighborhood Center (NC) Zone Page 2 of 18
policies. Zone Changes to establish new NC Zones may be applied only to properties
designated Mixed Use Commercial (MUC) on the Comprehensive Plan Map as of
December 31, 2006, or properties to which this designation is applied through a
subsequent or concurrent Comprehensive Plan Map Amendment. The NC Zone also
may be applied through a legislative process in accordance with the procedures
identified in Chapter 2.0 - Public Involvement. The designation of Minor NC or Major
NC shall be applied when the Zone is established.
The following locational and dimensional criteria shall apply to new NC Zones.
a. Locational Criteria
The following locational criteria shall be applied to Zone Changes, in conjunction
with Chapter 2.2 - Zone Changes.
1. The Major NC Zone designation may be applied only to parcels at or near
an intersection of Collector and/or Arterial Streets.
2. The Minor NC Zone may be applied to parcels at or near intersections of
Neighborhood Collector, Collector, or Arterial Streets. Intersections may
also include a Local or Local Connector Street, provided that it intersects
with a Neighborhood Collector, Collector, or Arterial Street.
3. As much as practicable, NC Zone boundaries shall occur such that similar
Uses face each other along street frontages.
4. The Minor NC Zone shall have at least 100 ft. of frontage and the Major
NC Zone at least 200 ft. of frontage either along an existing or planned
Shopping Street, as defined in Chapter 4.0 - Improvements Required with
Development, or along a dedicated public square or plaza. See Figure

CHAPTER 3.15
RIVERFRONT (RF) ZONE
Section 3.15.10 - PURPOSE
The Riverfront (RF) Zone implements the Central Business Comprehensive Plan
designation for a portion of the core downtown area. It is intended to provide an area
for Commercial, Civic, and Residential Uses, and to merge downtown with the
Riverfront Commemorative Park in a pedestrian-friendly, multi-use neighborhood that
focuses on the river. While the Zone does not permit new Low Density Residential
Building Types, it does encourage dwelling units in, or attached to, buildings containing
commercial activities.
Development in the Riverfront Zone is intended to enhance public safety and the
pedestrian experience by encouraging the presence of citizens 24 hours a day. Allowed
Uses such as retail, office and restaurants with windows to the sidewalk, and a
residential neighborhood promote the greatest public access and activity. Large-scale
civic and cultural facilities are encouraged in the Riverfront Zone, provided the Uses and
activities promote the basic function of the Zone. Such Uses shall be reviewed for their
character and contribution to the viability of the Riverfront Zone and to the Central
Business Zone, and may be reviewed under the procedures outlined in Chapter 2.12 -
Lot Development Option or Chapter 2.5 - Planned Development, should variations to
development standards be needed.
Safe, adequate, and convenient parking for employees, customers, and residents is
desired through the use of on-street parking and parking facilities that are functionally
and visually compatible with the pedestrian orientation of the area. Structured parking
facilities are encouraged to promote Use densities that enhance the intended high level
of neighborhood safety and pedestrian activity within the multi-use neighborhood. To
the extent that they meet the other purposes of the RF Zone and other requirements of
this Code, creative measures to provide needed parking within the RF Zone and
potentially within the Central Business Zone are encouraged to foster communitypreferred
activities in the RF Zone.
Section 3.15.20 - GENERAL PROVISIONS

personal service activities of limited sizes, with larger Uses in the Major Neighborhood
Center Zone, and mixed use developments, accommodating both pedestrian oriented
Uses and a limited number of land uses that are more dependent on automobile
circulation.
The MUCS Zone also serves these purposes:
a. Provides transitions from a linear pattern of commercial development toward a
pedestrian-friendly environment;
b. Locates a range of complementary businesses close to each other;
c. Provides human-scale development to the greatest extent practicable;
d. Mitigates the adverse effects of automobile-oriented development on the
pedestrian environment;
e. Supports the use of alternative modes of transportation, including walking, riding
transit, and bicycling;
f. Minimizes hazards, noise, traffic congestion, and other related effects of
commercial concentrations; and

Section 3.19.40 - DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
3.19.40.01 - Use and Building Size
a. The maximum size of a Use is established in Table 3.19-1 - Permitted Use
Types.
b. The maximum building footprint shall be 25,000 sq. ft., except for Lodging
Services Use Types and Residential Use Types, for which no limits are
established.
c. Any building containing over 25,000 sq. ft. of gross floor area shall
accommodate the additional floor area on additional floors. Full floors,
partial floors and/or mezzanines comply with this standard.
d. Building footprints in excess of 25,000 sq. ft. existing prior to December
31, 2006, and in conformance with the Code on that date, or constructed
pursuant to a valid Conceptual or Detailed Development Plan approved
prior to December 31, 2006, shall not be classified as nonconforming
structures. In such structures, change in Use from the Use existing prior
to December 31, 2006, and in conformance with the Code on that date to
a Use otherwise permitted, but for the maximum Use size limitation, shall
be permitted.
Similarly, in buildings with interior portions in excess of 10,000 sq. ft.
existing prior to December 31, 2006, and in conformance with the Code on
that date, change in Use from an existing Permitted Use to a Use
otherwise permitted, but for the maximum Use size limitation, shall be
permitted. In each case, the change of Use shall be considered through
the permit procedure identified in Table 3.19-1 - Permitted Use Types.
3.19.40.02 - Thresholds for Determining the Applicable Review Procedure -
Commercial Uses
The permit procedures for Commercial Uses in the MUCS Zone shall be as
identified in Table 3.19-1 - Permitted Use Types. The size of each Use is
determined based on the total gross floor area of the Use. For the purposes of
the MUCS Zone, floor area also includes unenclosed areas needed for
automobile circulation for Car Washes, Fuel Sales, and Drive-through Facilities
Uses. For these specific Uses, these unenclosed areas include those needed for
operational use, queuing, and service areas, with the exception of areas needed
for customer and employee parking, as defined in Chapter 3.0 - Use
Classifications.
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 3.19  Mixed Use Community Shopping (MUCS) Zone Page 13 of 17
3.19.40.03 - Commercial Floor Area Ratio
Minimum commercial Floor Area Ratios (FARs) are required for all property with
a Mixed Use Community Shopping designation. This requirement ensures that
commercial land is preserved for primarily commercial purposes. For an
explanation of how to apply/calculate FARs, see the definition of Floor Area Ratio
in Chapter 1.6 - Definitions.
All commercial and mixed use developments shall comply with the following
standards for commercial floor area:
a. For Commercial Use Types, the minimum FAR shall be 0.25 and the
maximum FAR shall be 1.0. When a project is composed of two or more
phases, development in each phase shall fall within the minimum and
maximum FAR requirements or an alternative FAR requirement proposed
and approved through a Planned Development Review process.
b. Residential Uses and structured parking shall not be included in the
maximum FAR.
c. To increase the FAR above the established maximum, a proponent must
apply for a Planned Development in accordance with Chapter 2.5 -
Planned Development. However, in all cases, the Primary Use of the
property(ies) shall be commercial. As mentioned in "a," above, when a
project is composed of two or more phases, development in each phase
shall fall within the minimum and maximum FAR requirements or an
alternative FAR requirement proposed and approved through a Planned
Development Review process.
3.19.40.04 - Mixed Use Development
a. Residential Uses located on the ground floor shall not exceed 50 percent
of the ground-floor space of the parcel; the Planned Development process
may be used to transfer ground-floor Commercial and Residential Uses
between parcels in the same development, resulting in stand-alone
residential structures, provided that no more than 50 percent of the
ground-floor space in the development is residential.
b. Mixed use developments shall comply with the Green Area standards in
Chapter 3.9 - Mixed Use Residential (MUR) Zone, except that a minimum
of 10 percent of the lot area shall be landscaping or preserved vegetation.
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 3.19  Mixed Use Community Shopping (MUCS) Zone Page 14 of 17
c. The minimum residential density for mixed use projects involving stand
alone residential buildings shall be 20 units per acre. For mixed use
buildings, no minimum densities are established. For purposes of this
standard, residential density shall be calculated only for the portion of the
site being used for Residential Use. Modifications to the 20 units/acre
density requirements for developments with stand-alone residential
buildings can be requested through a Planned Development Review
process in accordance with Chapter 2.5 - Planned Development.
3.19.40.05 - Setbacks
a. Front Setback - Structures may be built to the property line, but no closer
to the street than the width of the standard planting strip and sidewalk for
that street classification. A maximum setback of 20 ft. from either the
property line or the line marking the outer boundary of the standard
planting strip and sidewalk for that street classification shall apply to all
building sites, except as provided in "1," through "3," below. However, in
no case shall parking facilities or circulation facilities, such as driveways
and queues, be allowed between the building front and the street.
1. Exceptions for Improved Pedestrian and Automobile Circulation -
The maximum setback may be increased by 50 percent through a
Conditional Development approval when the Planning Commission
finds that an increased setback will provide for improved pedestrian
circulation and safety and improved vehicular access management
outside the public rights-of-way. For example, objectives for both
pedestrians and vehicles can be met through the provision of
shared driveways, connected parking lots, improved pedestrian
connections between buildings and the street sidewalk, and internal
connections between adjoining buildings.
2. Exceptions Granted through Conditional Development/Planned
Development Review - In conformance with Section 3.19.20.01.c,
the maximum setback may be increased to provide for the following
features:
a) Pedestrian amenities in conformance with Chapter 4.10 -
Pedestrian Oriented Design Standards;
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 3.19  Mixed Use Community Shopping (MUCS) Zone Page 15 of 17
b) An internal Shopping Street consistent with the requirements
of Section 4.0.60.m of Chapter 4.0 - Improvements Required
with Development;
c) Protection of Significant Natural Features protected by

Vegetation Protection Provisions, Chapter 4.13 - Riparian
Corridor and Wetland Provisions, and/or Chapter 4.14 -
Landslide Hazard and Hillside Development Provisions; or
d) Compliance with other Sections of this Code.
3. Exceptions for Interior Buildings - Buildings interior to a
development site are exempt from this requirement, provided other
buildings on the site meet the requirement.
b. Side and Rear Setbacks and Building Separations - The following
setbacks shall apply:
1. No minimum setback adjacent to Mixed Use General Commercial
(MUGC), Neighborhood Center (NC), and Industrial (GI, II) zones.
2. 20 ft. minimum setback adjacent to Low and Medium Density
Residential zones; buffering shall be provided in accordance with
Chapter 4.2 - Landscaping, Buffering, Screening, and Lighting.
3. 10 ft. minimum setback adjacent to Medium-high and High Density
Residential zones; buffering shall be provided in accordance with
Chapter 4.2 - Landscaping, Buffering, Screening, and Lighting.
3.19.40.06 - Alleys and Access Consolidation
a. Alleys shall be required for all newly created blocks in the MUCS Zone and
provided in accordance with the standards in Chapter 4.0 - Improvements
Required with Development. This standard is intended to apply to
undeveloped sites that can accommodate new blocks developed in
accordance with block standards in Chapter 4.0 - Improvements Required
with Development. Although adherence to this standard is encouraged, it is
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 3.19  Mixed Use Community Shopping (MUCS) Zone Page 16 of 17
not necessarily intended to apply to redevelopment of or intensification of
Uses on developed sites.
b. With development, access consolidation, particularly along Arterial
Streets, shall be required to the maximum extent practicable. Access
consolidation shall be accomplished as approved by the City Engineer,
and/or as required by applicable access control plans approved by the
City Council. Connectivity between adjacent parking and vehicle
circulation areas, internal to development sites, shall be implemented
where practicable.
3.19.40.07 - Compliance with Chapter 4.10 - Pedestrian Oriented Design
Standards
The requirements in Chapter 4.10 - Pedestrian Oriented Design Standards shall
apply to the following types of development in the MUCS Zone:
a. All new buildings or structures for which a valid permit application has
been submitted after December 31, 2006;
b. Developments subject to Conditional Development and/or Planned
Development approval, as required by a Condition(s) of Approval(s); and
c. Independent or cumulative expansion of a commercial or civic structure in
existence and in compliance with the Code on December 31, 2006, or
constructed after December 31, 2006 pursuant to a valid Conceptual or
Detailed Development Plan approved on or before December 31, 2006,
shall comply with the pedestrian requirements of Chapter 4.10 -
Pedestrian Oriented Design Standards as outlined in Section 4.10.70.01.
3.19.40.08 - Structure Height
No structure shall exceed 45 ft. in height.
3.19.40.09 - Monument Sign Exceptions
In cases where street visibility of a business in a conforming structure
established prior to December 31, 2006, is significantly reduced due to new
construction on adjacent property, and the 100-ft. minimum separation
requirement for freestanding signs in Section 4.7.80.02.c of Chapter 4.7 - Sign
Regulations otherwise precludes any street signage associated with the
structure, a single monument sign a maximum of eight ft. high and 32 sq. ft. in
area, which otherwise meets the requirements of Chapter 4.7 - Sign Regulations,
is permitted.

MIXED USE GENERAL COMMERCIAL (MUGC) ZONE
Section 3.20.10 - PURPOSE
The Mixed Use General Commercial (MUGC) Zone implements the Mixed Use
Commercial Comprehensive Plan designation in areas located outside the mixed use
Neighborhood Center Zone and Mixed Use Community Shopping Zone. It is intended
to provide areas for those commercial and related services and businesses that
generally require extensive outside storage, are not Retail or Office Uses, or have
characteristics with less pedestrian orientation than other commercial zones. Site and
building design in the MUGC Zone is intended to comply with pedestrian- and humanscale
policies of the Comprehensive Plan, while recognizing and providing for Uses that
may conflict with pedestrian access and the character of the other commercial zones.
Section 3.20.20 - GENERAL PROVISIONS - Establishment of the MUGC Zone
Zone Changes to establish new MUGC Zones may be applied only to properties
designated Mixed Use Commercial (MUC) on the Comprehensive Plan Map as of
December 31, 2006, or as established though a subsequent or concurrent
Comprehensive Plan Map Amendment. The MUGC Zone also may be applied through
a legislative process in accordance with Chapter 2.0 - Public Involvement. The
following locational and dimensional criteria shall apply to any new MUGC Zone.
a. Locational Criteria - The following locational criteria shall be applied to Zone
Changes, in conjunction with Chapter 2.2 - Zone Changes.
1. The MUGC Zone shall have at least 50 ft. of frontage along a Collector or

CHAPTER 3.21
MIXED USE TRANSITIONAL (MUT) ZONE
Section 3.21.10 - PURPOSE
This Zone implements the Mixed Use Transitional (MUT) Comprehensive Plan
designation. The MUT Comprehensive Plan designation should be applied to existing
industrial areas that are identified, through an area Refinement Plan, as being desirable
for transition over time to less intensive Uses. The MUT Zone provides a mechanism to
permit the introduction of new, less intensive Uses while allowing General and Intensive
Industrial Uses to remain during an indefinite period of transition. It also addresses
limitations on re-intensification of Uses that have previously transitioned from General or
Intensive Industrial Uses to less intensive activities.
Key objectives of the MUT Zone include reducing conflicts between Industrial and less
intensive Uses located nearby; providing an opportunity to develop a mix of nonindustrial
Uses in the Zone that are compatible with surrounding land uses; transitioning
to new, less conflicting Uses; and achieving the transition in a way that is fair and
preserves value and flexibility for the industrial businesses located within the MUT
Zone.
Section 3.21.20 - GENERAL PROVISIONS
3.21.20.01 - Establishment of the MUT Zone
The MUT Zone may be applied to properties with an MUT designation on the
Comprehensive Plan Map.
3.21.20.02 - Zone Size and Dimensions
The size of the MUT Zone shall be established through an area Refinement Plan.
Public street rights-of-way shall not count toward the total area of the Zone.
Section 3.21.30 - PERMITTED USES
Land use in the MUT Zone shall conform to the list of Permitted Use Types in Table
3.21-1 - Permitted Use Types. Ministerial Development involving Use Types permitted
outright are identified with a P. General Development involving Use Types subject to
Chapter 2.13 - Plan Compatibility Review are identified with a PC. Special
Development involving Use Types subject to Chapter 2.3 - Conditional Development
and Chapter 2.5 - Planned Development are identified with a CD and a PD,
respectively. Uses identified with an N are not permitted.

The following provisions identify development standards within the MUT Zone for all
development of a Civic, Commercial, Limited Manufacturing, or Residential Use Type.
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 3.21  Mixed Use Transitional (MUT) Zone Page 10 of 18
3.21.50.01 - Minimum Lot Area and Setback Requirements
a. A setback of not less than 25 ft. shall be provided along each MUT Zone
boundary line abutting any Residential (RS) zone. Off-street parking and
loading shall be permitted in this area except within 15 ft. of the Zone
boundary line, which shall not be used for any Permitted Use, activity, or
structure other than fences, walls, driveways, or walks. Driveways,
parking, and loading areas adjacent to residential zones shall be
landscaped and screened in accordance with Chapter 4.2 - Landscaping,
Buffering, Screening, and Lighting.
b. Residential structures shall be developed in accordance with Chapter 3.8 -
High Density (RS-20) Zone and the design guidelines in this Chapter.
c. For maximum permitted setbacks, see Section 3.21.60.02.
3.21.50.02 - Structure Height
Structure height shall not exceed 45 ft. unless a site is developed as a Planned
or Conditional Development and in a manner compatible with any adjacent
residential property(ies), in which case the structure height may be increased up
to 75 ft. See Section 3.21.60.09 - Neighborhood Compatibility.
3.21.50.03 - Green Area Standards
A minimum of 20 percent of the total site area shall be retained as Green Area.
Green Area may include landscape areas, natural areas, and/or pedestrian
amenities consistent with Section 3.21.60.07, except that a minimum of 15
percent of the required Green Area shall be landscaping or preserved vegetation.
The site design and building design standards of this Chapter shall also be met.
3.21.50.04 - Off-street Parking
Off-street parking shall be provided in accordance with Chapter 4.1 - Parking,
Loading, and Access Requirements. Required parking shall be provided on the
same site as the Use or upon abutting property. Contiguity can be achieved
across street rights-of-way except on Arterial and Collector Streets where there is
not a controlled intersection within 100 ft. of the subject property. Chapter 4.1 -
Parking, Loading, and Access Requirements, allows adjustments to minimum
parking standards where transit service and bicycle parking are available.
Additional flexibility for required vehicle parking may be granted in the MUT Zone
in conformance with the following standards:
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 3.21  Mixed Use Transitional (MUT) Zone Page 11 of 18
a. Shared parking agreements may be used to provide additional reductions
in required parking, provided the applicant demonstrates an adequate
supply of parking for each Use. Identification of surplus parking during
peak periods or surplus capacity provided due to off-peak use are
methods of demonstrating this adequacy.
b. Additional flexibility to vehicle parking provisions may be granted
consistent with Chapter 2.12 - Lot Development Option, when the site is
less than three acres, or Chapter 2.5 - Planned Development. This
flexibility is provided to encourage development patterns that reduce
reliance on the automobile by taking advantage of alternate modes of
travel.
Section 3.21.60 - DESIGN GUIDELINES AND STANDARDS FOR CIVIC,
COMMERCIAL, LIMITED MANUFACTURING, AND RESIDENTIAL USE TYPES
3.21.60.01 - Coordinated Development
New development shall be designed in a manner that does not preclude
development of adjacent property(ies) and that ensures the logical and efficient
extension of public facilities and services, including but not limited to sanitary
sewer, water, storm drainage, and street and pedestrian facility connections.
3.21.60.02 - Building Orientation and Maximum Setbacks
a. All new buildings in the MUT Zone shall be oriented to existing or
proposed public streets or to private streets as approved by the City.
Building orientation is demonstrated by placing buildings and their public
entrances close to streets so that pedestrians have a direct and
convenient route from the street sidewalk to building entrances.
b. At least one major public entrance should be oriented to each street that
the building abuts. Corner entrances may be used to provide entrance
orientation to two streets, provided that the length of the building adjacent
to the street does not exceed 50 ft.
c. Building setbacks from streets or plazas shall not exceed 20 ft. except
when necessary to preserve healthy, mature tree(s), to provide pedestrian
amenities in conformance with Section 3.21.60.07, or to accommodate
handicapped access requirements. A further exception to these setback
requirements may be considered when the site is fronted by more than
two streets.
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 3.21  Mixed Use Transitional (MUT) Zone Page 12 of 18
3.21.60.03 - Corner Building Entrances
For all new buildings or when redevelopment opportunities allow, the design of
corner lot buildings should reinforce public intersections as public spaces.
Corner building entrances with weather protection or other architectural features
may be required to ensure that this guideline is met. The maximum allowable
building setback in Section 3.21.60.02 may be increased when the building
design incorporates seating, plazas, and other public amenities, as defined by
Section 3.21.60.07.
3.21.60.04 - Weather Protection
a. Where new industrial development is constructed adjacent to street
sidewalks or pedestrian plazas, a six ft.-wide, weather-protected area
such as awnings or canopies shall be provided over the primary entrance.
b. Where new commercial or residential development is constructed adjacent
to street sidewalks or pedestrian plazas, a six ft.-wide, weather-protected
area, such as awnings or canopies, shall be provided along all portions of
building(s) adjacent to the sidewalks and/or plazas.
c. For existing development, weather protection, as identified in "a," and "b,"
above, shall be provided when there are alterations, repairs, or additions
to existing structures. However, an exception to this weather protection
standard may be requested where the applicant can demonstrate, to the
satisfaction of the Director, that the cost of improvements to the existing
structure is less than four times the cost of providing an awning. In
addition, where existing weather protection is at least four ft. in width, an
exception to this standard may be authorized.
3.21.60.05 - Landscaping and Screening
Landscaping and screening shall be required, in accordance with Chapter 4.2 -
Landscaping, Buffering, Screening, and Lighting. The following additional
standards apply to the MUT Zone:
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 3.21  Mixed Use Transitional (MUT) Zone Page 13 of 18
a. Street trees shall be required, consistent with Chapter 4.2 - Landscaping,
Buffering, Screening, and Lighting. Species should be compatible with the
design features identified in Section 3.21.60.07, and shall provide
continuity with nearby landscaping. A reduction to the number of required
street trees may be granted when a development preserves healthy,
mature tree(s) adjacent to the sidewalk.
b. Screening of parking areas, drives, mechanical equipment, and solid
waste receptacles shall be installed prior to building occupancy.
Screening options include landscape plants, planters, ornamental walls,
trellises, fences, or other features consistent with Chapter 4.2 -
Landscaping, Buffering, Screening, and Lighting.
c. Irrigation systems shall be installed to support landscaping.
3.21.60.06 - Street Connectivity and Internal Circulation
a. For new structures and substantial improvements to existing development,
an applicant may be required to provide street or driveway stubs and
reciprocal access easements to promote connectivity, dispersal of traffic,
and efficient circulation between Uses and properties.
b. Traffic lanes shall be internal to the site and shall not be located between
buildings and sidewalks, except where drop-off facilities are provided,
such as for handicapped access. Such facilities shall be designed to meet
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requirements and provide for direct
pedestrian circulation.
3.21.60.07 - Pedestrian Amenities
a. Number Required - For all new structures and substantial improvements
in the MUT Zone, with the exception of existing residential dwellings and
General and Intensive Industrial Uses, the applicant shall provide
pedestrian amenities. The number of pedestrian amenities provided shall
comply with the sliding scale in Table 3.21-2 - Number of Required
Pedestrian Amenities.

9. Additional weather protection in excess of requirements of Section
3.21.60.04
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 3.21  Mixed Use Transitional (MUT) Zone Page 15 of 18
c. Pedestrian Amenities Shall Comply with the Following Standards
and Guidelines -
1. Amenities should be visible and accessible to the general public
from an improved street. Access to pocket parks, plazas, and
sidewalks shall be provided via a public right-of-way or a public
access easement.
2. The size or capacity of pedestrian amenities should be roughly
proportional to their expected use, including use by employees,
customers, residents, and other visitors. The minimum area
standards for pocket parks and plazas may be increased based on
this guideline.
3. Amenities eligible for credit toward Green Area standards, and
adjustment to the maximum 20 ft. setback standard, include plazas,
pocket parks, seating areas, street furniture, and other areas that
provide usable pedestrian space.
4. Amenities should be consistent with the character and scale of the
MUT area. For example, similarity in awning height, bench style,
planter materials, street trees, and pavers is recommended to
foster continuity in the design of pedestrian areas. Materials should
be suitable for outdoor use, easily maintained, and have a
reasonably long life cycle, such as 10 years before replacement.
5. When provided at or near a bus stop, amenities should conform to
standards of the Corvallis Transit System.
3.21.60.08 - Minimum General Building Design Standards
Special attention to building design is required in the MUT Zone because of the
intermixing of a wide variety of land uses. The following standards are intended
to be specific and quantifiable, while allowing for flexibility in design. Additional
flexibility is provided through the Planned Development and Lot Development
Option review processes. This Section provides both required and optional
design elements.
New structures and substantial improvements should be designed to provide
architectural relief and interest, with emphasis at building entrances and along
sidewalks, to promote and enhance a comfortable pedestrian scale and
orientation. Blank walls shall be avoided when practicable by complying with the
following minimum requirements:
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 3.21  Mixed Use Transitional (MUT) Zone Page 16 of 18
a. Ground-floor windows shall be provided for Civic and Commercial Use
Types. The main front elevation(s) of buildings shall provide at least 60

CHAPTER 3.22
LIMITED INDUSTRIAL - OFFICE (LI-O) ZONE
Section 3.22.10 - PURPOSE
The Limited Industrial-Office (LI-O) Zone implements the Limited Industrial-Office
Comprehensive Plan designation. It is intended to create and preserve areas where
Limited Manufacturing, development oriented to the large-scale Office industry (rather
than small-scale, single-use, stand-alone Office buildings) and related Use Types may
locate, as defined and guided by this Chapter.
Ancillary or customarily incidental non-industrial and non-office Uses that support the
Primary Use activity are permitted, such as Administrative, Sales, and Service Uses.
Together, all of these Uses are intended to reduce potentially adverse effects from, and
provide a buffer between, General Industrial Uses and non-industrial Uses such as
Neighborhood Centers, Residential and Mixed Use zones, etc.). The LI-O Zone
development standards and design guidelines are intended to ensure quality
appearance at community gateways, consistent with the Comprehensive Plan.
Section 3.22.20 - GENERAL PROVISIONS - ESTABLISHMENT OF THE LI-O ZONE
Zone Changes to establish new LI-O Zones may be applied only to properties
designated Light Industrial-Office (LI-O) on the Comprehensive Plan Map as of
December 31, 2006, or as established through a subsequent or concurrent
Comprehensive Plan Map Amendment. The LI-O Zone also may be applied through a
legislative or quasi-judicial process in accordance with Chapter 2.0 - Public
Involvement. The following locational and dimensional criteria shall apply to any new
LI-O Zone.
a. Locational Criteria -
1. All portions of the LI-O Zone shall be located within 1/4 mile of existing or
planned transit service, shall have at least 50 ft. of frontage along a
Collector or Arterial Street, and/or shall be contiguous to a property that is
zoned Industrial and that fronts onto a Collector or Arterial Street, as
designated by the City's Transportation Plan; and
2. The LI-O Zone shall be located adjacent to an existing or planned General
Industrial (GI) Zone, and function as a buffer between the GI Zone and
adjacent non-industrial Uses;
OR
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 3.22  Limited Industrial  Office (LI-O) Zone Page 2 of 11
3. The LI-O Zone shall be located in areas determined, through a legislative
process, to be necessary to provide employment opportunities and
services to the community.
b. Zone Size and Dimensions - A new LI-O Zone shall consist of at least one
whole parcel if the parcel is one acre in size or smaller. When multiple parcels
are included, portions at least one acre in size of individual parcels may be
included, provided the size of the remainder of each parcel is developable under
its zone designation. Public street rights-of-way shall not count toward the total
area of a zone.

Section 3.27.40 - DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
The following provisions identify development standards within the MUE Zone.
3.27.40.01 - Preservation of Industrial Land Supply
a. A minimum floor area ratio (FAR) of 0.25 of Industrial structure/Use is
required for all properties with a Comprehensive Plan Map designation of
industrial. This requirement is to ensure that industrial land is preserved
for primarily industrial purposes. This provision does not apply when a
Commercial Use in an industrially designated property is applied to an
existing residential building that existed prior to the adoption of this MUE
Zone. This provision also does not apply when a Residential Use is
applied to an existing commercial building within an industrial zone that
existed prior to the adoption of this MUE Zone. The Industrial Uses on an
MUE site are required to be developed prior to or concurrently with
Residential and Commercial Uses, with the exception of Residential
and/or Commercial Uses in existence as of the adoption of this MUE
Zone.
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 3.27  Mixed Use Employment (MUE) Zone Page 10 of 19
b. When a project is composed of two or more phases, the mixed use site
shall be reviewed as a Planned Development in accordance with Chapter
2.5 - Planned Development, and each phase shall meet the minimum 0.25
FAR as described in "a," above.
c. Where the square footage of the non-industrial Use(s) exceeds the square
footage of the Industrial Use(s), the development site shall be subject to a
Plan Compatibility Review process in accordance with Chapter 2.13 - Plan
Compatibility Review.
d. When an MUE Zone is approved for a site, a deed restriction recognizing
the industrial character and underlying industrial land use designation of
the property shall be recorded on the parcel(s) involved at the time the
MUE Zone is approved.
e. As provided in the introductory statement of Section 3.27.30.01.a.4,
Commercial Use Types listed in that Section and also classified as
Primary Uses permitted outright in the Limited Industrial and/or General
Industrial Zones may be considered as Industrial Uses for the purposes of
calculating minimum Floor Area Ratios (FARs) and square footages as
required in this "a," above. The provisions in this Section are intended to
protect the City's inventory of Industrial land, in conformance with
Statewide Goal 9 - Economic Development, and the Comprehensive Plan.
By preserving a minimum amount of land in the MUE Zone that must be
used for industrial (i.e., employment) purposes, the City can ensure
compliance with Goal 9.
3.27.40.02 - Minimum Lot Area and Setback Requirements
a. A setback of not less than 25 ft. shall be provided along each MUE Zone
boundary line abutting any residential (RS) zone. Off-street parking and
loading shall be permitted in this area except within 15 ft. of the Zone
boundary line, which shall not be used for any Permitted Use, activity, or
structure other than fences, walls, driveways, or walkways. Driveways,
parking, and loading areas adjacent to residential zones shall be
landscaped and screened in accordance with Chapter 4.2 - Landscaping,

reasonably long life cycle, such as 10 years before replacement.
5. When provided at or near a bus stop, amenities should generally
conform to standards of the Corvallis Transit System.
3.27.50.08 - Minimum General Building Design Standards
Mixed Use zones require special attention to building design because of the
intermixing of land uses in such areas. The following standards are intended to
be specific and quantifiable, while allowing for flexibility in design. Additional
flexibility is provided through the Lot Development Option process in Chapter
2.12 - Lot Development Option - Lot Development Option and the Planned
Development process in Chapter 2.5 - Planned Development. This Section
provides both required and optional design elements.
New structures and substantial improvements should provide architectural relief
and interest, with emphasis at building entrances and along sidewalks, to
promote and enhance a comfortable pedestrian scale and orientation. Blank
walls shall be avoided when practicable by complying with the following minimum
requirements:
a. Ground-floor windows shall be provided for Civic and Commercial Use
Types. The main front elevation(s) of buildings shall provide at least 60
percent windows or transparency at the pedestrian level. On corner lots,
this provision applies to both street-facing elevations. The transparency is
measured in linear fashion, such that a 100-ft.-wide building facade shall
have a total of at least 60 linear ft. of windows.
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 3.27  Mixed Use Employment (MUE) Zone Page 17 of 19
b. Ground-floor windows shall be provided for Industrial Use Types. The
main front elevation(s) of buildings shall provide at least 30 percent
windows or transparency at the pedestrian level. On corner lots, this
provision applies to both street-facing elevations. The transparency is
measured in linear fashion, such that a 100-ft.-wide building facade shall
have a total of at least 30 linear ft. of windows.
c. Ground-floor entrances shall include an off-set of at least eight ft. in depth
and of sufficient width to easily discern the entrance location. Examples of
off-sets include recesses, extensions, or other breaks in elevation.
d. To break up vast expanses of single-element building elevations, building
design shall include a combination of architectural elements and features
such as off-sets, windows, entry treatments, wood siding, brick, stucco,
synthetic stucco, such as EIFS, textured concrete block, textured
concrete, etc.
e. Provide differentiation between ground-level spaces and upper stories.
For example, bays or balconies for upper levels and awnings, canopies, or
other similar treatments for lower levels can provide differentiation.
Variation in building materials, trim, paint, ornamentation, windows, or
other features such as public art may also be used. Recognizing that
other design solutions may be appropriate, a developer may propose
alternatives for review and approval by the Director.
f. Ensure privacy in residential developments through effective window
placement, sound-proofing, landscape screening, and/or orientation of
outdoor living areas such as balconies, porches, patios, etc. Opposing
windows at close distances should be off-set horizontally or should employ
appropriate materials, such as frost-glazed, tinted, etc., to protect privacy.
g. Access shall be designed to minimize interference with traffic circulation.
Where necessary, additional rights-of-way shall be dedicated to maintain
adequate circulation.
3.27.50.09 - Neighborhood Compatibility - Minimum Standards Adjacent to a
Residential Zone

CHAPTER 3.31
HISTORIC PRESERVATION (HPO) OVERLAY
The City of Corvallis recognizes that historic resources located within its boundaries
contribute to the unique character of the community and merit preservation. The City's
Historic Preservation Overlay provisions assist in implementing the policies in
Comprehensive Plan Article 5.4 - Historic and Cultural Resources. The Historic
Preservation Overlay (HPO) designation applies to all historic resources listed in the
Corvallis Register of Historic Landmarks and Districts (Local Register). The procedural
provisions implementing this Chapter are located in Article II - Administrative
Procedures. These provisions also conform with Statewide Planning Goals and other
state land use requirements.
A Historic Preservation Overlay Designation does not apply to Designated Historic
Resources listed in the National Register of Historic Places unless those Designated
Historic Resources are also listed in the Local Register. However, National Register of
Historic Places resources are subject to the City's Historic Preservation Provisions in
Chapter 2.9 - Historic Preservation Provisions, and all other provisions of this Code that
apply to Designated Historic Resources.
Historic resources are listed in the National Register of Historic Places consistent with
state and federal processes and criteria. Official action at the local level is not required
as part of the National Register of Historic Places designation process. However, if a
property owner wishes to list a Nationally-designated Historic Resource in the Local
Register, a Zone Change to add a Historic Preservation Overlay is required in
accordance with Chapter 2.2 - Zone Changes. A Nationally-designated Historic
Resource also is defined as a Designated Historic Resource and is subject to the City's
Historic Preservation Provisions in Chapter 2.9 - Historic Preservation Provisions,
unless as otherwise specified under state and federal law. However, a Designated
Historic Resource listed in the National Register of Historic Places may or may not have
a Historic Preservation Overlay. If it does, it is listed in the Local Register. If is does
not, it is not listed in the Local Register.
Section 3.31.10 - PURPOSES
This Overlay is intended to:
a. Implement, through Chapter 2.9 - Historic Preservation Provisions, historic and
cultural resource policies of Comprehensive Plan Article 5.4 - Historic and
Cultural Resources;
b. Encourage, effect, and accomplish the protection, enhancement, and
perpetuation of such historic resource improvements and of Historic Districts
which represent or reflect elements of the City's cultural, social, economic,
political, and architectural history;

Chapter 3.34  University Neighborhoods Overlay (UNO) Page 1 of 5
CHAPTER 3.34
UNIVERSITY NEIGHBORHOODS OVERLAY (UNO)
The University Neighborhoods Overlay (UNO) can be applied to one or more Lots or
Parcels in conjunction with any other residential zone within its adopted boundary, as
may be amended over time. The standards implemented by the UNO reflect patterns of
development that are integral to those neighborhoods within proximity of the Oregon
State University campus. As such, its use should be limited to those neighborhoods
unless expansion is justified by additional documentation and analysis of residential
development patterns that may exist beyond the current boundary.
Section 3.34.10 - PURPOSES
This Overlay is intended to:
a. Promote new development that is compatible with original patterns of
neighborhood development, and that are appropriate to the site and area;
b. Encourage incremental change in density while remaining conscious of the
mass, scale, and form of original development within the affected neighborhoods;
c. Supplement other development standards within this Code that are intended to
facilitate housing diversity;
d. Respond to adopted recommendations from the Collaboration Corvallis project
regarding promotion of established neighborhood development patterns;
e. Implement development standards that were created in response to the North
Campus Area plan; and

the procedures of Chapter 2.2 - Zone Changes.
Section 3.34.40 - PERMITTED USES
Permitted uses consist of any uses listed in the underlying residential zone.
Section 3.34.50  MAXIMUM FLOOR AREA RATIO
a. Maximum FAR per Zone  Unless provided otherwise, new or cumulative
residential development shall comply with the following:
Zone Standard
1. RS-5 1,200 square feet of living space per unit or a Maximum Floor
Area Ratio (Max. FAR) of 0.30, whichever is greater.
2. RS-6 1,200 square feet of living space per unit or a Maximum Floor
Area Ratio (Max. FAR) of 0.30, whichever is greater.

Section 3.34.60 - GARAGE, CARPORT AND OFF-STREET PARKING ACCESS
FOR LOTS AND PARCELS WITH IMPROVED ALLEY ACCESS
Orienting garages, carports, and off-street parking facilities toward a street within the
University Neighborhoods Overlay may be inconsistent with original patterns of
neighborhood development. Front-loaded, attached garages and carports have the
greatest potential for conflicting with those patterns.
The minimum standards for driveway width and side yard setback contained in the
Corvallis Off-street Parking and Access Standards are intended to facilitate narrow
driveways and detached garages as part of redevelopment within the University
Neighborhoods Overlay. For Lots or parcels without improved alley access, detached
garages placed a minimum of 20 ft. behind the longest segment of the front wall of a
primary structures street-facing elevation(s) are strongly encouraged.
The following standards apply to Lots and Parcels with improved alley access.
a. Alley Access Required  Vehicular access to a garage, carport or other offstreet
parking facilities shall be limited to an alley for a Lot or Parcel with access
along an alley that is either improved consistent with Section 4.0.60.j or
otherwise paved for its full length.

the following types of development in the University Neighborhoods Overlay:
a. All new buildings or structures for which a valid permit application has
been submitted after December 31, 2006;
b. Developments subject to Conditional Development and/or Planned
Development approval, as required by a Condition(s) of Approval(s); and
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 3.34  University Neighborhoods Overlay (UNO) Page 5 of 5
c. Independent or cumulative expansion of a nonresidential structure in
existence and in compliance with the Code on December 31, 2006, or
constructed after December 31, 2006 pursuant to a valid Conceptual or
Detailed Development Plan approved on or before December 31, 2006,
shall comply with the pedestrian requirements of Chapter 4.10 -
Pedestrian Oriented Design Standards as outlined in Section 4.10.70.01.

Chapter 3.36 - Oregon State University (OSU) Zone Page 1 of 34
CHAPTER 3.36
OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY (OSU) ZONE
This Zone implements Comprehensive Plan policies that encourage coordination between
the University and City in planning and review of campus development. Coordination with
campus development is essential due to the physical size of the University and its related
effects on City facilities and services. This Zone also coincides with the Public Institutional
Comprehensive Plan designation for property generally within the OSU campus area.
However, not all property within this Zone is owned by OSU; some parcels are privately
owned.
In conjunction with this Zone, a Physical Development Plan for campus development was
originally adopted in 1986 and has been revised periodically by the University. The most
recent revision, which this Zone implements, is the Oregon State University Campus
Master Plan (CMP), approved in 2004.
Section 3.36.10  PURPOSE
The OSU Zone implements the provisions in OSUs 2004-2015 Campus Master
Plan, which is the blueprint for campus development over the next decade.
The purpose of the OSU Zone is to:
a. Encourage coordination between the University and the City of Corvallis,
especially in the areas of land use planning and reviewing campus
development;
b. Facilitate University development;
c. Ensure compatibility of University development with surrounding areas;
d. Ensure adequacy of public utilities, parking, and transportation facilities;
e. Expedite the development review process; and
f. Create a mechanism to regulate development on campus consistent with the
CMP.
Section 3.36.20  DEFINITIONS SPECIFIC TO THIS CHAPTER
The following definitions contained in Section 3.36.20 pertain only to instances where the term
is used within the contents of Chapter 3.36  OSU Zone.

If existing improvements for an OSU Street identified in Figure 3.36-3 are inconsistent with the
standards outlined in Section 3.36.60.18, the OSU Street is delineated by the minimum
dimensional width required to improve the OSU Street to the functional classification and
emergency access standards outlined in Section 3.36.60.18. An OSU Street shall include
shared or mode-specific facilities for vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians and typically will include
the required designated tree planting area. For the purposes of LDC Chapter 1.6 - Definitions
and Chapter 2.9  Historic Preservation Provisions, an OSU Street shall be construed as a
private street right-of-way.
OSU Tree Well  A tree well that conforms to the standards for tree wells specified in the OSU
Tree Management Plan.
Sidewalk  A pedestrian facility constructed of a permanent hard surface parallel to a public
street or OSU Street, and considered a component of that street.

2.5 - Planned Development.
2 Streets, bike lanes, and vehicle-rated sidewalks shall be designed to provide emergency and fire vehicle access as
approved by the City and Fire Department.
3 Street improvements shall comply with Sections 4.5.90.02.C. and Section 4.12.70.
4 Lane widths shown are the preferred construction standards that apply to existing routes adjacent to areas of new
development, and to newly constructed routes. On University Collector roadways, an absolute minimum for safety concerns
is 10 ft. Such minimums are expected to occur only in locations where existing development along an established substandard
route or other severe physical constraints preclude construction of the preferred facility width. Note: the number
of lanes does not include turn lanes.
5 On streets where there are shared bike and vehicle facilities, bike lanes are not required.
6 One way streets shall only be required to provide one (1) bike lane. Contra-flow bike lanes are permitted.

Section 4.0.60 - PUBLIC AND PRIVATE STREET REQUIREMENTS
a. Traffic evaluations shall be required of all development proposals in
accordance with the TIS Guide and the following:
1. All development site proposals shall provide an estimate of site generated
trips based on ITE standards. A traffic impact analysis (TIA) is required for
any proposal generating 30 or more peak hour trips to an
intersection/access. A proposed TIA scope with preliminary trip estimates
and trips distribution shall be prepared by a registered professional
engineer, and submitted to the City Engineer for review and approval
based on established procedures. The applicant shall complete the
evaluation consistent with the approved scope in accordance with
accepted traffic engineering practices and present the results with the site
development proposal.
2. If the TIA identifies safety issues or mobility performance conditions less
than the minimum standard established in the Corvallis Transportation
Plan, recommended improvements and funding strategies mitigating the
issue or conditions shall be included in the TIA, and considered
concurrently with a development proposal.
3. Conditions of Approval.
a) The City may deny, approve, or approve a proposal with conditions
necessary to meet operational and safety standards; provide the
necessary right-of-way for improvements; and to require
construction of improvements to ensure consistency with the future
planned transportation system.
b) Construction of off-site improvements may be required to mitigate
impacts resulting from development that relate to capacity
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 4.0  Improvements Required With Development Page 8 of 32
deficiencies and public safety; and/or to upgrade or construct public
facilities to city standards.
b. Location of new Arterial, Collector, and Neighborhood Collector Streets shall
conform to the Corvallis Transportation Plan.
c. Although through-traffic movement on new Local Connector and Local Streets
usually is discouraged, this may not be practical for particular neighborhoods.
Local Connector or Local Street designations shall be applied in newly
developing areas based on review of a street network plan and, in some cases, a
traffic study provided with the development application. The decision regarding
which of these designations will be applied is based on a number of factors,
including density of development, anticipated traffic volumes, and the potential
for through traffic.
Street network plans must provide for connectivity within the transportation
system to the extent that, generally, both Local Connector and Local Streets will
be created within a development. In order to promote efficient vehicular and
pedestrian circulation throughout the city, subdivisions and site developments
shall be served by an interconnected street network, consistent with block
perimeter standards in Section 4.0.60.o.
Identified traffic calming techniques, such as bulbed intersections, etc., can
reduce traffic speeds and, where included, are to be constructed at the time of
development. To further address traffic speeds and volumes on Local Connector
and Local Streets, the following street designs, along with other designs intended
to reduce traffic speeds and volumes, shall be considered:
1. Straight segments of Local Connector and Local Streets should be less
than .25 mile in length, and include design features such as curves and T
intersections.
2. A cul-de-sac shall only be permitted where the Planning Commission or
Director determines that natural features or topographical constraints,
existing development patterns, or compliance with other applicable City
requirements preclude a street extension. Cul-de-sacs shall not exceed
600 ft. nor serve more than 18 dwelling units.
3. Street designs that include traffic calming, where appropriate, are
encouraged.
d. Private streets, though discouraged in conjunction with Land Divisions,
may be considered within a development site provided all the following
conditions are met:
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 4.0  Improvements Required With Development Page 9 of 32
1. Extension of a public street through the development site is not needed for
continuation of the existing street network or for future service to adjacent
properties;
2. The development site remains in one ownership, or adequate
mechanisms are established, such as a homeowners' association with the
authority to enforce payment, to ensure that a private street installed with
a Land Division will be adequately maintained;
3. Where a private street is installed in conjunction with a Land Division,
development standards, including paving standards, consistent with City
standards for public streets shall be used to protect the interests of future
homeowners; and
4. The private street is located within a separate tract.
e. Development sites shall be provided with access from a public street or a
private street that meets the criteria in "d," above, both improved to City
standards in accordance with the following:
1. Where a development site abuts an existing public street not improved to
City standards, the abutting street shall be improved to City standards
along the full frontage of the property concurrently with development.
Where a development site abuts an existing private street not improved to
City standards, and the private street is allowed per the criteria in "d",
above, the abutting street shall meet all the criteria in "d", above and be
improved to City standards along the full frontage of the property
concurrently with development.
2. Full width street improvements, from curb to curb are typically required.
Half-width street improvements from curb to centerline may be approved
by the Planning Commission or Director where essential to the reasonable
development of the property. Approval for half-width street improvements
may be allowed when other standards required for street improvements
are met and when the Planning Commission or the Director finds that it
will be possible to obtain the dedication and/or improvement of the
remainder of the street when property on the other side of the half-width
street is developed.
3. To ensure improved access to a development site consistent with policies
on orderly urbanization and extension of public facilities, the Planning
Commission or Director may require off-site street improvements
concurrently with development.
f. To provide for orderly development of adjacent properties, public streets
and private streets that meet all the criteria in "d", above, shall be installed
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 4.0  Improvements Required With Development Page 10 of 32
concurrently with development of a site and shall be extended through the
site to the edge of the adjacent property(ies) in accordance with the
following:
1. Temporary dead-ends created by this requirement may be installed
without turn-arounds, subject to the approval of the Fire Marshal.
2. Drainage facilities shall be provided to properly manage storm water runoff
from temporary dead-ends.
g. The Planning Commission or Director may require the extension of public and
private street improvements through a development site to provide for the logical
extension of an existing street network or to connect a site with a nearby
neighborhood activity center, such as a school or park. Where this creates a
Land Division incidental to the development, a land partition shall be completed
concurrently with the development, in accordance with Chapter 2.14 - Partitions,
Minor Replats, and Property Line Adjustments.
h. Names for new streets shall not duplicate or create confusion with names of
existing streets. Street names and numbers shall conform to the established
pattern in the surrounding area and are subject to approval of the Director.
i. To provide off-street loading and/or access to parking areas, alleys shall be
provided in Commercial and Industrial zones to serve abutting properties unless
other permanent provisions are approved by the Planning Commission or
Director.
j. Alley standards shall be as follows -
1. Standards for Alleys Serving both Residential and Nonresidential Use

development, and to newly constructed routes. On Arterial and Collector roadways, an absolute minimum for safety
concerns is 10 ft. Such minimums are expected to occur only in locations where existing development along an established
sub-standard route or other severe physical constraints preclude construction of the preferred facility width.
3. An absolute minimum width for safety concerns is five ft., which is expected to occur only in locations where existing
development along an established sub-standard route or other severe physical constraints preclude construction of the
preferred facility width. Parallel multi-use paths in lieu of bike lanes are not appropriate along the Arterial-Collector system
due to the multiple conflicts created for bicycles at driveway and sidewalk intersections. In rare instances, separated (but
not adjacent) facilities may provide a proper function.
4. Tree wells shall be constructed consistent with detail TBD.
5. Where existing streets are proposed to have a reduced curb to curb width, prior approval shall be required by the City
Engineer.

parallel parking aisle is required.
8. Where adequate right-of-way exists, the required improvements in this table may be modified to the satisfaction of the City
Engineer.
9. On streets where sharrows have been approved, bike lanes may not be required.
o. Block Perimeter Standards - Development shall create a series of complete
blocks bound by a connecting network of streets with sidewalks, or by walkways
without streets where allowed under the exceptions noted below. Partial blocks
are allowed only when appropriate block perimeter connections are stubbed to
abutting property that would be required to complete the blocks with future
development. Where a street or walkway passes through a site, block perimeter
standards shall be met separately on each side of the street or walkway. Where
walkways are allowed in lieu of streets, they shall be constructed according to the
standards of Section 4.0.30.b.2.
1. Applicability: The standards of this section shall apply to sites that are
greater than two acres in size, and are:

CHAPTER 4.1
PARKING, LOADING, AND ACCESS REQUIREMENTS
Section 4.1.10 - PURPOSES
The regulations in this Chapter are established to provide appropriate location and
design of parking and loading areas and appropriate location, design, and capacity of
accesses. The parking requirements are intended to provide sufficient parking in close
proximity to the various Uses for residents, customers, and/or employees; and to
maintain traffic carrying capacity of nearby streets. These regulations apply to both
motorized vehicles, hereafter called vehicles, and bicycles.
Section 4.1.20 - GENERAL PROVISIONS
a. Provision and Maintenance - The provision of required off-street parking for
vehicles and bicycles, and loading facilities for vehicles, is a continuing obligation
of the property owner. Building or other Permits will only be issued after receipt
of site plans drawn to a suitable scale and showing the location of permanent
parking and loading facilities. New vehicle and bicycle parking spaces shall be
provided in accordance with the provisions of this Code.
b. Unspecified Requirements - Vehicle and bicycle parking requirements for Uses
not specified in this Chapter shall be determined by the Director based upon the
requirements of similar Uses.
c. New Structures - When a structure is constructed, on-site vehicle and bicycle
parking and loading spaces shall be provided in accordance with Section 4.1.30
below.
d. Alteration of Existing Nonresidential Structures - When an existing structure
is altered to the extent that the existing Nonresidential Use is intensified, vehicle
and bicycle parking shall be provided in the amount required for such
intensification.
When increased intensity requires no more than two additional vehicle and/or
bicycle spaces, no additional parking facilities shall be required. However, the
effects of changes, additions, or enlargements shall be cumulative, and when the
net effect of one or more changes generates a need for more than two spaces,
they shall be provided in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter.
Additional spaces shall be required for the intensification but not for the original
Use. New vehicle and bicycle parking spaces shall be provided in accordance
with the provisions of this Code.
e. Change in Nonresidential Uses - No additional parking shall be required when
an existing structure is changed from one Nonresidential Use Type to another, as
listed in Section 4.1.30, and the vehicle and bicycle parking requirements for
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 4.1  Parking, Loading, and Access Requirements Page 2 of 21
each Use Type are the same. When the change in Use requires no more than
two additional vehicle and/or bicycle spaces, no additional parking facilities shall
be required. However, where a change in Use results in a requirement for more
than two additional vehicle and/or bicycle parking spaces, additional parking
space shall be provided to compensate for the increased intensity of Use. New
vehicle and bicycle parking spaces shall be provided in accordance with the
provisions of this Code.
f. Inoperative Motor Vehicles - In any residential zone, all motor vehicles
incapable of movement under their own power or lacking legal registration shall
be stored in a completely screened space, garage, or carport.
g. Mixed Uses - When several Uses occupy a single structure or lot, the total
required vehicle and bicycle parking shall be the sum of the requirements of
individual Uses. Exceptions to this provision for shared parking may be
considered through the Planned Development process outlined in Chapter 2.5 -
Planned Development.
h. Conflicting Parking Requirements - When a building or Use is planned or
constructed in such a manner that more than one standard is applicable, the Use
that requires the greater number of parking spaces shall govern.
i. Availability of Parking Spaces - Required vehicle and bicycle parking spaces
shall be unobstructed, and available for parking of vehicles and bicycles of
residents, customers, patrons, and employees only. Required spaces shall not
be used for storage of vehicles or materials, or for parking of vehicles or bicycles
used in conducting the business or conducting the Use, and shall not be used for
sale, repair, or servicing of any vehicle or bicycle.
j. Location of Required Parking -
1. Vehicles
a) Vehicle parking shall be located consistent with Chapter 4.10 -
Pedestrian Oriented Design Standards, such that it does not
separate buildings from streets except for driveway parking
associated with single-family development. An exception may also
be granted for up to two parking spaces per dwelling unit for

LANDSCAPING, BUFFERING, SCREENING, AND LIGHTING
Section 4.2.10 - PURPOSES
The City recognizes the aesthetic and economic value of landscaping and encourages its
use to establish a pleasant community character, unify developments, and buffer or
screen unsightly features; to soften and buffer large-scale structures and parking lots;
and to aid in energy conservation by providing shade from the sun and shelter from the
wind. The community desires and intends all properties to be landscaped and
maintained.
This Chapter prescribes standards for Landscaping, Buffering, Screening, and Lighting.
While this Chapter provides standards for frequently encountered development
situations, detailed planting plans and irrigation system designs, when required, shall be
reviewed by the City with this purposes clause as the guiding principle.
Section 4.2.20 - GENERAL PROVISIONS
a. Required Landscaping -
1. Landscaping and Irrigation Plans - Where a landscape plan is required by
this Code, by a particular proposal, and/or by Conditions of Approval,
detailed planting plans, irrigation plans and other related plans shall be
submitted for review and approval with Building Permit applications and/or
prior to the recordation of a Final Plat, as applicable. Building Permits,
including Foundation Permits, shall not be issued until the Director has
determined that the plans comply with the purposes clause and specific
standards in this Chapter, any specific proposal(s), and/or Conditions of
Approval that apply to the particular project. On a case by case basis, and
where no Significant Natural Features would be impacted, the Director may
grant an exception and allow the issuance of permits. Required
landscaping shall be reviewed and approved by the Director, and in no case
shall landscaping be less than that required by this Chapter. Landscaping
shall consist of ground cover, shrubbery, and trees.
2. Installation - All required landscaping and related improvements, such as
irrigation, etc., shall be completed prior to the issuance of a Certificate of
Occupancy, with the exception of the following:
a) In accordance with Administrative Policy 10.05, required street trees
for a development may be provided by utilizing the Citys Tree for a
Fee program. If the Tree for a Fee program is utilized, a Certificate
of Occupancy will be issued once all required fees have been paid,
and all required irrigation and site preparation as defined in
Administrative Policy 10.05 has been completed and approved.

Plat.
If an applicant chooses to financially secure landscaping and related
improvements in order to record a Final Plat, such financial security
shall be consistent with the provisions of this Code, shall be reviewed
and approved by the Director, and shall be for an amount at least
equivalent to 120 percent of the cost of the installation of the
landscaping and related improvements.
If an applicant chooses to utilize the Tree for a Fee program in order
to record a Final Plat, site preparation as defined in Administrative
Policy 10.05 shall be completed and approved with individual lot
development, prior to issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy.
3. Coverage within Three Years - All required landscaping shall provide a
minimum 90 percent ground coverage within three years. A financial
guarantee shall be provided for new residential development, with the
exception of areas within single-family or Duplex lots. A financial guarantee
shall also be provided for new nonresidential development, and
nonresidential redevelopment that involves a 3,000 sq. ft. or 20 percent
expansion, whichever is less, except that 20 percent expansions less than
500 sq. ft. are exempt. The financial guarantee shall cover maintenance for
a three-year period from the date that the landscaping was installed by the
applicant and accepted by the City. This guarantee shall be established
prior to the issuance of a Final Certificate of Occupancy and prior to
recording of a Final Plat. Additionally, this guarantee shall be consistent
with the provisions of this Code, shall be reviewed and approved by the
Director, and shall be for an amount that is at least equivalent to 50 percent
of the cost of installation of required landscaping and related improvements,
plus 20 percent of the 50 percent figure.
To release this guarantee at the end of the three-year period, the developer
shall provide a report to the Director. This report shall be prepared by a
licensed arborist or licensed landscape contractor and shall verify that 90
percent ground coverage has been achieved, either by successful plantings
or by the installation of replacement plantings. The Director shall approve
the report prior to release of the guarantee.
Street trees provided through the Tree for a Fee program shall not be
subject to the requirement for a three-year maintenance financial
guarantee.

Section 4.2.40 - BUFFER PLANTINGS
Buffer plantings are used to reduce apparent building scale, provide a transition between
contrasting architectural styles, and generally mitigate incompatible or undesirable views.
They are used to soften rather than block viewing. Where required, a mix of plant
materials shall be used to achieve the desired buffering effect. At minimum, this mix shall
consist of trees, shrubs, and ground cover, and may also consist of existing vegetation,
such as natural areas that will be preserved.
At minimum, buffering is required in areas identified through Conditions of Approval, in
areas required by other provisions within this Code, and in Through Lot areas, and as
required below.
Parking, Loading, and Vehicle Maneuvering Areas -
a. Buffering is required for parking areas containing four or more spaces, loading
areas, and vehicle maneuvering areas. Boundary plantings shall be used to buffer
these uses from adjacent properties and the public right-of-way. A minimum fiveft.-
wide perimeter landscaping buffer shall be provided around parking areas; and
a minimum 10 ft.-wide perimeter landscaping buffer shall be provided around trees.
Additionally, where parking abuts this perimeter landscape buffer, either parking
stops shall be used or planters shall be increased in width by 2.5 ft. On-site
plantings shall be used between parking bays, as well as between parking bays
and vehicle maneuvering areas. Low-lying ground cover and shrubs, balanced
with vertical shrubs and trees, shall be used to buffer the view of these facilities.
Decorative walls and fences may be used in conjunction with plantings, but may
not be used alone to comply with buffering requirements.
b. In addition to any pedestrian refuge areas, each landscaped island within and
around parking lot areas shall -
1. Include one or more shade canopy trees;
2. Be a minimum length of eight ft. at its smallest dimension;
3. Include at least 80 sq. ft. of ground area per tree to allow for root aeration;
and
4. Include raised concrete curbs around the perimeter.
c. Connecting walkways through parking lots shall have one or more canopy shade
tree per 40 linear ft. Driveways to or through parking lots shall have one or more
canopy shade tree per 40 linear ft. on each side. These trees shall be planted in
landscape areas within five ft. of the walkways and driveways, respectively.

Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 4.2  Landscaping, Buffering, Screening, and Lighting Page 9 of 16
Section 4.2.50 - SCREENING (HEDGES, FENCES, WALLS, AND BERMS)
Screening is required where unsightly views or visual conflicts must be obscured or
blocked and/or where privacy and security are desired. Fences and walls used for
screening may be constructed of wood, concrete, stone, brick, wrought iron, or other
commonly used fencing/wall materials. Acoustically designed fences and walls shall also
be used where noise pollution requires mitigation.
Where landscaping is used for required screening, it shall be at least six ft. in height and
be at least 80 percent opaque, as seen from a perpendicular line of sight, within 18
months following establishment of the primary use of the site.
A chainlink fence with slats shall qualify for screening only if a landscape buffer is provided
in compliance with Section 4.2.40, above.
4.2.50.01 - Height Limit
The height of hedges, fences, walls, and berms shall be measured from the lowest
adjoining finished grade, except where screening is required for parking, loading,
storage, and similar areas. In these cases, height shall be measured from the
finished grade of such improvements. Screening is not permitted within Vision
Clearance Areas, as determined by the City Engineer.
a. Hedges, fences, and walls shall not exceed four ft. in height within any
required yard adjacent to a street or within the Through Lot Easement area
of a lot, except as provided in 4.2.50.01.d and e. See Through Lot
Easement in Chapter 1.6 - Definitions. See also Chapter 4.4 - Land Division
Standards for additional Through Lot requirements. The Director may grant
an exception to this provision under the following circumstances:
1. Where required by the Planning Commission to meet screening
requirements;
2. Where an applicant wishes to allow portions of a screen to encroach
up to five ft. into a Through Lot Easement area. This type of
encroachment pertains to a screen that is designed and constructed
with off-sets to prevent visual monotony. In this situation, the hedge,
fence, or wall shall maintain an average setback of 20 ft. from the
rear property line, shall not exceed five ft. in height, and shall
maintain Vision Clearance Area standards. It remains the property
owner's responsibility to maintain the area outside the fence.
b. Notwithstanding the height restrictions outlined in a, above, the height of
solid fences and walls shall be limited to a maximum of four ft. when
constructed within five feet of sidewalks and multi-use paths that are not
adjacent or parallel to streets, and up to six feet when constructed greater
than five feet from these sidewalks or multi-use paths. Examples of such
situations include sidewalks and multi-use paths adjacent to pedestrian and
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 4.2  Landscaping, Buffering, Screening, and Lighting Page 10 of 16
bicycle connections between Cul-de-sacs or between residential areas and
neighborhood centers, etc. The limitation on these solid forms of screening
is intended to increase visibility and public safety. Portions of fences above
four ft. in height are allowed, when they are designed and constructed of
materials that are open a minimum of 50 percent. Fence and wall heights
shall be measured from the grade of the sidewalk or multi-use path. Fences
and walls along sidewalks and multi-use paths shall be located outside of
any associated rights-of-way and/or easement areas.
c. Hedges, fences, and walls may exceed four ft. in rear and interior side
yards, except when these yards abut a sidewalk or multi-use path, in which
case provisions in b, above, apply. Fences and walls over six ft. high
require Building Permit approval prior to construction.
d. Hedges, fences, and walls up to six feet in height are allowed in exterior

Pursuant to City Council Policy 91-9.04, "The City of Corvallis is interested in well
shielded, energy efficient street lighting sources that direct the light source downward
where it is needed, not up or sideways where it is wasted and causes glare, light trespass,
and bright skies."
All developers shall submit a proposed lighting plan for approval that meets the functional
security needs of the proposed land use without adversely affecting adjacent properties
or the community. This criteria is satisfied upon compliance with the provisions listed
below and shall be substantiated by the applicant's submittal of the necessary information
to demonstrate compliance, such as information including but not limited to
manufacturers' specifications:
a. For safety purposes, lighting shall be provided in all areas designed to include
pedestrian activities, such as streets, sidewalks, multi-use paths, parking lots,
buildings, and plazas.

requests for permits.
c. Site lighting that may be confused with warning, emergency, or traffic signals is
prohibited.
d. Light sources shall be concealed or shielded to the maximum extent feasible to
minimize the potential for glare and unnecessary diffusion on adjacent property.
Compliance with this provision shall be demonstrated by ensuring that, when
evaluated from a point four ft. above the ground, bulbs of light fixtures are not
visible from adjacent property.
e. All new Subdivision street lights and future street-light luminaire replacements
within the existing street-light system shall be flat-lens fully shielded luminaires.
f. Standard placement of street lights shall be at intersections, in the middle of long
blocks, and in dead end streets and long Cul-de-sacs.

Section 4.5.20 - APPLICABILITY
4.5.20.01 - Natural Hazards that are Subject to this Chapter
a. These provisions apply to public and private properties in the 100-yr.
Floodplain of rivers and local streams;
b. Mapping of Natural Hazards - The Natural Hazard areas in "a," above,
are mapped on the Corvallis Natural Hazards Map.
The Special Flood Hazard Areas identified by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency in its Flood Insurance Study for Benton County and
Incorporated Areas, dated June 2, 2011, with accompanying Flood Insurance
Rate Maps or Digital Flood Insurance Rate Maps, and other supporting data, are
adopted by reference and declared a part of the 100-yr. Floodplain regulations
presented below. The Flood Insurance Study and the Flood Insurance Rate Map
are on file at the office of the City of Corvallis Engineer at 1245 NE Third Street,
Corvallis, Oregon 97330, and at the Development Services Division at 501 SW
Madison Avenue, Corvallis, Oregon, 97333. Not every Special Flood Hazard
Area within the Urban Growth Boundary has been mapped by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency through the Flood Insurance Study, Flood
Insurance Rate Maps, and Digital Flood Insurance Rate Maps cited above. The
Floodplain Administrator or designee is authorized through Sections 4.5.50.02,
4.5.50.03.p, and 4.5.60.02.b to obtain from applicants the information necessary
to determine the presence and extent of unmapped Special Flood Hazard Areas
as part of reviewing Development proposals that affect the 100-yr. Floodplain.
Once approved by the Floodplain Administrator or designee, such information
shall be incorporated into the Natural Hazards Map and used by the City of
Corvallis to supplement the Flood Insurance Study, Flood Insurance Rate Maps,
and Digital Flood Insurance Rate Maps cited above to ensure consistency with
the 100-yr. Floodplain regulations contained in this Chapter and Chapter 2.11 -
Floodplain Development Permit.
4.5.20.02 - Coordination with Building Codes and Greater Restrictions
a. Coordination with Building Codes - Pursuant to the requirement established in
ORS 455 that the City of Corvallis administers and enforces the State Building
Codes, the City Council of the City of Corvallis does hereby acknowledge that the
State Building Codes contain certain provisions that apply to the design and
construction of buildings and structures located in Special Flood Hazard Areas.
Therefore, this chapter and Chapter 2.11 - Floodplain Development Permit are
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 4.5  Floodplain Provisions Page 4 of 41
intended to be administered and enforced in conjunction with the State Building
Codes.
b. Greater Restrictions - This Chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or
impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where
this Chapter and any other ordinance, easement, covenant, or deed restriction
conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall
prevail.
4.5.20.03 - Exceptions to Achieve Minimum Assured Development Area
(MADA)
a. General - Chapter 4.11 - Minimum Assured Development Area (MADA)
explains how Minimum Assured Development Area (MADA) is
determined. If the application of Natural Hazard regulations outside
prohibited areas, or if the cumulative impact of such Natural Hazard
regulations and the application of the regulations in Chapter 4.12 -
Significant Vegetation Protection Provisions and Chapter 4.13 - Riparian
Corridor and Wetland Provisions would limit the developable portion of a
property below the property's MADA, then development will be allowed on
the property, to the degree necessary to achieve the MADA, as explained
in Chapter 4.11 - Minimum Assured Development Area. However, use of
MADA provisions to develop in the 0.2-ft. Floodway is prohibited, as
outlined in Sections 4.5.90.05 and 4.5.100.03, as well as Section
4.11.50.05 of Chapter 4.11 - Minimum Assured Development Area; and
b. Floodway Fringe Development Pursuant to MADA Provisions
Requires Adherence to Partial Protection Floodplain Provisions - In
cases where encroachment into the Floodway Fringe is allowed per the
Minimum Assured Development Area provisions in Chapter 4.11 -
Minimum Assured Development Area (MADA), all such Development shall
comply with Section 4.5.100 - Standards in Partial Protection Floodway
Fringe. See Sections 4.5.90.05 and 4.5.100.03.
Section 4.5.30 - DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
The degree of flood protection required by this Chapter and Chapter 2.11 - Floodplain
Development Permit is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on
scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods and hazard events can and will
occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural
causes. Areas impacted by other Natural Hazards may differ from those shown on the
Corvallis Natural Hazards Map. Neither this Chapter nor Chapter 2.11 - Floodplain
Development Permit implies that land outside the Special Flood Hazard Areas or Uses
permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages, nor does it
imply that land outside of mapped hazard areas will be free from damage or earth
movement in a hazard event. Neither this Chapter nor Chapter 2.11 - Floodplain
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 4.5  Floodplain Provisions Page 5 of 41
Development Permit shall create liability on the part of the City of Corvallis, any officer
or employee thereof, or the Federal Insurance Administration, for any flood damages or
other hazard damages that result from reliance on this chapter and Chapter 2.11 -
Floodplain Development Permit, or any administrative decision lawfully made
hereunder. Compliance with the minimum standards established by this Chapter is not
intended to relieve any private party from liability for the design or construction of
Development which causes damage or injury by increasing flooding or aggravating an
existing and known hazard.
Section 4.5.40 - FINDINGS OF FACT, DEFINITIONS, AND RELATED STANDARDS
4.5.40.01 - Findings of Fact
a. The Special Flood Hazard Areas of the City of Corvallis are subject to
periodic inundation that results in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health,
safety and general welfare.
b. These flood losses are caused by buildings and structures in Special
Flood Hazard Areas, which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or
otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect
of obstructions in Floodplains causing increases in flood heights and
velocities.
c. The City of Corvallis has the primary responsibility for planning, adoption
and enforcement of land use regulations to accomplish proper Floodplain
management.
4.5.40.02 - Definitions
a. Specific Definitions for Phrases Related to 100-Yr. Floodplain
Regulations - See Section 1.6.40 for the full set of definitions that are
unique to the 100-yr. Floodplain regulations presented below.
b. 100-yr. Floodplain, 0.2-ft. Floodway, and Floodway Fringe -
1. 100-yr. Floodplain - The 100-yr. Floodplain is a land area adjacent
to a river, stream or other water body that is subject to a one
percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. The
Floodplain is divided into two sections: the Floodway and
Floodway Fringe areas. The 100-yr. Floodplain is mapped by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) on Flood
Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) or, for areas not mapped by FEMA,
it is mapped via Floodplain studies approved by the Floodplain
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 4.5  Floodplain Provisions Page 6 of 41
Administrator or designee. It is also referred to as the Special
Flood Hazard Area and is the area subject to Base Flood
regulations. See Figure 4.5-1 - Components of 100-yr. Floodplain;
and the following definitions in Section 1.6.40: Floodway
(Regulatory Floodway); Floodplain - 100-yr.; Flood,100-yr.; Base
Flood; and Floodway Fringe.
2. 0.2-ft. Floodway - The 0.2-ft. Floodway is defined as the river
channel or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must
be reserved in order to discharge the Base Flood (100-yr. Flood)
without cumulatively increasing the Water Surface Elevation more
than 0.2 ft. See Figure 4.5 -1 - Components of 100-yr. Floodplain;
and the Floodway (Regulatory Floodway) definition in Section
1.6.40. The Regulatory Floodway for the City of Corvallis is the 0.2-
ft. Floodway. However, unless development qualifies as one of the
exceptions per Sections 2.11.40, 4.5.50.04, or 4.5.80.05, no rise in
Base Flood Elevation (BFE) is allowed.
3. Floodway Fringe - The Floodway Fringe is defined as the area of
the 100-yr. Floodplain lying outside of the 0.2-ft. Floodway. See
Figure 4.5 -1 - Components of 100-yr. Floodplain; and the following
definitions in Section 1.6.40: Floodway Fringe and Floodway
(Regulatory Floodway). However, unless development qualifies as
one of the exceptions per Section 2.11.40, 4.5.50.04, or 4.5.80.05,
no rise in Base Flood Elevation (BFE) is allowed.
Figure 4.5-1  Components of the 100-year Floodplain Where
development is allowed per Code provisions, no rise in Base Flood
Elevation (BFE) is allowed, unless the development qualifies as one of the
specific exceptions outlined in Section 2.11.40, 4.5.50.04, or 4.5.80.05.
4.5.40.03 - Relationship of 0.2-ft. Floodway and Floodway Fringe to
Regulated Riparian Corridors
Areas of the 0.2-ft. Floodway and Floodway Fringe that fall within a Regulated
Riparian Corridor are also subject to the provisions of Chapter 4.13 - Riparian
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 4.5  Floodplain Provisions Page 7 of 41
Corridor and Wetland Provisions. Where regulations are in conflict, the most
restrictive shall apply. See Riparian Corridor, Regulated in Chapter 1.6 -
Definitions.
Section 4.5.50 - PROCEDURES
Compliance with the provisions of this Chapter shall be determined through the
development review processes identified in Section 1.2.110 of Chapter 1.2 - Legal
Framework and in Chapter 2.11 - Floodplain Development Permit. Applications for
Excavation and Grading Permits, Floodplain Development Permits, Building Permits or
other permits for buildings and structures on sites containing the 100-yr. Floodplain shall
be submitted and reviewed to ensure compliance with specifications referenced herein;
and to ensure that development is reasonably safe from anticipated hazards. Such
applications also include those needed for Manufactured Dwellings. Other development
activities as described in this provision include all the activities listed in the Section
1.6.40 definition for Development. However, unless development qualifies as one of the
exceptions per Section 2.11.40, 4.5.50.04, or 4.5.80.05, no rise in Base Flood Elevation
(BFE) is allowed.

Section 4.5.60 - ADMINISTRATION AND INTERPRETATION
4.5.60.01 - Administration
a. Designation of a Local Floodplain Administrator - The City Engineer is
hereby appointed as the Floodplain Administrator. The City Engineer or
designee is responsible for administering and implementing the provisions
of this chapter and Chapter 2.11 - Floodplain Development Permit;
b. Duties and Responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator or
Designee - Duties of the Floodplain Administrator or designee shall
include, but shall not be limited to:
1. Review all Floodplain Development Permit applications to
determine whether proposed new Development will be located in
Special Flood Hazard Area;
2. Review applications for modifications of any existing Development
in Special Flood Hazard Areas for compliance with the
requirements of this Chapter and Chapter 2.11 - Floodplain
Development Permit;
3. Interpret Special Flood Hazard Area boundaries, provide available
Special Flood Hazard Area information, and provide Base Flood
Elevations, where they exist;
4. Review proposed Development to assure that applicants have
obtained and provided the necessary permits from governmental
agencies from which approval is required by federal or state law,
including but not limited to Section 404 of the Federal Water
Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, 33 U.S.C. 1334; the
Endangered Species Act of 1973, 16 U.S.C. 1531-1544; and State
of Oregon Removal-Fill permits. Copies of such permits shall be
maintained on file;
5. Review all Floodplain Development Permit applications to
determine if the proposed Development is located in the 0.2-ft.
Floodway and, if so, ensure that the encroachment standards of
Section 4.5.80 are met;
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 4.5  Floodplain Provisions Page 12 of 41
6. When Base Flood Elevation or Floodway data have not been
identified by FEMA in a Flood Insurance Study and/or Flood
Insurance Rate Maps, the Floodplain Administrator or designee
shall require an applicant to provide a Floodplain study prepared by
a licensed engineer, and the study shall be in accordance with
Section 4.5.50.03.p. Newly mapped 100-yr. Floodplain areas shall
be designated as High Protection Floodplain. Upon receipt and
approval of this Floodplain study, the Floodplain Administrator or

relation to the vertical datum used on the effective Flood Insurance
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 4.5  Floodplain Provisions Page 13 of 41
Rate Map, or Highest Adjacent Grade where no Base Flood
Elevation is available, of the Lowest Floor level, including
Basement, of all New Construction or Substantially Improved
buildings and structures;
12. Obtain from applicants, verify, and record the actual elevation, in
relation to the vertical datum used on the effective Flood Insurance
Rate Map, or Highest Adjacent Grade where no Base Flood
Elevation is available, to which any new or Substantially Improved
buildings or structures have been flood-proofed. When floodproofing
is utilized for a structure, the Floodplain Administrator or
designee shall obtain from applicants certification of design criteria
from a registered professional engineer or architect;
13. Ensure that all records pertaining to the 100-yr. Floodplain
regulations presented in this Chapter are permanently maintained
in the office of the Floodplain Administrator or designee and shall
be open for public inspection;
14. Make inspections in Special Flood Hazard Areas to determine
whether Development has been undertaken without issuance of a
Floodplain Development Permit, ensure that Development is
undertaken in accordance with a Floodplain Development Permit
and the provisions of this Chapter and Chapter 2.11 - Floodplain
Development Permit, and verify that existing buildings and
structures maintain compliance with the provisions of this Chapter
and Chapter 2.11 - Floodplain Development Permit;
15. The Floodplain Administrator or designee shall make periodic
inspections of Floodplain areas to establish that Development
activities within the Floodplain are being performed in compliance
with an approved Floodplain Development Permit. The Floodplain
Administrator or designee shall prepare a field report listing noncomplying
conditions and shall proceed with enforcement actions
including, but not limited to: the issuance of a Stop Work Order; the
issuance of a citation; and the commencement of civil legal
proceedings;
16. Coordinate with the Building Official to inspect areas where existing
buildings and structures in Special Flood Hazard Areas have been
damaged, regardless of the cause of damage, and notify owners
that permits may be required prior to repair, rehabilitation,
demolition, relocation, or reconstruction of the Building or Structure;
and
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)

Chapter 4.5  Floodplain Provisions Page 28 of 41
4.5.110.03 - Flood Protection Construction Standards
a. All New Construction and Substantial Improvements shall be designed (or
modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral
movement of the structure resulting from Hydrodynamic and Hydrostatic
Loads, including the effects of buoyancy;
b. All mobile and Manufactured Dwellings shall be anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse, or lateral movement, and shall be installed using
methods and practices that minimize flood damage. Anchoring methods
may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to
ground anchors as approved by the Building Official. This requirement is
in addition to applicable state and local anchoring requirements for
resisting wind forces; and
c. All building materials not elevated one ft. above Base Flood Elevation
shall be constructed with materials that resist, and methods that minimize,
flood damages.
4.5.110.04 - Use of Fill within the Floodway Fringe
Any fill allowed to be placed within the Floodway Fringe shall be stable under
conditions of flooding, including rapid rise and rapid drawdown of floodwaters,
prolonged inundation, and flood-related erosion and scour. This standard shall
not be varied.
4.5.110.05 - Below-grade Crawlspaces
Below-grade Crawlspaces are allowed, provided they conform to the following
standards as found in FEMA Technical Bulletin 11-01, Crawlspace Construction
for Buildings Located in Special Flood Hazard Areas:
a. The building shall be designed and adequately anchored to resist flotation,
collapse, and lateral movement of the structure resulting from
hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy.
Hydrostatic loads and the effects of buoyancy can usually be addressed
through the required openings stated in "b," below. Because of
hydrodynamic loads, Crawlspace construction is not allowed in areas with
flood velocities greater than five ft. per second unless the design is
reviewed by a qualified design professional, such as a registered architect
or licensed professional engineer. Other types of foundations are
recommended for these areas;
b. The Crawlspace is an enclosed area below the Base Flood Elevation
(BFE) and, as such, shall have openings that equalize hydrostatic
pressures by allowing the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. The
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 4.5  Floodplain Provisions Page 29 of 41
bottom of each flood vent opening shall be no more than one ft. above the
lowest adjacent exterior grade;
c. Portions of the building below the Base Flood Elevation (BFE) must be
constructed with materials resistant to flood damage. This includes not
only the foundation walls of the Crawlspace used to elevate the building,
but also any joists, insulation, or other materials that extend below the
BFE. The recommended construction practice is to elevate the bottom of
joists and all insulation above BFE;
d. Any building utility systems within the Crawlspace shall be elevated above
Base Flood Elevation (BFE) or designed so that flood waters cannot enter
or accumulate within the system components during flood conditions.
Ductwork, in particular, shall either be placed above the BFE or sealed
from flood waters;
e. The interior grade of a Crawlspace below the Base Flood Elevation (BFE)
shall not be more than two ft. below the lowest adjacent exterior grade;
f. The height of the below-grade Crawlspace, measured from the interior
grade of the Crawlspace to the top of the Crawlspace foundation wall shall
not exceed four ft. at any point. The height limitation is the maximum
allowable unsupported wall height according to the engineering analyses
and Building Code requirements for Special Flood Hazard Areas;
g. There shall be an adequate drainage system that removes flood waters
from the interior area of the crawlspace. The enclosed area should be
drained within a reasonable time after a flood event. The type of drainage
system will vary because of the site gradient and other drainage
characteristics, such as soil types. Possible options include natural
drainage through porous, well-drained soils and drainage systems such as
perforated pipes, drainage tiles, or gravel or crushed stone drainage by
gravity or mechanical means; and
h. The velocity of flood waters at the site should not exceed five ft. per
second for any Crawlspace. For velocities in excess of five ft. per second,
other foundation types should be used (see "a," above).
4.5.110.06 - Standards for Recreational Vehicles
a. For the purposes of this Section, Recreational Vehicle is defined as a
vehicle which includes all the following characteristics:
1. Built on a single chassis;
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)

projection;
3. Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck; and
4. Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling, but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or
seasonal use.
b. All Recreational Vehicles placed on sites within Federal Flood Zones A,
AH, A1-A30, AE, AO, and A99 shall either:
1. Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days;
2. Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, on its wheels or
jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect-type
utilities and security devices, and have no permanently attached
structures or addition; or
3. Meet all standards of Section 4.5.110.03.
4.5.110.07 - Residential Construction
a. New Construction and Substantial Improvement (as defined in Chapter 1.6
- Definitions) of any residential structure, including mobile and
Manufactured Dwellings, shall have the Lowest Floor elevated to a
minimum of one ft. above Base Flood Elevation. In AO Federal Flood
Zones, the Lowest Floor shall be elevated a minimum of one ft. above the
flood Depth Number or, in areas where the Depth Number is unknown, the
Lowest Floor shall be elevated a minimum of three ft. above the Highest
Adjacent Grade. Lowest Floor includes basements and Habitable
attached garages, and electrical (except utility meters), heating,
ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other service
facilities (including ductwork). See definition for Lowest Floor in Section
1.6.40.
b. Accessory buildings and structures less than 200 sq. ft., and fully enclosed
nonhabitable areas below the Lowest Floor that are subject to flooding are
prohibited, unless designed to automatically equalize Hydrostatic flood
forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of flood waters
(fences and walls are not governed by this section, but are subject to the
standards in Section 4.5.110.12). These accessory buildings and
structures and fully enclosed nonhabitable areas include nonhabitable
attached or detached garages, provided they meet the description of an
"unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure" in the Section 1.6.40 definition for
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 4.5  Floodplain Provisions Page 31 of 41
Lowest Floor. Designs for meeting these requirements shall meet
standards outlined in the adopted Oregon Structural Specialty Code and
shall meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
1. A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than
one sq. in. for every sq. ft. of enclosed area subject to flooding shall
be provided;
2. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one ft. above
grade; and
3. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other
coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry
and exit of flood waters.
4.5.110.08 - Nonresidential Construction
a. New Construction and Substantial Improvement of any commercial,
industrial, or other nonresidential structure shall either have the Lowest
Floor elevated a minimum of one ft. above the level of the Base Flood
Elevation, or accomplish the alternative approach in "1," through "3,"
below. Lowest Floor includes basements and Habitable attached
garages, and electrical (except utility meters), heating, ventilation,
plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities
(including ductwork). See definition for Lowest Floor in Section 1.6.40.
The alternative approach includes:
1. Flood-proofing the Lowest Floor together with attendant utilities and
sanitary facilities, so that the structure is watertight a minimum of
one ft. above the Base Flood level;
2. Having the structural components of the Lowest Floor capable of
resisting Hydrostatic and Hydrodynamic Loads and effects of
buoyancy; and
3. Having the alternative design certified by a registered professional
engineer or architect, stating that the design and methods of
construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice
for meeting provisions of this subsection, based on his/her
Development and/or review of the structural design, specifications,
and plans.
b. Designs for meeting the requirements in "a," above, shall meet standards
outlined in the adopted Oregon Structural Specialty Code.
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 4.5  Floodplain Provisions Page 32 of 41
1. Nonresidential buildings and structures that are elevated and not
flood-proofed must have structural components capable of resisting
Hydrostatic and Hydrodynamic Loads and effects of buoyancy, for
space below the Lowest Floor; and
2. Applicants proposing to flood-proof nonresidential buildings shall be
notified that the flood insurance premiums shall be based on rates
for buildings and structures with a Lowest Floor that is one ft. below
the flood-proofed level.
4.5.110.09 - Critical Facilities
Construction of new Critical Facilities, as defined in Section 1.6.40, shall be, to
the maximum extent possible, located outside the limits of Special Flood Hazard
Areas. Construction of new Critical Facilities shall be permissible within the
Special Flood Hazard Area if no feasible alternative site is available. Critical
Facilities constructed within Special Flood Hazard Areas shall have the Lowest
Floor elevated three feet above Base Flood Elevation (or Depth Number in AO
Federal Flood Zones). Access to and from the Critical Facility shall also, to the
maximum extent possible, be protected to the height utilized above within the
corresponding Special Flood Hazard Area(s). Any grade transition necessary to
achieve the access protection requirement shall be achieved outside of the
corresponding Special Flood Hazard Area(s). Dry floodproofing and sealing
measures must be used to ensure that toxic substances or priority organic
pollutants, as defined by the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality, will
not be displaced by or released into floodwaters. The Floodplain Administrator or
designee shall make the determination as to whether or not the Critical Facility's
siting and access have achieved this provision's standards of "to the maximum
extent possible."
Some types of facilities may be critical to a community, but require location within
or partially within Special Flood Hazard Areas because of the nature of the
facilities. The Taylor Water Treatment plant along the Willamette River is an
example of such a facility. It is pulling water from the Willamette River. Because
of this fact, these types of facilities have purposefully been excluded from the
definition of Critical Facility in Section 1.6.40.
4.5.110.10 - Storage Tanks
a. Underground tanks in Special Flood Hazard Areas shall be anchored to
prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement resulting from hydrostatic
loads, including the effects of buoyancy assuming the tank is empty,
during conditions of the design flood.
b. Above-ground tanks in Special Flood Hazard Areas shall be:
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 4.5  Floodplain Provisions Page 33 of 41
1. Attached to and elevated to or above the Base Flood Elevation (or
Depth Number in AO Federal Flood Zones) and attached to a
supporting structure that is designed to prevent flotation, collapse
or lateral movement during conditions of the design flood; or be
2. Anchored or otherwise designed and constructed to prevent
flotation, collapse or lateral movement resulting from hydrodynamic
and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy assuming
the tank is empty, during conditions of the design flood.
c. Tank inlets, fill openings, outlets and vents shall be:
1. A minimum of 2 ft. above Base Flood Elevation (BFE) or fitted with
covers designed to prevent the inflow of floodwater or outflow of the
contents of the tank during conditions of the design flood; and
2. Anchored to prevent lateral movement resulting from hydrodynamic
and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy, during
conditions of the design flood.
4.5.110.11 - On-site Sewage Systems
a. Soil absorption systems shall be located outside of Special Flood Hazard
Areas. Where suitable soil absorption sites outside of Special Flood
Hazard Areas are not available, the soil absorption site is permitted to be
located within an Special Flood Hazard Area, provided the Floodplain
Administrator or designee finds that it is located to minimize the effects of
inundation under conditions of the Base Flood; and
b. Mound systems are prohibited in Special Flood Hazard Areas.
4.5.110.12 - Fences and Walls
Unless exempt per Section 2.11.40.b, a Floodplain Development Permit shall be
obtained for fences and walls, and the fences and walls shall comply with all of
the standards in "a," and "b," below:
a. Applicability - These provisions apply when fences and walls are not
exempt per Section 2.11.40.b, and at least one of the following is true:
1. The velocity of the flood waters where the fence or wall is proposed
is equal to or greater than 5 ft. per second. This velocity
information shall be obtained from one of the two following sources:
a) The Flood Insurance Study for Benton County and
Incorporated Areas, dated June 2, 2011; or
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 4.5  Floodplain Provisions Page 34 of 41
b) For sites where no FEMA Flood Insurance Study is
available, an independent Floodplain study approved by the
Floodplain Administrator or designee and meeting all the
requirements as outlined in Section 4.5.50.03.p; or
2. The velocity of flood waters information specified in "1," above, is
not available from one of the two sources in Section 4.5.110.12.a.1.
In these instances the velocity of flood waters shall be assumed to
be greater than 5 ft. per second.
The purpose of the Floodplain Development Permit for fences and walls in
Floodplain areas with unknown flood water velocities or velocities at least
5 ft. per second, even where the fences and walls meet the design
parameters in Section 4.5.110.12.b, is to ensure proper documentation
and consideration of Floodplain activities for the benefit of the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Floodplain
Administrator or designee.
b. Fencing shall fully comply with Table 4.5-1 Fencing and Wall Parameters
for Fences and Walls that Require a Floodplain Development Permit.

4.5.110.13 - Temporary Structures, Storage, and Bridges
A Floodplain Development Permit is required for construction or placement of
temporary structures, temporary storage associated with nonresidential uses,
and temporary bridges located in Special Flood Hazard Areas:
a. Temporary structures, not including bridges, shall be limited by the
Floodplain Administrator or designee as to time of service, with the intent
that the time of service is limited to the minimum time necessary to
accomplish the temporary activity, per the provisions in "c," below. This
time of service shall not exceed 90 days. The Floodplain Administrator or
designee is authorized to grant extensions for demonstrated cause; such
cause shall reaffirm the temporary nature of the structure. Temporary
structures shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral
movement.
b. Temporary storage of fill shall be limited by the Floodplain Administrator or
designee as to time of service, with the intent that the time of service is
limited to the minimum time necessary to accomplish the temporary
activity, per the provisions in "c," below. This time of service shall not
exceed 90 days and the amount of temporary fill shall be limited to no
more than 50 cubic yards. The Floodplain Administrator or designee is
authorized to grant extensions for demonstrated cause; such cause shall
reaffirm the temporary nature of the storage. Stored material shall be
anchored or contained to prevent flotation or release outside the assigned
storage area. Hazardous materials priority persistent pollutants identified
by the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality shall not be stored in
the 0.2-ft. Floodway.
c. Temporary encroachments, including bridges, in the 0.2-ft. Floodway
require approval of a Floodplain Development Permit subject to conditions
"1" through "7", below. No CLOMR/LOMR is required1.
1. The Floodplain Development Permit shall stipulate the days and
dates the Development will be on site. The Floodplain Administrator
or designee shall determine the permissible period of
encroachment based on the existing and expected hydrologic
conditions of the 0.2-Floodway, as well as the type of and need for
the encroachment. The Floodplain Administrator or designee is
authorized to grant extensions for demonstrated cause; such cause
shall reaffirm the temporary nature of the Development and be
based on the hydrologic conditions expected during the period of
extension. The Floodplain Administrator or designee is authorized
to place limits on the volume of materials placed within the 0.2-ft.
1 No CLOMR/LOMR will be required because there is no need to modify the FIRM due to the temporary
condition of the encroachment.
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 4.5  Floodplain Provisions Page 37 of 41
Floodway as a temporary encroachment and, when making such a
determination, shall consider the existing and expected hydrologic
conditions during the period of encroachment, as well as the type of
and need for the encroachment;
2. A flood warning plan for the project shall be in place to allow
equipment to be evacuated from the site and placed outside the
Floodplain prior to inundation by flood waters;
3. Placement of equipment in the Floodway shall be restricted to only
that equipment which is absolutely necessary for the purposes of
the project. All other accessory equipment and temporary
structures (i.e., construction trailers) shall be restricted from the 0.2-
ft. Floodway. Structures should be placed on site so that flood
damages are minimized. In instances where the Floodplain
Administrator or designee believes that evacuation isn't practical,
the Floodplain Administrator or designee is authorized to require
anchoring of construction trailers;
4. Temporary changes to the Floodplain under a one percent chance
flood event (100-yr. flood) shall be identified; and
5. The applicant shall be notified in writing that they may be liable for
any flood damages resulting from the temporary structure.
4.5.110.14 - Non-conversion of Enclosed Areas Below the Lowest Floor
To ensure that the areas below the Base Flood Elevation (BFE) continue to be
used solely for parking vehicles, limited storage, or access to the building and not
be finished for use as human habitation without first becoming fully compliant
with the provisions of this chapter and Chapter 2.11 - Floodplain Development
Permit in effect at the time of conversion, the Floodplain Administrator or
designee shall:
a. Determine which applicants for New Construction and/or Substantial
Improvements have fully enclosed areas below the Lowest Floor that are
five ft. or higher;
b. Require the property owner to enter into a "NON-CONVERSION
AGREEMENT FOR CONSTRUCTION WITHIN SPECIAL FLOOD
HAZARD AREAS" or equivalent with the City of Corvallis. The agreement
shall be recorded with Benton County as a deed restriction. The nonconversion
agreement shall be reviewed and approved by the Floodplain
Administrator or designee; and
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 4.5  Floodplain Provisions Page 38 of 41
c. Have the authority to inspect any area of a structure below the Base Flood
Elevation to ensure compliance upon prior notice of at least 72 hours.
Section 4.5.120 - SUBDIVISIONS, LAND PARTITIONS, AND PROPERTY LINE
ADJUSTMENTS
Subdivisions, Property Line Adjustments, and Minor Land Partitions that would create
parcels or lots that cannot be developed in conformance with the regulations contained
in this Chapter are prohibited, with the exception of lots created for public park
purposes. See Section 4.5.90.03.
4.5.130 - MAP REFINEMENTS
4.5.130.01 - Map Refinements Defined
Map Refinements are adjustments made through professional analyses to refine
the actual boundaries of some Natural Resources and Natural Hazards. Map
Refinements must be made in accordance with the provisions in Chapter 4.5 -
Floodplain Provisions, Chapter 4.13 - Riparian Corridor and Wetland Provisions,
and Chapter 4.14 - Landslide Hazard and Hillside Development Provisions. The
Map Refinements governed by this chapter are specifically allowed to determine
the location and extent of the:
a. 0.2-ft. Floodway;
b. 1.0-ft. Floodway, in accordance with FEMA regulations; and
c. 100-yr. Floodplain, in accordance with FEMA regulations.
4.5.130.02 - Map Refinements Provisions
a. Map Refinement provisions for the 0.2-ft. Floodway, the 1.0-ft. Floodway,
and the 100-yr. Floodplain are outlined below. Map Refinement provisions
for Top-of-bank, Riparian Corridor, and Wetland boundaries are outlined in
Chapter 4.13 - Riparian Corridor and Wetland Provisions. Map
Refinement provisions for Landslide Hazard areas and slopes are outlined
in Chapter 4.14 - Landslide Hazard and Hillside Development Provisions.
Map Refinements are also adjustments to resolve registration issues that
may occur between different GIS layers or maps, or adjustments that may
be necessary to comply with updates to applicable Flood Insurance Rate
Maps, Digital Flood Insurance Rate Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies
issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
b. Floodplain and Floodway Boundaries - The precise locations of
Floodplain and Floodway boundaries are determined as follows:
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 4.5  Floodplain Provisions Page 39 of 41
1. 0.2-ft. Floodway - Surveyed and mapped by a licensed surveyor or
civil engineer, using two-ft. contour intervals established by the
survey, and outlining a river channel or other Watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the
Base Flood (100-yr. Flood) without cumulatively increasing the
water surface elevation more than 0.2 ft.
2. 1.0-ft. Floodway - Surveyed and mapped by a licensed surveyor or
civil engineer, using two-ft. contour intervals established by the
survey, and outlining a river channel or other Watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the
Base Flood (100-yr. Flood) without cumulatively increasing the
water surface elevation more than one ft.
3. 100-Yr. Floodplain -
a) 100-yr. Floodplain in Areas Studied by FEMA and
Addressed by Current Federal Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) -
1) Surveyed and mapped by a licensed surveyor or civil
engineer, using the Base Flood Elevations
established by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) and two-ft. contour intervals
established by the survey; or
2) FEMA-approved adjustments as specified in "i," and
"ii," below. However, no adjustments to the FIRM
other than those specified in "i," and "ii," below may
occur through the Map Refinement process.
i) Adjustments needed to comply with updates to
applicable Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Digital
Flood Insurance Rate Maps, and Flood
Insurance Studies issued by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency.
ii) Adjustments needed to reflect Letters of Map
Amendment (LOMAs) and Letters of Map
Revision (LOMRs) approved by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
The Director shall only correct the 100-yr.
Floodplain portion of the City's maps to exactly
reflect FEMA decisions.
b) 100-Yr. Floodplain in Areas Not Studied by FEMA and Not
Addressed by Current Federal Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) -
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 4.5  Floodplain Provisions Page 40 of 41
Sections 4.5.20.01.b and 4.5.50.03.p require Floodplain
Studies to identify the 100-yr. Floodplain and related
information in areas that are unmapped by the current FEMA
Flood Insurance Study for Benton County and Incorporated
Areas, dated, June 2, 1011, and are, therefore, not shown
on the current Federal Insurance Rate Map (FIRM).
Provided the information is entirely consistent with Sections
4.5.20.01.b and 4.5.50.03.p, the Map Refinement process
can be used to map the 100-yr. Floodplain for these
unstudied and unmapped areas. Once identified and
approved by the Floodplain Administrator or designee, these
newly mapped areas shall be reflected in the Natural
Hazards Overlay on the Comprehensive Plan and Zoning

Floodplain on the Natural Hazards Map.
4.5.130.03 - Map Refinement Procedures
a. Adjustments to maps consistent with the provisions of Sections 4.5.130.01
and 4.5.130.02, above, are considered to be Map Refinements and may
be Ministerially adjusted on the relevant maps, with no land use process
required other than a demonstrated adherence to the provisions of
Sections 4.5.130.01 and 4.5.130.02.
b. Adjustments to maps to address FEMA-approved Letters of Map
Amendment (LOMAs) and Letters of Map Revisions (LOMRs) for 100-yr.
Floodplain information may be requested following written verification of a
LOMA or LOMR approved by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA). When the FEMA determines that a LOMA or LOMR
should be approved, and written documentation of the approval is
provided to the Community Development Director, the Director shall
ensure that changes reflected in the LOMA or LOMR are reflected in the
City's affected maps and databases.
4.5.140 - MAP CORRECTIONS
No Zone Change or Comprehensive Plan Map Amendment shall be required to
accomplish Map Corrections approved in accordance with the provisions outlined in this
Section.
a. Decisions regarding Map Correction requests shall be made by the Community
Development Director, as specified in Sections 4.5.140.01 and 4.5.140.02,
below. Upon approval of a Map Correction request, the Director shall ensure that
changes are reflected in the Citys affected maps and databases. Notice of such
Map Correction shall be provided to decision-makers as outlined in Section
4.5.140.b, below.
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 4.5  Floodplain Provisions Page 41 of 41
b. When requests for five Map Corrections on any Natural Hazard or Natural
Resource for which a Map Correction is allowed have been submitted to and
decided upon by the Community Development Department Director, or
approximately twice a year, whichever is sooner, the Map Correction requests
shall be summarized in an informational memo for decision-makers so that they
may review them for tracking purposes in accordance with Comprehensive Plan
Policy 4.2.6. This memo shall be shared with the Corvallis Planning Commission
and City Council for Map Correction requests on lands within the City limits; and
with the Corvallis and Benton County Planning Commissions, the Corvallis City
Council, and the Benton County Board of Commissioners for Map Correction
requests on lands within the Urban Fringe.
4.5.140.01  Map Corrections Defined
a. A Map Correction is not the type of adjustment described in the Map
Refinement provisions of Section 4.5.130, above. A Map Correction is,
however, an actual correction to maps referencing Natural Hazards or Natural
Resources other than Significant Vegetation areas, where it is found that the
map depiction does not reflect the Natural Features Inventory. As the Natural
Features Inventory (NFI) was the basis for developing the Citys maps that
reference Natural Hazards and Natural Resources, a correction to the NFI for
Natural Hazards or Natural Resources other than Significant Vegetation areas
could result in a correction to the related maps. These maps include the
Comprehensive Plan Map, Local Wetlands Inventory Map, Official Zoning
Map, Natural Hazards Map, or Riparian Corridors and Wetlands Map.
b. Map Correction provisions for the 100-year Floodplain are outlined below.
Adjustments to other hazards governed by this chapter are not Map
Corrections, but are Map Refinements and are addressed through the
provisions of Section 4.5.130, above. Map Correction provisions for Riparian
Corridor widths and Wetland boundaries are outlined in Chapter 4.13 -
Riparian Corridor and Wetland Provisions. Map Correction provisions for
Landslide Hazard Areas are outlined in Chapter 4.14 - Landslide Hazard and
Hillside Development Provisions.

A reduction or waiver from the requirements of Section 4.6.30 above may be granted by
the Planning Commission to the minimum extent necessary to:
a. Reflect development constraints associated with complying with the hillside
development provisions of Chapter 4.14 - Landslide Hazard and Hillside
Development Provisions or reflect physical land development constraints related
to the shape of the site;
b. Meet City design requirements for provision of landscaping and location of
buildings consistent with minimum setbacks; or
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 4.6  Solar Access Page 3 of 4
c. Address sites where site planning to achieve Solar Access is negatively affected
by the construction of streets, utilities, bridges, bicycle, and pedestrian facilities
that are required by the City of Corvallis Transportation Plan, or other adopted
City Plan, or that are necessary in order to maintain an acceptable functional
classification of roadways adjacent to the property. It must be shown that no
other reasonable location is available for the required infrastructure.
Section 4.6.50 - ADJUSTMENTS TO IMPLEMENT SOLAR STANDARD IN
SUBDIVISIONS
For Residential Subdivisions approved by the Planning Commission or City Council,
modifications to solar provisions on a lot-by-lot basis may be authorized by the Director
without public notice under any of the following conditions:
a. Where the affected property is developed and the change would not affect an
existing dwelling;
b. Where the affected property is vacant and the Director finds that the proposed
change will still maintain a 1400 sq. ft. building area on the affected lot where the
dwelling located in this area would have Solar Access as outlined in Section
4.6.30; or
c. Where the proposed change would not increase shade on the affected dwelling
more than that resulting from more than a six-ft.-high fence on the property line;
or
d. Where the Director finds that an error in the original solar calculations has been
made so that a two-story house cannot be built within the setbacks on the heightrestricted
lot.
Any other modifications shall be in accordance with Chapter 2.12 - Lot Development
Option.
Section 4.6.60 - REDUCTION OR WAIVER OF STANDARD IN PLANNED
DEVELOPMENTS

provisions of Section 4.6.40 above or to the minimum extent necessary to:
a. Meet a broad range of residential needs by encouraging use of innovative site
development techniques and a mix of Housing Types;
b. Address future housing needs in the community by encouraging Affordable
Housing, as defined in Chapter 1.6 - Definitions, to increase housing choices;
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 4.6  Solar Access Page 4 of 4
c. Reflect development constraints associated with complying with the hillside
development provisions of Chapter 4.14 - Landslide Hazard and Hillside
Development Provisions or reflect physical land development constraints related
to the shape of the site;
d. Meet City design requirements for provision of landscaping and location of
buildings consistent with minimum setbacks; or
e. Address sites where site planning to achieve Solar Access is negatively affected
by the construction of streets, roads, utilities, bridges, bicycle, and pedestrian
facilities that are required by the City of Corvallis Transportation Plan, or other
adopted City Plan, or that are necessary in order to maintain an acceptable
functional classification of roadways adjacent to the property. It must be shown
that no other reasonable location is available for the required infrastructure.
A reduction or waiver may not be granted under this Section unless the applicant
demonstrates that the loss of Solar Access for current and future generations has been
mitigated by a substantial increase in energy efficiency of the proposed dwellings over
Building Code requirements.

Section 4.7.80 - ALLOCATION PROVISIONS AND DESIGN STANDARDS BY TYPE
OF SIGN
The following provisions and design standards organized by type of sign specify how the
total sign allocation may be used. Unless specified elsewhere in these regulations, the
sign allocation for a property shall be determined by multiplying the length of a property's
primary frontage by the primary frontage multiple, which is identified for each zone in
Section 4.7.90 below.
4.7.80.01 - General Sign Standards
a. All signs and sign structures shall comply with the standards of these
regulations and with the provisions of the Building Code. Unless otherwise
permitted by these regulations, no sign shall exceed 200 sq. ft. in area.
b. Sign allocation for a given frontage may be apportioned to attached signs
and, if permitted by these regulations, to free-standing and temporary signs.
That portion of the sign allocation used by a business or tenant for attached
signage on a given frontage shall be used in not more than two signs. If
property frontage allocation for attached signs exceeds the maximum Sign
Area size of the zone, additional allocation may be used in additional
sign(s), provided that an eight ft. separation is maintained between signs.
Portable Signs, as defined in Chapter 1.6 - Definitions, are exempt from sign
allocation requirements.
c. Sign Area allocation for a primary frontage may be used for attached sign(s)
that face a secondary frontage, limited to one sign per establishment. The
amount of allocation used for secondary frontage signs shall be subtracted
from and shall not exceed the total sign allocation for the property.
d. The maximum projection of attached signs facing secondary frontages shall
be six in., except no sign shall project over a public alley.
e. Minimum setback from the curb face where signs are permitted over a
public street right-of-way shall be two ft.
f. Where illuminated signs are permitted, illumination may be provided by
internal lighting or external spot lighting unless otherwise specified. In no
case shall this illumination cause direct glare on adjacent properties or
streets.
g. Up to two poles, each with a maximum diameter of six in., may be placed
within the Vision Clearance Area as defined by the City Engineer, and used
to support a sign above a Vision Clearance Area. Any other intrusion into
the Vision Clearance Area by a sign or its supporting structure is prohibited
without written approval of the City Engineer.

Section 4.10.10 - PURPOSE
The Pedestrian Oriented Design Standards in this Chapter are established to do the following:
a. Implement applicable policies of the Comprehensive Plan;
b. Foster human-scale development that emphasizes pedestrian rather than vehicular
features;
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 4.10  Pedestrian Oriented Design Standards Page 2 of 47
c. Promote pedestrian oriented buildings, pedestrian amenities, and landscaping that
contribute positively to an appealing streetscape;
d. Promote an environment where developed areas, recreational areas, and multi-use
paths are accessible to all;
e. Promote pedestrian safety by increasing the visibility and vitality of pedestrian areas;
f. Ensure direct and convenient access and connections for pedestrians and bicyclists;
g. Augment the sidewalk and multi-use path system for pedestrians;
h. Provide a connected network of sidewalks and multi-use paths;
i. Encourage street activity to support livable neighborhoods and vital commercial areas;
j. Ensure that developments contribute to the logical continuation of the City's street and
block form and/or establish block patterns in parts of the City where they do not exist;
k. Provide a sense of diversity and architectural variety, especially in residential areas,
through the use of varied site design layouts and building types and varied densities,
sizes, styles, and materials;
l. Encourage development and building designs that promote crime prevention and
personal and community safety; and
m. Encourage development and building designs that maintain some level of privacy for
individual dwelling units.
Section 4.10.20 - APPLICABILITY
The Pedestrian Oriented Design Standards shall apply to those chapters in this Code that
reference compliance with this Chapter.
Section 4.10.30 - OPTIONS FOR REVIEW
Three options are available for review of a development's compliance with the Pedestrian
Oriented Design Standards. These options include:
a. Clear and Objective Review - Applications shall demonstrate compliance with the
standards in this Chapter. Compliance allows applications to proceed with ministerial
review when they consist of outright permitted uses or when they have already
obtained the necessary discretionary review approvals.
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 4.10  Pedestrian Oriented Design Standards Page 3 of 47
b. Lot Development Option - Adjustments to the standards may be requested through the
Lot Development Option procedures outlined in Chapter 2.12 - Lot Development Option.
c. Discretionary Reviews Involving Public Hearings - Flexibility beyond the allowances
described in "b," above may be requested in accordance with the procedures in Chapter
2.5 - Planned Development.
Section 4.10.40 - APPLICATION OF STANDARDS
a. Residential Uses - For all Residential Uses, the applicable residential standards shall
apply.
b. Commercial, Industrial, and Civic Uses - For all Commercial, Industrial, and Civic Uses,
the applicable commercial, industrial, and civic standards shall apply.
c. Mixed Use Buildings - For mixed use buildings, the applicable provisions for each use
component shall apply to that portion of the building. For example, if a mixed use
building has ground floor retail and residential above, the standards for Commercial,
Industrial, and Civic Uses shall apply to the commercial portion, and the Residential Use
standards shall apply to the remainder of the building. If a conflict exists between
standards, the standard that provides more pedestrian amenities applies.
d. Orientation to Streets - Where a lot or parcel fronts on three or more streets, the
requirements of this Chapter, such as building orientation, location of parking, etc.,
apply to only two of these streets. For Through Lots in low density residential zones,
and/or on a site where there is an existing Through Lot Easement, the requirements of
this Chapter, such as building orientation, location of parking, etc., apply to only one
street.

GREATER, TOWNHOME, TRIPLEX, FOURPLEX, AND APARTMENT RESIDENTIAL BUILDING TYPES
4.10.60.01 - Building Orientation, Entrances, and Facades Adjacent to Pedestrian
Areas
All building orientations, facades, and entrances shall comply with the following
standards.
a. Orientation of Buildings - All dwellings shall be oriented to existing or proposed
public or private streets, as outlined in this provision and in Chapter 4.4 - Land
Division Standards. Private streets used to meet this standard must include the
elements in Chapter 4.0 - Improvements Required with Development. See
Chapter 4.0 for public and private street standards.
1. Primary building entrances shall face the streets or be directly accessed
from a public street right-of-way or private street tract by a sidewalk or
multi-use path less than 200 ft. long (distance measured along the
centerline of the path from a public street right-of-way or private street
tract), as shown in Figure 4.10-13 - Primary Building Entrances Within 200
Ft. of the Street, below. Primary entrances may provide access to
individual units, clusters of units, courtyard dwellings, or common
lobbies. Entrances shall open directly to the outside and shall not require
passage through a garage or carport to gain access to the doorway. This
provision shall apply to development of attached single-family dwelling
units (three or more) and to development of three or more units on a
single lot in any configuration of building types as allowed by the
associated zone.

2. Open courtyard space may increase up to 50 percent of the building front
beyond the maximum setback, as shown in Figure 4.10-14 - Open
Courtyards, below. Open courtyard space is usable space that shall
include pedestrian amenities such as benches, seating walls, or similar
furnishings, and shall include landscaping. For example, an apartment
building in a Mixed Use Residential Zone is required to have a front yard
setback of no more than 15 ft. If a developer desires to construct a ushaped
building with a pedestrian courtyard in the center, then one half
the width of the building, based upon the lineal footage of the building's
street frontage, could be located farther back than the maximum setback
of 15 ft.
Figure 4.10-14- Open Courtyards
3. Off-street parking and vehicular circulation shall not be placed between
buildings and the streets to which those buildings are primarily oriented,
with the following exceptions:

e. The required standards applicable to expansions shall be applied either to the
portion of the building being expanded, or in equal proportion to portions of the
original building not in compliance with respect to the standard. For example,
where windows may be required, but the security of a proposed storage room is
needed, the applicant may install windows on other portions of the building not
in compliance with the window provisions to satisfy the requirements.
f. Expansions proposed for sites containing existing parking lots not in compliance
with the parking lot design standards in this Chapter and in Chapter 4.1 - Parking,
Loading, and Access Requirements, and containing parking spaces in excess of
the minimum required for the existing development on the site, shall first use
the excess parking spaces to satisfy the parking requirements of the expansion,
and shall modify those portions of the parking lot(s) associated with the
proposed expansion in accordance with the design standards in this Chapter and
in Chapter 4.1. The modifications shall comply with the parking lot design
standards to the maximum extent that they can be accommodated by the
existing site development.
g. Accessory Structures not open to customers or the public, and modular
classroom buildings on school grounds, shall not be required to comply with this
section provided that:
1. The Accessory Structure is not located between the primary building and
the street to which that building is oriented; and either
2. The building is 500 sq. ft. or less in size; or
3. The building is 3,000 sq. ft. or less in size and is equivalent to 20 percent
or less of the primary structures gross floor area.
4.10.70.02 - Building Orientation
All buildings shall be oriented, as outlined in this Section, to existing or proposed public
or private streets. See Chapter 4.0 - Improvements Required with Development for
public and private street standards. Buildings on corner parcels shall be oriented to both
streets bordering the property. Private streets used to meet this standard must include
the elements in Chapter 4.0.
The building orientation standard is met when all of the following criteria are met:
a. Street Frontage Setback - At least 50 percent of the building's linear frontage is
located within the maximum setback established for the zone for structures that
have street frontage, as shown below in Figure 4.10-18 - Percent of Building
Frontage Within Maximum Setback Area. An exception to this requirement
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 4.10  Pedestrian Oriented Design Standards Page 30 of 47
pertains to provisions elsewhere in this Chapter for development in the
Neighborhood Center (NC) Zone. Expansion of a structure existing prior to
December 31, 2006, and in conformance with the Code on that date is deemed
to meet this criterion, provided the area of expansion is between the street and
the existing building frontage.
Figure 4.10-18  Percent of Building Frontage within
Maximum Setback Area
b. Entrances - All building sides that face an adjacent public or private street
include at least one customer entrance. When the site is adjacent to more than
one street, corner entrances at an angle of up to 45 degrees, from the largest of
the two adjacent streets, may be substituted for separate entrances on adjacent
streets. If the building does not have frontage along an adjacent street, direct
pedestrian access to the street may be achieved by a sidewalk or courtyard
connecting to a street no farther than 100 ft. from the building's pedestrian
entrance (distance measured along the centerline of the sidewalk or over the
"hard-surfaced" portion of the courtyard from a public street right-of-way or
private street tract). Examples of these requirements are shown below in Figure
4.10-19 - Site Development Element Locations. Buildings of less than 3,000 sq.
ft. fronting on only one street may provide the customer entrance on the side of
the building in lieu of the front, if a sidewalk or courtyard provides a direct,
"hard-surfaced" pedestrian connection of less than 50 ft. between the entrance
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 4.10  Pedestrian Oriented Design Standards Page 31 of 47
and the street (distance measured along the centerline of the sidewalk or over
the "hard-surfaced" portion of the courtyard from a public street right-of-way or
private street tract).
Figure 4.10-19  Site Development Element Locations
c. Parking and Vehicle Circulation - Off-street parking or vehicular circulation shall
not be placed between buildings and streets used to comply with this standard,
as shown above in Figure 4.10-19 - Site Development Element Locations. Where
allowed by the underlying zone, outdoor vehicle display lots for sale of autos,
noncommercial trucks, motorcycles, trailers with less than 10,000 lbs. gross
cargo weight, motor homes, and boats may be located adjacent to streets. The
parking lot perimeter landscaping requirements of Section 4.2.40 of Chapter 4.2
- Landscaping, Buffering, Screening, and Lighting shall be met.
d. Neighborhood Center (NC) Zone Special Provisions - Buildings in the
Neighborhood Center (NC) Zone shall comply with the following additional
standards. See Figure 4.10-20 - Shopping Streets for context:
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 4.10  Pedestrian Oriented Design Standards Page 32 of 47
1. Buildings shall be oriented to designated Shopping Streets, public open
space, or a public park; and
2. On designated Shopping Streets in the Neighborhood Center (NC) Zone,
80 percent of the building front shall be within the maximum setback.
The maximum setback may be waived if pedestrian amenities occupy the
extended setback area, as shown in Figure 4.10-19 - Site Development
Element Locations. Pedestrian amenities are defined in Section
4.10.70.05.
e. Exception for Enhanced Pedestrian Environment - Within a Minor
Neighborhood Center, an exception to the requirement that all buildings on
corner parcels front both streets may be granted through the process identified
in Chapter 2.16 - Request for Interpretation if the proposed Shopping Street's
design and layout can be shown to provide a pedestrian environment that is
clearly superior to the environment that would result from the corner
orientation. An example of a design and layout with a clearly superior
pedestrian environment is one where the Shopping Street is enclosed, etc. For
Major Neighborhood Centers, such exceptions may be granted, based on the
same standard, through the process identified in Chapter 2.10 - Major
Neighborhood Center Master Site Plan Requirements.
f. Grading (Cuts and Fills) - Structures and on-site improvements shall be designed
to fit the natural contours of the site and be consistent with the Natural Hazards
and Natural Resource Provisions of Chapter 2.11 - Floodplain Development
Permit, Chapter 4.2 - Landscaping, Buffering, Screening, and Lighting, Chapter
4.5 - Floodplain Provisions, Chapter 4.11 - Minimum Assured Development Area

1. Existing trees shall be considered preserved only if no cutting, filling, or
compaction of the soil takes place between the trunk of the tree and the
perimeter of the tree's Circle of Protection. A Circle of Protection is
created by the greater of the two areas defined by the formulas below:
a) A radius in feet that equals the diameter in inches of the tree trunk
at four ft. above Natural Grade. For example, a 15-in. diameter tree
creates a 15 ft. radius of protected area; or
b) A perimeter located five ft. outside of the tree's drip-line.
2. Existing vegetation may be considered preserved only if no cutting, filling,
or compaction of the soil takes place within the vegetation's Circle of
Protection. A Circle of Protection for vegetation is created by defining a
circle around the vegetation, the perimeter of which is located one ft.
outside of the vegetation's drip-line or edge.
3. Temporary fencing to protect trees and vegetation shall be used to clearly
mark areas to be preserved. Such fencing shall be placed outside the

Tree species. See Tree, Large Canopy in Chapter 1.6 - Definitions.
i. Required street trees and parking lot landscaping shall not be credited toward
mitigation trees, shrubs, or ground covers.
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 4.12  Significant Vegetation Protection Provisions Page 15 of 18
j. Required street trees and parking lot landscaping trees shall be credited for
Mature Tree Canopy Coverage in developed areas outside protected HPSV or
PPSV areas.
k. Trees, shrubs, and ground covers required in Section 4.12.60 to be planted to
achieve minimum landscape and/or Tree Canopy Coverage shall be continuously
maintained in a healthy manner. Prior to the removal of any vegetation a cash
deposit, bond, or other financial security allowed by Code in the amount of 125
percent of the cost of required mitigation trees, shrubs, and ground covers shall
be provided. Similar financial security for maintenance and replacement of
vegetation shall be provided for a minimum of five years after the plantings.
Required trees, shrubs, and ground covers that die within the first five years after
initial planting must be replaced in kind.
l. Required trees, shrubs, and ground covers shall be planted within 180 days of
their removal and shall be irrigated as per Chapter 4.2 - Landscaping, Buffering,
Screening, and Lighting, except as provided in "f.5," above.

Chapter 4.13  Riparian Corridor and Wetland Provisions Page 1 of 25
CHAPTER 4.13
RIPARIAN CORRIDOR AND WETLAND PROVISIONS
Section 4.13.10 - PURPOSES
These provisions are intended to protect and preserve Significant Riparian Corridors
and Wetland areas within the City of Corvallis. They are intended to protect open,
natural Streams, drainageways, Special Flood Hazard Areas, and Wetlands as integral
parts of the City environment. These provisions are also intended to maintain both the
hydrological and biological functions of open drainageways, Special Flood Hazard
Areas, and Wetland systems in accordance with the Corvallis Stormwater Master Plan;
OAR Chapter 660, Division 23, the Administrative Rule that implements Statewide
Planning Goal 5 - Open Spaces, Scenic and Historic Areas, and Natural Resources;
and other state and federal regulations, including Statewide Planning Goal 6 - Air,
Water, and Land Resources Quality. In order to assist in the furtherance of these
purposes, where not required, open space tracts are encouraged within areas
designated as Natural Resources or Natural Hazards on the Comprehensive Plan and
Official Zoning Maps.
a. These provisions are necessary in order to:
1. Manage stormwater drainage;
2. Accommodate increases in runoff volume resulting from urbanization;
3. Moderate increases in peak flows resulting from urbanization;
4. Minimize drainageway and other maintenance costs;
5. Protect properties adjacent to drainageways;
6. Improve surface and groundwater water quality; and
7. Protect Riparian Corridor and Wetland plant and animal habitats.
b. Consistent with the Corvallis Comprehensive Plan, these provisions are
also intended to:
1. Minimize harm to natural systems from their use as a stormwater facility;
2. Maintain the Properly Functioning Conditions of Stream and Wetland
systems;
3. Preserve hydrological conveyance and storage capacity;
4. Provide for infiltration and groundwater recharge;
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 4.13  Riparian Corridor and Wetland Provisions Page 2 of 25
5. Allow for natural channel lateral migration and bank failure;
6. Allow for channel widening and other channel modifications that result
from changes in hydrology from urban development;
7. Provide proper shading of the Stream to maintain or improve water quality;
8. Allow for a vegetative management strategy that encourages native
riparian species;
9. Provide a pollutant filtering zone for surface runoff;
10. Allow for natural Stream processes to minimize Stream channel, bank,
and corridor maintenance needs;
11. Buffer urban uses from Stream processes;
12. Provide a source for large woody debris; and
13. Preserve the 0.2-ft. Floodway.
Section 4.13.20 - APPLICABILITY
These provisions apply to Significant Riparian Corridor and Wetland areas, as mapped
on the Corvallis Riparian Corridors and Wetlands Map. However, state and federal
Wetland and riparian regulations will continue to apply to Wetland and Riparian Corridor
areas within the City, regardless of whether or not they are mapped on the Corvallis
Riparian Corridors and Wetlands Map. Nothing in these regulations should be
interpreted as superceding or nullifying state or federal requirements.
Section 4.13.30 - GREATER RESTRICTIONS
This Chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements,
covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this Chapter and any other ordinance,
easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more
stringent restrictions shall prevail. It is likely that there will be some overlap between the
regulations in this Chapter and those in Chapter 2.11 - Floodplain Development Permit
and Chapter 4.5 - Floodplain Provisions, which regulate development in Natural Hazard
areas, including the 100-year Floodplain (Special Flood Hazard Area). Where two
regulations are in conflict, the most stringent shall govern.
Section 4.13.40 - PROCEDURES
Compliance with the provisions of this Chapter shall be determined through the

a high level of protection due to their environmental importance and Natural Resource
quality. Riparian-related Areas are defined as Proximate Wetlands, drainage
easements and drainage dedications under the Citys jurisdiction, and open space tracts
that have been created for Riparian Corridor protection purposes. Additionally, the
Special Flood Hazard Area serves an important Riparian Function. This area is
mapped on the Citys Natural Hazards Map, and is subject to the protections outlined in
Chapter 2.11 - Floodplain Development Permit and Chapter 4.5 - Floodplain Provisions.
In addition to the requirements of the underlying zone, the following limitations and
exceptions shall apply to activities within Highly Protected Riparian Corridors and
Riparian-related Areas, as mapped on the Citys Riparian Corridors and Wetlands Map.
a. Removal of Vegetation - Removal of vegetation from Riparian Corridors and
Riparian-related Areas is prohibited, except for the following purposes:

constructed to minimize adverse impacts to Riparian Corridors and Riparianrelated
Areas.
1. Replacement or Relocation of Existing Buildings - Replacement or
relocation of existing buildings, either within the buildings original
footprint, or with the same or reduced square footage area elsewhere on
the site. A relocation of an existing building within the same square
footage area, but located elsewhere on the site, is only allowed if the
relocation of the building enhances Riparian, Stormwater, and Floodplain
Functions. Under no circumstances shall a relocated building be located
within 15 ft. of Top-of-bank. The relocation shall be considered to enhance
Stormwater, and Floodplain Function if it furthers any of the following
goals without worsening any other goal:
a) Replaces standard construction with Flow-through Design
construction, if the building is within the 100-year Floodplain
(Special Flood Hazard Area);

Section 4.13.70 - DRAINAGEWAY TRACTS, EASEMENTS, AND DEDICATIONS
Section 4.13.70.01 - Overview
a. Impacts of Development - Development can have a number of impacts
on the drainage system and its associated water quality. These potential
impacts include, but are not limited to:
1. Increases in the amount and velocity of surface water runoff;
2. Decreases in the time for stormwater destined for drainageways to
reach peak flow;
3. Increases in the frequency and velocity of floods;
4. Channel incision and widening;
5. Increases in water temperature; and
6. Increases in the quantity and types of pollutants that may enter
drainageways.
b. Minimizing Impacts of Development -
1. The drainageways within the City are intended to function as a
wholistic natural system that includes both Fish-bearing Streams
and other Streams whose flow is recognized to have direct impacts
on these Fish-bearing Streams. The City intends to manage
stormwater from development in a manner that maintains or
improves the Properly Functioning Conditions of the Streams
utilized for stormwater discharge.
2. Requiring of Easements -
a) Reasons for Requiring Easements -
1) To ensure that negative impacts to the system in a,
above, are minimized;
2) To accommodate and maintain the natural
hydrological functions and processes; and
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 4.13  Riparian Corridor and Wetland Provisions Page 16 of 25
3) To provide and maintain adequate stormwater
facilities.
b) When the Granting of an Easements is Required -
1) For new development, expansion of existing
development, or redevelopment proposed on land
abutting or containing an open, natural drainageway.
2) The granting of this easement shall be under the
conditions described in Section 4.13.70.02, below,
over lands suitable for conveying storm waters and for
maintaining and operating an effective open
drainageway system.
3. The easement required by 2, above, is intended to satisfy the
purposes cited in Section 4.13.10, as well as the stormwater
management purposes identified in Chapter 2.11 - Floodplain
Development Permit and Chapter 4.5 - Floodplain Provisions; and
shall be reviewed and approved by the City Engineer or Floodplain
Administrator or designee, as appropriate.
Section 4.13.70.02 - Easements, Easement Restrictions, Dedications, and
Easement Widths
a. Easement - An easement shall be required when:
1. Development is proposed on a vacant parcel or a partially developed
parcel, and the amount of impervious surface on the parcel resulting from
new development and/or redevelopment occurring after December 31,
2004, would cumulatively equal or exceed 20 percent of the total area of
the parcel. The effects of new development and/or redevelopment shall
be cumulative from December 31, 2004, and when the net effect of one or
more changes results in 20 percent impervious coverage or more, an
easement shall be required; or
2. A parcel of land is divided into two or more parcels, whether by Land
Partition or Subdivision.
b. Easement Restrictions - The easement shall contain sufficient restrictions on
the use of the area to satisfy the purposes cited in Section 4.13.10 above.
Restrictions shall apply to structural improvements, regrading, filling, and
alteration of existing vegetative cover, as specified on an easement document
provided by the City Engineer. Trees that fall within riparian easement areas are
not to be removed, unless they are a hazard, or unless they would create
flooding that would cause structural damage.
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 4.13  Riparian Corridor and Wetland Provisions Page 17 of 25
c. Dedications - The City will strongly consider accepting voluntary
drainageway dedications provided:
1. Public maintenance of the drainageway is anticipated or public
ownership will enhance protection of the resource or maintenance
of Stormwater Functions;
2. Dedication of the drainageway area does not create substandard
lot size, substandard building setbacks, or otherwise reduce
applicable development standards to the point that would render
the existing development Nonconforming;
3. The methodologies for determining width described in subsection
d, are utilized; and
4. The land to be dedicated is placed in a separate tract through the
Land Division process.
d. Easement Widths - When an easement is required, the appropriate width shall
be as described in 1, through 5, below. However, in no case shall riparian
easements include areas containing existing buildings that are intended to
remain, nor shall easements include development area assured under 4, below.
For areas with Riparian Corridors, as designated on the Citys Riparian Corridors
and Wetlands Map, the associated easement width and requirements shall be as
follows:
1. Measurement and Separate Tract - Easement areas shall be measured
from Top-of-bank, as indicated from a submitted topographic survey, and
shall be placed in a separate tract.
2. Easement Width - When an easement is required, the appropriate width
shall be as outlined in Table 4.13-2 - Easement Width, except as modified
by the provisions in 3, through 5, below.

Floodplain Administrator or designee, extends beyond the required width
as specified in 2, above, additional easement width shall be provided as
needed to encompass the Floodway.
4. If, through the provisions of Chapter 4.11 - Minimum Assured
Development Area (MADA), it is determined that encroachment into a
Riparian Corridor area is necessary to allow for utilization of the Minimum
Assured Development Area, any associated easement requirement shall
be relaxed to the extent necessary to allow for the minimum necessary
encroachment into the resource area.
5. Easement widths wider than required in 2," above, may be accepted to
cover the full Riparian Corridor, as determined per Section 4.13.40.a.1.
2 Exceptions for select existing structures located between the 1.0-ft. Floodway and the 0.2-ft. Floodway
are outlined in Chapter 2.11 - Floodplain Development Permit and Chapter 4.5 - Floodplain Provisions

Chapter 4.13  Riparian Corridor and Wetland Provisions Page 19 of 25
Section 4.13.80 - STANDARDS FOR PROPERTIES WITH WETLANDS
a. The Citys Riparian Corridors and Wetlands Map identifies two types of
Wetlands within the City -
1. Locally Protected Wetlands; and
2. Non-locally Protected Wetlands.
b. All Wetlands are identified in the Citys adopted Local Wetlands Inventory Map.
The Inventory includes all Wetlands within the Urban Growth Boundary that are
at least 0.5 ac. in size, whether isolated, within Riparian Assessment Areas, or
within wildlife habitat assessment areas.
c. The methodology for identifying the Wetlands was taken from the Oregon
Department of State Lands (DSL) Administrative Rules. The Oregon Freshwater
Assessment Methodology (OFWAM) was utilized to assess whether or not a
Wetland met the state criteria for a Locally Significant Wetland (LSW). Once a
list of Locally Significant Wetlands is identified, a local jurisdiction is able to apply
additional local regulations to those LSWs, if it is deemed appropriate.
d. The City Council determined that a number of the identified LSWs should be
locally protected. The identified Locally Protected Wetlands (LPW), on the Citys
Riparian Corridors and Wetlands Map, represent the Wetlands which are to
receive local protection. The Locally Protected Wetlands consist of:
1. Locally Significant Wetlands of Special Concern; and
2. Locally Protected Locally-significant Wetlands.
e. The Locally Significant Wetlands of Special Concern are Wetlands that are
especially worthy of protection due to Oregon Freshwater Assessment
Methodology (OFWAM) factors such as the presence of known habitat for rare,
threatened, and endangered species. Non-locally Protected Wetlands are
mapped on the Citys Local Wetlands Inventory Map, but are not subject to local
regulations beyond state and federal requirements.
4.13.80.01 - Use Limitations and Exceptions Within Locally Protected
Wetlands
a. In addition to the requirements of the underlying zone, the limitations
and exceptions in b, through e, below, shall apply to -
1. Activities within Locally Protected Wetlands (LPWs) as shown on
the Citys Riparian Corridors and Wetlands Map; and
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 4.13  Riparian Corridor and Wetland Provisions Page 20 of 25
2. The associated 25-ft. setback/buffer area described in Section
4.13.40.b.1.b, unless a delineation results in a different boundary.
b. Removal of Vegetation - Removal of vegetation from Locally Protected
Wetlands is prohibited, except for the following purposes:
1. Wetland restoration and enhancement programs approved by the
Department of State Lands; and
2. Activities outlined in sections 4.13.50.a.2, 4.13.50.a.3, 4.13.50.a.5
through 4.13.50.a.8, and 4.13.50.a.10.
c. Building, Paving, and Grading Activities - Within LPW areas, the
placement of structures or impervious surfaces, as well as grading,
excavation, and the placement of fill, is prohibited, except as outlined
below. Exceptions to the LPW restrictions may be made for the purposes
identified in 1, and 2, below, provided they are designed and
constructed to minimize adverse impacts to Wetland Functions.
1. Replacement of existing buildings with buildings located within the
original building footprint, provided replacement does not disturb
additional surface area within the Wetland area. Vertical additions
may be added to these structures if they do not disturb additional
surface area within the Wetland area.
2. Activities outlined in sections 4.13.50.b.2, 4.13.50.b.5, and
4.13.50.b.6.
d. Compliance with Some Use Limitations and Exceptions for Highly
Protected Riparian Corridors and Riparian-related Areas - Compliance
is required with sections 4.13.50.e through 4.13.50.g of Section 4.13.50 -
Use Limitations and Exceptions for Highly Protected Riparian Corridors
and Riparian-related Areas.
e. Department of State Lands and US Army Corps of Engineers
Notification Required - In addition to the restrictions and requirements of
this Section, all proposed development activities within any Wetland are
also subject to Oregon Department of State Lands (DSL) and US Army
Corps of Engineers standards and approval. Where there is a difference,
the more restrictive regulation shall apply. In accordance with ORS
227.350, as amended, the applicant shall be responsible for notifying DSL
and the Corps of Engineers whenever any portion of any Wetland is
proposed for development.
No application for development will be accepted as complete until
documentation of such notification is provided. Additionally, no site
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 4.13  Riparian Corridor and Wetland Provisions Page 21 of 25
development permits, such as Grading and Excavation Permits, Public
Improvements by Private Contract Permits (PIPC), and Building Permits,
shall be issued until the City has received verification of DSL and Corps of
Engineers approval for development on the subject site.
4.13.80.02 - Procedures for Non-locally Protected Wetlands
Department of State Lands and US Army Corps of Engineers Notification
Required - In addition to the restrictions and requirements of this Section, all
proposed development activities within any Wetland are also subject to Oregon
Department of State Lands (DSL) and US Army Corps of Engineers standards
and approval. Where there is a difference, the more restrictive regulation shall
apply. In accordance with ORS 227.350, as amended, the applicant shall be
responsible for notifying DSL and the Corps of Engineers whenever any portion
of any Wetland is proposed for development.
No application for development will be accepted as complete until documentation
of such notification is provided, and no site development permits, such as
Grading and Excavation Permits, Public Improvements by Private Contract
Permits (PIPC), and Building Permits, shall be issued until the City has received
verification of DSL and Corps of Engineers approval for development on the
subject site. Non-locally Protected Wetlands are shown on the Citys Local
Wetlands Inventory Map.
4.13.90 - MAP REFINEMENTS
4.13.90.01 - Map Refinements Defined -
Map Refinements are adjustments made through professional analyses to refine
the actual boundaries of some Natural Resources and Natural Hazards. Map
Refinements must be made in accordance with the provisions in Chapter 4.5 -
Floodplain Provisions, Chapter 4.13 - Riparian Corridor and Wetland Provisions,
and Chapter 4.14 - Landslide Hazard and Hillside Development Provisions. The
Map Refinements governed by this chapter are specifically allowed to determine
the location and extent of the:
a. Top-of-bank of Streams and rivers;
b. Riparian Corridors, once Top-of-bank is accurately determined; and
c. Wetlands, through delineations approved by the Oregon Department of
State Lands.
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 4.13  Riparian Corridor and Wetland Provisions Page 22 of 25
4.13.90.02 - Map Refinements Provisions -
Map Refinement provisions for Top-of-bank, and Riparian Corridor and wetland
boundaries are outlined below. Map Refinement provisions for the 0.2-foot
Floodway, the 1.0-ft. Floodway, and the 100-year Floodplain are outlined in
Chapter 4.5 - Floodplain Provisions. Map Refinement provisions for Landslide
Hazard areas and slopes are outlined in Chapter 4.14 - Landslide Hazard and
Hillside Development Provisions. Map Refinements are also adjustments to
resolve registration issues that may occur between different GIS layers or maps.
a. Top-of-bank and Riparian Corridor Boundaries - Riparian Corridor
Boundaries and widths are as noted on the Riparian Corridors and
Wetlands Map. They are measured with respect to Top-of-bank. The
precise Top-of-bank is determined in the field by a licensed civil engineer.
The civil engineer determines the location of Top-of-bank using two-ft.
contour intervals and using the methodology cited in the definition for Topof-
bank in Chapter 1.6 - Definitions. The two-ft. contour intervals must be
surveyed by a licensed surveyor or civil engineer. The outer bounds of
the Riparian Corridors is determined by measuring from the precise
location of Top-of-bank, using the widths specified on the Riparian
Corridors and Wetlands Map. The boundaries must then be surveyed by
a licensed surveyor or civil engineer and mapped using two-ft. contours.
b. Wetland Boundaries - Wetland boundaries must be determined by one of
the following two methods:
1. Using the Corvallis Local Wetland Inventory Map, in which case a
25-ft. setback/buffer must be added to the upland edge of the
wetland; or
2. Using an established and unexpired wetland delineation accepted
and approved by the Department of State Lands (DSL), in which
case, no setback/buffer is required from the upland edge of the
wetland.
4.13.90.03 - Map Refinement Procedures -
Adjustments to maps consistent with the provisions of Section 4.13.90.01 and
Section 4.13.90.02, above, are considered to be Map Refinements and may be
Ministerially adjusted on the relevant maps, with no land use process required
other than a demonstrated adherence to the provisions of Section 4.13.90.01 and
Section 4.13.90.02.
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 4.13  Riparian Corridor and Wetland Provisions Page 23 of 25
4.13.100 - MAP CORRECTIONS
No Zone Change or Comprehensive Plan Map Amendment shall be required to
accomplish Map Corrections approved in accordance with the provisions outlined in this
Section.
a. Decisions regarding Map Correction requests shall be made by the Community
Development Director, as specified in Section 4.13.100.01 and Section
4.13.100.02, below. Upon approval of a Map Correction request, the Director
shall ensure that changes are reflected in the Citys affected maps and
databases. Notice of such Map Correction shall be provided to decision-makers
as outlined in Section 4.13.100.b, below
b. When requests for five Map Corrections on any Natural Hazard or Natural
Resource for which a Map Correction is allowed have been submitted to and
decided upon by the Community Development Department Director, or
approximately twice a year, whichever is sooner, the Map Correction requests
shall be summarized in an informational memo for decision-makers so that they
may review them for tracking purposes in accordance with Comprehensive Plan
Policy 4.2.6. This memo shall be shared with the Corvallis Planning Commission
and City Council for Map Correction requests on lands within the City limits; and
with the Corvallis and Benton County Planning Commissions, the Corvallis City
Council, and the Benton County Board of Commissioners for Map Correction
requests on lands within the Urban Fringe.
4.13.100.01 - Map Corrections Defined
A Map Correction is not the type of adjustment described in the Map Refinement
provisions of Section 4.13.90 above. A Map Correction is, however, an actual
correction to maps referencing Natural Hazards or Natural Resources other than
Significant Vegetation areas, where it is found that the map depiction does not
reflect the Natural Features Inventory. As the Natural Features Inventory (NFI)
was the basis for developing the Citys maps that reference Natural Hazards and
Natural Resources, a correction to the NFI for Natural Hazards or Natural
Resources other than Significant Vegetation areas could result in a correction to
the related maps. These maps include the Comprehensive Plan Map, Local
Wetlands Inventory Map, Official Zoning Map, Natural Hazards Map, or Riparian
Corridors and Wetlands Map.
Map Correction provisions for Riparian Corridor widths and Wetland boundaries
are outlined below. There are no Map Correction provisions for the 100-year
Floodplain, since corrections are accomplished through the Map Refinement
provisions in Chapter 4.5 - Floodplain Provisions. Map Correction provisions for
Landslide Hazards are outlined in Chapter 4.14 - Landslide Hazard and Hillside
Development Provisions.
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 4.13  Riparian Corridor and Wetland Provisions Page 24 of 25
a. Riparian Corridor Widths - Riparian Corridor boundaries may be refined
through the Map Refinement procedures outlined in Section 4.13.90,
above. Riparian Corridor widths used to determine the boundaries were
developed using information from the Natural Features Inventory
regarding the amount of acres drained within specified areas, and then
appropriate corridor widths were applied to the Riparian Corridors and
Wetlands Map. The relationship between the areas drained and the
different Riparian Corridor widths is contained in Table 4.13-1 - Base
Riparian Corridor Widths. If an error is discovered in the mapping
portrayal of the information contained within the Natural Features
Inventory, a Mapping Correction may be requested.
b. Wetland Boundaries - Wetland boundaries may be refined through the
Map Refinement procedures outlined in Section 4.13.90, above.
However, if it can be scientifically demonstrated that an error exists in the
translation of the Natural Features Inventory Information to the associated
City Maps, then a Mapping Correction may be requested.
4.13.100.02 - Map Corrections Procedures -
a. Riparian Corridor Widths - Map Correction requests to Riparian Corridor
widths indicated by the mapping portrayal of the information contained
within the Natural Features Inventory shall be accomplished as outlined in
this Section.
If a property owner or property owners legal representative provides the
Community Development Department Director with the items listed in 1,
below, a request to revise the Riparian Corridor width indicated on the
Riparian Corridors and Wetland Map and other affected maps may be
considered as outlined in 2, and 3, below.
1. Documents identifying the specific reach of Riparian Corridor in
question, and the specific information in the Natural Features
Inventory that the property owner believes has not been accurately
translated to the Riparian Corridors and Wetlands Map and related
other City maps.
2. If review of the items in 1, above indicate that a mapping error has
occurred, then the Director shall ensure that the appropriate
changes are made to correct the Riparian Corridors and Wetlands
Map and other affected maps and databases.
3. To approve a Map Correction request, the Director must find that
the Natural Features Inventory contains information for the specific
Riparian Corridor reach in question that is different from that
indicated by the Riparian Corridor Width on the Riparian Corridor
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 4.13  Riparian Corridor and Wetland Provisions Page 25 of 25
and Wetlands Map. The appropriate Riparian Corridor widths are
as noted in Table 4.13-1 - Base Riparian Corridor Widths.
b. Wetland Boundaries - Map Correction requests for Wetland boundaries
indicated on the Riparian Corridors and Wetlands Map and other affected
maps shall be accomplished as outlined in this Section.
If a property owner or property owners legal representative provides the
Community Development Department Director with the items listed in 1,
below, a request to revise the Wetland boundaries indicated on the
Riparian Corridors and Wetland Map and other affected maps may be
considered as outlined in 2, and 3, below.
1. Documents that identify information contained within the Natural
Features Inventory and an explanation of how the property owner
believes that the information has not been accurately translated to
the Riparian Corridor and Wetlands Map and other City maps. The
documents shall identify the specific wetland in question and
demonstrate that an error exists.
2. If review of the items in 1, above, indicate that a mapping error
has occurred, then the Director shall ensure that the appropriate
changes are made to correct the Riparian Corridors and Wetlands
Map and other affected maps and databases.
3. To approve a Map Correction request, the Director must find that
an error exists in the translation of the Natural Features Inventory
Information to the associated City Maps.
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 4.14  Landslide Hazard and Hillside Development Provisions Page 1 of 25
CHAPTER 4.14
LANDSLIDE HAZARD AND HILLSIDE DEVELOPMENT PROVISIONS
Section 4.14.10 - PURPOSES - LANDSLIDE HAZARD AND HILLSIDE
DEVELOPMENT PROVISIONS
Without establishing any priority, the purposes of this Chapter are intended to:
a. Protect human life, health, and property;
b. Reduce damage and loss of life from the Natural Hazards of steep slopes,
landslide risk areas, and landslide-related risk areas;
c. Implement the landslide hazard and hillside development requirements of
Statewide Planning Goal 7 - which relates to Areas Subject to Natural Disasters
and Hazards;
d. Implement the landslide hazard and hillside provisions in Article 4 of the
Comprehensive Plan; and
e. In order to assist in the furtherance of these purposes, where not required,
creation of open space tracts is encouraged within areas designated as Natural
Resources or Natural Hazards on the Comprehensive Plan and Official Zoning
Maps.
Section 4.14.20 - APPLICABILITY
4.14.20.01 - Natural Hazards that are Subject to this Chapter
a. These provisions apply to:
1. Areas with slopes equal to or greater than 10 percent;
2. High landslide risk areas;
3. Existing landslide areas; and
4. Landslide debris run-out areas.
b. Mapping of Natural Hazards -
1. Natural Hazards Map - The Natural Hazard areas in "a," above, are
mapped on the Corvallis Natural Hazards Map.
2. Exclusion of Corvallis Fault Line and Liquifaction Soils - Hazards
associated with the Corvallis Fault Line and liquefaction soils are
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 4.14  Landslide Hazard and Hillside Development Provisions Page 2 of 25
not addressed as part of this Code. Hazards associated with the
Corvallis Fault Line, and with fault lines in general, are difficult to
anticipate. This is in part because the Fault has not been precisely
mapped and in part because other faults may exist in the area
which are not yet known. The hazards posed by liquefaction soils
can be addressed by the application of more stringent building
construction requirements. However, the City will have a map(s)
available for informational purposes to show the approximate
location of the Corvallis Fault Line and the location of liquefaction
soils. These hazards may need to be addressed per the
requirements of the adopted Building Code and/or per the
recommendations of geologic studies, etc.
4.14.20.02 - Coordination with Building Codes and Greater Restrictions
a. Coordination with Building Codes - Pursuant to the requirement
established in ORS 455 that the City of Corvallis administers and enforces
the State Building Codes, the City Council of the City of Corvallis does
hereby acknowledge that the State Building Codes contain certain
provisions that apply to the design and construction of buildings and
structures located in landslide hazard and hillside areas. Therefore, this
ordinance is intended to be administered and enforced in conjunction with
the State Building Codes.
b. Greater Restrictions - This Chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate,
or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions.
However, where this Chapter and any other ordinance, easement,
covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the
more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
4.14.20.03 - Exceptions
Chapter 4.11 - Minimum Assured Development Area (MADA) explains how
Minimum Assured Development Area (MADA) is determined. If the application of
Natural Hazard regulations outside prohibited areas, or if the cumulative impact
of such Natural Hazard regulations and the application of the regulations in this
chapter, Chapter 2.11 - Floodplain Development Permit, Chapter 4.5 - Floodplain
Provisions, Chapter 4.12 - Significant Vegetation Protection Provisions and
Chapter 4.13 - Riparian Corridor and Wetland Provisions would limit the
developable portion of a property below the property's MADA, then development
will be allowed on the property, to the degree necessary to achieve the MADA,
as explained in Chapter 4.11 - Minimum Assured Development Area. However,
development is prohibited in certain areas, regardless of MADA, as outlined in
Section 4.11.50.05 of Chapter 4.11 - Minimum Assured Development Area.
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 4.14  Landslide Hazard and Hillside Development Provisions Page 3 of 25
Section 4.14.30 - DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
The degree of Natural Hazard protection required by this Chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger hazard events can and will occur on rare occasions. Landslide
risks may be increased by man-made or natural causes. Areas impacted by other
Natural Hazards may differ from those shown on the Corvallis Natural Hazards Map.
This Chapter does not imply that land outside the landslide hazard areas or Uses
permitted within such areas will be free from landslides, nor does it imply that land
outside of mapped hazard areas will be free from damage or earth movement in a
hazard event. This Chapter shall not create liability on the part of the City of Corvallis,
any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Insurance Administration, for any hazard
damages that result from reliance on this Ordinance or any administrative decision
lawfully made hereunder. Compliance with the minimum standards established by this
Chapter is not intended to relieve any private party from liability for the design or
construction of development which causes damage or injury by aggravating an existing
and known hazard.
Section 4.14.40 - PROCEDURES
Compliance with the provisions of this Chapter shall be determined through the
development review processes identified in Section 1.2.110 of Chapter 1.2 - Legal
Framework. Applications for Excavation and Grading Permits, Building Permits or other
permits for structures on sites containing the Natural Hazard areas, as defined in
Section 4.14.20, shall be submitted and reviewed to ensure compliance with
specifications referenced herein; and to ensure that development is reasonably safe
from anticipated hazards. Such applications for Excavation and Grading Permits,
Building Permits or other permits for structures also include those needed for
Manufactured Dwellings. Other development activities as described in this provision
include, but are not limited to, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, and excavating.
a. Development Application - Development applications for all properties
containing or abutting a mapped Natural Hazard area shall accurately indicate
the locations of these features and the location of any proposed development.
Development applications shall include Floodplain Development Permits,
Excavation and Grading Permits, Building Permits, Public Improvements by
Private Contract Permits (PIPC), and any land use application identified in
Chapter 2.1 - Comprehensive Plan Amendment through Chapter 2.14 -
Partitions, Minor Replats, and Property Line Adjustments. The Building Official,
City Engineer, Floodplain Administrator, or Community Development Director
may determine that the following information is not necessary in conjunction with
permits for work that would not exacerbate hazard conditions in any way.

4.14.50.06 - Standards for Areas with Slopes Equal to or Greater than 35
Percent
Generally, development in these areas is strongly discouraged due to concerns
with safety, ground movement, slope stability, high levels of cut and fill, and
hydrological and erosion impacts. However, very limited development, as
described and regulated in "a," through "e," below, may occur in areas with
slopes equal to or greater than 35 percent. These standards are applicable only
to the specific portions of a site which contain the specified slopes, as indicated
on a topographic survey. If an applicant demonstrates, by submittal of the
topographic map, that development on a property can be accommodated without
encroachment into the specified slope areas, then the following standards do not
apply.
a. Development on Units of Land Legally Created prior to December 31,
2006 - For units of land that were legally created prior to December 31,
2006, and are ½ acre or less in size, development may occur within areas
containing slopes of 35 percent or greater. Although properties developed
under this exception are not required to qualify for MADA, encroachment
into areas with slopes of 35 percent or greater shall not exceed the area
that would be allowed by MADA provisions based on the zoning and size
of the property. Additionally, development shall comply with LDC Section
4.14.50 - Standards for Development in Steeply Sloped Areas, 4.14.60.04
- Required Indemnification and Release, and 4.14.70 - Hillside
Development Standards.
b. Development Limitations - Streets, driveways, and utilities may be
located on the specified slope areas only if it can be shown that passage
through the steeply sloped area is the only viable route available to afford
access to the developable portion of a property;
c. Site Assessment and Geotechnical Report Required - Applications for
development on the specified slope areas, including land use applications,
Public Improvements by Private Contract Permits (PIPC), Excavation and
Grading Permits, Floodplain Development Permits, and Building Permit
submittals, shall be accompanied by a site assessment, geotechnical
report, and any other report deemed necessary by the site assessment
report. Reports shall meet the criteria identified in sections 4.14.50.04 and
4.14.50.05. Development shall conform with all recommendations and
requirements established by these required reports.
d. Compliance with Hillside Development Standards - Development shall
comply with the Hillside Development Standards in Section 4.14.70.
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 4.14  Landslide Hazard and Hillside Development Provisions Page 9 of 25
e. Tree Cutting Limitations - No tree cutting is allowed on slopes equal to
or greater than 35 percent, with the exception of the following:
1. Removal of a Hazardous Tree - Hazardous Trees are defined in

be consistent with Section 4.2.20.l;
2. Accommodation of development allowed under 4.14.50.06.a and/or
b above; or
3. Accommodation of a public or private utility for which permits have
been obtained.
4.14.50.07 - Standards for Areas with Slopes Equal to or Greater than 25
Percent, but less than 35 Percent
Development in these areas should be avoided, if feasible, due to concerns with
safety, ground movement, slope stability, and erosion impacts. However, the
following standards shall apply for development in areas with slopes equal to or
greater than 25 percent, but less than 35 percent. These standards are
applicable only to the specific portions of a site which contain the specified
slopes, as indicated on a topographic survey. If an applicant demonstrates, by
submittal of the topographic map, that development on a property can be
accommodated without encroachment into the specified slope areas, then the
following standards do not apply.
a. Site Assessment and Geotechnical Report Required - Applications for
development on the specified slope areas, including land use applications,
Public Improvements by Private Contract Permits (PIPC), Excavation and
Grading Permits, Floodplain Development Permits, and Building Permit
submittals, shall be accompanied by a site assessment, geotechnical
report, and any other report deemed necessary by the site assessment
report. Reports shall meet the criteria identified in sections 4.14.50.04 and
4.14.50.05. Development shall conform with all recommendations and
requirements established by these required reports.
b. Compliance with Hillside Development Standards - Development shall
comply with the Hillside Development Standards in Section 4.14.70.
4.14.50.08 - Standards for Areas with Slopes Equal to or Greater than 15

Chapter 4.14  Landslide Hazard and Hillside Development Provisions Page 10 of 25
than 15 percent, but less than 25 percent. These standards are applicable only
to the specific portions of a site which contain the specified slopes, as indicated
on a topographic survey. If an applicant demonstrates, by submittal of a
topographic survey, that development on a property can be accommodated
without encroachment into the specified slope areas, then the following
standards do not apply.
a. Site Assessment Required - Applications for development on the
specified slope areas, including land use applications, Public
Improvements by Private Contract Permits (PIPC), Excavation and
Grading Permits, Floodplain Development Permits, and Building Permit
submittals, shall be accompanied with a Site Assessment which meets the
criteria identified in Section 4.14.50.04. If the Site Assessment identifies
the need for a Geotechnical Report, or other reports, those reports shall
be submitted with the application for development and shall be consistent
with the requirements of Section 4.14.50.05. Development shall conform
with all recommendations and requirements established by any and all

AREAS
4.14.60.01 - Purposes - Standards for Development in Landslide Hazard
Areas
It is the purpose of these regulations to provide supplementary development
regulations to underlying zones to ensure that development occurs in such a
manner as to mitigate potential impacts from landslides in Corvallis. Landslide
Hazard areas include High Landslide Risk areas, Existing Landslide areas, and
Landslide Debris Runout areas. These areas are mapped on the Natural
Hazards Map. The following regulations shall apply to development and other
activities in identified Landslide Hazard areas.
4.14.60.02 - Applicability
Except as provided under Section 4.14.60.03, below, no person shall engage in
any of the following regulated activities within the Landslide Hazard areas
designated on the Corvallis Natural Hazards Map. Development inside of the
500-ft. buffer of the Landslide Hazard areas, but outside of the Landslide Hazard
areas, is not subject to the provisions in Sections 4.14.60.03 and 04, unless
deemed necessary by the Citys Building Official.
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 4.14  Landslide Hazard and Hillside Development Provisions Page 11 of 25
a. Excavation;
b. Fill;
c. Installation or construction of any accessory structure with a Building Code
occupancy classification other than "U;"
d. Construction, reconstruction, structural alteration, relocation or
enlargement of any building or structure for which permission is required
pursuant to this Code, or the adopted Building Code; and
e. Construction or expansion of utilities, streets, driveways, or other
accessways.
4.14.60.03 - Site Assessment and Geotechnical Report Requirement
a. Applications for development within identified Landslide Hazard areas, or
as deemed necessary by the Citys Building Official, including land use
applications, Excavation and Grading Permits, Floodplain Development
Permits, Public Improvements by Private Contract Permits (PIPC),
Building Permits, and any other development permits, shall include a Site
Assessment and Geotechnical Report which meet the criteria identified in
Sections 4.14.50.04 and 4.14.50.05. In addition to the items identified in
Section 4.14.50.05, the Geotechnical Report shall specifically address the
presence, characteristics, and precise location of the identified hazard(s)
on the subject property which is/are depicted on the Natural Hazards Map.
If other reports are called for by the Site Assessment, these reports shall
also be submitted.
b. Prior to issuance of permits for any work on the development site, the
Building Official and/or City Engineer shall review the submitted Site
Assessment, Geotechnical Report, and any other required reports.
Permits shall not be issued until the Building Official and/or City Engineer
approve the required reports. Upon approval of these reports, permits for
construction activities may be issued, if they are in accordance with the
findings and recommendations of the reports. Site inspections and
submitted permit materials shall demonstrate that all necessary measures
recommended by the reports and by City staff are addressed in the
construction process. In no case will permits be issued for development
that would increase landslide risks on the development site, or upon
neighboring properties, as indicated in the approved reports.
4.14.60.04 - Required Indemnification and Release
Prior to issuance of Building Permits for structures within Landslide Hazard
areas, or as deemed necessary by the Citys Building Official, the applicant shall

landslides. This indemnity and release shall be recorded with the property, and
shall run with the land.
[Section 4.14.60 amended by Ordinance 2012-18, effective December 13, 2012]
Section 4.14.70 - HILLSIDE DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
4.14.70.01 - Purposes
Hillside Development standards have been developed for the following purposes:
a. To plan development to fit the topography, soil, geology, and hydrology of
hillsides;
b. To align the built surface infrastructure, such as streets and waterways,
with the natural contours of terrain; and to minimize cutting and filling in
developments;
c. To minimize soil disturbances and the removal of native vegetation, and to
avoid these activities during winter months, unless impacts can be
mitigated;
d. To encourage the design of developments and the utilization of
construction techniques that minimize erosion and surface water runoff;
e. To balance a view of the hills with the view from the hills;
f. To provide or maintain landscaping that enhances the identified open
space resources; and
g. To design developments that consider landscaping management that will
minimize the threat of fire on improved property and the spreading of fire
to wildland habitat.
4.14.70.02 - Applicability
Areas with slopes of 10 percent or greater are identified on the Natural Hazards
Map. The following standards regulate development on areas with slopes of 10
percent or greater. In addition to these regulations, the Standards for
Development in Steeply Sloped Areas in Section 4.14.50 apply to development in
areas with slopes of 15 percent or greater. The Natural Hazards Map provides
information regarding the location of slopes of 10 percent or greater on property
within the Corvallis Urban Growth Boundary.
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 4.14  Landslide Hazard and Hillside Development Provisions Page 13 of 25
4.14.70.03 - Definitions
a. Natural Hazards Map - The Natural Hazards Map is based on recent
aerial photography (2002) and provides a level of accuracy equivalent to
two-ft. contour intervals. An applicant for development may contest the
accuracy of the slope data on the Natural Hazards Map by providing a
slope survey prepared and stamped by a licensed surveyor. The slope
survey must show Natural Grade, prior to any site grading.
b. Individual Lot Grading - Grading done on an individual lot, in conjunction
with the development of a building, or buildings, on the lot.
c. Mass Grading - Site grading done in anticipation of future development,
prior to grading done to accommodate specific structures. Typically,
grading for street and infrastructure improvements is done in conjunction
with Mass Grading. For Subdivisions, Mass Grading is done after
preliminary plat approval, but prior to application for Building Permits for
individual lots.
d. Eight-ft. Standard - Restricts grade changes (cuts or fills) in excess of
eight ft. on an individual lot or development site. Cut and fill is measured
vertically from Natural Grade. In no case shall a combination of cut and fill
in the same location exceed 16 ft.
e. 10- ft. Standard - Restricts grade changes (cuts or fills) in excess of 10 ft.
in an area where an exception to the Eight-ft. Standard is allowed. Cut
and fill is measured vertically from Natural Grade. In no case shall a
combination of cut and fill in the same location exceed 16 ft.
f. 12- ft. Standard - Restricts grade changes (cuts or fills) in excess of 12 ft.
in an area where an exception to the Eight-ft. Standard is allowed. Cut
and fill is measured vertically from Natural Grade. In no case shall a
combination of cut and fill in the same location exceed 16 ft.
4.14.70.04 - Grading Regulations
a. Types of Grading - The following regulations address two types of
grading, both of which are defined in Section 4.14.70.03, above:
1. Mass Grading; and
2. Grading on Individual Lots.
b. These regulations prescribe grading area limitations based on
zoning and lot size, as set out in Sections 4.14.70.04.c.3 and
4.14.70.04.d.2 -
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 4.14  Landslide Hazard and Hillside Development Provisions Page 14 of 25
1. On development sites where both Mass Grading and Individual Lot
Grading are employed, Mass Grading and Individual Lot Grading
must be contained within the same grading limitation areas. The
amount of gradable area allowed, per lot, is the same under both
standards. This means that when Mass Grading is employed, the
area that is Mass Graded on an individual lot will be the area in
which Individual Lot Grading is allowed, unless the Mass Graded
area is less than the maximum gradable area allowed. In this case,
additional area, up to the maximum allowed, can be graded at the
time of Individual Lot Grading.
2. The remaining provisions of this Section in 4.14.70.04.c through
4.14.70.04.e, below, are organized as follows:
a) Mass Grading Standards;
b) Individual Lot Grading Standards; and
c) Terracing Requirements and Design Standards.
3. Exceptions to these standards for streets may be allowed through
the Planned Development process of Chapter 2.5 - Planned
Development, or through the Capital Improvements Program
process.
c. Mass Grading Standards - The following standards shall apply to
development throughout the City of Corvallis:
1. Maximum Allowed Cut Depth and Fill Height - The following
standards govern the maximum cut depth and fill height:
Site Characteristics Maximum Cut Depth and
Fill Height
No Extenuating Conditions Eight-ft. Standard
One Extenuating Condition 10-ft. Standard only where
allowed to work around
extenuating condition
Two or more Extenuating
Conditions
12-ft. Standard only where
allowed to work around
extenuating conditions
2. Extenuating Conditions - Exceptions to the Eight-ft. Standard for
Mass Grading shall be based on the following specific extenuating
conditions:
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 4.14  Landslide Hazard and Hillside Development Provisions Page 15 of 25
a) Street/Pedestrian Alignment - Additional Cut/Fill provides for
the alignment of a necessary street or pedestrian
connection. A necessary street or pedestrian connection is
one which is needed to create a Block Perimeter of
approximately 1,600 ft., or which is identified in an adopted
City Master Plan document. A necessary street connection
must comply with the slope standards in Section 4.0.60.k of
Chapter 4.0 - Improvements Required with Development.
Section 4.0.60.k stipulates that Arterial Streets shall not
exceed a six percent grade, Collector and Neighborhood
Collector Streets shall not exceed 10 percent, and Local and
Local Connector Streets shall not exceed 15 percent. The
width and overall extent of any street exceeding the Eight-ft.
Standard shall be minimized, where feasible, to minimize
grading impacts.
b) Significant Natural Feature - Additional cut/fill is necessary to
protect a Significant Natural Feature, which is defined as a
feature subject to a Natural Hazards (except slopes) and/or
Natural Resource Overlay on the Comprehensive Plan Map,
or a Significant Tree, as defined in Chapter 1.6 - Definitions.
In the case of a preserved tree, a certified arborist must find
that the proposed cut/fill exception would preserve the
viability of a Significant Tree that would otherwise have been
damaged by the application of the Cut and Fill Standards.
c) Detention Facilities - To accommodate stormwater detention
facilities where no other viable location exists on the site.
3. Grading Area Limitations - The following requirements apply to
Mass Grading in areas with slopes equal to or greater than 10

qualified Stream scientist, or qualified wetlands scientist that
potential impact to an existing Significant Tree or a Significant
Natural Feature in the area of the cut and fill would be significantly
reduced by an exception to the terracing requirement.
A Significant Natural Feature is defined in Chapter 1.6 - Definitions.
In the case of a preserved tree, a certified arborist must find that
the proposed retaining wall treatment would preserve the viability of
a Significant Tree that would otherwise have been damaged by the
application of the Cut and Fill Standards, and that the Tree's
continued growth will not adversely affect the structural integrity of
the wall.
6. Per Chapter 2.12 - Lot Development Option, exceptions to the
requirements in "1," through "5," above, may be granted through
the Lot Development Option process, if the exceptions qualify as a
Minor or Major Lot Development Option. The Lot Development
Option may allow an increase in retaining wall height of up to 20
percent of the permitted height, or a reduction of shelf width of up to
20 percent of the required depth, subject to compliance with all Lot
Development Option criteria in Section 2.12.30.06 of Chapter 2.12 -

that may occur between different GIS layers or maps.
a. Landslide Hazard Area Boundaries - The precise locations of Landslide
Hazard area boundaries are determined by one of the following two
methods:
1. Site Assessments and/or Geotechnical Reports, as required per
Section 4.14.60; or
2. Information provided by the Oregon Department of Geology and
Mining Industries (DOGAMI), once it has been developed and
finalized by DOGAMI.
If these areas are not precisely mapped by one of these two methods, the
500-ft. setback required by Section 4.14.60.02 shall be maintained.
b. Slope Boundaries - The precise locations of the steep slope boundaries
are determined by one of the following two methods, consistent with the
provisions of Section 4.14.50.03:
1. Using the information from the Natural Hazards database and
creating a topographic map of the development site showing two-ft.
contour intervals; or
2. Using a topographic survey, showing two-ft. contour intervals,
prepared and stamped by a licensed surveyor or civil engineer.
4.14.80.03 - Map Refinement Procedures
Adjustments to maps consistent with the provisions of Sections 4.14.80.01 and
4.14.80.02, above, are considered to be Map Refinements and may be
Ministerially adjusted on the relevant maps, with no land use process required
other than a demonstrated adherence to the provisions of sections 4.14.80.01
and 4.14.80.02.

4.14.90 - MAP CORRECTIONS
No Zone Change or Comprehensive Plan Map Amendment shall be required to
accomplish Map Corrections approved in accordance with the provisions outlined in this
Section.
a. Decisions regarding Map Correction requests shall be made by the Community
Development Director, as specified in sections 4.14.90.01 and 4.14.90.02, below.
Upon approval of a Map Correction request, the Director shall ensure that
changes are reflected in the City's affected maps and databases. Notice of such
Map Correction shall be provided to decision-makers as outlined in Section
4.14.90.b, below.
b. When requests for five Map Corrections on any Natural Hazard or Natural
Resource for which a Map Correction is allowed have been submitted to and
decided upon by the Community Development Department Director, or
approximately twice a year, whichever is sooner, the Map Correction requests
shall be summarized in an informational memo for decision-makers so that they
may review them for tracking purposes in accordance with Comprehensive Plan
Policy 4.2.6. This memo shall be shared with the Corvallis Planning Commission
and City Council for Map Correction requests on lands within the City limits; and
with the Corvallis and Benton County Planning Commissions, the Corvallis City
Council, and the Benton County Board of Commissioners for Map Correction
requests on lands within the Urban Fringe.
4.14.90.01 - Map Corrections Defined
a. A Map Correction is not the type of adjustment described in the Map
Refinement provisions of Section 4.14.80, above. A Map Correction is,
however, an actual correction to maps referencing Natural Hazards or
Natural Resources other than Significant Vegetation areas, where it is
found that the map depiction does not reflect the Natural Features
Inventory. As the Natural Features Inventory (NFI) was the basis for
developing the City's maps that reference Natural Hazards and Natural
Resources, a correction to the NFI for Natural Hazards or Natural
Resources other than Significant Vegetation areas could result in a
correction to the related maps. These maps include the Comprehensive
Plan Map, Local Wetlands Inventory Map, Official Zoning Map, Natural
Hazards Map, or Riparian Corridors and Wetlands Map.
Map Correction provisions for Landslide Hazard areas are outlined below.
Adjustments to other hazards governed by this chapter are not Map
Corrections, but are Map Refinements and are addressed through the
provisions of Section 4.14.80, above. There are no Map Correction
provisions for the 100-year Floodplain, since corrections are accomplished
through the Map Refinement provisions in Chapter 4.5 - Floodplain
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 4.14  Landslide Hazard and Hillside Development Provisions Page 24 of 25
Provisions. Map Correction provisions for Riparian Corridor widths and
Wetland boundaries are outlined in Chapter 4.13 - Riparian Corridor and
Wetland Provisions.
b. Landslide Hazard Areas - Landslide Hazard area boundaries may be
refined through the Map Refinement procedures outlined in 4.14.80,
above. However, if technical data demonstrates that no Landslide Hazard
exists within or near an area identified as a potential Landslide Hazard on
the City's maps, a Map Correction may be accomplished to delete the
Landslide Hazard indication from the maps. Such technical data must be
from:
1. A site assessment and geotechnical report; or
2. The Oregon Department of Geology and Mining Industries
(DOGAMI).
4.14.90.02 - Map Corrections Procedures for Landslide Hazard Areas
There are two procedures available for a Map Correction involving the removal
of a Landslide Hazard area from the Natural Hazards Map.
a. Removal of a Landslide Hazard Area from Determination by the Oregon
Department of Geology and Mining Industries (DOGAMI) -
If in finalizing its data and maps regarding Landslide Hazard areas the
Oregon Department of Geology and Mining Industries (DOGAMI)
determines that no Landslide Hazard exists within or near an area
identified as a potential Landslide Hazard on the Natural Hazards Map,
then a Map Correction to remove indication of the Landslide Hazard area
shall be done by the Community Development Department Director,
following written verification of the DOGAMI's determination. When such
written documentation of the determination is provided to the Director, the
Director shall ensure that the changes reflected by the DOGAMI decision
are reflected in the City's affected maps and databases.
b. Removal of a Landslide Hazard Area from Determinations Reached by a
Site Assessment and Geotechnical Report -
If a property owner or property owner's legal representative provides the
Community Development Department Director with the items listed in "1,"
below, a request to remove indication of a Landslide Hazard area from the
Natural Hazards Map and other affected maps may be considered as
outlined in "2," and "3," below.
Corvallis Land Development Code (as amended)
Chapter 4.14  Landslide Hazard and Hillside Development Provisions Page 25 of 25
1. For a Map Correction request to consider removal of a Landslide
Hazard from the Natural Hazards Map and other related maps, the
following information is required:
a) A Site Assessment and Geotechnical Report which meet the
criteria identified in sections 4.14.50.04 and 4.14.50.05. In
addition to the items identified in Section 4.14.50.05, the
Geotechnical Report shall specifically address the lack of
presence, characteristics, and/or precise location of the
identified hazard(s) on the subject property which is/are
depicted on the Natural Hazards Map. If other reports are
called for by the Site Assessment, these reports shall also
be submitted; and
b) An indemnification and release agreement in accordance
with the provisions of Section 4.14.60.04;
2. For lands within the City limits, Map Correction requests shall be
reviewed by the Building Official and City Engineer, in coordination
with the Community Development Department. The Community
Development Director shall make the final decision. For lands
within the Urban Fringe, Map Correction requests shall be reviewed
by the Building Official and City Engineer, in coordination with the
Corvallis Community Development Department and the Benton
County Development Department. For the Urban Fringe lands, the
Corvallis Community Development Department Director shall also
make the final decision.
3. To approve a Map Correction request, the Director must find that:
a) The information required by "1," above, has been provided
and is complete;
b) The required technical reports and recommendations
sufficiently demonstrate that there is no Landslide Hazard on
or near the area identified on the Natural Hazards Map; and
c) The required technical reports and recommendations
sufficiently demonstrate that development on the subject
area would not increase landslide risks on the development
site, or upon neighboring properties.
