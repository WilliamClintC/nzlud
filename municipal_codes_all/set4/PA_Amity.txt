of Amity with a certificate pursuant to Section 508(b) of the Insurance
Company Law of 1921, as amended by Act 98 of 1992 and Act 93 of

securing the building or other structure in an amount less than the
amount calculated under the foregoing transfer formula, the
insurer shall transfer to the Treasurer for the Township from the
insurance proceeds the amount specified in the estimate. If there is

shall include, without limitation, any engineering, legal or
administrative costs incurred by the Township in connection
with such removal, repair or securing or any proceedings

insurer a notice that the proceeds have been received by the
Township and that the procedures under this subsection shall

removing, repairing or securing the building or other
structure, in which event the Township Treasurer shall, if such
estimates deemed by the Township Treasurer to be reasonable,
return to the insured the amount of the funds transferred to
the Township in excess of that amount required to pay the
municipal expenses; provided, however, that the Township has
not commenced to remove, repair or secure the building or
other structure, in which case the Township will complete the
work.
(iv) Pay to the Treasurer of the Township for reimbursement to the
Township's General Fund, the amount of the municipal
expenses paid by the Township.
(v) Pay the remaining balance in the fund without interest to the
named insured upon receipt of a certificate issued by the
Township Treasurer that the repair, removal or securing of the
building or other structure has been completed in accordance
with all applicable codes and regulations of the Township.

Part 1
GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 10-101. Statutory Authorization. [Ord. No. 278, 6/20/2012]
The Legislature of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has, by the passage
of the Pennsylvania Flood Plain Management Act of 1978, delegated the
responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management
regulations to promote public health, safety, and the general welfare of its
citizenry. Therefore, the Board of Supervisors of the Township of Amity does
hereby order as follows.
§ 10-102. Intent. [Ord. No. 278, 6/20/2012]
The intent of this chapter is to:
§ 10-103. Applicability. [Ord. No. 278, 6/20/2012]
It shall be unlawful for any person, partnership, business or corporation
to undertake, or cause to be undertaken, any construction or development
anywhere within an identified floodplain area within Township of Amity
unless a permit has been obtained from the floodplain administrator.
§ 10-104. Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. [Ord. No. 278, 6/20/
2012]
This chapter supersedes any other conflicting provisions which may be
in effect in identified floodplain areas. However, any other ordinance
provisions shall remain in full force and effect to the extent that those
provisions are more restrictive. If there is any conflict between any of the
provisions of this chapter, the more restrictive shall apply.
§ 10-105. Severability. [Ord. No. 278, 6/20/2012]
If any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause, or phrase of this
chapter shall be declared invalid for any reason whatsoever, such a decision
shall not affect the remaining portions of the chapter, which shall remain in
(a) Promote the general health, welfare, and safety of the community.
(b) Encourage the utilization of appropriate construction practices in order
to prevent or minimize flood damage in the future.
(c) Minimize danger to public health by protecting water supply and
natural drainage.

units, and its residents, by preventing excessive development in areas
subject to flooding.

hereby declared to be severable.
§ 10-106. Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. [Ord. No. 278, 6/20/
2012]
The degree of flood protection sought by the provisions of this chapter is
considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on accepted
engineering methods of study. Larger floods may occur or flood heights
may be increased by man-made or natural causes, such as ice jams and
bridge openings restricted by debris. This chapter does not imply that areas
outside any identified floodplain areas, or that land uses permitted within
such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages.
This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the Township of Amity

foot at any point. This term shall also include floodway areas which
have been identified in other available studies or sources of information
for those special floodplain areas where no floodway has been identified
in the FIS.
Within any floodway area, no encroachments, including fill, new
construction, substantial improvements, or other development shall be
permitted unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis performed in accordance with standard engineering
practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any
increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of
the base flood discharge.
No new construction or development shall be allowed, unless a permit
is obtained from the Department of Environmental Protection Regional
Office.
(b) The AE Area/District without floodway shall be those areas identified as
an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for

In AE Area/District without floodway, no new development shall be
permitted unless it can be demonstrated that the cumulative effect of
all past and projected development will not increase the BFE by more
than one foot.
(c) The A Area/District shall be those areas identified as an A Zone on the
FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no 1%
annual chance flood elevations have been provided. For these areas,
elevation and floodway information from other federal, state, or other
acceptable source shall be used when available. Where other
acceptable information is not available, the elevation shall be
determined by using the elevation of a point on the boundary of the
identified floodplain area which is nearest the construction site.
In lieu of the above, the municipality may require the applicant to
determine the elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering
techniques. Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only
by professional engineers or others of demonstrated qualifications, who
shall certify that the technical methods used correctly reflect currently
accepted technical concepts. Studies, analyses, computations, etc.,
shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical
review by the municipality.
(d) Community identified flood hazard areas shall be those areas where
Amity Township has identified local flood hazard or ponding areas, as
delineated and adopted on a "local flood hazard map" using best
available topographic data and locally derived information such as flood
of record, historic high water marks, soils or approximate study
methodologies.
(e) No permit shall be granted for any construction, development, use, or
activity within any floodway area that would cause any increase in the
BFE.
(f) No permit shall be granted for any construction, development, use, or
activity within any AE Area/District without floodway unless it is
demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development
would not, together with all other existing and anticipated
development, increase the BFE more than one foot at any point.
(g) No new construction or development shall be located within the area
measured 50 feet landward from the top-of-bank of any watercourse.

estimated flood height as determined using simplified methods plus a
freeboard safety factor of 1 1/2 feet.
SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA)  An area in the floodplain
subject to a 1% or greater chance of flooding in any given year. It is shown
on the FIRM as Zone A, AO, A1-A30, AE, A99, or AH.
SPECIAL PERMIT  A special approval which is required for hospitals,
nursing homes, jails, and new manufactured home parks and subdivisions
and substantial improvements to such existing parks, when such
development is located in all, or a designated portion of a floodplain.
START OF CONSTRUCTION  Includes substantial improvement and other
proposed new development and means the date the permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180
days from the date of the permit and shall be completed within 12 months
after the date of issuance of the permit unless a time extension is granted,
in writing, by the floodplain administrator. The actual start means either
the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such
as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction
of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement
of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not
include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does
it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include
excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection
of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property
of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling
units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the
actual start of construction means the first, alteration of any wall, ceiling,

parcels of more than 10 acres, not involving any new street or easement of
access or any residential dwelling, shall be exempted.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE  Damage from any cause sustained by a
structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged
condition would equal or exceed 50% or more of the market value of the
structure before the damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT  Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals
or exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure before the "start
of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which
have incurred "substantial damage" regardless of the actual repair work
performed. The term does not, however, include any project for
improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local
health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary
to assure safe living conditions.
Historic structures undergoing repair or rehabilitation that would
constitute a substantial improvement as defined in this chapter, must
comply with all ordinance requirements that do not preclude the structure's
continued designation as a historic structure.
Documentation that a specific ordinance requirement will cause removal
of the structure from the National Register of Historic Places or the State
Inventory of Historic places must be obtained from the Secretary of the
Interior or the State Historic Preservation Officer. Any exemption from
ordinance requirements will be the minimum necessary to preserve the
historic character and design of the structure.

UNIFORM CONSTRUCTION CODE (UCC)  The statewide building code
adopted by The Pennsylvania General Assembly in 1999 applicable to new
construction in all municipalities, whether administered by the municipality,
a third party or the Department of Labor and Industry. Applicable to
residential and commercial buildings, the code adopted the International
Residential Code (IRC) and the International Building Code (IBC), by
reference, as the construction standard applicable with the state floodplain
construction. For coordination purposes, references to the above are made
specifically to various sections of the IRC and the IBC.
VIOLATION  The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community's flood plain management regulations. A
structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other
certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in 44 CFR
60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) is presumed to be in

applications shall mean those subdivisions and developments that can
be shown to generate less than two additional PM peak hour trips,
without rounding, using the most current version of the Institute of

agreed upon traffic study. To qualify for the exemption, applicants shall
be required to place a waiver request on their final plat and submit

trips to be generated in accordance with the most current version of the
Institute of Transportation Engineers publication, Trip Generation
Manual.
(e) In the event that the trip generation characteristics of a use are not
sufficiently documented in the Trip Generation Manual, the fee shall be
determined by the information contained in the required Traffic Impact
Study per the Township Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance
as approved by the Township Transportation Engineer.

such improvements as verified by the Township. The Board of Supervisors
shall not be obligated to accept an offer of improvement construction by an
applicant.
(b) The Township Treasurer, or his designee, shall establish an impact fee
fund where the fee shall be deposited. This fund shall be deposited in an

receive deposits of the Township. Interest earned from this fund shall
be credited to that account and shall be used solely for the same
purpose as the original fee.
(c) The Township Manager or Treasurer shall establish appropriate
accounts for each transportation service area. These accounts shall be
reflected in the Township Budget and show expected credits and
payments for each project.
(d) The Township Manager or Treasurer shall maintain and keep adequate
financial records for each account that shall show the source and
disbursement of all revenues. He shall ensure that the disbursement of
funds shall be used solely and exclusively for the provision of projects
specified in the Transportation Capital Improvements Plan for that
particular transportation service area.
(a) If an applicant makes such improvements, he must enter into an
agreement with the Board of Supervisors prior to the issuance of any
building permit. The agreement must establish the estimated cost of
the improvement, the schedule for the initiation and completion of the
improvement, a requirement that the improvement shall be completed
to Township and Pennsylvania Department of Transportation standards
and criteria and any other terms and conditions that are deemed
necessary by the Board of Supervisors.
(b) Any credit shall not exceed the amount of the fee for each development.
However, provided that the applicant has other developments within
the transportation service areas that are in the same ownership and
have received preliminary approval, credits calculated to be greater
than the fee due may be applied to the fee for the applicant's other
developments.
(c) Applicants shall be required to post financial security, sufficient in the
judgment of the Township Engineer, to cover the cost of any
improvements installed by the applicant for which a credit is sought.
(d) An applicant, seeking a credit and with Board of Supervisors approval,
shall be entitled as a credit against the fee in the amount equal to the
fair market value of land dedicated by the applicant and accepted by

Fees collected pursuant to this Part shall be refunded, together with earned
accrued interest thereon, to the payor of the fee under the following
circumstances:
the Township for future right-of-way, realignment, or widening of
existing roadways provided that any on-site land dedication shall not be
counted unless it exceeds the requirements of the Township Subdivision
and Land Development Ordinance.
(e) An applicant, seeking a credit and with Board of Supervisors approval,
shall be entitled as a credit against the fee in the amount equal to the
construction value of any road improvement that is contained in the
Transportation Capital Improvements Plan that was performed at the
applicant's expense.
(a) In the event that the Township completes or terminates an adopted
capital improvements plan for a transportation service area and there
remains at the time of termination or completion undispersed funds in
the accounts established for that purpose, the Township shall provide
written notice by certified mail to those persons who previously paid
the fees which remain undispersed of the availability of said funds for
refund of the person's proportionate share of the fund balance.
(b) If the Township fails to commence construction of any transportation
service area road improvements within three years of the scheduled
construction date set forth in a transportation capital improvements
plan, any person who paid the fee pursuant to that transportation
capital improvements plan shall, upon written request to the Township,
receive a refund of that portion of the fee attributable to the
contribution for the uncommenced road improvement, plus the interest
accumulated thereon from the date of payment. However, no refund
shall be paid for any improvement project actually begun prior to the
receipt of such refund request.
(c) If, upon completion of any road improvements project contained in the
Transportation Capital Improvements Plan by the Township, the actual
expenditures of the capital project are less than 95% of the costs
properly allocable to the fee paid, the Township shall, upon written
request to the Township, refund the pro rata difference between the
budgeted costs and the actual expenditures, including interest
accumulated thereon from the date of payment, to the applicant.
(d) If the development for which the fee was paid is not commenced prior
to the expiration of building permits the fee with accumulated interest
shall be refunded, upon written request to the Township, to the
applicant. If the building permit as issued for the development is
altered and the alteration results in a decrease in the amount of the fee
due, the difference between the new fee and fee previously paid shall be
refunded, upon written request to the Township, to the applicant. The

hauler shall be submitted to the Township within 30 days following the
pumping.
(b) The Township will be divided into three management areas, with one
area designated to be pumped each year. The management areas will be
evaluated with the area with greatest number of older systems to be
pumped the first year, and the area with the greatest number of new
systems will be pumped in the third year.
(c) To assure that septic tanks are properly pumped, septic tank lids shall
be exposed prior to pumping. The exposure of the septic tank lid shall
be the responsibility of the tank owner. After pumping, the lid must
remain accessible until the Sewage Enforcement Officer or Plumbing
Inspector performs his inspection.
(d) In the event that a person provides a receipt or other written evidence
demonstrating that the person's septic tank has been pumped within
three years prior to the effective date of this Part, the Township may
delay that person's initial required pumping.
(e) The required pumping frequency may be increased at the discretion of
the authorized agent if the septic tank is undersized, if solids buildup in
the tank is above average, if the hydraulic load on the system increases
significantly above average, if a garbage grinder is used in the building,
if the system malfunctions, or for other good cause shown.
(f) Should maintenance be required as determined by the Sewage

untreated or partially treated sewage to the surface of the ground or
into the waters of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, unless a permit
to discharge has been obtained from the DEP.
(b) A written notice of violation shall be issued to any person who is the
owner of any property which is found to be served by a malfunctioning
on-lot sewage disposal system or which is discharging sewage without a
permit.
(c) Within seven days of notification by the Township that a malfunction
has been identified, the property owner shall make application to the
SEO for a permit to repair or replace the malfunctioning system. Within

into the POTW any pollutant or wastewater which causes pass through
or interference. These general prohibitions apply to all users of the
POTW whether or not they are subject to categorical pretreatment
standards or any other federal, state or local pretreatment standards or
requirements.
(b) Specific Prohibitions. No user shall introduce or cause to be introduced
into the POTW the following pollutants, substances or wastewater:
(1) Pollutants which create a fire or explosive hazard in the POTW,
including, but not limited to, waste streams, with a closed-cup
flashpoint of less than 140° F. (60° C.) using the test methods
specified in 40 CFR 261.21;
(2) Wastewater having a pH less than 6.0 or more than 9.0, or
otherwise causing corrosive structural damage to the POTW or
equipment;
(3) Solid or viscous substances in amounts which will cause
obstruction of the flow to the POTW resulting in interference with
the proper operation of the POTW. Such substances include, but are
not limited to, ashes, cinders, sand, mud, straw, shavings, metal,
glass, bones, rags, feathers, tar, plastic, wood, paunch, manure,
butchers' offal, whole blood, bentonite, lye, building materials,
rubber, hair, leather, porcelain, china, ceramic wastes, asphalt,
paint, waxes, needles or syringes of any type, but in no case solids
greater than two inches in any dimension.
(4) Pollutants, including oxygen-demanding pollutants (BOD, etc.),
released din a discharge at a flow rate and/or pollutant
concentration which, either singly or by interaction with other
pollutants, will cause interference with the POTW;
(5) Wastewater having a temperature greater than 104° F. or lower
than 32° F., or which will inhibit biological activity in the treatment
plant resulting in interference, but in no case wastewater which
causes the temperature at the introduction into the treatment plant
to exceed 104° F. (40° C.);
(6) Petroleum oil, nonbiodegradable cutting oil, or products of mineral
oil origin, in amounts that will cause interference or pass through;
(7) Pollutants which result in the presence of toxic gases, vapors, or

sufficient to create a public nuisance or a hazard to life, or to
prevent entry into the sewers for maintenance or repair;
(10)Wastewater which imparts color which cannot be removed by the
treatment process, such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and
vegetable tanning solutions, which consequently impart color to
the treatment plant's effluent, thereby violating the Township's
NPDES permit. Color (in combination with turbidity) shall not
cause the treatment plant effluent to reduce the depth of the
compensation point for photosynthetic activity by more than 10%
from the reasonably established norm for aquatic life;

The above limits may be revised by resolution of Amity Township Board of
Supervisors.
The above limits apply at the point where the wastewater is discharged
to the POTW (end of the pipe). All concentrations for metallic substances
are for "total" metal unless indicated otherwise. The Township may impose
mass limitations in addition to or in place of the concentration-based
limitations above.
Deductions will be made from these limited substances equal to the
concentrations of each substance that is contained in the potable water
supply.
§ 23-334. Township's Right of Revision. [Ord. No. 227, 9/5/2006]
The Township reserves the right to adopt, from time to time by ordinance
or in wastewater discharge permits, such additional rules and regulations
as it shall deem necessary and proper relating to connection to and proper
operation of the POTW, which rules and regulations shall be construed as a
part of this Part.
§ 23-335. Special Agreement. [Ord. No. 227, 9/5/2006]
The Township reserves the right to enter into special agreements with users
setting out special terms under which they may discharge to the POTW.
In no case will a special agreement waive compliance with a pretreatment
standard or requirement. However, a user may request a net gross
adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15.
A user also may request a variance from the categorical pretreatment
standard from the approved authority. Such a request will be approved only
if the user can prove that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally
different from the factors considered by EPA when establishing that
categorical pretreatment standard. A user requesting a fundamentally
different factor variance must comply with the procedural and substantive
provisions in 40 CFR 403.13.
§ 23-336. Dilution. [Ord. No. 227, 9/5/2006]

to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate
treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless
expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or
requirement. The Township may impose mass limitations on users who are
using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements,
or in other cases where the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.

(a) Whenever deemed necessary, the Township may require users to
restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain
wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or
consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage waste streams from
industrial waste streams, and such other conditions as may be
necessary to protect the POTW and determine the user's compliance
with the requirements of this Part.
(b) Each person discharging into the POTW greater than 25,000 gallons
per day or greater than 5% of the average daily flow in the POTW,
whichever is less, shall install and maintain, on his property and at his
expense, a suitable storage and flow control facility to ensure
equalization of flow over a twenty-four hour period. The facility shall
have a capacity for at least 50% of the daily discharge volume and shall
be equipped with alarms and a rate of discharge controller, the
regulation of which shall be directed by the Township. A wastewater
discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization.

Standard Deadline. [Ord. No. 227, 9/5/2006]
Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable
categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source following
commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any user
subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit
to the Township a report containing the information described in
§ 23-358(b)(4-6) of this Part. For users subject to equivalent mass or
concentration limits established in accordance with the procedures in 40
CFR 403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's
long-term production rate. For all other users subject to categorical
pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge
per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report shall
include the user's actual production during the appropriate sampling
period. All compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance
with § 23-346 of this Part.

Each user must notify the Township of any planned significant changes to
the user's operations or system which might alter the nature, quality, or
volume of its wastewater at least 30 days before the change.
(a) All significant industrial users shall, at a frequency determined by the
Township but in no case less than twice per year (in June and
December), submit a report indicating the nature and concentration of
pollutants in the discharge which are limited by pretreatment
standards and the measured or estimated average and maximum daily
flows for the reporting period. All periodic compliance reports must be
signed and certified in accordance with § 23-346 of this Part.
(b) All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's discharge.
Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be
properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at
all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good
working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample
results are unrepresentative of its discharge.
(c) If a user subject to the reporting requirements in this section monitors
any pollutant more frequently than required by the Township, using the
procedures prescribed in § 23-368 of this Part, the results of this
monitoring shall be included in the report.
(a) The Township may require the user to submit such information as may
be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the
submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under

not limited to, flow increases of 10% or greater, and the discharge of
any previously unreported pollutants.
(a) In the case of any discharge including, but not limited to, accidental
discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a
noncustomary batch discharge, or a slug load, that may cause potential
problems for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and notify
the Township of the incident. This notification shall include the location
of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume (if known),
and corrective actions taken by the user.
(b) Within five days following such discharge, the user shall, unless waived
by the Township, submit a detailed written report describing the

Administrative Enforcement Remedies.
§ 23-375. Notification of Violation. [Ord. No. 227, 9/5/2006]
When the Township finds that a user has violated (or continues to violate)
any provision of this Part, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
Township may serve upon that user a written notice of violation. Within
seven days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and
a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include
specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the Township.
Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any
violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation.
Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the Township to take
any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action,
without first issuing a notice of violation.
§ 23-376. Consent Orders. [Ord. No. 227, 9/5/2006]
The Township may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary
compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any
user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific
action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time
period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same
force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to §§ 23-378
and 23-379 of this Part and shall be judicially enforceable.
§ 23-377. Show Cause Hearing. [Ord. No. 227, 9/5/2006]
The Township may order a user which has violated or continues to violate
any provision of this Part, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear
before the Township and show cause why the proposed enforcement action
should not be taken. Notice shall be serviced on the user specifying the time
and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons
for such action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed
enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be
served personally or by registered mail (return receipt requested) at least
10 days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized
representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against,
or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
§ 23-378. Compliance Orders. [Ord. No. 227, 9/5/2006]
When the Township finds that a user has violated or continues to violate
any provision of this Part, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
Township may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge
directing that the user come into compliance within 15 days. If the user
§ 23-375 ADOPTING ORDINANCE § 23-378
AO:349
does not come into compliance within 30 days, sewer service shall be
discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related
appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders may
also contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including
additional self-monitoring, and management practices designed to minimize
the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order
may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a federal
pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve
the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation.
Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite
for, taking any other action against the user.
§ 23-379. Cease and Desist Orders. [Ord. No. 227, 9/5/2006]
When the Township finds that a user has violated (or continues to violate)
any provision of this Part, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the
user's past violations are likely to recur, the Township may issue an order to
the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the
user to:
§ 23-380. Administrative Fines. [Ord. No. 227, 9/5/2006]
(a) Immediately comply with all requirements; and
(b) Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed
to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including
halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.
Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(a) When the Township finds that a user has violated or continues to violate
any provision of this Part, a wastewater discharge permit or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement,
the Township may fine such user in an amount not to exceed $1,000.
Such fines shall be assessed on a per violation, per day basis. In the
case of monthly or other long-term average discharge limits, fines shall
be assessed for each day during the period of violation.
(b) Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after 15 calendar days, be
assessed an additional penalty of 10% of the unpaid balance, and
interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of 1% per month. A lien against
the user's property will be sought for unpaid charges, fines, and
penalties.
(c) Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for the
Township to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine
amount within 10 days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has
merit, the Township may convene a hearing on the matter. In the event

In addition to the provisions in § 23-346 of this Part, any user who violates
the following conditions is subject to discharge termination:
accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user. The Township may
add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as
notices and orders, to the fine.
(d) Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(a) Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop
or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to
immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the
Township may take such steps as deemed necessary, including
immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize
damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any
individuals. The Township may allow the user to recommence its
discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the
Township that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the
termination proceedings in § 23-382 of this Part are initiated against
the user.
(b) A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written
statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the
measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the Township prior
to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under §§ 23-377
and 23-382 of this Part.
Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior
to any emergency suspension under this section.
(a) Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions;
(b) Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;

each separate day shall constitute a separate and distinct offense under
this section.
(b) For purposes of this section, a single operational upset which leads to
simultaneous violations of more than one pretreatment standard or
requirement shall be treated as a single violation as required by the
Federal Water Pollution Control Act.
(c) In addition to the civil penalty, the Township may recover the costs for
re-establishing the operation of the POTW.
(d) The Township shall include as part of the notice of an assessment of
civil penalties a description of the appeals process to be followed,
including the name, address, and telephone number of the person
responsible for accepting such appeal.
(e) The Township may publicly adopt a formal, written civil penalty
assessment policy and make it publicly available. Each industrial
discharger with an industrial waste discharge permit shall be given
written notice of the policy. In developing the penalty assessment policy,
the POTW shall consider damage to air, water, land, or other natural
resources of this Commonwealth and their uses; cost of restoration and
abatement; savings resulting to the person in consequence of the
violation; history of past violations; deterrence of future violations; and
other relevant factors.

either the amount of the penalty or the fact of the violation, the
industrial user must file an appeal within 30 days pursuant to 2
Pa.C.S.A. (relating to administrative law and procedure). Failure to
appeal within this period shall result in a waiver of all legal rights to
contest the violation or the amount of the penalty. In the event of an
appeal, the Township shall conduct a hearing and decide the appeal as
provided by administrative law and procedure. In the event, after
hearing and decision, the industrial user wishes to make a further
appeal, it may do so by filing an appropriate appeal to the Court of
Common Pleas of Berks County within 30 days of the final order of the
Township.

ARTICLE Q.
Affirmative Defenses to Discharge Violations.
§ 23-392. Upset. [Ord. No. 227, 9/5/2006]
(a) For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional incident
in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the
reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include
noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly
designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of
preventive maintenance or careless or improper operation.
(b) An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for
noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the
requirements of Subsection (c) are met.
(c) A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall
demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating lots
or other relevant evidence that:
(1) An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
(2) The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation
and maintenance procedures; and
(3) The user has submitted the following information to the Township
and treatment plant operator within 24 hours of becoming aware of
the upset (if this information is provided orally, a written
submission must be provided within five days):
(i) A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
(ii) The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times
or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is
expected to continue; and
(iii) Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
(d) In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
(e) Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any
claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance
with categorical pretreatment standards.
(f) Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary
to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon
reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is

AO:359
§ 23-393. Prohibited Discharge Standards. [Ord. No. 227, 9/5/2006]
A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought
against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in § 23-330(a)
of this Part or the specific prohibitions in § 23-330(b)(3) of this Part if it
can prove that it did not know or have reason to know that its discharge,
alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause
pass through or interference and that either: (a) a local limit exists for
each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit
directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or (b) no
local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature
or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the Township was
regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of
interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal
requirements.
§ 23-394. Bypass. [Ord. No. 227, 9/5/2006]
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This
requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the
primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or
fails.
(a) For the purposes of this section:
(1) "Bypass" means the intentional diversion of waste streams from
any portion of a user's treatment facility.
(2) "Severe property damage" means substantial physical damage to
property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to
be inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural
resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the
absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean
economic loss caused by delays in production.
(b) A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause
pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it
also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These
bypasses are not subject to the provision of Subsections (c) and (d) of
this section.
(c) If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior
notice to the Township, at least 10 days before the date of the bypass, if
possible.
A user shall submit oral notice to the Township of an unanticipated
bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours
from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission
shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes
aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description
of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including
§ 23-392 AMITY CODE § 23-394
AO:360
exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected,
the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or
planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass.
The Township may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if
the oral report has been received within 24 hours.
(d) Bypass is prohibited, and the Township may take an enforcement action
against a user for a bypass, unless:
(1) Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or
severe property damage;
(2) There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use
of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This
condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should
have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering
judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal
periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
(3) The user submitted notices as required under Subsection (c) of this
section.
The Township, after consulting with its Consulting Engineer, may approve
an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if they
determine that it will meet the three conditions listed in Subsection (d)
above.

Determination of Charges for Strong Wastes.
§ 23-398. Strong Waste Surcharges. [Ord. No. 227, 9/5/2006]
There may be additional charges for wastes having concentrations of BOD,
suspended solids, dissolved solids, ammonia-nitrogen, and phosphorus in
excess of the average concentration of these pollutants in normal domestic
waste. Normal domestic waste shall be considered as having the following
concentrations:
§ 23-399. Strong Waste Surcharge Formula. [Ord. No. 227, 9/5/
2006]
In order to determine the additional charges for wastes with strength
greater than that of domestic waste, the following formula shall be used:
SQ = 0.00834 QI [(CBOD5 - 300) TCBOD + (SSI - 250) TCSS + (DSI - 500)
TCDS + (NH3NI-25) TCNH3N]
Where:
SQ is the quarterly surcharge to be added to the normal sewer rent.
0.00834 is a constant to convert waste concentrations expressed in
mg/L to thousands of pounds of waste.
QI is the quarterly waste flow expressed in million gallons.
CBOD5, SSI, DSI, and NH3NI are the respective concentrations of
CBOD5, suspended solids, dissolved solids, and ammonia nitrogen of
the waste expressed in mg/L.
300, 250, 500, and 25 are constants which express the waste load
concentrations in mg/L for normal domestic waste.
TCCBOD5 is the treatment cost incurred by the Township as updated
annually per 1,000 pounds of CBOD5.
(a) CBOD5 - 300 mg/L.
(b) Suspended solids - 250 mg/L.
(c) Dissolved solids - 500 mg/L.
(d) Ammonia nitrogen - 25 mg/L.
Maximum acceptable wastewater strength concentrations are as
follows:
(a) CBOD5 - 900 mg/L
(b) Suspended solids - 750 mg/L
(c) Dissolved solids - 1,500 mg/L
(d) Ammonia nitrogen - 75 mg/L
§ 23-398 ADOPTING ORDINANCE § 23-399
AO:365
TCss is the treatment cost incurred by the Township as updated
annually per 1,000 pounds of suspended solids.
TCDS is the treatment cost incurred by the Township as updated
annually per 1,000 pounds of dissolved solids.
TCNH3N is the treatment cost incurred by the Township as updated
annually per 1,000 pounds of ammonia nitrogen.
When a value of CBOD, suspended solids, dissolved solids and/or ammonia
nitrogen is less than the normal domestic waste concentration set forth
in the strong waste surcharge formula, then the normal domestic waste
concentration shall be used in the calculation of strong waste surcharge.
The Township may choose not to apply the surcharge formula for any of the
above parameters depending on the parameters listed in its NPDES permit.
§ 23-400. Additional Surcharges. [Ord. No. 227, 9/5/2006]
The formula specified in § 23-399 of this Part is to determine additional
charges or surcharges for the treatment of wastes having concentrations of
CBOD5, suspended solids, dissolved solids and ammonia nitrogen in excess
of those of domestic waste. It is, however, recognized that the discharge
of any waste or other substance containing any one of the prohibited
substances listed in § 23-330 may result in extraordinary laboratory, labor,
maintenance and/or treatment expenses to the Township. Hence, in the
event of the discharge of any wastes or other matters or substance
containing any one of the prohibited substances listed in § 23-330 or
§ 23-334 multiplied by the TRC, the Township shall have the power to bill
the owner of the property from which such discharge is made an additional
surcharge of $300. Each day that such discharge is made shall result in a
separate $300 additional surcharge. This $300 charge shall be in addition
to the normal sewer rental and/or any strong waste surcharge as incurred
under § 23-399 of this Part.
§ 23-401. Methods of Payment of Extra Charges by Industrial Users.
[Ord. No. 227, 9/5/2006]
The strong waste surcharge shall be paid quarterly. The Township shall
cause the water meter of each industrial user where the wastewater flow
determination is based upon metered water consumption, and the
wastewater meter where the wastewater flow determination is based upon
wastewater flow measurement, to be read on a quarterly basis, and the
Township shall cause strong waste surcharge bills to be mailed forthwith
following each reading.
(a) The Township shall cause periodic sampling of the wastewater
discharged by each industrial user in accordance with § 23-403 of this
Part.
(b) The analysis of the sample shall be the basis for computing strong
waste surcharges.

AO:366
§ 23-402. New Industrial Users. [Ord. No. 227, 9/5/2006]
A new industrial user is one which connects to the treatment works after the
effective date of this section. Strong waste surcharge payments by a new
industrial user shall begin on the date treatment works use is initiated and
continue indefinitely.
(c) Bills for strong waste surcharge shall be mailed to the owner's address
specified on the industrial waste permit. Failure to receive a bill as a
result of incorrect address or otherwise shall not excuse nonpayment of
charges or extend the time for payment.
(d) The strong waste surcharge formula will be updated annually using
current operation and maintenance costs and waste load quantities to
reflect actual costs to remove specific pollutants.

Measurement of Concentration of Industrial Waste.
§ 23-403. Industrial Waste Sampling. [Ord. No. 227, 9/5/2006]
Industrial wastes being discharged into the sewer system shall be subject
to sampling and inspection to be used as a basis for determining additional
charges due to excessive concentrations of CBOD5, suspended solids,
dissolved solids, ammonia nitrogen, and/or substances prohibited in
§ 23-330 of this Part. Such sampling and inspection shall be made by the
Township as frequently as may be deemed necessary. The analysis of the
sample so obtained shall be the basis for computing additional charges in
accordance with § 23-401 of this Part. The cost of such sampling and testing
thereof shall be borne by the user.
The industry may request that samples be taken in addition to the samples
taken by the Township. The cost of making this collection and analysis shall
be borne by the user.
Samples and the analysis of samples shall be made in accordance with the
techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136, unless otherwise specified in
an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does
not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question,
sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures
approved by EPA.
§ 23-404. Control Manhole. [Ord. No. 227, 9/5/2006]
When required by the Township, the owner of any property discharging
industrial waste into the sewer system shall install a suitable control
manhole together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in
the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, and measurement
of the waste. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessible and safely

Surcharges.
§ 23-405. Measurement. [Ord. No. 227, 9/5/2006]
Whenever a person purchasing his entire water supply from a water
purveyor discharges only industrial waste into the sewer system, the
volume of water purchased may be used as a measure of the quantity of
industrial waste discharged.
Whenever a person purchasing his entire water supply from a water
purveyor discharges combined domestic waste and industrial waste into
the sewer system, the volume of water purchased chargeable as industrial
waste shall be the total volume of water purchased less the volume
determined to be domestic waste. The domestic waste shall be determined
by the Township in either of the following two ways:
(a) Actual measured flow; or
(b) By multiplying the average number of employees in the establishment
during the preceding billing period by 10 gallons per day.
Whenever a person purchasing his entire water supply from a water
purveyor and discharging industrial waste into the sewer system also
discharges unpolluted cooling water to either a separate storm sewer
or other outlet, an allowance for the amount of water so discharged
shall be made in computing the sewer charges. The person so
discharging cooling water shall, at his own expense, install a meter or
meters, as required, to indicate accurately and to the satisfaction of
the Township the amount of water claimed as a credit.
The Township shall be responsible for the reading of water and/or
sewage meters when installed in industrial establishments within its

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 25-101. Short Title. [Ord. No. 243, 3/19/2008]
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the Amity Township
Stormwater Management Ordinance".
§ 25-102. Statement of Findings. [Ord. No. 243, 3/19/2008]
The Board of Supervisors of the Township of Amity finds that:
(a) Inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting
from development throughout a watershed increases flood flows and
velocities, contributes to erosion and sedimentation, overtaxes the
carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers, greatly
increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater,
undermines floodplain management and flood reduction efforts in
upstream and downstream communities, reduces groundwater
recharge, and threatens public health and safety.
(b) Inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting
from land development and redevelopment throughout a watershed can
also harm surface water resources by changing the natural hydrologic
patterns, accelerating stream flows (which increase scour and erosion
of stream-beds and stream-banks thereby elevating sedimentation),
destroying aquatic habitat and elevating aquatic pollutant
concentrations and loadings such as sediments, nutrients, heavy metals
and pathogens. Groundwater resources are also impacted through loss
of recharge.
(c) A comprehensive program of stormwater management (SWM),
including minimization of impacts of development, redevelopment and
activities causing accelerated erosion, is fundamental to the public
health, safety, welfare, and the protection of the people of the Township
and all the people of the commonwealth, their resources, and the
environment.
(d) Inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting
from development throughout a watershed poses a threat to surface
and groundwater quality.
(e) Stormwater can be an important water resource by providing
groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams,
which also protects and maintains surface water quality.
(f) Impacts from stormwater runoff can be minimized by using project
designs that maintain the natural hydrologic regime, and sustain high
water quality, groundwater recharge, stream baseflow and aquatic
ecosystems. The most cost effective and environmentally advantageous
way to manage storm water runoff is through nonstructural project
§ 25-101 ADOPTING ORDINANCE § 25-102
AO:393
§ 25-103. Purpose. [Ord. No. 243, 3/19/2008]
The purpose of this chapter is to promote the public health, safety, and
welfare within Amity Township by maintaining the natural hydrologic
regime by minimizing the impacts described in § 25-102 of this chapter
through provisions designed to:
design, minimizing impervious surfaces and sprawl, avoiding sensitive
areas (i.e. stream buffers, floodplains, steep slopes), and designing to
topography and soils to maintain the natural hydrologic regime.
(g) Public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an
essential component in successfully addressing stormwater.
(h) Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to
implement a program of stormwater controls. These municipalities are
required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their
separate storm sewer systems under the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES).
(i) Non-stormwater discharges to municipal separate storm sewer systems
can contribute to pollution of waters of the commonwealth by the
Township.
(a) Promote alternative project designs and layout that minimizes impacts
to surface and ground water.
(b) Promote nonstructural best management practices (BMPs).
(c) Minimize increases in stormwater volume.
(d) Minimize impervious surfaces.
(e) Manage accelerated runoff and erosion and sedimentation problems at
their source by regulating activities that cause these problems.
(f) Provide review procedures and performance standards for stormwater
planning and management.
(g) Utilize and preserve the existing natural drainage systems.
(h) Manage stormwater impacts close to the runoff source, which requires
a minimum of structures and relies on natural processes.
(i) Focus on infiltration of stormwater, to maintain groundwater recharge,
to prevent degradation of surface and groundwater quality and to
otherwise protect water resources.
(j) Maintain existing base flows and quality of streams and watercourses,
where possible.
(k) Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including
regulations at 25 Pa. Code Chapter 93.4a to protect and maintain
"existing uses" and maintain the level of water quality to support those
§ 25-102 AMITY CODE § 25-103
AO:394
§ 25-104. Statutory Authority. [Ord. No. 243, 3/19/2008]
uses in all streams, and to protect and maintain water quality in
"special protection" streams.
(l) Address the quality and quantity of stormwater discharges from the
development site.
(m) Provide a mechanism to identify controls necessary to meet the NPDES
permit requirements.
(n) Implement an illegal discharge detection and elimination program to
address nonstormwater discharges into the Township's separate storm
sewer system.
(o) Preserve and restore the flood-carrying capacity of streams.
(p) Prevent scour and erosion of stream banks and streambeds.
(q) Provide performance standards and design criteria for watershed-wide
stormwater management and planning.
(r) Provide proper operation and maintenance of all permanent
stormwater management facilities and BMPs that are implemented in
the Township.
(s) NPDS Requirements. Federal regulations approved October 1999
require operators of small municipal separate storm sewer systems
(MS4s) to obtain NPDES Phase II permits from DEP by March 2003.
(NPDES II is an acronym for the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System Phase II Stormwater Permitting Regulations.) This
program affects all municipalities in "urbanized areas" of the state. This
definition applies to all Schuylkill River watershed municipalities
identified in Table III-1 of the Schuylkill River Stormwater Management
Plan Volume II as NPDES Phase II municipalities. Therefore, these
identified municipalities will be subject to the NPDES Phase II
requirements mandated by the Federal Clean Water Act as
administered by DEP. For more information on NPDES II requirements,
contact the DEP Regional Office.
(a) Primary Authority. The Township is empowered to regulate these
activities by the authority of the Act of October 4, 1978, P.L. 864 (Act
167), 32 P.S. § 680.1 et seq., as amended, the "Storm Water
Management Act" and the Pennsylvania Second Class Township Code,
53 P.S. § 65101 et seq., as amended.
(b) Secondary Authority. The Township also is empowered to regulate land
use activities that affect runoff by the authority of the Act of July 31,
1968, P.L. 805, No. 247, The Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning
Code, as amended.

permit, as required by DEP regulations, shall be available at the project
site at all times.
(f) Additional erosion and sediment control design standards and criteria
are recommended to be applied where infiltration BMPs are proposed
shall include the following:
(1) Areas proposed for infiltration BMPs shall be protected from
sedimentation and compaction during the construction phase to
maintain maximum infiltration capacity.
(2) Infiltration BMPs shall not be constructed nor receive runoff until
the entire contributory drainage area to the infiltration BMP has
achieved final stabilization.
(a) For projects disturbing one acre or more, the design of all regulated
activities shall include evaluation of practicable alternatives to the
surface discharge of stormwater, the creation of impervious surfaces,
and the degradation of waters of the commonwealth, and must maintain
as much as possible the natural hydrologic regime of the site.
(1) An alternative is practicable if it is available and capable of being
done after taking into consideration cost, existing technology and
logistics in light of overall project purposes, and other Township
requirements.
(2) All practicable alternatives to the discharge of stormwater are
presumed to have less adverse impact on quantity and quality of
waters of the commonwealth unless otherwise demonstrated.
(b) The applicant shall demonstrate that they designed the regulated
activities that disturb one acre or more included consideration of the
following issues:
(1) Prepare an Existing Resource and Site Analysis Map (ERSAM),
showing environmentally sensitive areas including, but not limited
to, steep slopes, ponds, lakes, streams, wetlands, hydric soils,
vernal pools, flood plains, stream buffer zones, hydrologic soil
groups A and B (areas conducive to infiltration), special geologic
features, any existing recharge areas and any other requirements
outlined in the Township Subdivision and Land Development
Ordinance.
(2) Establish appropriate buffers for each of the delineated
environmentally sensitive areas per the Township Zoning

§ 25-305. Ground Water Recharge (Infiltration/Recharge/
Bioretention). [Ord. No. 243, 3/19/2008]
Maximizing the ground water recharge capacity of the area being
developed is required. Design of the infiltration stormwater management
facilities shall give consideration to providing ground water recharge to
compensate for the reduction in the percolation that occurs when the
ground surface is disturbed or impervious surface is created. It is
recommended that roof runoff be directed to infiltration BMPs which can be

AO:412
over-designed to compensate for the infiltration losses due to parking areas.
It is recommended that roof runoff be directed to infiltration BMPs which
may be designed to compensate for the runoff from parking areas. These
measures are required to be consistent with § 25-103, and take advantage
of utilizing any existing recharge areas.
Infiltration may not be feasible on every site due to site-specific limitations
such as soil type. If it cannot be physically accomplished, due to seasonal
high water table, soil permeability rate, soil depth or setback distances from
special geologic features, then the design professional shall be responsible
to show that this cannot be physically accomplished. If it can be physically
accomplished, then the volume of runoff to be infiltrated shall be
determined from § 25-305(a)(3) depending on demonstrated site conditions
and shall be the greater of the two volumes.
(a) Infiltration BMPs shall meet the following minimum requirements:
(1) Infiltration Requirements. Regulated activities will be required to
infiltrate, where site conditions permit, a portion of the runoff
created by the development as part of an overall stormwater
management plan designed for the site. The volume of runoff to be
infiltrated shall be determined from § 25-305(a)(3)(i) or (ii),
depending upon demonstrated site conditions.
(2) Infiltration BMPs intended to receive runoff from developed areas
shall be selected based on suitability of soils and site conditions
and shall be constructed on soils that have the following
characteristics:
(i) A minimum depth of 24 inches between the bottom of the BMP
and the limiting zone.
(ii) An infiltration and/or percolation rate sufficient to accept the
additional stormwater load and drain completely as
determined by field tests conducted by the applicant's design
professional.
(iii) The infiltration facility shall be capable of completely
infiltrating the required retention (infiltration) volume within
four days (96 hours).
(iv) Pretreatment shall be provided prior to infiltration.
(3) The size of the infiltration facility shall be based upon the following
volume criteria:
(i) NRCS Curve Number equation.
The NRCS runoff equation shall be utilized to calculate
infiltration requirements (I) in inches.
I (Infiltration requirement, in inches) =
(200/ CN) - 2
Eqn: 305.1
§ 25-305 ADOPTING ORDINANCE § 25-305
AO:413
Where:
CN = SCS (NRCS) curve number of existing conditions
contributing to the infiltration facility.
This equation is displayed graphically in, and the infiltration
requirement can be determined from Figure 305.1.
It has been determined that infiltrating 0.46 inches of runoff
from the impervious areas will aid in maintaining the
hydrologic regime of the watershed. However, the rounded
number 0.5 inches will be used.
Figure 305.1. Infiltration requirement based upon
NRCS Curve Number.
The retention (infiltration) volume (Rev) required to meet the
infiltration requirement would therefore be computed as:
Rev = (0.5 or I, whichever is greater)*
impervious area (square feet)/(12 in/ft) = Cubic
Feet
Eqn: 305.2
Where:
I = Infiltration requirements (in inches)
(ii) Annual Recharge - Water Budget Approach. If the goals of
§ 25-305(a)(3)(i)a cannot be achieved, then 0.5 inch of rainfall
shall be infiltrated from all impervious areas, up to a an
existing site conditions curve number of 81. Above a curve
number of 81, Equation 305.1 or the curve in Figure 305.1
should be used to determine the infiltration requirement.
The retention (infiltration) volume (Rev) required again would
therefore be computed as:
§ 25-305 AMITY CODE § 25-305
AO:414
Rev = (0.5 or I, whichever is greater) * impervious area (sq.
ft.) / (12 in/ft) = cubic feet.
(b) Soils Testing. If on-lot infiltration is proposed as part of a project, the
applicant's design professional must demonstrate to the satisfaction of
the Township that the soils are conducive to infiltration at the proposed
location of infiltration facilities. Soils testing shall be completed as
follows:
(1) Soils testing must be conducted by a qualified design professional
and at a minimum shall address depth to limiting zone, soil
permeability, and subgrade stability. Soils testing must be observed
by a representative of the Township.
(2) Analyze hydrologic soil groups as well as natural and man-made
features within the site to determine general areas of suitability for
infiltration practices. In areas where development on fill material is
under consideration, conduct geotechnical investigations of subgrade
stability; infiltration may not be ruled out without conducting
these tests.
(3) Conduct field testing including: test pits to determine soil horizons
and depth to limiting zone and permeability tests, at the elevation
of the proposed infiltration facility surface, to determine the
appropriate hydraulic conductivity rate. Double ring infiltrometer
or hydraulic conductivity tests should be used to determine soil
permeability (percolation tests are not recommended for design
purposes). Site evaluation and soils testing should be conducted in
accordance with Appendix C of the Pennsylvania Stormwater Best
Management Practices Manual.
(4) The proposed infiltration facilities shall be designed for the
required recharge (Rev) volume based on the field determined
capacity at the surface elevation of the proposed infiltration facility.
(c) Carbonate Areas. The applicant is required to investigate the ability of
all areas on the site which are not underlain by carbonate rock to meet
the infiltration requirements of § 25-305(a). If this investigation proves
infeasible, infiltration can occur on areas underlain by carbonate rock
by following the recommended procedure below in conjunction with
Figure B-1 in Appendix B.10 However, the applicant is not required to
use infiltration in carbonate areas even if the site falls into the
"Recommended" range on Figure B-1 in Appendix B. If infiltration is not
proposed, the calculated infiltration volume [§ 25-305(a)] shall be
treated by an acceptable BMP.
Infiltration BMP loading rate percentages in Figure B-1 in Appendix B
shall be calculated as follows:
10.Editor's Note: Appendix B is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 25-305 ADOPTING ORDINANCE § 25-305
AO:415
The area tributary to the infiltration BMP shall be weighted as
follows:
Area Description Weighting
All disturbed area to be made
impervious
100%
All disturbed areas to be made
pervious
50%
All undisturbed impervious areas 100%
All undisturbed pervious areas 0%
Soil thickness is to be measured from the bottom of any proposed
infiltration BMP. The effective soil thickness in Figure B-1 in Appendix
B is the measured soil thickness multiplied by the thickness factor
based on soil permeability, as follows:
Permeability Range Thickness Factor
6.0 to 12.0 inches/hr 0.8
2.0 to 6.0 inches/hr 1.0
1.0 to 2.0 inches/hr 1.4
0.75 to 1.0 inches/hr 1.2
0.5 to 0.75 inches/hr 1.0
The design of all facilities over Karst shall include an evaluation of
measures to minimize adverse effects.
(d) Stormwater Hotspots. Following is a list of examples of designated
hotspots. If a site is designated as a hotspot, it has important
implications for how stormwater is managed. First and foremost,
untreated stormwater runoff from hotspots shall not be allowed to
recharge into groundwater where it may contaminate water supplies.
Therefore, the Rev requirement shall NOT applied to development sites
that fit into the hotspot category (the entire WQv must still be treated).
Second, a greater level of stormwater treatment shall be considered at
hotspot sites to prevent pollutant washoff after construction. EPA's
NPDES stormwater program requires some industrial sites to prepare
and implement a stormwater pollution prevention plan.
Examples of Hotspots:
 Vehicle salvage yards and recycling facilities
 Vehicle fueling stations
§ 25-305 AMITY CODE § 25-305
AO:416
Examples of Hotspots:
 Vehicle service and maintenance facilities
 Vehicle and equipment cleaning facilities
 Fleet storage areas (bus, truck, etc.)
 Industrial sites (based on Standard Industrial Codes)
 Marinas (service and maintenance)
 Outdoor liquid container storage
 Outdoor loading/unloading facilities
 Public works storage areas
 Facilities that generate or store hazardous materials
 Commercial container nursery
 Other land uses and activities as designated by an appropriate
review authority
The following land uses and activities are not normally considered
hotspots:
 Residential streets and rural highways
 Residential development
 Institutional development
 Office developments
 Non-industrial rooftops
 Pervious areas, except golf courses and nurseries (which may
need an integrated pest management (IPM) plan).
While large highways (average daily traffic volume (ADT) greater than 30,000) are not
designated as a stormwater hotspot; it is important to ensure that highway stormwater
management plans adequately protect groundwater.
(e) Caution shall be exercised where infiltration is proposed in Source
Water Protection Areas as defined by the Township or local Water
Authority.
(f) Infiltration facilities shall be used in conjunction with other innovative
or traditional stormwater control facilities that are found within the
PADEP State BMP Manual.
(g) Caution shall be exercised where salt or chloride (municipal salt
storage) would be a pollutant since soils do little to filter this pollutant
and it may contaminate the groundwater. The qualified design
professional shall evaluate the possibility of groundwater
contamination from the proposed infiltration facility and perform a
hydrogeologic justification study if necessary.
§ 25-305 ADOPTING ORDINANCE § 25-305
AO:417
(h) The infiltration requirement in high quality or exceptional value waters
shall be subject to the Department's Chapter 93 Antidegradation
Regulations.
(i) Dependant upon certain land use or hotspots, an impermeable liner will
be required in detention basins where the possibility of groundwater
contamination exists. A detailed hydrogeologic investigation may be
required by the Township.
(j) The Township shall require the applicant to provide safeguards against
groundwater contamination for land uses that may cause groundwater
contamination should there be a mishap or spill.
(k) Infiltration Design Criteria.
(1) All infiltration systems shall have appropriate positive overflow
controls to prevent storage within one foot of the finished surface
or grade.
(2) All infiltration systems shall have a minimum setback of 15 feet
from principal structures, 10 feet from property lines, 100 feet
from wells, 50 feet from septic system drain fields, and 50 feet from
a geologic contact with carbonate bedrock. Care should be taken to
prevent any seepage into subgrade structures.
(3) Surface inflows shall be treated to prevent the direct discharge of
sediment and pollutants into the infiltration system; accumulated
sediment reduces stormwater storage capacity and ultimately clogs
the infiltration mechanism.
(4) No sand or other particulate matter may be applied to a porous
paving surface for winter ice conditions.
(5) During site construction, all recharge system components shall be
protected from compaction due to heavy equipment operation or
storage of fill or construction material. Recharge areas shall be
protected from sedimentation. All areas designated for recharge
shall not receive runoff until the contributory drainage area has
achieved final stabilization.
(6) The following procedures and materials shall be required during
the construction of all subsurface facilities:
(i) Excavation for the infiltration facility shall be performed with
equipment which will not compact the bottom of the seepage
bed/trench, or like facility.
(ii) The bottom of the bed and/or trench shall be scarified prior to
the placement of aggregate.
(iii) Only clean aggregate, free of fines, shall be allowed.
§ 25-305 AMITY CODE § 25-305
AO:418
§ 25-306. Water Quality Requirements. [Ord. No. 243, 3/19/2008]
The applicant shall comply with the following water quality requirements of
this Part.
(iv) The top and sides of all seepage beds, trenches, or like
facilities shall be covered with drainage filtration fabric. Fabric
shall meet the specifications of PennDOT Publication 408,
Section 735, Construction Class 1.
(v) Perforated distribution pipes connected to centralized catch
basins and/or manholes with provision for the collection of
debris shall be provided in all facilities. The perforated pipes
shall distribute stormwater throughout the entire seepage bed/
trench, or like facility.
(7) All infiltration facilities which service more than one lot and are
considered a common facility shall have an easement provided to
the Township for future access if necessary.
(8) No more than 50% of the required infiltration volume may be
provided in detention basin bottoms. The remaining 50% of
infiltration volumes shall be provided at or near the proposed
impervious coverage.
(a) Developed areas shall provide adequate storage and treatment facilities
necessary to capture and treat stormwater runoff. The infiltration
volume computed under § 25-305 may be a component of the water
quality volume if the applicant chooses to manage both components in a
single facility. If the infiltration volume is less than the water quality
volume, the remaining water quality volume may be captured and
treated by methods other than infiltration BMPs. The required water
quality volume (WQv) is the storage capacity needed to capture and
treat a portion of stormwater runoff from the developed areas of the
site.
To achieve this goal, the following criterion is established:
The following calculation formula is to be used to determine the water
quality storage volume, (WQv), in acre-feet of storage for Amity
Township:
WQv = [(P) (Rv)(A)]/12
WQv = Water Quality Volume (acre-feet)
P = 1 inch
A = Total contributing drainage area to the water quality
BMP (acres)
Rv = 0.05 + 0.009(I) where I is the percent of the area that is
impervious surface ((impervious area/A)*100)

AO:419
§ 25-307. Stream Bank Erosion Requirements. [Ord. No. 243, 3/19/
2008]
In addition to control of the water quality volume, in order to minimize
the impact of stormwater runoff on downstream stream bank erosion, the
primary requirement is to design a BMP to detain the proposed conditions
two-year, twenty-four-hour design storm to the existing conditions oneyear
peak flow using the SCS Type II distribution. Additionally, provisions
shall be made (such as adding a small orifice at the bottom of the outlet
structure) so that the proposed conditions one-year storm takes a minimum
of 24 hours to drain from the facility from a point where the maximum
volume of water from the one-year storm is captured (i.e., the maximum
water surface elevation is achieved in the facility). Release of water can
begin at the start of the storm (i.e., the invert of the water quality orifice is
at the invert of the facility).
The minimum orifice size in the outlet structure to the BMP shall be a three
inch diameter orifice and a trash rack shall be installed to prevent clogging.
This volume requirement can be accomplished by the permanent
volume of a wet basin or the detained volume from other BMPs.
Release of water can begin at the start of the storm (i.e., the invert
of the water quality orifice is at the invert of the facility). The design
of the facility shall provide for protection from clogging and unwanted
sedimentation.
(b) For areas within defined special protection subwatersheds which
include exceptional value (EV) and high quality (HQ) waters, cold water
fishery (CWF) the temperature and quality of water and streams shall
be maintained.
(c) To accomplish the above, the applicant shall use innovative or
traditional stormwater control facilities that are found within the
PADEP State BMP Manual.
(d) If a perennial or intermittent stream passes through the site, the
applicant shall create a stream buffer extending a minimum of 50 feet
to either side of the top-of-bank of the channel. The buffer area shall be
maintained with appropriate native vegetation (Reference to Appendix
H of Pennsylvania Handbook of Best Management Practices for
Developing Area for plant lists). If the applicable rear or side yard
setback is less than 50 feet, the buffer width may be reduced to 25% of
the setback to a minimum of 10 feet. If an existing buffer is legally
prescribed (i.e. deed, covenant, easement, etc.) and it exceeds the
requirements of this chapter, the existing buffer shall be maintained.
This does not include lakes or wetlands.
(e) Evidence of any necessary permit(s) for regulated earth disturbance
activities from the appropriate DEP regional office must be provided to
the Township.
§ 25-306 AMITY CODE § 25-307
AO:420
On sites with small contributing drainage areas to this BMP that do not
provide enough runoff volume to allow a twenty-four-hour attenuation with
the three inch orifice, the calculations shall be submitted showing this
condition. Orifice sizes less than three inches can be utilized provided that
the design will prevent clogging of the intake.
§ 25-308. Stormwater Management Districts. [Ord. No. 243, 3/19/
2008]
(a) Amity Township has been divided into stormwater management
districts as shown on the Stormwater Management Districts Map in
Appendix D.11
In addition to the requirements specified in Table 308.1 below, the
groundwater recharge (§ 25-305), water quality (§ 25-306), and stream
bank erosion control (§ 25-307), requirements shall be implemented.
Standards for managing runoff from each subarea for the two-year
through 100-year design storms are shown in Table 308.1. Development
sites located in each of the districts must control proposed conditions
runoff rates to existing conditions runoff rates for the design storms in
accord with Table 308.1.

AO:421
§ 25-309. Calculation Methodology. [Ord. No. 243, 3/19/2008]
All areas, regardless of the release rate, must still meet the
requirements of the groundwater recharge criteria (§ 25-305), water
quality criteria (§ 25-306), and stream bank erosion criteria (§ 25-307).
(b) General. Proposed condition rates of runoff from any regulated activity
shall not exceed the peak release rates of runoff prior to development
for the design storms specified on the Stormwater Management
Districts Map ( Appendix D) and § 25-308, of this chapter.
(c) District Boundaries. The boundaries of the stormwater management
districts are shown on in the Appendix D. The exact location of the
stormwater management district boundaries as they apply to a given
development site shall be determined by mapping the boundaries using
the two-foot topographic contours (or most accurate data required)
provided as part of the drainage plan.
(d) Sites Located in More Than One District. For a proposed development
site located within two or more stormwater management district
category subareas, the peak discharge rate from any subarea shall
meet the management district criteria for which the discharge is
located, as indicated in § 25-308. The calculated peak discharges shall
apply regardless of whether the grading plan changes the drainage
area by subarea.
(e) Off-Site Areas. Off-site areas that drain through a proposed
development site are not subject to release rate criteria when
determining allowable peak runoff rates. However, on-site drainage
facilities shall be designed to safely convey off-site flows through the
development site.
(f) Site Areas. Where the site area to be impacted by a proposed
development activity differs significantly from the total site area, only
the proposed impact area utilizing stormwater management measures
shall be subject to the management district criteria. In other words,
unimpacted areas bypassing the stormwater management facilities
would not be subject to the management district criteria.
(a) Stormwater runoff from all development sites with a drainage area of
greater than five acres shall be calculated using a generally accepted
calculation technique that is based on the NRCS soil cover complex
method. Table 309-1 summarizes acceptable computation methods and
the method selected by the design professional shall be based on the
individual limitations and suitability of each method for a particular
site. The Township may allow the use of the Rational Method to
estimate peak discharges from drainage areas that contain less than
five acres. The Soil Complex Method shall be used for drainage areas
greater than five acres.

complex method shall use the appropriate design rainfall depths for the
various return period storms according to the region in which they are
located as presented in Table B-1 in Appendix B of this chapter.12 If a
hydrologic computer model such as PSRM or HEC-1 / HEC-HMS is used
§ 25-309 ADOPTING ORDINANCE § 25-309
AO:423
for stormwater runoff calculations, then the duration of rainfall shall be
24 hours. The rainfall distribution should reference to NOAA Atlas 14.
(c) For the purposes of existing conditions flow rate determination,
undeveloped land shall be considered as "meadow" in good condition,
unless the natural ground cover generates a lower curve number or
Rational 'C' value (i.e., forest), as listed in Table B-2 or B-3 in Appendix
B of this chapter.
(d) All calculations using the Rational Method shall use rainfall intensities
consistent with appropriate times-of-concentration for overland flow
and return periods from the NOAA Atlas 14 Precipitation-Frequency
Atlas of the United States (2004, revised 2006). Times-of-concentration
for overland flow shall be calculated using the methodology presented
in Chapter 3 of Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds, NRCS, TR-55
(as amended or replaced from time to time by NRCS). Times-ofconcentration
for channel and pipe flow shall be computed using
Manning's equation. NRCS lag equation divided by 0.6 as acceptable
method for Tc in undeveloped areas.
(e) Runoff Curve Numbers (CN) for both existing and proposed conditions
to be used in the soil cover complex method shall be obtained from
Table B-2 in Appendix B of this chapter.
(f) Runoff coefficients (c) for both existing and proposed conditions for use
in the Rational method shall be obtained from Table B-3 in Appendix B
of this chapter.
(g) Where uniform flow is anticipated, the Manning equation shall be used
for hydraulic computations, and to determine the capacity of open
channels, pipes, and storm sewers. Values for Manning's roughness
coefficient (n) shall be consistent with Table B-4 in Appendix B of this
chapter. Full flow shall be assumed for closed conduits.
(h) Outlet structures for stormwater management facilities shall be
designed to meet the performance standards of this chapter using any
generally accepted hydraulic analysis technique or method.
(i) The design of any stormwater detention facilities intended to meet the
performance standards of this chapter shall be verified by routing the
design storm hydrograph through these facilities using the Storage-
Indication Method. For drainage areas greater than five acres in size,
the design storm hydrograph shall be computed using a calculation
method that produces a full hydrograph (i.e. TR-20, TR-55, HEC-1,
PSRM). The Township may approve the use of any generally accepted
full hydrograph approximation technique that shall use a total runoff
volume that is consistent with the volume from a method that produces
a full hydrograph.

scale developments which, in the judgment of the Planning
Commission, achieve substantially the objectives of these regulations
and which are further protected by such covenants or other legal
provisions as will assure conformity to and achievement of the
subdivision or land development plan.
(e) Land subject to hazards of life, health or property, such as may arise
from fire, floods, disease or other causes, shall not be subdivided or
developed unless such hazards have been eliminated or unless the
subdivision or land development plan shall show adequate safeguards
against them, which shall be approved by the appropriate regulatory
agencies.

proposed internal and existing transportation system. The study
shall describe the external roadway system within 0.5 mile along
the adjacent roadway in both directions from all access points or to
a major intersection along these roadways. Major intersections in
the study area shall be identified and delineated. All future
transportation improvements which are part of proposed roadway
improvements, which are part of proposed surrounding
developments shall be identified and included in the calculations.
(4) Existing traffic conditions shall be measured and documented for
all roadways and intersections within the study area. Existing
traffic volumes for average daily traffic, peak highway hour(s)
traffic, and peak development-generated hours(s) traffic shall be
recorded. Manual traffic counts at major intersections in the study
area shall be conducted, encompassing the peak highway and
development-generated hour(s), and documentation shall be
included within the report. A volume-capacity and delay analysis
based upon existing volumes shall be performed during the peak
highway hour(s) and the peak development-generated hour(s) for
all roadways and major intersections within the study area. Levels
of service shall be determined for each location.
(5) The analysis will determine the adequacy of the existing roadway
system to serve the current and projected traffic demand.
Roadways and/or intersections experiencing levels of Service D, E
or F, as described in Highway Capacity Manual, Special Report
209, as amended, shall be noted as congested locations.
(6) Calculation of vehicular trips to result from the proposed
development shall be completed for the average daily peak
highway hour(s). Vehicular trip generation rates to be used for this
calculation shall be obtained from the Trip Generation Report
(current edition or as amended), published by the Institute of
Transportation Engineers (ITE). These development-generated
traffic volumes shall be provided for the inbound and outbound
traffic movements. These generated volumes shall be distributed to
the study area and assigned to the existing roadways and
intersections through the study area.
(7) All Anticipated Turning Movements shall be Calculated.
Documentation of all assumptions used in the distribution and
§ 27-505 ADOPTING ORDINANCE § 27-505

assignment phase shall be provided. Traffic volumes shall be
assigned to individual access points. Any characteristics of the site
that will cause particular trip generation problems shall be noted.
(8) The total future traffic demand shall be calculated and included
within the study. The total traffic demand shall consist of the
combination of existing traffic expanded to the completion year,
which is estimated to be 5% per year, the proposed use or
development generated traffic, and the traffic generated by other
proposed developments in the study area. A second volume/
capacity and delay analysis shall be conducted using the total
future demand and the future roadway capacity. If staging of the
proposed development is anticipated, calculation for each stage of
completion shall be made. This analysis shall be performed during
the peak highway hour(s) and peak development-generated hour(s)
for all roadways and major intersections within the study area.
Volume-capacity and delay calculations shall be completed for all
major intersections. The procedures described in the Highway
Capacity Manual, Special Report 209, as amended, and as outlined
in the PennDOT Design Manual, Volume 2, or as amended, shall be
followed.
(9) The levels of service for all roadways and intersections shall be
listed. All roadways and/or intersections showing a level of service,
D, E or F and volume/capacity ratios equal to or greater than 1.0
shall be considered deficient. The study shall conclude with a list of
specific recommendations for the elimination of these traffic
problems. This listing of recommended improvements shall
include, but not be limited to, internal circulation design, site
access location and design, external roadway and intersection
design and improvements, traffic signal installation and operation
(including timing), and transit design improvements. All physical
roadway improvements shall be depicted within the study. Signal
timing should be evaluated for any intersection with a level of
service D, E or F, but a volume capacity ratio of less than 1.0.
Warrants for signalization shall be examined for any unsignalized
intersections with levels of service E or F.

the bottom of the well shall be recorded and maintained
constant for the duration of the test.
(iv) The water source pump shall be operated at maximum capacity
and output for the first six hours of the test or until the water
level in the source well reaches a point 20 feet above the water
source pump. The elapsed time and rate of pumping shall be
recorded at 60 minute intervals on a log data sheet.
(v) Draw-down of the source well in feet shall be recorded at 60
minute intervals as well as the water draw-down of any
required peripheral test hole wells* on the log data form.
(vi) Reduce the maximum rate of pumping by 10 gallons per
minute (GPM) and continue pumping for the next two hours of
test or until the water level reaches a point 20 feet above the
water source pump. The elapsed time, rate of pumping and
draw-down of the source well and, where required, the
peripheral test hole wells* shall be recorded on the log data
forms at 60 minute intervals.
(vii) Continue the above procedure using the two hour time periods
or the criteria of water level above the source pump until the
conditions are such that the Dynamic Recovery Rate of the
water source equals the pumping rate (dynamic equilibrium).
The increment of GPM reduction may be increased where on
site pumping data warrants such action. Note: as the Dynamic
Recovery Rate is approached, the increment of GPM reduction
will need to be reduced from 10 GPM to eight GPM to five GPM
to n GPM to zero GPM. At this point, no detectable change in
draw-down will occur. If any change in draw-down is detected,
either plus or minus, dynamic equilibrium has not been
achieved.
(viii) When said Dynamic Recovery Rate is reached, record elapsed
time, pumping rate and draw-down on log data sheet and
continue pumping at this rate for the remainder of the
minimum forty-eight hour test time or a minimum of 24 hours,
whichever is the greater time. Elapsed time, pumping rate and
draw-down of the source well, and where required, the
peripheral test wells*, shall be recorded hourly.
(ix) Measurements of static water level recovery shall be made on
the source well and peripheral test hole wells*, where
§ 27-515 AMITY CODE § 27-515

by the utility or developer for review and analysis.
* Peripheral test hole wells, if existing wells are not available in the
vicinity, may be required in order to determine the area of influence of
the source well and the capacity of the source well aquifer. Peripheral
test hole wells will generally be required in geological areas with slate
and shale formations where existing wells are not available. The test
hole wells shall have a minimum diameter of six inches and shall be
situated 100 feet from the source well, equally distributed along the
periphery.
(18) Where a community water system is to be installed within a
proposed subdivision or land development, the improvement
procedures and requirements set forth within this chapter shall be
followed. Improvements agreements, guarantees, inspections and
guarantee releases shall include consideration of the community
water company in carrying out the procedures and requirements of
this chapter.
(19) Final specifications for the design and installation of the
centralized water system shall be included as part of the
improvements agreement between the developer and the
Township. Final approval of the subdivision or land development
plan shall not take place until such specifications are finalized
within the improvements agreement and until the necessary
improvements and maintenance guarantees are posted.
Engineering review of the specifications for the water system by
the Township Engineer shall take place before signing of the
improvements agreement and before approval of the final
development plan.
(20) A community water supply system may be permitted on a
temporary basis for developments which are to be permanently
serviced by a public water supply system. All agreements between
the developer and the public water supply company for the

to conserve existing healthy plant communities, such as woodlands,
and to require new landscape plantings in critical areas of
developments in order to:
(i) Reduce soil erosion and protect surface water quality by
minimizing stripping of existing woodlands or tree masses.
(ii) Reduce stormwater runoff velocity and volume by providing
planting areas where stormwater can infiltrate.
(iii) Improve air quality by conserving existing or creating new
plantings which produce oxygen and remove carbon dioxide
from the atmosphere.
(iv) Provide animal habitat.
(v) Provide windbreaks, shade and the other microclimate benefits
of trees and landscape plantings.
(vi) Conserve historically, culturally or environmentally important
landscapes, such as, but not limited to, wooded hillsides,
scenic views or aesthetic natural areas, and historic stone
fences.
(vii) Preserve and enhance property values through the
implementation of good landscape architectural standards and
minimize conflicting land uses.
(viii) Provide planted buffers between land developments and
subdivisions which act to visually integrate a development into
the existing landscape.
(ix) Provide planted and architectural visual screens around
visually obtrusive site elements within land developments and
subdivisions.
(x) Enhance the aesthetic appearance of the community and
provide privacy and beauty.
(xi) Improve traffic flow in parking lots by requiring planted
parking islands and medians to separate traffic.
(xii) Conserve energy by moderating solar radiation and providing
shade.
(xiii) Improve the environment for pedestrians along streets,
parking lots and other pedestrian areas.
§ 27-517 AMITY CODE § 27-517

(xiv) Aesthetically improve stormwater management facilities, such
as detention basins, without impairing function.
(3) It is the intent of these regulations to protect the health, safety and
welfare of the community by requiring planting plans for land
developments and subdivisions.
(4) Minor plan submissions, as set forth in § 27-306 of this chapter are
exempt from these regulations.
(b) Landscaping Plan. A landscaping plan for the proposed subdivision or
land development is required. For residential proposals with more than
10 units and nonresidential proposals, the landscaping plan shall
consist of a separate plan sheet(s). For residential proposals of 10 units
or less, the landscaping plan may be included on the grading/utility
plan. Landscaping plans shall contain the following:
(1) Plan scale, date, and North arrow.
(2) Location of all existing and proposed buildings and structures.
(3) Location of all existing and proposed roads, parking areas, service
areas and other paved areas.
(4) Location of all outside storage and trash receptacle areas.
(5) Sidewalks, berms, fences, walls, freestanding signs and site
lighting.
(6) Existing and proposed underground and aboveground utilities,
such as site lighting, transformers, hydrants, manholes, valve
boxes, etc. (Reference may be made to other submission drawings).

determine the relationship of planting and grading. Areas with
steep slopes as defined in the Zoning Ordinance shall be
highlighted on the plan.
(8) The location of existing mature trees, woodland and tree masses to
remain and demarcated as such.
(9) The location of existing mature trees, woodland and tree masses to
be removed and demarcated as such.
(10) The location of all proposed landscaping, including required street
trees, stormwater basin landscaping, parking lot landscaping,
property line buffer screens and site element screens.
(11) The location of floodplains, wetlands and other natural features
that may affect the location of proposed streets, buildings and
landscape plantings.

proposed for each category.
(14) Planting details, including the method of protecting existing
vegetation and landscape planting methods.
(15) For residential developments with 50 or more dwelling units and
non-residential developments in which the cumulative gross floor
area exceeds 40,000 square feet, the landscaping plan must be
prepared and certified by a professional landscape architect.
(c) Preservation and protection of existing vegetation.
(1) Preservation of Existing Vegetation. Each mature tree or tree mass
on the site to be developed or subdivided shall be designated "TO
REMAIN" or "TO BE REMOVED" in accordance with the following
criteria:
(i) Subdivisions and land developments shall be laid out in such a
manner as to minimize the removal of healthy trees and shrubs
on the site. Special consideration shall be given to major
specimen trees.
(ii) It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to prove that
vegetation removal is minimized. If required by the township,
the applicant shall produce written documents or plans
certified by a registered landscape architect or other qualified
professional demonstrating that no alternative layouts are
possible and that no alternative clearing or grading plan would
reduce the loss of mature trees, tree masses and woodlands.
(iii) A mature tree or tree mass shall be considered "TO REMAIN"
only if it meets all of the following criteria:
a) The outermost branches of the tree(s) are at least 10 feet
from any proposed buildings, structures, paving, parking
or utilities (overhead or underground).
b) The outermost branches of the tree(s) are at least 10 feet
from any proposed changes in grade or drainage, such as
excavations, mounding or impoundments.
c) The tree(s) are clear of any proposed sight triangles and
do not, by their location or apparent health, pose any
undue threat to the health, safety and welfare of the
community.
(2) For each tree to be preserved, a tree protection zone shall extend a
distance from the tree trunk equal to 12 times the trunk diameter.
Thus, a twenty inch DBH tree would have a circular tree protection
zone 20 feet in radius. Within the tree protection zone, no
disturbance, material stockpiling, foot or vehicle traffic shall be
permitted. Prior to the start of construction, the tree protection

orange construction fencing or other fencing deemed suitable by
the Township.
(3) Hydrology. Alteration of existing drainage patterns and water
supply for the protected vegetation shall be minimized.
(d) Parking Lot Landscaping.
(1) Parking lots shall be effectively landscaped with trees and shrubs
to reduce the visual impact of glare, headlights, parking lot lights;
to delineate driving lanes and define rows of parking; to provide
shade in order to reduce the amount of reflected heat; and to
improve the aesthetics of parking lots. Parking lot landscaping
shall not create sight distance constraints which cause unsafe
conditions.
(2) All parking lots with 10 or more parking stalls shall be landscaped
according to the following regulations:
(i) Off-street parking areas shall be separated from external
streets by a 20 feet wide curbed planting strip.

planting strips into smaller parking areas of no more than 20
stalls.
(iv) In nonresidential developments, parking lots shall be divided
by planting strips into smaller parking areas of no more than
60 stalls. There shall be no more than two consecutive rows of
parking spaces, regardless of the number of spaces in the row,
without the installation of a planting strip as herein defined.
(v) Planting islands shall be a minimum of nine feet by 18 feet in
area, underlain by soil (not base course material); mounded at
no more than a four to one slope, nor less than a twelve to one
slope, and shall be protected by curbing. Each planting island
shall contain one shade tree plus shrubs and/or ground cover
(i.e., mulch, decorative stone or similar material) to cover the
entire area.
(vi) All planting strips shall be a minimum of eight feet wide. Strips
shall run the length of the parking row, underlain by soil,
mounded at no more than four to one slope, nor less than a
twelve to one slope, and shall be protected by curbs. Planting
strips shall contain plantings of street-type shade trees at
intervals of 30 feet to 40 feet plus shrubs and/or ground cover
(i.e., mulch, decorative stone or similar material) to cover the
entire area at maturity.

trees shall be retained in lieu of street trees.
(3) Street trees shall be located between the ultimate right-of-way line
and the building setback line and shall meet the following
standards:
(i) Trees shall be planted a minimum distance of six feet and a
maximum distance of 15 feet outside the ultimate right-of-way
line. The Board of Supervisors, however, may permit trees to
be planted within the ultimate right-of-way under the following
circumstances:
a) In areas, such as existing villages, where front yards may
be located within the ultimate right-of-way.
b) Where closely spaced rows of street trees may be
desirable and future street widening is considered
unlikely.
(ii) In nonresidential developments, trees shall be located within a
planting bed within the front yard setback, at least 10 feet in
width, planted in grass or ground cover.
(iii) Trees shall be located so as not to interfere with the
installation and maintenance of sidewalks and utilities. Trees
shall be planted a minimum distance of six feet from curbs and
sidewalks, 15 feet from overhead utilities and six feet from
underground utilities.
(iv) Trees shall be planted at a ratio of at least one tree per 30
linear feet of frontage or fraction thereof. Trees shall be

grass or naturalized plantings specifically suited for stormwater
basins. (See the Plant Material List, for recommended plants for
stormwater basins.)
(i) Lawn grass areas shall be sodded or hydroseeded to minimize
erosion during the establishment period and, once established,
these areas shall be maintained at a height of not more than six
inches.
(ii) Naturalized cover plantings, such as wildflowers, meadows
and nonaggressive grasses specifically designed for the
permanently wet, intermittently wet and usually dry areas of
stormwater basins may be planted as an alternative to lawn
grass, provided that:
a) The plantings provide continuous cover to all areas of the
basin.
b) The plantings do not interfere in the safe and efficient
function of the basin as determined by the Township
Engineer.
(iii) Trees and shrubs shall be allowed in and around stormwater
basins, provided that they do not interfere with the proper
function of the basin and no trees are planted on or within 30
feet of an impoundment structure or dam.

amended by Ord. No. 153, 6/3/1996; and by Ord. No. 249, 10/1/
2008]
(a) During the review phase of a subdivision or land development plan, the
Township will consider the adequacy of the existing or proposed
community facilities to serve the proposed development.
(b) The developer shall give earnest consideration to the desirability of
providing or reserving areas for community facilities normally required
in residential neighborhoods, including educational facilities, utility
services, emergency management facilities and recreational facilities.
(c) Areas provided or reserved for community facilities should be adequate
to provide adequate land area for any proposed buildings and off-street
parking. Such areas should be located in an area of the development
which is accessible to the general public.
(a) Park and Recreation Purposes. Pursuant to the procedures and
requirements of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code (Act
247), as amended, the Board of Supervisors have prepared and enacted
a Park and Recreation Plan. This particular plan has been developed for
the following purposes:
(1) To guide, control and regulate growth and development into the
21st century.
(2) To examine existing parks, recreational facilities and open space in
light of current and projected demands.
(3) To establish the future need for parks, open space and recreation
areas and facilities.
(4) To establish priorities for immediate and long-range acquisition,
development and improvement of parks and recreation facilities.
(5) To analyze the administration and management of facilities and
services to determine the level of efficiency and recommend
improvements.
(6) To examine funding options in order to acquire, develop, construct
and/or maintain recreation facilities and open space.
(7) To implement the established goals, objectives and policies
identified within the Township Comprehensive Plan of 1990, as
amended.
(b) General Provisions.
(1) All applicants, excepting only those seeking approval of a
subdivision which would consist of three or less single-family
residential units, shall, concurrent with the submission of a final
plan of subdivision or land development, offer for dedication a
§ 27-518 ADOPTING ORDINANCE § 27-519
AO:577
portion of the land being subdivided or developed, as hereinafter
set forth, as public recreation area.
(2) Such public recreation area shall provide adequate open space and
recreation land and facilities accessible to such subdivisions or
developments.
(3) Such recreation area shall not be part of any lot, but it shall be
dedicated to the Township or, in the sole discretion of the Board of
Supervisors, to a public trust or association, which will perpetually
maintain the property for the purposes intended for full access and
use by the general public constituting the residents, constituents
and invitees of the Township, the documentation for which shall be
submitted to and be subject to the approval of the Board of
Supervisors and, in the case of a public trust or association, if
authorized in the sole discretion of the Board of Supervisors, shall
provide that said real estate is to be used and occupied exclusively
as park and recreation area, is not to be the subject of further
subdivision or land development, that the document establishing
title to the same shall contain language that said real estate is not
subject to further subdivision or land development as a condition
running with title to the land and that the public trust or
association shall bear all responsibility for ownership and
maintenance of said real estate and shall maintain the same in a
manner open to the general public constituting the constituents,
residents and invitees of the Township.
(4) All areas dedicated under the provisions of this section shall be
consistent with the specific goals, objectives, plans and
recommendations of the Township Comprehensive Plan and the
Township Parks and Recreation Plan and are to be in accordance
with the definite principles and standards contained in this chapter.
(5) In lieu of land dedicated for recreation purposes, a fee may be paid,
as hereinafter set forth.
(6) The amount and location of land to be dedicated or the fees to be
paid shall bear a reasonable relationship to the use of the park and
recreation facilities by future residents, occupants, employees or
visitors to the subdivisions or land developments.
(c) Standards for Land Dedication.
(1) Any land dedicated to the Township shall be used only for park,
recreation or open space purposes and shall be available to all
residents of the Township, subject to such regulations and rules as
may be recommended by the Township Parks and Recreation Board
and/or adopted by the Board of Supervisors.
(2) The land to be dedicated shall have size, dimensions, topography,
access and general character suitable for its proposed recreational
use, as determined by the Board of Supervisors, in conjunction with
§ 27-519 AMITY CODE § 27-519
AO:578
the Township Park and Recreation Board and the Township
Planning Commission. Any land not suitable for active or passive
recreation shall not be accepted as dedicated land, this includes
areas within storm water basins that could not be used for
recreation.
(3) Consideration shall be given to preserving natural features,
including rocks and rock outcrops, large trees and tree stands,
watercourses, historic structures and areas, and other community
assets that would enhance the value and aesthetic qualities of the
development.
(4) The land shall be easily and safely accessible from all residential or
occupied areas within the development or the general area to be
served, and it shall have road frontage or, subject to the discretion
of the Board of Supervisors, suitable access, ingress and egress
from a public roadway for maintenance purposes.
(5) The land shall be contiguous and regular in shape, where possible
and practical.
(6) The Board of Supervisors may, at its discretion, require that land to
be dedicated be located along a property boundary so that such
land may be combined with dedicated land or other recreation
areas that are or will be adjacent to the land to be dedicated.
(7) The land shall be located on soils suitable for use and development
as a recreation area.
(8) No more than 25% of the land shall have a slope in excess of 7%.
(9) No more than 25% of the land shall be within floodplain, hydric soil
overlay or wetland areas.
(10) The land shall be easily accessible to all necessary utilities.
(11) The land shall be designed and developed for its intended park or
recreation use in accordance with the recommendations for such as
contained in the National Recreation and Park Association's
Recreation Park and Open Space Standards and Guidelines, 1983,
as amended.
(12) A minimum of 0.038 acre of land shall be offered for dedication for
each residential lot, dwelling unit or combination thereof,
excluding only those subdivisions comprised of three or fewer
tracts or parcels of real estate for single-family detached
residential development and which have not been the subject of
prior subdivisions or land development submissions consisting in
total of three or fewer tracts or parcels of real estate; a minimum of
0.006 acre of land shall be offered for dedication for each 1,000
square feet of building, structure or improvement proposed for any

AO:579
acre of land shall be offered for dedication for each 1,000 square
feet of building, structure or improvement proposed for any
agricultural land development plan. [Amended by Ord. No. 298,
1/17/2017]
(13)No contiguous area of land shall be considered for dedication if it is
less than 0.5 acre, and in no event shall the area proposed for
dedication be less than 50 feet in width; and the Board of
Supervisors shall have the discretion not to approve or accept any
area of land if it determines that the contiguous area of the same is
insufficient to adequately serve as or provide park and recreation
area.
(14) When land is dedicated, acceptance by the Township shall be by
means of a signed resolution and a signed deed of dedication
executed by the property owner, to which a property description of
the dedicated area shall be attached. Subject to the submission of
documentation to the Board of Supervisors for its approval, a fee
simple warranty deed conveying the property shall be delivered to
the Township with title free and clear of all liens, encumbrances
and conditions, other than public utility easements.
(d) Standards for Fees in Lieu of Land Dedication.
(1) Subject to the discretion of the Board of Supervisors, payment of a
fee in lieu of land dedication shall be required (i) where land
dedication would result in open space or recreation areas too small
to be usable, (ii) if the Township Comprehensive Plan or the
Township Parks and Recreation Plan recommends recreation land
be provided elsewhere, or (iii) if a suitable site for recreation
cannot be located within the development.
(2) The applicant shall tender to the Township prior to or concurrent
with final plan approval a fee in lieu of dedication, calculated in an
amount as set forth in a resolution adopted by the Board of
Supervisors, as amended from time to time, specifically identifying
this section of this chapter, or in proportionate rate for any portion
thereof, as hereinbefore required to be dedicated with regard to
each such subdivision or land development. [Amended by Ord.
No. 298, 1/17/2017]
(3) All fees paid in lieu of land dedication shall be used only for (i) the
acquisition of land for parks, recreation areas and facilities, and
open space, (ii) the construction of improvements on such land, and
(iii) costs incidental to such purposes, including but not limited to
planning, engineering, design, administrative and legal fees, utility
relocation or installation, construction of sewage or water facilities,
vehicular and pedestrian access, signage and the purchase of park
equipment.
§ 27-519 AMITY CODE § 27-519
AO:580
(4) All fees paid to the Township shall be deposited in a separate
interest-bearing account established for such fees, the records for
which shall clearly identify the specific recreational facilities for
which such fees have been received. Interest earned on such fees
shall become funds of that account and be subject to distribution or
expenditure for any and all costs and expenses as hereinbefore
identified. Funds from such accounts shall be expended only in
properly allocable portions of the costs incurred to acquire,
construct or improve the specific recreation facilities for which the
funds were collected.
(5) If the Township fails to use the collected fees in accordance with
this section within three years of the date such fees were paid, the
applicant may submit a written request, on such forms as are
established by the Township, for the refund of such fees, plus
interest that accumulated thereon from the date of fee payment,
which request shall be reviewed and acted upon by the Board of
Supervisors within 45 days of the date of receipt.
(e) Combination of Land Dedication and Fees in Lieu of Land Dedication.
(1) The Township may accept a combination of land dedication and
fees in lieu of land in order to meet the requirements and standards
of the Township Park and Recreation Plan. Such combination shall
be subject to the review and approval of the Board of Supervisors.
(2) The resulting combination of land and fees shall not exceed the
total acreage to be developed or the acreage which constitutes the
basis of calculating the fee in lieu of dedication required by this
chapter.
(f) Decision of Land Dedication vs. Fees in Lieu of Land Dedication.
(1) The Board of Supervisors shall determine whether land dedication
or fees in lieu of land dedication shall be required. Such decision
shall be made as early in the plan review process as possible but
not later than concurrent with the preliminary plan approval.
(2) The Board of Supervisors shall, in reaching its decision, consider
the following factors, in addition to any other factors that may be
applicable to a particular plan:
(i) If the land in that location serves a valid public purpose.
(ii) If there is a need to make a reasonable addition to an existing
park or recreation area.
(iii) If the land meets the objectives and requirements of this
section.
(iv) If the area surrounding the proposed development has
sufficient existing parks, recreation areas or facilities, or open

No. 294, 6/15/2016]
space, and if pedestrians or bicycles can safely reach these
areas.
(v) Any relevant policies of the Township regarding parks,
recreation areas and facilities, and open space, including those
within the Township Comprehensive Plan and the Township
Park and Recreation Plan.
(vi) Any recommendations regarding such land that has been
received from the Township and/or the County Planning
Commission, the Township Parks and Recreation Board, the
Township Engineer and/or the Daniel Boone School District.
(a) Purpose.
(1) To require and set minimum standards for outdoor lighting for new
subdivisions and land developments to:
(i) Provide lighting in outdoor public places where public health,
safety and welfare are potential concerns.
(ii) Protect drivers and pedestrian from the glare of non-vehicular
light sources that shine into their eyes and thereby impair safe
traverse.
(iii) Protect neighbors and the night sky from nuisance glare and
stray light from poorly aimed, placed, applied, maintained or
shielded light sources.
(b) Applicability.
(1) Outdoor lighting shall be required for new subdivisions and land
developments for safety and personal security in areas of public
assembly and traverse; including but not limited to the following:
residential developments, commercial, industrial, publicrecreational,
and institutional uses.
(2) The Board of Supervisors may require lighting be incorporated for
other uses or locations, as they deem necessary.
(3) The glare-control requirements herein contained apply to lighting
in all above mentioned uses as well as, but not limited to
architectural, landscaping, and residential lighting.
(c) Illumination Levels. Lighting, where required by this chapter, shall have
intensities and uniformity ratios in accordance with the following:
§ 27-519 AMITY CODE § 27-520
AO:582
Use/Task
Maintained

Building entrances 5.0 Avg. 
Notes:
- Illumination levels are maintained horizontal footcandles on the
task, e.g., pavement or area surface.
- Uniformity ratios dictate that average illuminance values shall not
exceed minimum values by more than the product of the minimum
value and the specified ratio. E.g., for commercial parking high
activity, the average footcandles shall not be in excess of 3.6 [0.9 x
4].
(d) Lighting Fixture Design.
(1) Fixtures shall be of a type and design appropriate to the lighting
application and aesthetically acceptable to the Board of
Supervisors.
§ 27-520 ADOPTING ORDINANCE § 27-520
AO:583
(2) For lighting horizontal tasks such as roadways, pathways and
parking areas, fixtures shall meet IESNA "full cutoff" criteria (not
have more than 2.5% of their light output emitted above 90° at any
lateral angle around the fixture.
(3) The use of floodlighting, spotlighting, wall-mounted fixtures,
decorative globes and other fixtures not meeting IESNA "full
cutoff" criteria shall be permitted only with the approval of the
Board of Supervisors, based upon acceptable glare control.
(4) Fixtures shall be equipped with or be capable of being back-fitted
with light directing devices such as shields, visors or hoods when
necessary to redirect offending light distribution.
(5) Control of Nuisance and Disabling Glare.
(i) All outdoor lighting required by this chapter; on private,
residential, commercial, industrial, municipal, recreational or
institutional property; shall be aimed, located, designed, fitted
and maintained so as not to present a hazard to drivers or
pedestrians by impairing their ability to safely traverse, i.e.,
disabling glare, and so as not to create a nuisance by
projecting or reflecting objectionable light onto a neighboring
use or property, i.e., nuisance glare.
(ii) Floodlights and spotlights shall be so installed or aimed that
they do not project their output into the windows of
neighboring residences, adjacent uses, directly skyward or
onto a roadway.
(iii) Vegetation screens shall not be employed to serve as the
primary means for controlling glare. Rather, glare control shall
be achieved primarily through the use of such means as cutoff
fixtures, shields and baffles and appropriate application of
fixture mounting height, wattage, aiming angle and fixture
placement.
(iv) The intensity of illumination projected onto any property from
another property shall not exceed 0.1 vertical footcandle,
measured at 30 inches above the ground at the property line.
(v) Fixtures meeting IESNA "full cutoff" criteria shall not be
mounted in excess of 24 feet above grade. Fixtures not meeting
IESNA "full cutoff" criteria shall not be mounted in excess of 16
feet above grade except as specifically approved by the Board
of Supervisors.
(vi) Fixtures used for architectural lighting, e.g., facade, fountain,
feature and landscape lighting, shall be aimed so as not to
project their output beyond the objects intended to be
illuminated.
§ 27-520 AMITY CODE § 27-520
AO:584
(6) Installation.
(i) Electrical feeds for lighting standards shall be run
underground, not overhead.
(ii) Lighting standards in parking areas shall be placed a minimum
of five feet outside paved area, or on concrete foundations at
least 30 inches high above the pavement, or suitably protected
by other approved means.
(7) Maintenance.
(i) Lighting fixtures and ancillary equipment shall be maintained
so as to always meet the requirements of this chapter.
(e) Residential Development Street Lighting.
(1) Street lights shall be provided at all street intersections within a
proposed subdivision or land development. The Township may
require additional street lights in order to provide safe and
convenient vehicular and/or pedestrian circulation.
(2) Electrical installations of all street lights shall be in accordance
with prevailing regulations and specifications established by First
Energy, or its successors or wholly owned subsidiaries. Provided
however, all street lights to be dedicated to Amity Township shall
be equipped with LED type light fixtures with the correlated color
temperature of the light to be determined by the Board of
Supervisors. Furthermore, all underground wiring required for
street light installation and operation must be placed in conduit. It
shall be the responsibility of the contractor or his agent to have
final construction inspected by an electrical inspection agency and
a written report attesting this fact submitted to First Energy, or its
successors or wholly owned subsidiaries, there by allowing the
utility to provide pole illumination.
(f) Recreational Facilities Lighting. The nighttime illumination of outdoor
recreational facilities for such aerial sports as baseball, basketball,
soccer, tennis, track and field, and football typically necessitate higher
than normally allowed luminaire mounting heights and aiming angles,
utilize very high-wattage lamps and potentially produce unacceptable
levels of light trespass and glare when located near residential
properties. Permission to illuminate such facilities shall be granted only
when the Township is satisfied that the health, safety and welfare rights
of nearby property owners and the municipality as a whole have been
properly protected. When recreational uses are specifically permitted
by the Township for operation during hours of darkness the following
requirements shall apply:
(1) Recreational facilities for basketball, baseball, football, soccer,
miniature golf, tennis or track shall not be illuminated if located
within 500 feet of a residence.
§ 27-520 ADOPTING ORDINANCE § 27-520
AO:585
(2) Maximum mounting heights for recreational lighting shall be in
accordance with the following:
(i) Basketball: 20 feet.
(ii) Football: 70 feet.
(iii) Soccer: 70 feet.
(iv) Lacrosse: 70 feet.
(v) Baseball.
Little League, softball: 60 feet.
Regulation field (90 feet base paths): 70 feet.
(vi) Miniature Golf: 20 feet.
(vii) Swimming Pool Aprons: 20 feet.
(viii) Tennis: 30 feet.
(3) To assist the Municipality in determining whether the potential
impacts of proposed lighting have been suitably managed,
applications for illuminating recreational facilities shall be
accompanied not only with information required under Subsection
(g) below but also by a visual impact place that contains the
following:
(i) Plan view containing a layout of the recreational facility and
showing pole locations and the location of residences or
adjoining properties.
(ii) Elevations containing pole and luminaire mounting heights,
horizontal and vertical aiming angles and luminaire arrays for
each pole location.
(iii) Elevations containing initial vertical illuminance plots at the
boundary site, taken at a height of five feet line-of-sight.
(iv) Elevations containing initial vertical illuminance plots on the
windowed facades of all residences facing and adjacent to the
recreational facility. Such plots shall demonstrate compliance
with the light trespass and glare control requirements of this
chapter.
(v) A narrative describing the measure proposed to achieve
minimum off-site-disturbance.
(g) Plan Submission.
(1) Lighting plans shall be submitted to the municipality for review and
approval and shall include:
§ 27-520 AMITY CODE § 27-520
AO:586
(i) Layout of the proposed fixture locations.
(ii) Isofootcandle plots for individual fixture installations and tenfoot
by ten-foot illuminance-grid plots for multi-fixture
installations, that demonstrate compliance with the intensities
and uniformities set forth in the chapter.
(iii) Description of the equipment, including fixture catalog cuts,
photometrics, glare reduction devices, lamps, control devices,
mounting heights and mounting methods proposed.
(iv) When requested by the Board of Supervisors, the applicant
shall submit a visual impact plan that demonstrates
appropriate steps have been taken to mitigate on-site and offsite
glare.
(v) Post-approval alterations to lighting plans or intended
substitutions for approved lighting equipment shall be
submitted to the Township for review and approval.
(h) Post Installation Inspection.
(1) The Township reserves the right to conduct a post-installation
nighttime inspection to verify compliance with the requirements of
this chapter, and if appropriate, to require remedial action at no
expense to the Township.
(i) Compliance Monitoring.
(1) Safety Hazards.
(i) If Township judges a lighting installation creates a safety or
personal-security hazard, the person(s) responsible for the
lighting shall be notified and required to take remedial action.
(ii) If appropriate corrective action has not been effected within 30
days of notification, the Township may levy a fine for as long as
the hazard continues to exist.
(2) Nuisance Glare and Inadequate Illumination Levels.
(i) When the Township judges an installation produces
unacceptable levels of nuisance glare, skyward light, excessive
or insufficient illumination levels or otherwise varies from this
chapter, the Township may cause notification of the person(s)
responsible for the lighting and require appropriate remedial
action.
(ii) If the infraction so warrants, the Township may act to have the
problem corrected as in (h)(1) above.
(j) Street Lighting Dedication.

date of the resolution or contingent approval. The Board of
§ 27-601 ADOPTING ORDINANCE § 27-601
AO:591
Supervisors may, at its discretion, grant a written extension which
shall be placed in writing at the request of the applicant.
(c) Acceptable Security. In addition to cash deposits and escrow accounts,
federal or commonwealth chartered lending institution irrevocable
letters of credit extending for a term of one year beyond completion of

purposes of securing the completion of the required improvements.
Such financial security shall be posted with the Township by a bonding
company or federal or commonwealth chartered lending institution
chosen by the applicant, provided such bonding company or lending
institution is authorized to conduct business within the Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania. Such bond, or other security, shall provide for, and
secure to the public the completion of any improvements which may be
required on or before the date fixed in the formal action of approval or
accompanying agreement for completion of the improvements.
(d) Amount of Security.
(1) The amount of financial security to be posted for the completion of

completion estimated as of 90 days following the date scheduled for
completion by the applicant, and all administrative and engineering
inspections, fees, costs and expenses.

annual basis by comparing the actual cost of the improvements
which have been completed and the estimated cost for completion
of the remaining improvements as of the expiration of the 90th day
after either the original date scheduled for completion or a
rescheduled date of completion. Subsequent to said adjustment,

Engineer, may refuse to accept such estimate for good cause
shown. If the applicant or applicants and the Township are not able
to agree upon an estimate, then the estimate shall be recalculated

the Commonwealth and chosen mutually by the Township and the

thereof beyond the first anniversary date from posting of financial
security or to an amount not exceeding 110% of the cost of completion
and inspection of the required improvements as reestablished on or
about the expiration of the preceding one-year period by using the
procedure described above.

a period of years, the Township may at its discretion authorize approval
of final plans by sections, stages or phases of development with the
understanding that no sale of lots and no work within the areas
reserved from development may commence until the required contracts
are signed and the financial security posted with respect to those areas
reserved from development. The Township shall also have the right to
impose additional requirements and conditions in connection with the
phases as they are approved so as to assure that each section or phase
will not be dependent for access or other improvement or common
amenity upon completion of improvements in the subsequent phase or
stage.
(g) Releases of Escrow. As the work of installing the required
improvements proceeds, the party posting the financial security may
request the Board of Supervisors to release or authorize the release,
from time to time, of such portions of the financial security. Any such
request shall be in writing addressed to the Board of Supervisors and
the Board of Supervisors shall have 45 days from receipt of such
request within which the Township Engineer shall certify, in writing, to
the Township whether such portion of the improvements has been
completed in accordance with the approved plan and applicable
specifications. Upon certification of completion, the Township shall
authorize release by the bonding company or lending institution of an
amount as estimated by the Township Engineer fairly representing the
value of the improvements completed or, if the Township fails to act
within said forty-five-day period, the Township shall be deemed to have
approved the release of funds as requested.

improvements in the subdivision or land development and may institute

date of this Part, each employer shall deduct the tax from compensation
payable to the taxpayer, file a return on a form prescribed by the Tax
Collector and pay to such Tax Collector the amount of taxes deducted
on a quarterly basis as follows: April 30, July 30, October 30 and

§ 29-404 AMITY CODE § 29-407
AO:618
the taxpayer, for the first payroll period after employment, a lump sum
equal to the amount of tax that was not withheld from the taxpayer, plus
the per payroll amount due for that first payroll period. The amount of
tax withheld per payroll period for the remaining payroll periods in that
calendar year shall be the same amount withheld for other employees.
In the event the employment of a taxpayer subject to withholding of the
tax under this Part is subsequently severed in that calendar year, the
taxpayer shall be liable for any outstanding balance of tax due and the
Township may pursue collection under this Part and the Act.

of the tax imposed hereby either directly or by collection though
employers, the employer shall not deduct that pro-rata share of the tax
but the employer shall withhold from the taxpayer, for the first payroll
period, a lump sum equal to the amount of tax that was not withheld
from the taxpayer to equal the necessary amount due from that
taxpayer to date to equal what all other employees have paid, plus the
per payroll amount due for that first payroll period. The amount of tax
withheld per payroll period for the remaining payroll periods in that
calendar year shall be the same amount withheld for other employees.
(e) If a taxpayer who claimed an exemption for a given calendar year from
the tax levied under this Part becomes subject to the tax for the
calendar year under this Part, the employer shall withhold the tax for
the remainder of that calendar year. The employer shall withhold from
the taxpayer, for the first payroll period after receipt of the notification,
a lump sum equal to the amount of tax that was not withheld from the
taxpayer due to the exemption claimed by the taxpayer, plus the per
payroll amount due for that first payroll period. The amount of tax
withheld per payroll period for the remaining payroll periods in that
calendar year shall be the same amount withheld for other employees.
(f) Any employer who discontinues business or ceases operation before
December 31 of any year during which this tax is in effect, shall file the
return hereinabove required and pay the tax to the Tax Collector, within
15 days after discontinuing business or ceasing operations.
(g) The failure of any employer to deduct the tax as required in this section
shall not relieve the taxpayer from the duty to file a return and pay the
tax. Any employer who fails to deduct the tax as required by this
section, or who fails to pay such tax to the Tax Collector, shall be liable
for such tax in full, without deduction of the commission hereinafter
provided, as though the tax had originally been levied against such
employer.
(h) Each employer may deduct and retain a commission equal to 2% of the
total amount of tax collected through the employer pursuant to this
section.

OVERLAY DISTRICTS
§ 32-501. Statement of Intent. [Ord. No. 130, 12/9/1991; as
amended by Ord. No. 192, 9/16/2002; and by Ord. No. 275, 10/5/
2011]
§ 32-502. Floodplain Overlay District. [Ord. No. 130, 12/9/1991; by
Ord. No. 164, 4/26/1999]
(a) Environmental Protection Overlay Districts. As established through the
goals, objectives and policies of the Amity Township Comprehensive
Plan, it is essential to acknowledge environmental protection and open
space preservation. It is therefore an objective of this chapter to
incorporate the "Environmental Protection Overlay Concept" to
implement this goal.
The Environmental Protection Overlay Districts incorporated under
this Part include provisions to supplement and enhance the existing
underlying District Regulations for land areas which may encounter
certain physical limitations for development. To implement and achieve
the goals and objectives established for preserving environmentally
sensitive areas, the overlay concept has been divided into the following
individual overlay districts:
Floodplain Overlay District
Hydric Soil Overlay District
High Water Table Overlay District
Steep Slope Overlay District
Wetland Overlay District
The Environmental Protection Overlay Districts are an overlay concept
which supplements but does not replace the existing underlying
Zoning District Regulations. In cases where Environmental Protection
Overlay Districts overlap, the more restrictive standards and
specifications shall apply.
(b) Route 422 Overlay District. The intent of this Overlay District is to:
(1) Encourage the unified development of large parcels along the
Route 422/Benjamin Franklin Highway corridor.
(2) Provide development flexibility and respond to market demands.
(3) Create tax base development and job opportunities.
(4) Provide opportunities for commercial and residential development
sufficient to meet the needs not only the local, but also of the
regional market.

AO:691
§ 32-503. Hydric Soil Overlay District. [Ord. No. 130, 12/9/1991; as
amended by Ord. No. 192, 9/16/2002]
(a) The purpose of the Floodplain Overlay District shall be an overlay to the
underlying zoning districts as illustrated on the Official Zoning Map of
the Township. As such, these provisions regulating floodplain
management shall be a supplement to the underlying zoning district
provisions.
(b) The purpose of establishing provisions for floodplain management is to
promote and protect the general health, welfare and safety of the
community, encourage the utilization of appropriate construction
practices, minimize potential hazards to public health, and reduce
financial burdens imposed on the community and government.
(c) The Amity Township Floodplain Ordinance (see Chapter 10 of the
Township Code of Ordinances) has been adopted by the Board of
Supervisors on December 1, 1997. The purpose, intent, application
procedures, administrative controls, identification of all floodplain
areas, technical provisions, permitted land uses, activities requiring
special exceptions, existing or nonconforming provisions, variance
procedures, technical definitions and enactment are comprehensively
outlined under said Amity Township Floodplain Ordinance (see Chapter
10 of the Township Code of Ordinances).
(d) For the purposes of this chapter, all activities within the floodplain shall
conform with the provisions and requirements outlined under the Amity
Township Floodplain Ordinance (see Chapter 10 of the Township Code
of Ordinances).
(a) Purpose.
(1) The areas subject to hydric soils within the Township shall be an
overlay to the existing underlying district as illustrated on the
Official Zoning Map. As such, these provisions regulating hydric
soils shall be a supplement to the underlying district provisions.
Where conflicts arise between provisions or regulations of this
chapter, the more restrictive provisions shall apply.
(2) The purpose of establishing provisions for areas which may
encounter hydric soils is to promote and protect the general health,
welfare and safety of the community; secure environmentally
sensitive lands; encourage the utilization of appropriate
construction practices; and to minimize hazards to public health.
(b) Designation of Hydric Soil Areas.
(1) The U.S. Department of Agriculture in cooperation with the
National Technical Committee for Hydric Soils has defined a
"hydric soil" as follows:
§ 32-502 AMITY CODE § 32-503
AO:692
A hydric soil is a soil that is saturated, flooded or ponded long
enough during the growing season to develop anaerobic conditions
in the upper part.
(2) The hydric soils which have been identified, described and
delineated within the Township by the U.S. Department of
Agriculture in conjunction with the Pennsylvania State University
and Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture in the Soil Survey of
Berks County include, but are not limited to the following:
Baile Silt (Ba)
Baile Stony Silt (Bd)
Bowmansville Silt (Bo)
Burgin Silt (Bu)
Croton Silt (CrA)
Croton Silt (CrB2)
(3) It is the intention of this chapter, that in cases where the Hydric
Soil Overlay District overlaps the Floodplain Overlay District, the
policies, restrictions, guidelines and standards of the Floodplain
Overlay District (§ 32- 502) shall preside.
(4) Development within areas with hydric soils shall be subject to
§ 32-506 (Wetland Overlay District) of this chapter.
(c) Uses Permitted by Conditional Use.
(1) Public and private recreation uses, including parks (except
amusement parks), playgrounds, picnic grounds, golf courses,
driving ranges, archery ranges, target ranges, horse riding trails,
hiking trails, camping, boating, fishing and hunting subject to
§ 32-906 of this chapter and Agricultural (General) subject to
§ 32-905(a) of this chapter. Notwithstanding § 32-906(c) hereof,
recreation uses involving impervious cover, permanent structures,
or regrading are permitted only when there is no practical
alternative, as determined by the Board of Supervisors.
(d) Boundary Disputes and Appeals Procedures.
(1) Should a dispute arise concerning the boundaries of those areas
subject to hydric soil overlay controls, an initial determination of
the boundaries shall be made by the Zoning Officer and/or the
Township Engineer utilizing the criteria listed under § 32-503(b)
(Designation of Hydric Soil Areas) of this chapter.
(2) Any person aggrieved by this decision may appeal to the Zoning
Hearing Board as specified in this chapter.
(3) The burden of proof shall be on the person appealing the decision
of the Zoning Officer and/or the Township Engineer.

§ 32-504. High Water Table Overlay District. [Ord. No. 130, 12/9/
1991; as amended by Ord. No. 192, 9/16/2002]
(4) If it is determined by the Zoning Hearing Board that the resources
which have established the Hydric Soil Overlay District are
inaccurate regarding the land in question, and that the area should
not be subject to the hydric soil controls established under this
section, the Zoning Officer and/or the Township Engineer shall be
notified in writing that the hydric soil controls will not apply to the
land in question.
(5) All boundary changes which are approved shall be made on the
map of the areas subject to hydric soil controls which is prepared
by the Board of Supervisors.
(a) Purpose.
(1) The High Water Table District shall be an overlay to the existing
underlying zoning district as illustrated on the Official Zoning Map.
As such, these provisions regulating high water table management
shall be a supplement to the underlying district provisions. Where
conflicts arise between provisions or regulations of this chapter,
the more restrictive provisions shall apply.
(2) The purpose of establishing provisions for areas which may
encounter a high water table is to promote and protect the general
health, welfare and safety of the community; secure
environmentally sensitive lands; encourage the utilization of
appropriate construction practices; and to minimize hazards to
public health.
(b) Designation of High Water Table Areas.
(1) The High Water Table Overlay District shall include all areas
subject to inundation of soils which are characteristic and
categorized as being alluvial and/or as high water table soils by the
Soil Survey of Berks County, Pennsylvania prepared by the United
States Department of Agriculture (Soil Conservation Service) in
cooperation with the Pennsylvania State University and
Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture.
(2) Alluvial soils are defined as soils which have been formed in
alluvium and deposited in the past by stream or flooding conditions.
The presence of these soils is a reliable indication that heavy runoff
conditions will probably create flooding in the future.
(3) High water table soils are defined as surface soils which are within
three feet of the seasonable high water table as described and
identified by the United States Department of Agriculture in the
Soil Survey of Berks County.
§ 32-503 AMITY CODE § 32-504
AO:694
(4) The alluvial and high water table soils which have been identified,
described and delineated within the Township by the U.S.
Department of Agriculture in conjunction with the Pennsylvania
State University and Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture in the

* Denotes that the soils group is considered a hydric soil and
is subject to the provisions identified under §§ 32-503 and
32-942.
(5) It is the intention of this chapter, that in cases where the High
Water Table Overlay District overlaps the Floodplain Overlay
District (§ 32-502) and/or the Hydric Soil Overlay District
(§ 32-503), the policies, guidelines and standards of the more
restrictive District shall preside.
(c) Uses Permitted by Right. The following uses and activities are
permitted by right in the High Water Table Overlay District provided
they are in compliance with the provisions of the underlying district and
are not prohibited by any other Township Ordinance:
(1) General agriculture uses, subject to § 32-905(a) of this chapter.

(5) All boundary changes which are approved shall be made on the
map of the areas subject to slope controls which is prepared by the
Board of Supervisors.
(a) Purpose.
(1) The areas subject to wetlands within the Township shall be an
overlay to the existing underlying district. As such, these provisions
regulating wetlands shall be a supplement to the underlying
district provisions. Where conflicts arise between provisions or
regulations of this chapter, the more restrictive provisions shall
apply.
(2) The purpose of establishing provisions for areas which may
encounter wetlands is to promote and protect the general health,
welfare and safety of the community; secure environmentally
sensitive lands; encourage the utilization of appropriate

amended by Ord. No. 281, 12/5/2012]
(1) The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in conjunction with the United
States Environmental Protection Agency have defined the term
"wetlands" as follows:
"Those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or
groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support,
and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of
vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions.
Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs and similar
areas."
The three major characteristics of wetlands include vegetation, soil
and hydrology.
(2) All land designated as "wetlands" within the Township are subject
to restrictions and/or permits by the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection and the United States Army Corps of
Engineers.
(3) For all subdivision and land development applications, the
Township Engineer shall determine whether a wetlands delineation
will be required by a qualified professional. Any subdivision or land
development on a property with surface water and/or hydric soils
shall require a wetlands delineation. Delineated wetlands shall be
accompanied by a technical report and data forms.
(4) For all zoning districts, a 10 feet buffer zone shall be applied to all

or phasing may change without approval by the Board of
Supervisors provided that the modified overall flex plan meets all
requirements of this Overlay District and any conditions imposed
during the final approval process. All plan revisions are subject to
review by Township staff prior to the re-recording of the plan. To
the extent the plan shall be re-recorded, it shall be submitted to the
Board of Supervisors for approval and signature.
(4) Where the subsequent division of a parcel, or part thereof, into lots
is required to facilitate ownership, financing or for phasing
purposes, the lots shall be exempt from provisions of the Township
Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance and this Overly
District with respect to frontage, setback, coverage, area of parcel,
open space and fee requirements, provided said requirements are
met on the overall flex plan, and further provided that a
development in this Overlay Zone provides documentation
satisfactory to the Township staff and Township Solicitor assuring
the appropriate covenants are recorded against the affected
parcels requiring all parcels to be operated and maintained in good
order and repair, in a clean and sanitary condition, uniform with the
appearance and maintenance of the approved complex and
providing appropriate covenants from for driveways, access ways

adjacent building, landscaping and the streetscape. Consideration
should be given to size and height relationships with adjacent
buildings, working in conjunction with building sizes, architectural
design and materials with national or regional marketing concepts
of, or for, individual users. Building facades facing streets or on-site
parking areas shall be treated consistently within these guidelines.
(3) All signs shall be consistent with the overall design concept for the
development and be appropriate to the type of activity to which
they pertain.
(4) Architectural Features.
(i) At least 60% of any building face which faces a street or on-site
parking area, shall contain one of the following materials:
wood; brick or brick face; stone or stone veneer; split-face or
textured-surface concrete masonry unit (CMU); stucco or
synthetic stucco; or glass. Alternative materials proposed by
the developer may be permitted if approved by the Board of
Supervisors. LEED certified buildings are highly encouraged.
(ii) Architectural features shall be provided above the roof line
when necessary to conceal mechanical equipment from view
from any streets or on-site parking area.
(iii) The overall architectural concept for a development shall be

space, nor vest in the public any rights to use the same.
(8) Before the expiration of said year, the Township shall, upon its
initiative or upon the request of the organization theretofore
responsible for the maintenance of the common open space, call a
public hearing upon notice to such organization, or to the residents
of the PRD, and shall show cause why such maintenance by the
Township shall not, at the option of the Township, continue for the
succeeding year. If the Board of Supervisors, or its designated
agency, shall determine that such organization is ready and able to
maintain said common open space in reasonable condition, the
Township shall cease to maintain said common open space at the
end of said year. If the Board of Supervisors, or its designated
agency, shall determine that such organization is not ready and
able to maintain said common open space in a reasonable
condition, the Township may, in its discretion, continue to maintain
said common open space during the next succeeding year and,

approval, for a section thereof. Said application shall be made to
the Township within the time or times specified by the official
written communication granting tentative approval. The
application shall include any drawings, specifications, covenants,
easements, performance bond or such other requirements as may
be specified by ordinance, as well as any conditions set forth in the
official written communication at the time of tentative approval. A
public hearing on an application for final approval of the
development plan, or part thereof, shall not be required provided
the development plan, or the part thereof, submitted for final
approval, is in compliance with the development plan theretofore
given tentative approval and with any specified conditions attached
thereto.
(2) In the event the application for final approval has been filed,
together with all drawings, specifications and other documents in
support thereof, and as required by this chapter and the official
written communication of tentative approval, the Township shall
§ 32-706 ADOPTING ORDINANCE § 32-706

grant such final approval to the PRD, as required by the Act, as
amended.
(3) In the event the development plan as submitted contains variations
from the development plan given tentative approval, the governing
body may refuse to grant final approval and shall, within the time
frame specified by the Act, as amended, so advise the landowner in
writing of said refusal setting forth in said notice the reasons why
one or more of said variations are not in the public interest.
In the event of such refusal, the landowner may either:
(i) Refile his application for final approval without the variations
objected to; or
(ii) File a written request with the approving body that it hold a
public hearing on his application for final approval.
If the landowner wishes to take either such alternate action he may
do so at any time within which he shall be entitled to apply for final
approval, or within 30 additional days if the time for applying for final
approval shall have already passed at the time when the landowner
was advised that the development plan was not in substantial
compliance. In the event the landowner shall fail to take either of
these alternate actions within said time, he shall be deemed to have
abandoned the development plan. Any such public hearing shall be
held pursuant to public notice within 30 days after request for the
hearing is made by the landowner, and the hearing shall be conducted
in the manner prescribed in this Part for public hearings on
applications for tentative approval. Within 30 days after the conclusion
of the hearing, the approving body shall by official written
communication either grant final approval to the development plan
or deny final approval. The grant or denial of final approval of the
development plan shall, in cases arising under this section, be in the
form and contain the findings required for an application for tentative
approval set forth in this chapter.
(4) A development plan, or any part thereof, which has been given final
approval shall be so certified without delay by the approving body
and shall be filed of record forthwith in the Office of the Recorder of
Deeds before the development shall take place in accordance
therewith. Upon the filing of record of the development plan the
zoning and subdivision regulations otherwise applicable to the land
included in such plan shall cease to apply thereto. Pending
completion in accordance with the time provisions specified, of said
PRD or of that part thereof, as the case may be, that has been
finally approved, no modification of the provisions of said
development plan, or part thereof, as finally approved, shall be
made except with the consent of the landowner. Upon approval of a
final plan, the developer shall record the plan and post financial
security (contracts and agreements) in accordance with the
§ 32-706 AMITY CODE § 32-706

§ 32-707. Administration and Review. [Ord. No. 130, 12/9/1991]
Township Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance (see
Chapter 27 of the Township Code of Ordinances).
(5) In the event that a development plan, or a section thereof, is given
final approval and thereafter the landowner shall abandon such
plan or the section thereof that has been finally approved, and shall
not notify the approving body in writing; or in the event the
landowner shall fail to commence and carry out the PRD in
accordance with the time provisions specified (after final approval
has been granted), no development or further development shall
take place on the property included in the development plan until
after the said property is reclassified by enactment of an
amendment to this chapter in the manner prescribed for such
amendments.
(a) Issuance of permits and all matters pertaining to administration of the
plan as finally approved shall be the responsibility of the Township
Zoning Officer.
(b) Upon application of the landowner showing compliance with the
requirements of final approval, the Zoning Officer shall issue permits
for construction pursuant to the plan, or any section thereof.
(c) The provisions of Part 11 (Administration and Enforcement) of this
chapter shall be fully applicable to the plan as finally approved insofar
as the provisions thereof are consistent with the provisions of this Part
and the conditions of final approval. The Zoning Officer shall review the
progress and status of construction of the plan and render monthly
reports thereon to the Board in order to assure compliance with the
provisions of this Part and the conditions of final approval.
(d) A PRD shall be designed in accordance with the design standards and
regulations of Part 7 and the Township Subdivision and Land
Development Ordinance (see Chapter 27 of the Township Code of
Ordinances) unless a waiver is granted or there is a conflict between
them. In the case of a conflict, Part 7 of this chapter shall govern.
(e) Any person, partnership or corporation who or which has violated the
PRD provisions and specifications under Part 7 of this chapter shall be
subject to all enforcement remedies in accordance with the Act, as

older and life-style changes that encourage aging in place.
(2) The need to provide for such developments consistent with the
Township's planning goals.
(3) The need to recognize that the reduced impact on Traffic, Township
Services and School Districts associated with Commercial
Retirement Communities can justify different development
standards as compared to typical residential development.
(4) The need to encourage flexible site design which respects the
needs of our aging population and the Township's natural features.
(5) The need to encourage the creation of individual neighborhoods.
(b) Commercial Retirement Community Qualifications.

(c) Lot, Yard, and Bulk Regulations. In case of each lot or tract of land
developed for an Age Restricted Housing development, the following
area and height regulations shall apply:
(1) Lot/tract area. The total gross tract area for a development in the
Age Restricted Housing development shall be not less than 20
acres.
(2) Density. Density of dwelling units shall not exceed six units per acre
in the MDR Zoning District and four units per acre in the LDR
Zoning District. In the computation of density, the number of units
shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number. Compliance
with the standards in this chapter does not guarantee that the
maximum number of dwelling units will be achievable in all cases.
The applicant's ability to develop the maximum number may be
reduced as a result of the applicant's choices of dwelling types,
building and/or lot sizes, physical constraints of the development
site, or other factors. The area of the tract used to calculate the
allowable density shall not include lands within existing street
rights of way existing utility easements or lands within the
Environmental Protection Overlay District.
(3) Impervious surface coverage. A maximum impervious surface
coverage of 60% of the total lot or tract area shall be permitted.

individual building areas or lots into which the larger development
may be subdivided. The areas which are not impervious shall be
improved with lawn or other suitable ground covers and other
landscaping.

development built pursuant to this subsection. However, in cases where
lots are not utilized the distances between units and road rights-of-way
(or equivalent rights-of-way in the case of private roads) shall be the
same as if lot lines are provided. However, along lot lines on which any
form of zero-lot line single-family detached dwelling unit is coincident,

certificate of use and occupancy will be issued for the family
member suite.
(6) The owner of the property shall be required to renew the zoning
permit every two years for the continued use by the submission of
an application to the Township. Such renewal shall be conditioned
upon the owner proving that a family member continues to reside
within the family member suite.
(7) The certificate of use for the zoning permit for a family member
suite shall expire six months after the use of the property as a
family member suite is discontinued.
(8) One additional off-street parking space must exist or be created in

imposed by this chapter, except that a principal building which
existed at the effective date of this amendment which is
nonconforming as to a yard requirement may have repairs,
improvements, modifications and/or additions made to those
portions of the building located within the required yard. All such
repairs, improvements, modifications and/or additions shall not

which shall take into consideration, among other things, the intent of
the provisions for the district.
(c) Discontinuance. Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in
or on which a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use shall

AO:853
§ 32-1105. Functions of the Zoning Hearing Board. [Ord. No. 130,
12/9/1991]
The Zoning Hearing Board shall have the functions authorized in the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, as amended. The jurisdiction of
the Zoning Hearing Board and the Township Board of Supervisors, and the
procedures to be followed by each, shall be as established in said Code.
(d) Procedures for Application. The Zoning Hearing Board shall act in strict
accordance with the procedures specified by the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code, as amended, and as it may be amended,
and by this chapter. All appeals and applications made to the Zoning
Hearing Board shall be in writing, on forms prescribed by the Zoning
Hearing Board. Every appeal or application shall refer to the specific
provision of this chapter involved and shall exactly set forth the
interpretation that is claimed, the grounds for any challenges to validity
of this chapter, the use for which a special permit is sought, or the
details of the variance that is applied for and the grounds on which it is
claimed that the variance should be granted, as the case may be. In all
cases, the Zoning Hearing Board shall request the Board of Supervisors
and the Township Planning Commission to review and comment on the
application prior to rendering a decision.
(a) Variances. The Zoning Hearing Board shall hear requests for variances
where it is alleged that the provisions of this chapter inflict unnecessary
hardship upon the applicant. In granting any variance the Zoning
Hearing Board may attach such reasonable conditions and safeguards
as it may deem necessary to implement the purposes of this chapter and
the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, as amended. The
Zoning Hearing Board may, by rule, prescribe the form of application
and may require preliminary application to the Zoning Officer. In all
cases, the Zoning Hearing Board shall request the Board of Supervisors
and the Planning Commission to review and comment on the
application prior to rendering a decision. The Zoning Hearing Board
may grant a variance provided that all the following findings are made
where relevant in a given case:
(1) That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity, narrowness or shallowness of lot size or
shape, or exceptional topographical or other physical conditions
peculiar to the particular property, and that the unnecessary
hardship is due to such condition, and not circumstances or
conditions generally created by the provisions of this chapter in the
neighborhood or district in which the property is located;
(2) That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is
no possibility that the property can be developed in strict
conformity with the provisions of this chapter and that the
authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to enable the
reasonable use of the property;
§ 32-1104 AMITY CODE § 32-1105
AO:854
(3) That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
appellant;
(4) That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is
located, nor substantially or permanently impair the appropriate
use or development of adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the
public welfare;
(5) That the variance as granted by the Zoning Hearing Board is the
minimum variance that will afford relief and will represent the least
modification possible of the regulation in issue.
(6) The approval of a variance if authorized by the Zoning Hearing
Board, which anticipates construction or modification of a
structure, creation of new or revised lot lines or dimensional
standards for a property or structure situated thereon, shall be
valid and remain in effect for a term of one year from the date of
said approval and shall thereafter expire and be void, unless said
construction, modification, new or revised lot lines or dimensional
standards or change of use or occupancy be initiated within said
one year term or said term is expressly extended as part of the
initial approval. In the event that the activity anticipated by the
variance should not be initiated within one year of the approval or
such additional term as may be expressed in the approval, or
should the activity which is the subject of the variance be
discontinued, the premises or structure or structure situated
thereon shall not thereafter be used except in conformity with the
regulations of the district in which it is located.
(b) Special Exceptions. The Zoning Hearing Board shall hear and decide,
upon application, only such special exceptions which the Zoning
Hearing Board by the provisions of this chapter is specifically
authorized to issue. The granting of a special exception when
specifically authorized by the terms of this chapter shall be subject to
the following standards and criteria. The applicant for a special
exception shall demonstrate, as a condition to approval of his
application, compliance with these criteria and those criteria specified
elsewhere in this chapter for the use in question. In all cases, the
Zoning Hearing Board shall request the Board of Supervisors and the
Planning Commission to review and comment on the application prior
to rendering a decision.
(1) Such use shall be one which is specifically authorized as a special
exception use in the zoning district wherein the applicant seeks a
special exception.
(2) Such special exception shall only be granted subject to any
applicable condition and safeguards as required by this chapter.
(3) Such use shall not adversely affect the character of the general
neighborhood, nor the conservation of property values, nor the
§ 32-1105 ADOPTING ORDINANCE § 32-1105
AO:855
§ 32-1106. Hearing Procedures. [Ord. No. 130, 12/9/1991; as
amended by Ord. No. 259, 10/7/2009]
health and safety of residents or workers on adjacent properties
and in the general neighborhood.
(4) Such use shall be of such size and so located and laid out in relation
to its access streets that vehicular and pedestrian traffic to and
from such use will not create undue congestion or hazards
prejudicial to the general neighborhood.
(5) Services and utilities shall be made available to adequately service
the proposed use by the applicant.
(6) The granting of the special exception shall be consistent with the
Township Comprehensive Plan.
(7) The approval of a special exception, if authorized by the Zoning
Hearing Board, which anticipates construction or modification of a
structure, creation of new or revised lot lines or dimensional
standards for a property or structure situated thereon, shall be
valid and remain in effect for a term of one year from the date of
said approval and shall thereafter expire and be void, unless said
construction, modification, new or revised lot lines or dimensional
standards or change of use or occupancy be initiated within said
one year term or said term is expressly extended as part of the
initial approval. In the event that the activity anticipated by the
special exception should not be initiated within one year of the
approval or such additional term as may be expressed in the
approval or should the activity which is the subject of the special
exception be discontinued, the premises or structure or structure
situated thereon shall not thereafter be used except in conformity
with the regulations of the district in which it is located.
In granting a special exception, the Board may attach such
reasonable conditions and safeguards, in addition to those
expressed in this chapter, as it may deem necessary to implement
the purposes of this chapter and the Pennsylvania Municipalities
Planning Code, as amended.
(a) Public notice, as defined by law, and written notice shall be given to the
public, the applicant, adjoining property owners of the applicant
property (which includes property owners across the street from the
applicant property), the zoning officer, such other persons as the
Township Board of Supervisors shall designate by ordinance and to any
person who has made timely request for the same. Written notices shall
be given at such time and in such manner as shall be prescribed by
ordinance or, in the absence of ordinance provision, by rules of the
Board. In addition to the written notice provided herein, notice of said
hearing shall be conspicuously posted on the affected tract of land at
least one week prior to the hearing.

Township, may, prior to the decision of the hearing, waive decision or
findings by the Board and accept the decision or findings of the hearing
officer as final.
(e) In all cases, the parties to the hearing shall be the Township, any person
affected by the application who has made timely appearance of record
before the Board, and any other person, including civic or community

power to require that all persons who wish to be considered parties
enter appearances in writing on forms provided by the Board for that
purpose.
(f) The chairman or acting chairman of the Board or the hearing officer
presiding shall have the power to administer oaths and issue subpoenas
to compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of relevant
documents and papers, including witnesses and documents requested
by the parties.
(g) The parties shall have the right to be represented by counsel. All such
representation shall be confirmed on the record and all statements
presented on behalf of said party shall be binding for the purposes of
administration and enforcement. All parties shall be afforded the
opportunity to respond and present evidence and argument and cross
examine adverse witnesses on all relevant issues.
(h) Formal rules of evidence shall not apply, but irrelevant, immaterial or
unduly repetitious evidence may be excluded.
(i) The Board or the hearing officer, as the case may be, shall keep a
stenographic record of the proceedings. The appearance fee for a

requesting the original transcript shall bear the cost thereof.

§ 32-1107. Amendments. [Ord. No. 130, 12/9/1991]

written decision or, when no decision is called for, make written
findings on the application within 45 days after the last hearing before
the Board or the hearing officer. Where the application is contested or
denied, each decision shall be accompanied by findings of fact and
conclusions based thereon together with the reasons therefor.
Conclusions based on any provisions of this act or of any ordinance, rule
or regulation shall contain a reference to the provision relied on and the
reasons why the conclusion is deemed appropriate in the light of the
facts found. If the hearing is conducted by a hearing officer, and there

within 45 days and the parties shall be entitled to make written
representations thereon to the Board prior to the final decision or entry

days after the report of the hearing officer. Where the Board fails to
render the decision within the period required by this subsection, or

applicant's request for a hearing, the decision shall be deemed to have
been rendered in favor of the applicant unless the applicant has agreed
in writing or on record to an extension of time. When a decision has
been rendered in favor of the applicant because of the failure of the
Board to meet or render a decision as hereinabove provided, the Board

it could have met to render a decision in the same manner as provided
in Subsection (a) of this section. If the Board shall fail to provide such

not later than the day following its date. To all other persons who have
