Where Constrained Lands overlap, use the more restrictive Constraint Type 

2. 
Unless a smaller ratio is approved by the Board of Supervisors as a conditional use. 


52 
B. 	Step 2: Calculate the Adjusted Tract Area (ATA). Calculation of the adjusted tract area is required in order to determine areas best suited for development. In order to determine the ATA, the following general formula shall be used: 
ATA = TTA – ACL, where TTA = Total Tract Area and ACL = Adjusted Constrained Lands (in acres). 
C. 	Step 3: Calculate the maximum permitted dwelling units (PDU). The PDU shall be determined using the density factor (DF) provided for Design Options 1 through 3 below. To calculate the PDU, the following general formula shall be used: 
PDU =DF X ATA. 
D. 	Step 4. Calculate the minimum required open space (ROS). The ROS shall be determined using the open space multiplier provided for Design Options 1 through 3 below. To calculate the ROS, the following general formula shall be used:

Maximum Density:  One dwelling unit per 10 acres  
Density Factor:  0.1  
Minimum Lot Size:  5 Acres  
Minimum Front Yard:  100 feet from centerline of right-of-way of existing roads;  

64 

50 feet from right-of-way of new streets, lanes, or common driveways  
Minimum Rear Yard:  Principal buildings: 50 feet Accessory buildings: 15 feet  
Minimum Side Yard:  25 feet  
Maximum Impervious Surface:  6% for Total Tract Area based on a minimum 10 acre gross density per principal dwelling unit

Maximum Height:  30 feet, except for agricultural uses such as barns and silos, which may exceed 30 feet, provided that for every 1 foot over 30 feet, 2 additional feet of setback from every lot line shall be provided  

A. 	Step 1: Calculate the Adjusted Constrained Lands (ACL). Calculation of the area of Adjusted Constrained Lands defines the acres unsuited for development and shall be utilized to determine the Adjusted Tract Area. 
The following multipliers shall be applied to Constrained Lands when calculating the ACL: 
Constraint Type  Percentage of Land to be Deducted  Multiplier  
1.  Floodplains  100%  1.00  
2.  Floodplain Soils (see Section 802.2)  100%  1.00  
3.  Streams  100%  1.00  
4.  Lakes or ponds  100%  1.00  
5.  Wetlands  100%  1.00  
6.  Limestone Geology (see Section 802.12)  90% or 40%  0.90 or 0.40  
7.  Steep Slopes (15%-25%)  80%  0.80  
8.  Steep Slopes (25% or more)  90%  0.90  
9.  Woodlands  66%2  0.66  
10.  Agricultural Soil  80%  0.80  
11.  Pond Shore  80%  0.80  
12.  Lake Shore  80%  0.80  

1. 
Where Constrained Lands overlap, use the more restrictive Constraint Type 

2. 
Unless a smaller ratio is approved by the Board of Supervisors as a conditional use. 


65 
The general formula for calculation of an individual Constraint Type is as follows: ACRES OF CONSTRAINT TYPE X MULTIPLIER = ACL 
The sum of all calculated individual Constraint Types yields the total ACL. If any portion of the tract is underlain by more than one natural feature subject to a multiplier as shown in the above table, the acreage shall be subject to the most restrictive (greatest) multiplier. 
B. 	Step 2: Calculate the Adjusted Tract Area (ATA). In order to determine the ATA, the following general formula shall be used: 
ATA = TTA – ACL where TTA = Total Tract Area and ACL = Adjusted Constrained Lands (in acres). 
C. 	Step 3: Calculate the maximum Permitted Dwelling Units (PDU). The PDU shall be determined using the Density Factor (DF) provided for each Design Options 2 through 4 below. To calculate the PDU, the following general formula shall be used: 
PDU = DF X ATA 
D. 	Step 4: Calculate the minimum Required Open Space (ROS). The ROS shall be determined using the Open Space Multiplier provided for Design Options 2 through 4 below. To calculate the ROS, the following general formula shall be used: 
ROS = ATA X OPEN SPACE MULTIPLIER

3. 	
Site Capacity Determination, Design Options 2 through 4. 


Maximum Density:  One dwelling unit per 10 acres  
Density Factor:  0.1  
Minimum Lot Size:  5 acres  
Minimum Lot Width:  One hundred thirty (130) feet  
Minimum Front Yard:  100 feet from centerline of right-of-way of existing roads; 50 feet from right-of-way of new streets, lanes, or common driveways  

70 

Minimum Rear Yard:  Principal buildings: 50 feet Accessory buildings: 15 feet  
Minimum Side Yard:  25 feet  
Maximum Impervious Surface:  6% for Total Tract Area based on a minimum 10 acre gross density per principal dwelling unit  

Permitted Dwelling Units Formula:  PDU = 0.1 X TOTAL TRACT AREA  
Maximum Height:  30 feet, except for agricultural uses such as barns and silos, which may exceed 30 feet, provided that for every 1 foot over 30 feet, 2 additional feet of setback from every lot line shall be provided  

The following formulae shall be utilized to determine the maximum permitted lots for Design Options 2 through 4. The applicable dimensional standard requirements set forth in §322.4, 5, and 6, below, will provide the necessary data to perform the required computations. 
A. 	Step 1: Calculate the Adjusted Constrained Lands (ACL). Calculation of the area of Adjusted Constrained Lands defines the acres unsuited for development and shall be utilized to determine the Adjusted Tract Area. 
The following multipliers shall be applied to Constrained Lands when calculating the ACL: 
Constraint Type  Percentage of Constrained Land to be Deducted  Multiplier  
1.  Floodplains  100%  1.00  
2.  Floodplain Soils (see Section 802.2)  100%  1.00  
3.  Streams  100%  1.00  
4.  Lakes or ponds  100%  1.00  
5.  Wetlands  100%  1.00  
6.  Limestone Geology (see Section 802.12)  90% or 40%  0.90 or 0.40  
7.  Steep Slopes (15%-25%)  80%  0.80  
8.  Steep Slopes (25% or more)  90%  0.90  
9.  Woodlands  66%2  0.66  
10.  Agricultural Soil  80%  0.80  
11.  Pond Shore  80%  0.80  
12.  Lake Shore  80%  0.80  

1. 
Where Constrained Lands overlap, use the more restrictive Constraint Type 

2. 
Unless a smaller ratio is approved by the Board of Supervisors as a conditional use. 


71 
The general formula for calculation of an individual Constraint Type is as follows: 
ACRES OF CONSTRAINT TYPE X MULTIPLIER = ACL. 
The sum of all calculated individual Constraint Types yields the total ACL. 
If any portion of the tract is underlain by more than one natural feature subject to a multiplier as shown in the above table, the acreage shall be subject to the most restrictive (greatest) multiplier. 
B. 	Step 2: Calculate the Adjusted Tract Area (ATA). Calculation of the Adjusted Tract Area is required in order to determine areas best suited for development. In order to determine the ATA, the following general formula shall be used: 
ATA = TTA – ACL, where TTA = Total Tract Area and ACL = Adjusted Constrained Lands (in acres). 
C. 	Step 3: Calculate the maximum Permitted Dwelling Units (PDU). The PDU shall be determined using the Density Factor (DF) provided for each Design Options 2 through 4 below. To calculate the PDU, the following general formula shall be used: 

PDU =DF X ATA. 
D. 	Step 4: Calculate the minimum Required Open Space (ROS). The ROS shall be determined using the Open Space Multiplier provided for Design Options 2 through 4 below. To calculate the ROS, the following general formula shall be used: 
ROS = ATA X OPEN SPACE MULTIPLIER

1. 	Purpose and Legislative Intent. 
A. 	It is hereby declared a matter of legislative declaration and belief that the morals of minors of West Sadsbury Township are threatened by the presence of adult entertainment establishments as said term is hereinafter defined. These establishments, and the type and character of the merchandise, paraphernalia and services sold in them, create an atmosphere of enticement for minors of West Sadsbury Township that is increased by the lascivious and suggestive advertising often employed to promote the availability of these products and services. It is the intent of the Board of Supervisors to minimize the exposure of these establishments. 
B. 	It is the firm belief of the legislative body that is has a vital duty and role to protect the moral fiber and standards of its residents, in particular the minors of the community. 
C. 	The location of adult entertainment establishments is of vital concern to society with regard to their location near areas where minors may learn, play, pass by, or would be exposed to the advertising, window displays, or the general atmosphere encompassing their operation. The legislative body finds that adult entertainment establishments, because of their very nature, are recognized as having objectionable operational characteristics, particularly when several of them are concentrated under certain circumstances, thereby having a deleterious effect upon adjacent areas. Special regulation of these businesses is necessary to insure that these adverse effects will not contribute to the blighting or downgrading of the surrounding neighborhoods. One of the purposes of this regulation is to prevent the concentration or clustering of these establishments in any one area. 
D. 	Further, these regulations are enacted to promote, protect and facilitate the public health, safety, morals and general welfare of all residents of West Sadsbury Township. 
2. 	Definitions. It is the purpose of this Subsection (2), together with its subparagraphs, to provide clear and concise definitions of those words, terms, and phrases most commonly utilized in the provisions of these regulations in order to assist in the interpretation of said provisions and to insure uniformity of application. It is intended that the following words, terms and phrases, whenever used, shall be construed as defined in the following subsections and subparagraphs unless from the context a different meaning is clearly intended.

§812.1  Intent 
The intent of this Part 8B of Chapter 27 is to: 
A. Promote the general health, welfare, and safety of the community. 
B. Encourage the utilization of appropriate construction practices in order to prevent or minimize flood damage in the future. 
C. Minimize danger to public health by protecting water supply and natural drainage. 
D. Reduce financial burdens imposed on the community, its governmental units, and its residents, by preventing excessive development in areas subject to flooding. 
E. Comply with federal and state floodplain management requirements. 
§812.2  Applicability 
It shall be unlawful for any person, partnership, business or corporation to undertake, or cause to be undertaken, any construction or development anywhere within the Identified Floodplain Area of the Township of West Sadsbury unless a Permit has been obtained from the Floodplain Administrator. 

§812.3.  Abrogation and Greater Restrictions 
This Chapter 27 supersedes any other conflicting provisions which may be in effect in Flood Hazard Districts. However, any other ordinance provisions shall remain in full force and effect to the extent that those provisions are more restrictive. If there is any conflict between any of the provisions of this Chapter 27, the more restrictive shall apply. 

§812.4.  Severability 
If any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause, or phrase of this Part 8B of Chapter 27 shall be declared invalid for any reason whatsoever, such a decision shall not affect the remaining

2. 
AE Area without floodway shall be those areas identified as an AE zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base flood elevations have been 


135 

provided but no floodway has been determined. 
3. 
No permit shall be granted within any AE Zone, no encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, or other development shall be permitted unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed development together with all other existing and anticipated development, would not result in an increase in flood levels within the subject property and would not result in any increase in flood levels on upstream, downstream and nearby properties not owned by the applicant  during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 

4. 
No new construction or development shall be located within the area measured fifty (50) feet landward from the top-of-bank of any watercourse, unless the appropriate permit is obtained from the Department of Environmental Protection Regional Office and West Sadsbury Township. 


C. The A Area/District shall be those areas identified as an A Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no base flood elevations have been provided. For these areas, elevation and floodway information from other Federal, State, or other acceptable sources shall be used when available. Where other acceptable information is not available, the base flood elevation shall be determined by using the elevation of a point on the boundary of the Flood Hazard District which is nearest the construction site. 
In lieu of the above, the municipality may require the applicant to determine the elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering techniques. Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by professional engineers or others of demonstrated qualifications, who shall certify that the technical methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. Studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by the municipality.

§818.4 Standards for Review 
A. 	In any instance where the Zoning Hearing Board is required to consider a request for a use by special exception or a variance from the provisions of this Part 8B of Chapter 27, in addition to any other criteria the Board shall, in considering whether the proposed use would be injurious to the public health, safety, and welfare, consider the following factors: 
1. 
The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or velocities caused by encroachments.  No special exception or variance shall be granted for any encroachments including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other development in any floodway unless a technical evaluation demonstrated that the encroachment will not result in any increase in the base flood elevation. 

2. 
The danger that materials may be swept on to other lands downstream to the injury of others. 

3. 
The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability of these systems to avoid causing disease, contamination, and unsanitary conditions. 

4. 
The susceptibility of the proposed use to flood damage and the effect of such damage to the owner. 

5. 
The importance of the proposed use to the community.

The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for the area. 

10. 
The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles. 

11. 
The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the flood water expected at the site. 


12. Such other factors which are relevant to the purpose of this Part 8B of Chapter 
27. 

§818.5 Conditions of Special Exception or Variance 
A. Upon consideration of the purpose of this Part 8B of Chapter 27, the Zoning Hearing Board may attach such conditions to the granting of a special exception or a variance as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this Part 8B of Chapter 27. 
1. In reviewing any request for a variance, the Township shall consider, at a minimum, that there is good and sufficient cause and that failure to grant a variance would result in an exceptional hardship to the applicant. In any case where the Board shall grant a variance to permit the erection of a structure in the Flood Hazard District and it shall appear that such premises is to be offered for sale or lease, or shall grant a variance to permit a change in nonconforming use of a structure already existing in the District and it shall appear that the premises is to be offered for sale or lease, the Zoning Hearing Board shall, for the protection of prospective purchasers or lessees impose the following conditions: 
a. 
Require the applicant to advise prospective purchasers and/or lessees that the lot is located either entirely or partially, as the case may be, in the Flood Hazard District. 

b. 
Require that before settlement or change in nonconforming use, as the case may be, may take place, the purchaser or lessee shall signify in writing that he has been advised that the premises lies partially or entirely in the Flood Hazard District and a signed copy of such signification shall be delivered to the Township. 

c. 
Where the premises is to be conveyed, the deed shall contain the following provisions: "This lot is entirely (partially) within the Flood Hazard District as defined by the West Sadsbury Township Floodplain Regulations Ordinance, Chester County, Pennsylvania". 


151 

2. When a variance or special exception is granted the Zoning Hearing Board shall notify the applicant in writing that the issuance of the variance and/or special exception to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance and such construction below the base flood level increases risk to life and property. Failure to give notice will not affect in any manner the validity of the Zoning Hearing Board decision. 
3. The notification as listed in 818.A.2 above shall be maintained with a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and such action shall be reported to theFEMAintheTownship’s biennial report. [Seesection813.3I.]

PART 8F 
WOODLAND AND TREE PRESERVATION 


AND REGULATIONS FOR TIMBER HARVESTING AND TREE CLEARING 
§870. Purpose and Applicability. 
1. 	Purpose. The purpose of this Ordinance is to preserve existing trees, tree clusters, and their associated vegetation layers, noteworthy trees, and other vegetation while providing for the reasonable and responsible practice of timber harvesting, as permitted by the Municipalities Planning Code (Act 247 of 1968, as amended). In addition, West Sadsbury Township recognizes the importance of and encourages the use and preservation of native, non-invasive species of vegetation. This Ordinance establishes standards for vegetation preservation and timber harvesting including, but not limited to: 
A. 	Maintaining air quality; 
B. 	Reducing soil erosion and stream sedimentation; 
C. 	Reducing dust and noise levels; 
D. 	Protecting groundwater resources and watersheds from increased velocity of water run-off and pollutant levels; 
E. 	Maintaining wildlife habitat; 
F. 	Reducing the velocity of strong winds; 
G. 	Maintaining species bio-diversity in the community; 
H. 	Promoting good forest stewardship; 
I. 	Protecting the rights of adjoining property owners; 
J. 	Minimizing the potential for adverse environmental impacts resulting from irresponsible timber harvesting practices; and, 
K. 	Avoiding unreasonable and unnecessary restrictions on the right to practice forestry. 
2. 	Applicability. The requirements in this section shall apply to all proposed earth disturbances which would cause disturbance or removal of existing vegetation, and all timber harvesting or tree clearing in West Sadsbury Township, unless otherwise specified. These regulations do not apply to the cutting of trees for the personal use of the landowner of a single-family residence for firewood to be burned inside the fireplace of such residence or for pre-commercial timber stand development. 

§871. Woodland and Tree Protection Standards. 
The following standards shall be met for all land owners, subdivisions and land developments proposed in West Sadsbury Township: 
167 

1. 	
Removal of Trees Prior to Plan Approval. 

No clearing or earth disturbance (except for soil analysis for proposed sewage disposal systems) shall be permitted on a site before the approval of subdivision and land development plans. The determination of site distance clearances along roadways shall be determined graphically and not by clearing on-site prior to final plan approval. 

2. 	
Delay of Subdivision. 


If thirty-four percent (34%) or more of a wooded area on a lot is harvested or clear­cut, the land shall not subsequently be approved for subdivision for a period of five 
(5) years. 
3. 	Minimizing Disturbance to Existing Vegetation. 
A. 	All cartways, buildings, other structures, and driveways shall be located in a manner so as to minimize disturbance to existing vegetation. Developers shall make reasonable efforts to harmonize their plans with the preservation of existing vegetation. 
B. 	A minimum of sixty-six percent (66%) of any woodland as defined by this Chapter 27 shall be preserved in a natural, unimproved condition on each lot or tract of land. A maximum of thirty-four percent (34%) of any woodland as defined by this Chapter may be cleared from a tract of land. No person shall clear or substantially clear the woodland from a tract of land two (2) or more acres in area and then further subdivide the whole and resell subdivided lots as non-woodland lots within five (5) years from the date of recording an approved subdivision or land development plan. This restriction shall be placed as a note on the final subdivision or land development plan. 
4. 	Areas Specified for Vegetation Removal. 
A. 	Except for approved tree harvesting operations and tree clearing operations with an approved Timber Harvesting or Tree Clearing Plan prepared as set forth in §872 below, existing trees, tree clusters and their associated vegetation layers shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. Tree removal shall be limited to terminally-diseased or dead trees and those trees located within the following: 
(1) 	
The ultimate right-of-way of a proposed street or other public improvement along with the minimum associated grading necessary; 

(2) 	
Twenty-five (25) feet from the foundation of a new building or structure and minimum associated grading necessary; 

(3) 	
Utility easements and individual property services along with the minimum associated grading necessary; 

(4) 	
Driveways; 

(5) 	
Soil erosion control devices and minimum associated grading necessary; 

(6) 	
Stormwater management facilities and minimum associated grading necessary. 

(7) 	
No native, mature trees shall be removed unless clearly necessary for completion of the proposed subdivision or land development. 

B. 	
Woodland Corridors. Except for approved tree harvesting operations or tree clearing operations with an approved Timber Harvesting or Tree Clearing Plan prepared in accordance with §872 below, where possible, woodlands which remain undisturbed shall interconnect with existing woodlands or wooded areas of adjacent properties to preserve continuous woodland corridors and allow for the natural movement and migration of wildlife and the dispersion of native vegetation. 

C. 	
Riparian Buffer Zone (RBZ). Except for approved activities, the Riparian Buffer Zone shall remain undisturbed. 

(1) 	
An RBZ adjacent to "High Quality Waters" and "Exceptional Value Waters" designated by the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) shall be subject to the provisions of the most recent edition of DEP Special Protection Waters Implementation Handbook and its amendments. To the extent that the Township and DEP requirements are not consistent, the more restrictive requirements shall apply. 


168 

5. 	Tree Protection Zone. Trees, tree clusters and their associated vegetation layers, noteworthy trees, and other vegetation that are to be preserved shall be protected to the limits of a Tree Protection Zone (TPZ). Trees within a TPZ shall be clearly marked with landscape paint, colored tape, or other appropriate marker, at breast height (4½ feet from ground level). Where tree masses are to be preserved, only the trees on the edge of the mass need to be marked. 
A. 	During construction, trees within a TPZ shall be clearly delineated with a proper barrier and signage, such as wood stakes, colored tape and snow fencing, to the limits of a TPZ to ensure that there is no encroachment and/or compaction of soil and roots within this area by: 
(1) 	
Change of grade; 

(2) 	
Excavation or trenching; 

(3) 	
Storage of building materials, topsoil, motor vehicles, or construction equipment; 

(4) 	
In addition, there shall be no storage of toxic materials, including petroleum-based products, within fifty (50) feet of a TPZ. 

B. 	
Trees scheduled to be removed that are adjacent to or within the TPZ of a tree that will be retained, should be left standing until grading is complete, to further protect the tree to be left standing from grading related impacts. 

C. 	
Roots from trees within the TPZ must be trimmed as a result of earth disturbance outside a TPZ, shall be cut by a backhoe or similar equipment aligned radially to the tree. This method reduces the lateral movement of the remaining roots, reducing the possibility of damage to the intertwined roots of surrounding trees and other vegetation. 

D. 	
Within four (4) hours of any severance of any roots, all roots that have been exposed and/or damaged shall be trimmed cleanly and covered temporarily with peat moss, moist burlap, or biodegradable material to keep them moist and protected from disease until permanent cover is installed. Permanent cover shall be installed within seventy-two (72) hours of the initial severance of roots. 

E. 	
Tree stumps located within ten (10) feet of a TPZ shall be removed by means of a stump grinder or similar device which shall minimize the effect on existing, intertwined roots within a TPZ. A stump shall be ground and removed to a point at least six (6) inches below ground level. 

F. 	
Trees that are to be removed shall not be felled, pushed or pulled into a TPZ. 

G. 	
Snow fencing placed around trees within a TPZ shall be placed at the drip line, unless determined to be appropriate at another location by West Sadsbury Township. 


169 

6. 	Minimum Tree Replacement Requirements. 
A. 	Replacement of Wooded Areas. Except in conjunction with routine tree maintenance and cases of alien/invasive species, the following regulations shall apply to tree clearing and timber harvesting operations: 
B. 	Tree Clearing Operations -Required Tree Replacement. If twenty percent (20%) or more of the ten (10) inch DBH or greater trees in a wooded area are cleared, tree replacement shall be required as set forth below: 
Minimum Tree Replacement Standards  
Number and Size of Healthy Trees to be Removed  Minimum Number and Caliper of Replacement Trees  
One tree, 10 to 24 inch DBH  One tree, 2-1/2 inch caliper  
One tree, 24 inch DBH or greater  One tree, 3 to 3-1/2 inch caliper  

(1) 	
The determination of the number of existing trees at the ten (10) to twenty-four (24) inch DBH size and the twenty-four (24) inch DBH or greater size may be made either by a survey of all individual trees or by the preparation of a Forest Density Survey. A Forest Density Survey is prepared by surveying a representative sample of trees on the subject tract. The typical size distribution of trees in the sample area is used as a basis for assigning the total number of trees at various sizes over the tract. 

(2) 	
If the number of replacement trees proposed to be planted cannot be installed due to existing features and site constraints, the Board of Supervisors may allow the installation of fewer larger trees instead of more smaller trees. Any substitutions must be reviewed by the Township Engineer and approved by the Board of Supervisors. 

C. 	
Timber Harvesting Operations-Required Tree Replacement. If twenty percent (20%) or more of the ten (10) inch DBH or greater trees in a wooded area are cleared then tree replacement shall be required as set forth below: 

(1) 	
Two saplings, a minimum of twenty-four (24) inches in height shall be replaced for each tree removed for the purposes of timber harvesting. 


170 

7. 	Land Development Plans -Applicant Responsibility. 
A standardized note shall be required to be placed on all final land development plans stating: 
“The applicant is responsible for the installation of shade trees on the lots as 
depicted on the final plans and in accordance with the West Sadsbury Township Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance. A Certificate of Occupancy for the development or a portion of the development shall not be issued by the Township Building Inspector until the required shade trees are installed or until an escrow agreement satisfactory to West Sadsbury Township is finalized to ensure installation of such shade trees.” 
8. 	Native Tree List.

PART 9A 


RESIDENTIAL SITE CAPACITY DETERMINATION 
§900. 	General. 
In order to promulgate the objectives of the West Sadsbury Township Comprehensive Plan, this Chapter 27 requires that prior to development of any tract or parcel of land a determination be made as to the intensity of development appropriate for the site. 
These regulations shall apply to any tract or parcel of land or fraction thereof under single ownership where specific residential site capacity calculations are not otherwise provided in this Zoning Ordinance for a specific lot as of the effective date of this Chapter 27. 
1. 	If a Special Exception has been granted by the Zoning Hearing Board permitting a use within a Residential Zoning District, the applicant may utilize the Site Capacity Calculations associated with the Zoning District where the permitted use is a use by right. For example, a special exception granted for a place of religious worship use within the RMD Zoning District would be permitted to use the Industrial/Commercial Site Capacity Determination calculations since a place of religious worship use is permitted by right within the CS Zoning District. 

§901. 	Base Site Area. 
Certain portions of tracts may not be usable for the proposed activities and should be subtracted from the site area to determine the Base Site Area: 
1. 	
Site Area as determined by survey Ac. 

2. 	
Subtract land which is not contiguous: 


A. 	A separate parcel which does not abut or adjoin the development -Ac. 
B. 	Land which is cut off from the main parcel by a road, railroad, existing land use, or so that it is isolated and unavailable for development purposes -Ac. 
3. 	
Subtract land previously reserved as permanent open space -Ac. 

4. 	
Subtract land used or zoned for another use -Ac. 

5.

The curative amendment and challenge shall be referred to the Planning Commission and the county planning agency as provided in §609 and notice of the hearing thereon shall be given as provided in §610 and §916.1 of the MPC, 53 P.S. §10609, §10610, and §10916.1. 

2. 	
The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with §908 of the MPC and all references therein to the Zoning Hearing Board shall, for purposes of this Section be references to the Board of Supervisors. If the Township of West Sadsbury does not accept a landowner's curative amendment brought in accordance with this subsection and a court subsequently rules that the challenge has merit, the court's decision shall not result in a declaration of invalidity for this entire Chapter 27 and Zoning Map, but only for those provisions which specifically relate to the landowner's curative amendment and challenge. 

3. 	
The Board of Supervisors, if it determines that a validity challenge has merit, may accept a landowner's curative amendment, with or without revision, or may adopt an alternative amendment which will cure the challenged defects. The Board of Supervisors shall consider the curative amendments, plans and explanatory material submitted by the landowner and shall also consider: 


A. 	the impact of the proposal upon roads, sewer facilities, water supplies, schools and other public service facilities; 
192 

B. 	if the proposal is for a residential use, the impact of the proposal upon regional housing needs and the effectiveness of the proposal in providing housing units of a type actually available to and affordable by classes of persons otherwise unlawfully excluded by the challenged provisions of this Chapter 27 or Zoning Map. 
C. 	the suitability of the site for the intensity of use proposed by the site's soils, slopes, woodlands, wetlands, flood plains, aquifers, natural resources and other natural features; 
D. 	the impact of the proposed use on the site's soils, slopes, woodlands, wetlands, flood plains, natural resources and natural features, the degree to which these are protected or destroyed, the tolerance of the resources to development and any adverse environmental impacts; and 
E. 	the impact of the proposal on the preservation of agriculture and other land uses which are essential to public health and welfare. 

§1016. Procedure for Township Curative Amendments. 
1. 	If the Township of West Sadsbury determines that this Chapter 27, or any portion hereof, is substantially invalid, it shall take the following actions: 
A. 	The Township of West Sadsbury shall declare by formal action, this Chapter 27 or portions hereof substantially invalid and propose to prepare a curative amendment to overcome such invalidity. Within thirty (30) days of such declaration and proposal the Board of Supervisors shall: 
(1) 	
By resolution make specific findings setting forth the declared invalidity of this Chapter 27 which may include: 

(a) 	
references to specific uses which are either not permitted or not permitted in sufficient quantity; 

(b) 	
reference to a class of use or uses which requires revision; or, 

(c) 	
reference to this entire Chapter 27 which requires revisions. 



(2) 	
Begin to prepare and consider a curative amendment to this Chapter 27 to correct the declared invalidity. 


2. 	
Within one hundred eighty (180) days from the date of the declaration and proposal, the Township of West Sadsbury shall enact a curative amendment to validate, or reaffirm the validity of, this Chapter 27 pursuant to the provisions of §609 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code (hereinafter "MPC"), 53 P.S. §10609, in order to cure the declared invalidity of this Chapter. 

3. 	
Upon the initiation of the procedures as set forth in subsection (1), the Board of Supervisors shall not be required to entertain or consider any landowner's curative amendment filed under §609.1 of the MPC, 53 P.S. §10609.1, nor shall the Zoning Hearing Board be required to give a report requested under §909.1 or §916.1 of the MPC, 53 P.S. §10909.1, §10916.1, subsequent to the declaration and proposal based upon the grounds identical or substantially similar to those specified by the resolution 


193 

required by subsection (1)(A). Upon completion of the procedures set forth in subsec­tions (1) and (2), no rights to a cure pursuant to the provisions of §609.1 and §916.1 of the MPC, 53 P.S. §10609.1, §10916.1, shall, from the date of the declaration and proposal, accrue to any landowner on the basis of the substantive invalidity of this Chapter for which there has been a curative amendment pursuant to this Section. 
4. 	The Township of West Sadsbury having utilized the procedures set forth in this Section may not again utilize said procedure for a period of thirty-six (36) months following the date of enactment of a curative amendment, or reaffirmation of the validity of this Chapter 27; Provided, However, if after the date of declaration and proposal there is a substantially new duty imposed upon the Township of West Sadsbury by virtue of a change in statute or by virtue of a Pennsylvania Appellate Court decision, the Township of West Sadsbury may utilize the provisions of this Section to propose a curative amendment to this Chapter 27 to fulfill said duty or obligation.

6. 	
All materials or wastes which might cause fumes or dust, or which constitute a fire hazard, shall be stored in containers adequate to eliminate such hazards. 



§1103. Access and Traffic Control. 
1. 	
Access from a lot to a public street or highway shall be placed so that interference with adjacent street intersection traffic is prevented. Driveways and entrances shall be located a minimum of one hundred (100') feet from the street line of an intersecting street on the same side as the access and shall be designed in a manner conducive for safe ingress and egress. Where practical, exits shall be located on minor rather than major streets or highways. 

2. 	
Access to and from developments shall be done in a manner which least disrupts traffic flow along abutting roads. Access points must be properly located and designed. In so doing, the location of existing roads, land uses and access points in the vicinity must be taken into account, and access to streets should be coordinated among adjoining land owners. 

3. 	
The owner shall pay for the construction of any necessary traffic control devices or additional acceleration and/or deceleration lanes required by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation or Township Engineer. 

4. 	
In office, commercial, and industrial zoning districts, plans for access to and from existing roads within the Township shall be reviewed by the Board of Supervisors in accordance with the standards and principles of this Section 1103, and are subject to approval by the Board. 

5. 	
In the design of access points, applicants shall consider the following factors. 


195 

A. 	Provision of marginal access roads or use of reverse frontage lots when appropriate.

L. 	Utilize ingress only and egress only driveways where appropriate. 
M. 	Construct opposing driveways opposite each other, without off-sets. 
N. 	Provide adequate internal circulation for the development to avoid congestion at access points. 
O. 	The cost of operation and maintenance of traffic signals installed as part of the project shall be the responsibility of the developer so long as permitted by law. 

§1104. Visibility at Intersections. 
On a corner lot or at a point of entry on a public road, nothing shall be erected, placed or allowed to grow in a manner which obscures vision: 
1. 	
Above the height of two and one-half (2½') feet measured from the center line grades of the intersecting streets; and 

2. 	
Within the area bounded by the street lines of such corner lots and a line joining points on these street lines seventy-five (75') feet from their intersection 


196 


§1105. Interior Circulation. 
Interior drives shall be designed so as to prevent blockage of vehicles entering or leaving the site. Drives may be one-way or two-way. Areas provided for loading and unloading of delivery trucks and other vehicles, and for the servicing of shops by refuse collection, fuel, and other service vehicles shall be so arranged that they may be used without blocking or interfering with the use of accessways or parking facilities. 

§1106. Lighting. 
1. 	Purpose. This section sets forth minimum criteria for the installation, use and maintenance of exterior lighting, the purposes of which are the following: 
A. 	To require lighting in outdoor public spaces where safety and security are concerns; 
B. 	To protect drivers and pedestrians on nearby streets from glare from non-vehicular light sources that shine directly into their eyes and thereby impair safe travel; 
C. 	To shield neighboring properties from glare resulting from excessive light sources and from nonexistent or improperly directed or shielded light sources; 
D. 	To limit the height of light standards to preclude or lessen light pollution; and, 
E. 	To promote efficient design and operation with regard to energy conservation. 
2. 	
Applicability. Lighting facilities shall be required for all off-street parking areas and off-street loading areas and for all driveways providing ingress and egress thereto and for all subdivisions and/or land developments for business, commercial, personal service, industrial, multifamily, recreational, institutional and public uses and for all construction or reconstruction or improvement of any such use for which land development approval is not required. In the approval of any subdivision or land development plan the Board of Supervisors shall have the authority to require lighting to be incorporated for other uses or locations where in their reasonable discretion such lighting is warranted. In addition, the provisions of this section shall apply to signs, architectural lighting, and landscape lighting. 

3. 	
Plan submission. 


A. 	Lighting plans shall be submitted for review and approval for all subdivisions and land developments and for all uses identified in subsection (2) of this §1106, and shall include the following data: 
(1) 	
A schematic layout of all proposed exterior fixtures; 

(2) 	
International Organization for Standardization (ISO) footcandle data; 

(3) 	
A plat demonstrating intensities and uniformities within the limitations established in §1106.4.B. of this section; 

(4) 	
Themanufacturer’sdescriptionoftheequipment(catalogue cut sheets) in the form of a detail on the plans; 

(5) 	
Glare control devices; 

(6) 	
Mounting heights and means; 

(7) 	
Proposed hours of operation of the lighting; and, 

(8) 	
Maintenance schedule. 

(9) 	
Illumination intensities shall be plotted to scale on a ten (10) foot by ten 


197 

(10) foot grid. 
4. 	Commercial Lighting Standards. 
A. 	Lighting facilities located in any off-street parking areas and loading areas and for uses and developments specified in §1106.2., or in connection with signs and recreational and institutional activities, shall provide an illumination level utilizing the current recommended standards of the Illuminating Engineering Society of America (IESNA) except as otherwise modified by the provisions of this §1106.4.A. However, in any instance in which the principal use of the property requires the granting of either a special exception or conditional use, the Zoning Hearing Board may impose a more stringent lighting standard requiring less illumination as a condition of any such approval when it determines the same to be necessary to protect the adjoining properties or streets from light pollution or glare. 
B. 	When illumination is required, it shall have the intensity and uniformity ratios in the Lighting Handbook of the Illuminating Engineering Society of America (IESNA), 9th Edition, except as modified herein as follows: 
Maintained Footcandles (MFC) Use  Uniformity, Average: Minimum  
Parking, Multifamily  0.20 mm;  4:1  
Medium vehicular/pedestrian activity  0.60 mm;  4:1  
Parking, Industrial, Commercial, Institutional, Municipal  0.60 mm;  4:1  
High Activity (Regional Shopping Centers, Fast Food Facilities, Major Athletic, Civic or Cultural Events)  0.90 mm;  4:1  
Medium Activity (Community Shopping Center, Office Parks, Hospitals, Commuter Lots, Civic or Cultural Events)  0.60 mm;  4:1  
Low Activity (Neighborhood Shopping Area, Industrial Employee Parking, Schools, Church Parking)  0.50 avg;  5:1  
Building entrances  5.0 avg.  
Canopy over Gas Dispensing Devices, Service Station Pump Islands  35.0 avg.  
Car Dealerships  35.0 max [1]  

[1]  Note: 35.0 MFC is the maximum permitted and is limited to the first 100 feet of outdoor display or parking along any street frontage, subject to otherwise applicable setbacks mandated by the district regulations. The remainder of the property shall be limited to 20.0 MFC, except for the rear yard, which shall be limited to 10 MFC. 
C. 	In the application of the above standards, the following regulations shall apply: 
198 

(1) 

(2) 

(3) 

(4) 

(5) 

(6) 

(7) 



Illumination levels shall be defined as maintained horizontal footcandles on the area, for example, on the pavement or area surface. 
Uniformity ratios dictate that average illumination values shall not exceed minimum values by more than the product of the minimum value and the specified ratio. For example, in the case of high activity commercial parking, the average footcandles shall not be in excess of 3.6 (0.9 x 4). 
In no case shall illumination exceed 0.2 footcandle measured at the property lines, except at driveway entrances, provided the illumination at the cartway centerline of the contiguous street shall not exceed 1.0 footcandle, unless a more stringent standard is required by another provision of this §1106.4; and the amount of illumination projected onto a property zoned or in residential use from another property shall not exceed 
0.1 footcandle at the property line. 
Lighting standards in parking areas shall be located no more than one hundred (100) feet apart, provided the Zoning Officer shall apply the standards of this §1106.4 by prohibiting the location of lighting standards in such close proximity to each other as would result in the violation of the footcandle and light spillage restrictions imposed by §1106.4B. 
Lamp types and colors shall be in harmony with the adjacent community, any special circumstances existing on the site, and with surrounding installations. Lamp types and colors shall be consistent with the use and setting and shall not create a mix of colors. 
Canopy lighting shall be located on the surface (ceiling) of the canopy and shall be limited to flush-lens fixtures mounted on the canopy ceiling. Drop-lens fixtures are prohibited. Up-lens lighting fixtures mounted on the canopy structure above the level of the gas pumps are permitted if they have the effect of reducing glare from the lighting fixtures mounted on the canopy ceiling. In no event shall any other lighting fixtures be located on or otherwise attached to or used to light a canopy or any area of the property adjacent to the canopy. Outdoor canopies include, but are not limited to, the following applications: 
(a)  Fuel  island  canopies  associated  with  service  stations  and  
convenience stores;  
(b)  Exterior canopies above store fronts in shopping centers and malls;  
(c)  Exterior canopies above driveways and building entrances; and,  
(d)  Pavilions and gazebos.  

All lighting proposed for use after 10:00 pm for commercial, industrial, institutional and recreational applications shall be reduced by seventy-five percent (75%) from then until dawn, unless a variance is granted by the Zoning Hearing Board upon cause shown related to public health, welfare and safety. 
199 

D. 	Glare Control.  
(1) 	
All lighting fixtures shall meet IESNA cutoff criteria. No lighting shall be permitted which shines directly into residential units, or results in glare beyond the angle of thirty (30) degrees from a vertical plane, measured from the light source. 

(2) 	
Light fixtures including mounting base, shall not exceed twenty (20) feet in height above the finished grade. On-lot residential light fixtures shall not exceed fifteen (15) feet in height above the finished grade. 

(3) 	
All lighting sources shall be effectively shielded and shall be installed and/or aimed so as to shield nearby public or private streets and neighboring properties from direct-glare light radiation, or light pollution which may create a safety hazard or nuisance. 

(4) 	
All lighting sources shall be effectively shielded from any public right-of­way. 

(5) 	
Illuminated signs shall have an indirect lighting source or shielded source. 

(6) 	
All lighting sources shall be controlled by automatic timing devices to extinguish light, except for demonstrably necessary security lighting after 

10:00 pm prevailing time, to mitigate the adverse consequences of light pollution when such action is necessary to protect adjacent properties and uses. 

(7) 	
Glare control shall be accomplished primarily through the proper selection and application of lighting equipment.  Only after those means have been exhausted shall vegetation, fences, and similar screening methods be considered acceptable for reducing glare. 

(8) 	
Fixtures used for architectural lighting, such as façade, feature and landscape lighting, shall be aimed or directed so as to preclude light projection beyond the immediate objects intended to be illuminated. All such lighting shall be extinguished between the hours of midnight prevailing time and dawn. 

(9) 	
In all residential districts or in connection with residential uses, floodlighting, spotlighting, and other high intensity lighting over one hundred (100) watts shall be located so that glare or reflection is not greater than 0.2 footcandle at the lot line of the receiving land. Such lighting fixtures shall be installed and/or aimed so that they do not project their output into windows of neighboring residences, adjacent uses, skyward, or onto a public street. All such lighting shall be extinguished after 10:00 pm prevailing time, except in the case of an emergency. 

(10) 	
With the exception of all night operations, lighting for commercial, industrial, public recreational and industrial applications shall be controlled by automatic switching devices such as time clocks or combination motion detectors and photocells, to permit extinguishing 


200 

outdoor lighting fixtures between 10:00 pm and dawn, to mitigate nuisance glare and sky-lighting consequences. 
(11) 	
The operation of searchlights or laser source light for advertising purposes is prohibited. 

(12) 	
All fixtures used for the lighting of active recreation facilities shall be fully shielded to prevent glare external to the property line. 

E. 	
Installation and maintenance. 

(1) 	
The developer/landowner shall install or cause to be installed all lighting fixtures and facilities at his/its expense. Light fixtures and poles shall be in accordance with a lighting plan approved by the Township Engineer in those instances where subdivision or land development approval or conditional use approval is not involved or otherwise approved by the Board upon recommendation by the Planning Commission and Township Engineer, in compliance with §1106. The developer/landowner shall be responsible for all costs involved in the maintenance, upkeep and operation of all lighting of parking and loading areas and other areas required by §1106. 

(2) 	
Electrical feeds to lighting standards shall be underground. 

(3) 	
Lighting fixtures shall be maintained by the landowner so as to always meet the requirements for this §1106. 

F. 	
Compliance. 

(1) 	
The Board of Supervisors’ approval of a lighting plan upon the recommendation of the Planning Commission and/or Township Engineer does not relieve the developer/landowner of responsibility should any light standards or light fixtures, after construction, fail to conform or continue to conform to the provisions of this §1106. The Township reserves the right to conduct a post-installation nighttime inspection to verify compliance with the requirements of this §1106 and if, appropriate, to require remedial action at the expense of the landowner. 

(2) 	
Authority for the determination of correct lighting installation in accordance with the requirements of this §1106 shall rest with the Zoning Officer, with advice from the Township Engineer. If the Zoning Officer determines that any lighting installation creates a safety or personal security hazard due to insufficient illumination levels or produces unacceptable levels of nuisance glare, light pollution, or skyward light, the landowner or other person/entity then responsible for the use, maintenance and operation of the lighting shall be so notified and required to take timely remedial action at the expense of the landowner or other responsible person/entity. 


201 


§1107. Shopping Cart Storage. 
Any establishment which furnishes carts or mobile baskets as an adjunct to shopping shall provide definite areas within the required parking space areas for storage of said carts. Each designated storage area shall be clearly marked for storage of shopping carts. Such signs indicating storage shall not be considered as regulated by the sign controls listed in Part 13.

PART 11A 
DESIGN STANDARDS FOR SITE PLANNING 


AND OPEN SPACE IN RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS 
§1100-A. Purpose. 
The design standards established under this ordinance have been established to support the natural resource conservation objectives of the Township Comprehensive Plan and its Open Space, Recreation and Environmental Resources Plan, while accommodating new development. The purposes of these standards are to: 
1. 	
To conserve open land, including those areas containing unique and sensitive natural resources such as woodlands, steep slopes, streams, floodplains, and wetlands, by setting them aside from development. 

2. 	
To provide greater design flexibility and efficiency in the siting of services and infrastructure, including the opportunity to reduce length of roads, utilities, and the amount of paving and impervious surface required for residential development. 

3. 	
To reduce erosion and sedimentation through the retention of existing vegetation, the minimization of development on steep slopes, and the reduction of earth disturbance. 

4. 	
To provide development options for landowners which minimize impacts on sensitive environmental resources, reduce disturbance of natural and cultural features, and conserve scenic views. 

5. 	
To provide flexible standards for addressing varying circumstances and interests of individual landowners and the unique characteristics of their properties. 



§1101-A. General Regulations. 
The design of new subdivisions created under this Part shall be governed by the following minimum standards: 
1. 	
Ownership. The tract of land may be held in single and separate ownership or in multiple ownership.  However, when a tract is held in multiple ownership, it shall be planned as a single entity with common authority and common responsibility. 

2. 	
Site Suitability. The tract incorporating these design options shall be suitable for supporting development in terms of health, safety, and welfare considerations, environmental conditions, its size, and configuration as evidenced by the required site analysis of the Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance and compliance with the natural resource protection standards, performance standards, and other applicable requirements of this and other Township ordinances. 

3. 	
Combining the Design Options. The various layout and density options for Conservation Lots, Estate Lots, and Rural Lots described in this Part may be combined at the discretion of the Board of Supervisors, based upon demonstration by the applicant that such a combination would better fulfill the intent of the Township 


209 

Comprehensive Plan and this Ordinance, in particular the stated purposes of this Part, as compared with applying a single option to the property. 
4. 	
Sensitive Area Protection. The proposed design shall strictly minimize disturbance of environmentally sensitive areas and comply with the Site Capacity Determination calculations set forth in the corresponding Zoning District. Demonstration by the applicant that these features will be protected by the proposed application shall be prerequisite to approval of all preliminary and final plans. 

5. 	
Community Wastewater Systems. 


A. 	In developments that are proposed to be served by community wastewater disposal systems, the selection of the wastewater treatment technique shall be 
based on Section 5.3.2.3.1 “Selection Process” of the 1999 Sewage Facilities 
Base Plan, or subsequent amendments. The recharge of groundwater is a primary consideration in the hierarchy of preferred treatment systems. 
B. 	Where subsurface soil absorption is utilized, an alternate replacement area must be provided on the Final Plan. The alternate site may be contiguous or noncontiguous to the original site. 

§1102-A. Additional Lot and Yard Area Requirements. 
In subdivisions using the Conservation Lot, Country Property, or Rural Lot design options, the following lot and yard area regulations shall apply to any principal buildings or any other buildings whether the buildings are located on the same lot or on a separate lot. 
1. 	Minimum separation distances between buildings, except as provided for accessory buildings in subsection b. below, shall be as follows: 
A. 	The minimum separation shall be fifty (50) feet measured perpendicularly from the rear wall of any residential building at any point to any other building not accessory to such residential building. 
B. 	Minimum separation distances from any other points between buildings shall be twenty (20) feet. 
2. 	Principal or accessory buildings shall be located no less than eight (8) feet from any lot line, except where specifically approved through the conditional use process and, in no case, shall principal or accessory buildings be located less than three (3) feet from any lot line. Where a setback of less than eight (8) feet has been approved, an easement shall be provided between the lot line and a distance of no less than eight 
(8) feet from the approved building envelope. 
3. 	
Minimum separation at any point between accessory buildings (e.g., detached garages or sheds) and the principal buildings to which they are accessory shall not be less than twelve (12) feet; minimum separation distances between accessory buildings and any other building shall comply with Subsection A. above. 

4. 	
Accessory buildings shall not be permitted on residential lots of less than ten-thousand (10,000) square feet in gross area, except where specifically approved through the conditional use process. 

5. 	
No exterior windows (except for clerestory windows), doors, or other openings shall be permitted in any portion of principal or accessory buildings located less than five 


210 

(5) feet from any lot line. Clerestory is defined as an outside wall of a room or building which rises above an adjoining roof and contains windows. 
6. 	
Where greater setbacks do not otherwise apply, front facing garages, whether attached or detached, shall be set back a minimum of thirty-five (35) feet from the edge of the right-of-way or from the sidewalk, whichever results in the greatest setback. In addition, front-facing garages shall be set back a minimum of eight (8) feet from the front façade of the dwelling unit. If the front façade is not uniform, the eight (8) foot setback shall be measured from the point of the façade nearest the street. 

7. 	
Minimum setback from the edge of the cartway (or outside edge of the curb if applicable) of any new local road which is part of the proposed subdivision/land development shall not be less than twenty-five (25) feet. Where abutting a new arterial or collector street within the proposed subdivision/land development, the setbacks shall be as follows: Principal or Minor Arterial Streets: seventy-five (75) feet, Major or Minor Collector Streets: sixty-five (65) feet. 

8. 	
In addition to the individual building lot setback requirements, new structures shall meet the following guidelines for minimum setbacks whether the adjacent use is on or off the site. These setbacks may be modified subject to approval by conditional use: 


A. 	From external road future rights-of-way: 75 feet 
B. 	From other tract boundaries: 50 feet 
C. 	From crop or pasture land: 100 feet 
D. 	From buildings or barnyards housing livestock: 250 feet

4. 	Owners of communications towers higher than thirty-five (35) feet will secure the property boundary, or at a minimum the tower base including any support structures, not including guy wires, with a chain link fence which shall be ten (10) feet in height. In addition to boundary security, all communication towers in excess of thirty-five 
(35) feet in height will have an integral security platform, or other means with locked access, to prevent unauthorized climbing of the tower. Landscaping will be provided around all fences and to screen them from public views and adjoining properties. 
5. 	
All communication tower owners will provide the Township with a statement that the emission of radio waves emanating from the tower will neither cause harm to an individual by its operation or cause measurable radio interference to the reception or operation of AM radios, TV and FM reception, car or cellular or portable phones, heart pacemakers, garage door openers, remote control units for models, and other radio dependent devices in general use within the Township and is in compliance with all FCC regulations.

The owner of any communication tower higher than thirty-five (35) feet will be required to routinely submit to the Township, proof of an annual inspection and tower maintenance program. Any structure faults thus noted will be immediately corrected by the owner. Failure to provide proof of certified inspection will result in notification to the owner to cease operation and dismantle the tower. 

8. 	
The communication tower owner is required to post financial security with the Township in an amount sufficient to pay the cost of removing the tower and appurtenant structures. The communication tower owner is required to notify the Township immediately upon cessation or abandonment of the operation. The communication tower owner shall then have ninety (90) days in which to dismantle and remove the tower and all appurtenant structures from the property.

234 

tower.  The break point of the tower shall insure that the structure will fall within the setback except as otherwise provided in this Section 1220. 
10. 	
No communication tower shall be allowed within one and one-half (1 ½) miles of another tower. 

11. 	
If there is suitable space available on an existing communication tower within the geographic area that a new cell site would serve, no new cell shall be established. 

12. 	
The visual effects of antennae and antenna support structures shall be minimized by careful site location and proper design. The applicant proposing an antenna support structure must demonstrate that the structure has been designed to blend in with or mimic existing features in the landscape such as trees, light poles, flag poles or farm silos. An antenna support structure and/or antenna(e) attached to and principally supported by an existing structure shall be constructed to simulate the architectural façade and/or color of the building, structure or object to which it is attached.

13. 	
In addition to the above standards, all other applicable performance standards applicable to the zoning district in which the tower is to be located shall apply to the tower and any associated support facilities or structures. This would require that all applicable plans must be submitted for review and approval for any development application for a communications tower. 

14.

That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions, including irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or shape, or exceptional topographical or other physical conditions peculiar to the particular property and that the unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions and not the circumstances or conditions generally created by the provisions of this Chapter in the neighborhood or district in which the property is located.

279 

The application for Conditional Use approval shall be accompanied by a unified, overall site plan covering the entire tract, regardless of any intended phasing of development. The plan shall be prepared with sufficient detail to adequately illustrate the proposed development uses and non-development uses of the tract, including (where appropriate), reserve areas for possible future expansion; coordinated internal and external vehicular and pedestrian circulation; well related, convenient and efficient parking and loading areas; agreeable surroundings that provide comfort, safety, and convenience for prospective residents, customers, and/or workers; and high quality design in terms of building relationship, facade treatment, signage, lighting, landscaped and planted buffers and screens, as well as other natural and constructed amenities in furtherance of the comprehensive planning objectives of Township of West Sadsbury. 
With respect to exact building locations, shapes and dimensions, and similar requirements of the Development Plan, prescribed in the paragraph above, it is recognized that a fixed and dimensioned architectural layout, as would be required for issuance of a building permit, is not feasible, nor is it the intent of this Section of the Zoning Ordinance to require such detail in an application for Conditional Use. However, the plans, information and data, as herein required for Conditional Use approval, shall be indicated in sufficient detail to serve as a firm commitment by the Applicant to the design criteria and standards. The Development Plan shall be prepared at a scale of not more than one inch equals fifty feet (1" = 50'). Where specific Conditional Use application requirements are contained in other articles of 
280 

this Ordinance and are applicable to a particular Conditional Use authorized by this Ordinance, the Applicant shall comply with such requirements which shall prevail in the event of conflict or overlap. 
The Development Plan shall generally include the following elements: Site Layout Plan, Existing Conditions and Environmental Resources Plan, Proposed Grading Plan, Landscape, Screening and Buffering Plan, and Lighting Plan. Other Plans or plan information may be required at the discretion of the Planning Commission or the Board of Supervisors. 
C. 	Natural and Cultural Resources Analysis 
The Applicant shall provide an inventory of the tract=s natural features and systems, cultural resources, and visual amenities that may be impacted by the proposed Conditional Use.

(6) 	
Soils with shallow depth to bedrock; 

(7) 	
Geologic formations (i.e. Conestoga Formation), particularly in relation to areas of groundwater recharge; 

(8) 	
Biotic resources as mapped and described in the Township of West Sadsbury Open Space, Recreation, and Environmental Resources Plan, and patterns of vegetation, including tree masses, rare or extraordinary individual species, any tree of six (6) inches or greater DBH and areas serving as habitat for wildlife (species of wildlife dependent upon the site for habitat shall be identified). 

(9) 	
Scenic resources as mapped and described in the West Sadsbury Township Open Space, Recreation, and Environmental Resources Plan, and any other visual amenities of the site (e.g., topography, 


281 

vegetation, water) considered unique, scenic, and/or that should be incorporated into the design of any future use; and 
(10) 	
Sites and structures of historical or cultural significance, including but not limited to those sites recorded in the West Sadsbury Township Open Space, Recreation and Environmental Resources Plan, the Township of West Sadsbury Comprehensive Plan and the Chester County Historic Sites Survey of 1982. 

(11) 
Prime agricultural soils 


The Applicant shall indicate how any or all of the inventoried resources will be affected by the proposed development, and shall describe mitigating measures to be employed in addressing these impacts. The development impacts and the proposed mitigating measures shall be described in narrative form, and their locations on the site and beyond shall be mapped at a scale of one (1) inch = one hundred (100) feet. 
D. Traffic Analysis 
The Board of Supervisors, at its sole discretion, may require the Applicant to provide traffic studies demonstrating feasible compliance with the objectives of this ordinance and the Township of West Sadsbury Comprehensive Plan. The Township of West Sadsbury Engineer shall provide the Applicant the minimum scope of work to be included in the analysis. The Traffic Analysis shall be prepared utilizing generally accepted practices and procedures in the preparation of a Traffic Impact Study. Such studies shall quantify existing peak hour traffic volumes at the study area intersections, estimate trip generation for the proposed development, project future peak hour traffic volumes pre-and post-development, and determine the levels of service, as by the Transportation Research Board, for all movements at intersections in the study area. The conclusions of the Traffic Impact Study shall recommend action(s) toward mitigating the traffic impact of new traffic generated by the proposed development. The Township reserves the right to retain the services of another qualified Traffic Engineer to review the findings of the Traffic Impact Study. In granting Conditional Use approval, the Board of Supervisors may defined in the most recent edition of the Highway Capacity Manual published attach conditions requiring specific improvements, to roads and adjacent intersections (or such intersections as agreed to by the parties) within the study area in an effort to maintain a predevelopment level of service for all movements. Any improvement(s) on adjacent state maintained roadways required by the Board of Supervisors (or such roadways as agreed to by the parties) shall be subject to Penn DOT approval. 
282 

E. Storm Water Management and Drainage Analysis

Supporting calculations for required detention basin volumes and groundwater recharge volumes shall be required. Off-site drainage problems in the vicinity of the development shall be identified and measures to mitigate such problems as a result of the Development shall be proposed. Any required PA DEP permits, floodplain encroachments, or other required permits shall be identified as part of the Storm Water Management and Drainage Analysis. 
F. Fiscal Impact Assessment 
The Township of West Sadsbury, at its sole discretion may require the Applicant to provide an assessment of the economic and fiscal impacts that will result from the proposed development in accordance with the Practitioner’s Guide To Fiscal Impact Analysis by Robert Burchell and David Listoken published by the Center for Urban Policy Research (Rutgers University) (latest edition) or other guidelines or guidance documents accepted by the Chester County Planning Commission. The assessment shall include a profile of the Township of West Sadsbury, County and School District revenues to be generated by the proposed development and the costs that it will impose on the Township of West Sadsbury, County and School District. The information shall be related to the initial, if staged, and completed subdivision or land development. 
G. Community Facilities and Services Assessment 
The Board of Supervisors, at its sole discretion may require the Applicant to provide an assessment of the facility and service needs required for the proposed development.

In either case, such review shall take place within sixty (60) days of submittal to the Commission, including the forwarding of any recommendation to the Township of West Sadsbury. The Planning Commission may extend its period of deliberation beyond sixty days upon written authorization by the Applicant. If the Planning Commission does not transmit its recommendations to the Board of Supervisors by the date set by the Board of Supervisors for public hearing for consideration of the Conditional Use application, the Board of Supervisors shall proceed to consider such application without the recommendation of the Commission. Should the Applicant submit new or revised plans for development under the application for Conditional Use approval during the period of review by the Planning Commission, the sixty (60) day review period shall start anew and prior plans shall be deemed withdrawn. The aforesaid period of review shall not start anew in the event a modification to the plans is made that is non substantive in the opinion of the Planning Commission in the exercise of its sole discretion. Plans that are deemed to be withdrawn as a result of substantive modifications requested by the Planning Commission or Township consultant shall not be subject to modifications of Township Ordinances for a period of sixty (60) days after the date of such request.

286 

which shall be borne by the Applicant. When the Applicant does not provide information as required, then it shall be presumed the proposed use is not in accordance with the requirements applicable for the granting of Conditional Use approval. 
E. 	Any grant of Conditional Use approval shall be deemed null and void eighteen (18) months from the date of such approval if, within that period, no application is made for a building permit, a use and occupancy permit, or subdivision or land development approval, as appropriate, unless so extended by the Board of Supervisors. Any request to extend the eighteen 
(18) month expiration period shall be properly filed with the Zoning Officer thirty (30) days in advance of the expiration date. The request shall include the reason why the extension is required, a reasonable estimate of the time needed to obtain the necessary approvals, and a qualified statement that there has been no change in the Conditional Use application or the neighborhood in which the property is located.  Failure to diligently pursue necessary approvals shall not be grounds for an extension.  The Board may grant up to two (2) additional eighteen (18) month extensions provided a reasonable argument is presented. No more than two (2) such extensions shall be granted per Conditional Use approval.

produce equal or better results, from the Township’s perspective, 
and represent minimum modifications necessary. 
C. 	If the Board of Supervisors determines that the applicant has met his, her or its burden, it may, but shall not be required to, grant a modification of the requirements of this Ordinance regarding a Conditional Use. In granting modifications, the Board may impose such conditions as will, in its judgment, secure the objectives and purposes of the applicable provisions of this Ordinance. 

§1507. Appeals to be in Writing. 
Appeals under §1503 may be filed with the Board in writing by the landowner affected, any officer or agency of the Township, or any other person aggrieved. 

§1508. All Other Challenges and Appeals. 
The Zoning Hearing Board shall hear all other challenges and appeals provided for in Section 910 and Article X of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, Act 247 as amended, under the regulations set forth in that Act. 

§1509. Time Limitations. 
1. 	No person shall be allowed to file any proceeding with the Zoning Hearing Board later than thirty (30) days after an application for development, preliminary or final, has 
290 

been approved by the Township of West Sadsbury if such proceeding is designed to secure reversal or to limit the approval in any manner unless such person alleges and proves that he had no notice, knowledge or reason to believe that such approval had been given. If such person has succeeded to his interest after such approval, he shall be bound by the knowledge of his predecessor in interest. The failure of anyone other than the landowner to appeal from an adverse decision on a tentative plan or from an adverse decision by the zoning officer on a challenge to the validity of this Chapter 27 or an amendment hereto or map or an amendment thereto shall preclude an appeal from a final approval except in the case where the final submission substantially deviates from the approved tentative approval. 
2. 	All appeals from determinations adverse to the landowner shall be filed by the landowner within thirty (30) days after notice of the determination is issued. 

§1510. Stay of Proceedings. 
1. 	
Upon filing of any appeal proceeding before the Zoning Hearing Board and during its pendency before the Board, all land development pursuant to any challenged ordinance, order or approval of the zoning officer or of any agency or body, and all official action thereunder, shall be stayed unless the zoning officer or any other appropriate agency or body certifies to the Board facts indicating that such stay would cause imminent peril to life or property, in which case the development or official action shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order, which may be granted by the Board or by the court having jurisdiction of zoning appeals, on petition, after notice to the zoning officer or other appropriate agency or body. When an application for development, preliminary or final, has been duly approved and proceedings designed to reverse or limit the approval are filed with the Board by persons other than the applicant, the applicant may petition the court having jurisdiction of zoning appeals to order such persons to post bond as a condition to continuing the proceedings before the Board. 

2. 	
After the petition is presented, the court shall hold a hearing to determine if the filing of the appeal is frivolous. At the hearing, evidence may be presented on the merits of the case. It shall be the burden of the applicant for a bond to prove the appeal is frivolous. After consideration of all evidence presented, if the court determines that the appeal is frivolous, it shall grant the petition for a bond. The right to petition the court to order the appellants to post bond may be waived by the appellee, but such waiver may be revoked by him if an appeal is taken from a final decision of the court. 

3. 	
The question whether or not such petition should be granted and the amount of the bond shall be within the sound discretion of the court. An order denying a petition for bond shall be interlocutory. An order directing the responding party to post a bond shall be interlocutory. 

4. 	
If an appeal is taken by a respondent to the petition for a bond from an order of the court dismissing a zoning appeal for refusal to post a bond and the appellate court sustains the order of the court below to post a bond, the respondent to the petition for a bond, upon motion of the petitioner and after hearing in the court having jurisdiction

5.3.2.3.1 Selection Process 
Applicants proposing the installation of multiple user systems within the Township shall begin their evaluation of treatment alternatives with Technology A, shown below, and continue the evaluation in sequence.  The final selection will be the alternative which most closely accomplishes the adopted wastewater planning policies and life cycle costs developed by the Township.   

Technologies 
A. 	Connection to an existing wastewater treatment plant (currently limited to the Route 372 corridor) 
B. 	Lagoon/pond system/slow rate land application (i.e., spray irrigation) 
C. 	Package plant/slow rate land application (i.e., spray irrigation) 
D. 	Septic tank with sand filter to sub-surface disposal* 
E. 	Package plant (tertiary treatment) with discharge to groundwater 
F. 	Package plant with spray irrigation of treated eff1uent in summer months and stream discharge of treated eff1uent in winter months 
G. 	Package plant with sand filter to stream discharge. 
*Sand filtration is required in order to prolong the useful life of the subsurface disposal fields and to improve the quality of effluent. 
The technologies listed above are not meant to be all inclusive or limiting.  The listed alternatives establish the basic treatment and disposal/reclamation technologies available and the Township established order of desired selection and implementation. 
The wastewater system selected and proposed by the developer will be evaluated by the Township as part of the Sewage Facilities Planning Module submission to determine if it is consistent with the established technology priorities and available alternatives. The applicant must submit, as part of the Sewage Facilities Planning Module, a narrative, with supporting documentation that fully describes each of the alternatives evaluated and full justification for selecting the proposed alternative for implementation.  It will also be evaluated with respect to its potential to meet the sewage facilities needs of the proposed project.  The Township will conduct a detailed design review of the proposed system in order to identify any particular concerns related to the design which would then be addressed as part of the system approval and permitting process.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT STATEMENT 

Instructions 
The primary purpose of the Environmental Assessment is to determine the impact of a project on the existing site, and the resultant changes the proposal will have on the immediate site, and surrounding area. 
In the preparation of this document keep in mind that only factual information, not subjective qualitative statements, shall be presented. 
1. 
Description of the Proposal 

Describe the proposed or recommended actions, its purpose, where it is to be located, when it is proposed to take place, and its interrelationship with other projects or proposals, including information and technical data sufficient to permit assessment of environmental impact by reviewing agencies. 

2. 
Description of the Environment 

Include a comprehensive description of the existing environment without the proposal and the probable future environment with the proposal.  This description should focus both on the environmental details most likely to be affected by the proposal and on the broader regional aspects of the environment, including ecological interrelationships. Particular attention should be given to the potential effects of past or present use of the site as a repository for toxic or hazardous wastes. 

3. 
The Environmental Impact of the Proposed Action 

Describe the environmental impacts of the proposed action. These impacts are defined as direct or indirect changes in the existing environment, both beneficial and detrimental.  Whenever possible these impacts should be quantified. This discussion should include the impact not only upon the natural environment but upon land use as well. Provide separate discussions for such potential impacts as man caused accidents and natural catastrophes and their probabilities and risks. Specific mention should also be made of unknown or partially understood impacts. 

4. 
Mitigating Measures Included in the Proposed Action 

Include a discussion of measures which are proposed to be taken to enhance, protect, or mitigate impacts upon the environment, including any associated research or monitoring. 

5. 
Any Adverse Effects Which Cannot Be Avoided Should the Proposal Be Implemented 

Include a discussion of the unavoidable adverse impacts described in 3. and 4. above, the relative values placed upon those impacts, and an analysis of who or what is affected and to what degree affected. 

6. 	
The Relationship Between Local Short-Term Uses of Man's Environment and the Maintenance and Enhancement of Long-Term Productivity 

Discuss the local short-term use of the environment involved in the proposed action in relation to its cumulative and long-term impacts and give special attention to its relationship to trends or similar actions which would significantly affect ecological interrelationships or pose long-term risk to health or safety.  Short-term and long-term do not refer to any fixed time periods, but should be viewed in terms of the various significant ecological and geophysical consequences of the proposed action. 

7. 	
Any Irreversible and Irretrievable Commitments of Resources Which Would Be Involved in the Proposed Action Should It Be Implemented 

Discuss and quantify where possible, any irrevocable uses of resources, including such things as resource extraction, erosion, destruction of archaeological or historical sites, elimination of endangered species' habitat, and significant changes in land use. 

8. 	
Alternatives to the Proposed Action 


Describe the environmental impacts, both beneficial and adverse, of the various alternatives considered.

PART 6 



DESIGN STANDARDS 

§601. 	Application. 
1. 	
The following principles, standards, and requirements shall be applied by the Board in evaluating plans for proposed subdivisions and land development. In addition, the standards set forth in Chapter 27 for the particular district in which the subdivision or land development is proposed, the provisions of this Part 6 shall govern the layout and size of lots and/or design of buildings, parking lots, and other facilities. 

2. 	
The standards and requirements outlined herein shall be considered minimum standards and requirements for the promotion of public health, safety, and general welfare. 



§602. 	General Standards. 
1. 	
The Board requires wherever practical, the use of interior streets to serve all proposed lots and will discourage, thereby, the submission of plans which provide for development of lots in "strips" fronting on Township or State roads within the Township. 

2. 	
It is the policy of the Board that land shall be suited to the purposes for which it is to be subdivided or developed. 

3. 	
Proposed subdivisions or land developments shall be coordinated with existing nearby neighborhoods both within and outside of the Township so that the community, as a whole, may develop harmoniously. Where necessary, in the opinion of the Board, joint reviews with neighboring townships shall be required. 

4. 	
In all developments, every precaution shall be taken to preserve natural and historic features. 

5. 	
Lot lines shall, where possible, follow Township boundary lines, rather than cross them. 



§603. 	Design Character. 
1. 	It is the policy of the Township that all development designs shall strive to achieve the following: 
A. 	Development grouped together on a tract of land, and each cluster of development serves as a module which is set off from others by an intervening space that helps give visual definition to each individual cluster. 
B. 	Preservation and utilization of unusual and important physical or topographical features of undeveloped land. 
C. 	Efficient use of the land and of those public facilities required to serve new residential development. 
2. 	Thoughtful and imaginative design of streets and their relationship to the arrangement and shape of lots is required. An important element is blending with the natural topography to produce curvilinear designs and reasonable grades. The rectilinear design of streets and lots involving long straight sections of street should be avoided unless clearly indicated otherwise by existing development patterns. 

§604. 	Street System. 
1. 	
Proposed streets shall be properly related to such street plans or parts thereof as have been officially prepared and adopted by the Township, including recorded subdivision plans and the Official Map of the Township. 

2. 	
Proposed streets shall conform to such Township, County, and State road and highway plans as have been prepared and adopted. 

3. 	
Local streets shall be laid out so as to discourage through traffic, but provision for street connections into and from adjacent areas will be required. 

4. 	
If lots resulting from original subdivisions are large enough for resubdivision, or if a portion of the tract is not subdivided, adequate street rights-of-way to permit further subdivision shall be provided. 

5. 	
Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed Township or State road, the Township may require dedication of additional right-of-way to provide the minimum right­of-way specified hereinafter.  Marginal access streets, rear service alleys, reverse frontage lots, or such other treatment as will provide protection for abutting properties, reduction in the number of intersections with the major thoroughfare and separation of local and through traffic are encountered. 

6. 	
New half or partial streets shall not be permitted, except where essential to reasonable subdivision of a tract in conformance with the other requirements and standards of this Chapter 22 and where, in addition, dedication of the remaining part of the street has been secured. Wherever a tract to be subdivided borders an existing half or partial street, the other part of the street shall be plotted within such tract. Where half or partial streets are proposed, the acceptance of Final Plans shall be conditioned upon the provision of guarantees providing for the construction or completion of such streets to Township standards. 

7. 	
Dead-end streets shall be prohibited, except as stubs to permit future street extension into adjoining tracts, or when designed as a cul-de-sac. 

8. 	
Continuation of existing streets shall be known by the same name, but names for other streets shall not duplicate or closely resemble names for existing streets in the Township and/or Post Office District. The Board may reject street names and suggest alternate names. 

9. 	
Where streets and other public improvements continue into adjoining municipalities, evidence of compatibility of design, particularly with regard to street widths, shall be submitted. The applicant shall coordinate such design with both municipalities to avoid abrupt changes in cartway width or in improvements. 

10. 	
Private streets shall be discouraged. They may be approved only if they are designed to meet public street standards and all other applicable requirements of this Chapter 22. An 

ownership and maintenance agreement concerning the private street shall be recorded with the final plan. 

11. 	
The proposed street system shall extend existing or recorded streets at the same width but in no case at less than the required minimum width. 

12. 	
Where, in the opinion of the Board, it is desirable to provide for street access to an adjoining property, the applicant shall create and provide a right-of-way between the proposed internal street right-of-way and the adjoining property line which right-of-way shall meet the applicable requirements of the Zoning Ordinance (Chapter 27) and this Chapter 22. The right-of-way so created shall be shown on the subdivision and/or land development plan and shall be described by bearings and distances. The property line for each lot abutting thereon shall extend to the center of the right-of-way.  The deed for each affected lot shall contain a description, including bearings and distances, of the right-of-way and language giving notice that no permanent structures, trees, plants or other objects may be erected or maintained within the limits of the right-of-way. Further, the deed shall contain language which states the right-of-way is continuously offered for dedication to the Township and that no compensation is due the property owner should the Township exercise its option to accept dedication at anytime in the future. 

13. 	
Where a subdivision abuts an existing street of improper alignment, the Board may require the dedication of land sufficient to correct the misalignment. 

14. 	
Streets shall be logically related to the topography so as to produce usable lots, reasonable grades, and proper alignment and drainage. 

15. 	
Where a subdivision abuts an existing street, and drainage problems are created or improvements are required due to increased traffic, the existing street and both of its sides shall be improved as a responsibility of the subdivider himself, or by means of sufficient funds escrowed for use by the Township to execute such improvement. 

16. 	
When reservations for future streets will adjoin lots to be developed prior to the construction of the streets, the developer shall establish the proposed grades of the future streets and the extent of the area necessary for the construction of those streets.  If the area necessary for the construction of the streets extends beyond the proposed street right-of­way lines, all excavation and grading necessary for the roads beyond the right-of-way lines shall be done in conjunction with the subdivision which contains the adjoining lots.  Alternatively, construction easements shall be provided on the adjoining lots, sufficient to permit construction of the future street. 

17. 	
For all subdivisions and land developments for which only one means of ingress and egress is proposed, the Board may require, where deemed necessary in the public interest and for the public safety, the provision of additional street or access drive access meeting Township standards or the provision of an alternate means of ingress and egress meeting Township standards which could be used by emergency vehicles if the primary means of ingress and egress were rendered unusable. Such alternate means of ingress and egress shall be of such width and improved to such an extent to be usable by emergency vehicles, and shall not be used for structures, trees, or similar obstructions. 

18. 	
All access drives within multiple family and nonresidential developments which are intended for circulation within the development shall be designed to the horizontal and vertical alignment standards found in this Chapter 22 for streets. 

19. 	
Any street not fully constructed for its entire length shall terminate in a temporary cul-de­sac or other turnaround configuration and shall be constructed as if it were to be a permanent street its entire length, including the turnaround area, and meet all applicable provisions of this Chapter 22 and also Chapter 27 to include installation of all utilities, stormwater control devices, grading, surfacing and so forth. 


The temporary cul-de-sac or other turnaround configuration shall be completely removed and the area restored upon construction of the street beyond the temporary cul-de-sac or other turnaround configuration. 

§605. 	Cul-De-Sac Streets. 
1. 	Cul-de-sac streets permanently designed as such shall not exceed one thousand (1000') feet 
in length nor shalltheybe less than two hundred and fifty(250’)feet in length and shallbe 
provided at the closed end with a paved turnaround having a minimum diameter to the outer pavement edge of eighty (80') feet.  Right-of-way shall have a minimum diameter of one hundred (100') feet within the turnaround areas.  The Board may allow cul-de-sacs up to sixteen hundred (1600') feet in length based upon topography or other characteristics of the site.  
2. 	
Unless future extension is clearly impractical or undesirable, the turn-around right-of-way shall be placed adjacent to a property line and a right-of-way of the same width as the street shall be carried to the boundary of the subdivision in such a way as to permit future extension of the street into the adjoining tract. 

3. 	
The small triangles of land between the cul-de-sac and the boundary shall be maintained by the adjoining property owners. 

4. 	
The center line grade on the cul-de-sac turning area shall not exceed four (4%) percent. 

5. 	
Drainage of cul-de-sac shall preferably be toward the open end. 

6. 	
The maximum number of dwelling units that may be served by a cul-de-sac street shall be 25, regardless of the configuration of such dwelling units. 


§606. 	Street Width. 
1. 	The rights-of-way for all new streets in the Township shall be as specified in Appendix H 
but in no event less than fifty (50’) feet. 
2. 	
Typical street, road, intersection, curb and sidewalk details are shown as Appendices E, F and G. 

3. 	
Additional rights-of-way and cartway widths may be required by the Board for the following purposes: 


A. 	To promote public safety and convenience. 
B. 	To provide parking space in commercial districts and in areas of High Density Residential Development. 

§607. 	Street Alignment. 
1. 	
Whenever street lines are deflected in excess of two (2°) degrees, connection shall be made by horizontal curves 

2. 	
To insure adequate sight distance, minimum center line radii for horizontal curves shall be at least: 


A. 	Local streets:  two hundred (200') feet. 
B. 	Other Street Classifications:  five hundred (500') feet. 
The centerline radii shall correspond to the required design speed per Appendix H and AASHTO. 
3. 	A tangent of at least one hundred (100') feet measured at the center line shall be required between reverse curves. 

§608. 	Street Grades. 
1. 	Vertical Alignment. Vertical street alignments shall be measured along the centerline. The minimum grade of all streets shall be one percent (1%). The maximum grade shall be as listed in Appendix H. 
A. 	Vertical Curves shall be used in changes in grade exceeding one percent (1%). The minimum length (in feet) of vertical curves shall be fifteen (15) times the algebraic difference in grade.  For example, if a three percent (3%) upgrade is followed by a four percent (4%) downgrade, the algebraic difference in grade is 7 [+3-(-4)=7]; the minimum length of the vertical curve would be 105 feet [15x7=105]. 
B. 	Where the approaching grade exceeds six percent (6%) on any or all streets at a four-way street intersection, or the terminating street at a three-way intersection, a leveling area shall be provided on the street(s) with such excessive grade. Such leveling area(s) shall have a maximum grade of four percent (4%) for minimum length of seventy-five (75) feet measured from the intersection of the centerlines. 
C. 	The grade within the diameter of a turnaround at the terminus of a permanent cul­de-sac shall not exceed five percent (5%). 
D. 	All new streets shall be graded to the right-of-way line. 
E. 	All cut and fill slopes shall be a minimum of 3:1. 
F. 	Vertical curves shall correspond to the required design speed as listed in Appendix H and by ASSHTO. 
G. 	The following minimum sight distances shall be maintained: 
(1) 	
Local streets: two hundred (200’)feet. 

(2)

The Board may require guide rail to be placed for protection on embankments when a barrier is required in Design Manual Part 2 Highway Design by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, January 1990 edition as amended or replaced. 

2. 	
Fixed obstructions along streets which would require guide rail shall be precluded or minimized. The Board may require guide rail to be placed when a barrier is required for fixed objects in Design Manual Part 2 Highway Design by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, January 1990 edition as amended or replaced. 

3. 	
The design and selection of guide rail shall be in accordance with the standards in Design Manual Part 2 Highway Design, January 1990 edition as amended or replaced, however, the Board shall determine the suitability of all guide rail systems. The Board may require wooden guide rail when deemed appropriate because of the rural, historic, or scenic nature of an area. 




PART 6A 
RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND 
OPEN SPACE DELINEATION STANDARDS 

§633. 	Applicability. 
The standards for resource conservation and open space delineation, as set forth in this Article, shall apply to all subdivision and land developments in West Sadsbury Township. 

§634. 	Planning and Design Standards. 
1. 	
General Standards to Minimize Adverse Impacts. All subdivisions and land developments shall avoid or minimize adverse impacts on the municipality's natural, cultural and historic resources, as defined below. 

2. 	
Groundwater Resources. Thissection is intended to ensurethat West SadsburyTownship’s groundwater resources are protected for purposes of providing water supplies for its residents and businesses, and to protect the base flow of the Township’s surface waters. These regulations shall be applied in conjunction with those provided for in other sections of this ordinance, dealing with groundwater conservation and replenishment. 


A. 	The proposed subdivision and land development of any tract shall be designed to cause the least practicable disturbance to natural infiltration and percolation of precipitation to the groundwater table, through careful planning of vegetation and land disturbance activities, and the placement of streets, buildings and other impervious surfaces in locations other than those identified on the Existing Resources and Site Analysis Plan as having the greatest permeability where precipitation is most likely to infiltrate and recharge the groundwater. 
B. 	All new development or expansion of existing development in West Sadsbury Township shall attempt to provide a non-negative hydrologic balance, pre-and post-development. Any reduction in the groundwater recharge resulting from the construction of new impervious surfaces, alteration of grading and drainage, loss of vegetation, construction of sanitary and storm sewers, and/or modification from any other pre-development condition, plus any groundwater consumed for water supply or other purposes, shall attempt to be compensated for by the increased infiltration of precipitation and wastewater effluent into the soil mantle. This recharge system shall utilize design and engineering standards and techniques approved by the Supervisors upon recommendations after review by the Township Engineer.  
C. 	Pre-development and post-development water balance calculations must be made to determine the resultant impact on groundwater resources.  Typically, the impact of changed site conditions must be estimated by using average rainfall, total disturbance acreage, and appropriate soil cover factors as applied in the “Cover­
Complex Method” developed bythe SoilConservation Service, or another method 
acceptable to the Township Engineer.  This calculation will provide an estimate of increased stormwater runoff resulting from development and therefore the net reduction in groundwater recharge. The estimate shall be developed on an average annual basis, in inches and gallons. If groundwater withdrawals are being undertaken for water supply or other purposes, this quantity also must be considered as a debit for the groundwater system. The difference between the pre-development and post-development conditions equals the total debit which must be balanced through modifications to stormwater management techniques or to wastewater effluent application which mitigate the total loss of groundwater recharge, where possible. 
3. 	Stream Valleys, Swales, Springs, and Other Lowland Areas. TheTownship’s Open Space, Recreation and Environmental Resources Plan describes and maps stream valleys (which include stream channels and flood plains), swales, springs and other lowland areas as resources that warrant restrictive land use controls because of flooding hazards to human life and property, their ground water recharge functions, their importance to water quality and the health of aquatic communities, and their wildlife habitats. They are generally poorly suited for on-site subsurface sewage disposal systems. 
A. 	The following activities shall be minimized: 
(1) 	
Disturbance to streams and drainage swales. 

(2) 	
Disturbance to year-round wetlands, areas with seasonally high water tables, and areas of surface water concentration. 

(3) 	
Because of their extreme limitations, stream valleys, swales and other lowland areas warrant designation as open space lands. They may also require adjoining buffer lands to be included in the open space, to be determined by an analysis of the protection requirements of such areas on a case-by-case basis. In certain instances, seasonal high water table soils may be excluded from the open space where it can be demonstrated that they are suitable for low density residential uses and conventional on-site sewage systems. 


4. 	Woodlands. Woodlands are found throughout the Township, often in association with stream valleys and wet areas, poor and erodible agricultural soils, and moderate to steep slopes. 
A. 	Woodland conditions within West Sadsbury Township vary with respect to species composition, age, stocking, and health. They range from relatively recent post-agricultural young stands to mature mixed-age forests. Most woodlands in the Township represent one or more of the following resource values: 
(1) 	
As soil stabilizers, particularly on moderate to steep slopes, thereby controlling erosion into nearby streams, ponds, impoundments and roads. A closely related function is their enhancement of ground water recharge. 

(2) 	
As a means of ameliorating harsh microclimatic conditions, in both summer and winter. 

(3) 	
As a source of wood products, i.e., poles, sawtimber, veneer and firewood. 

(4) 	
As habitats for woodland birds, mammals and other wildlife. 

(5) 	
As recreation resources for walkers, equestrians, picnickers and other related outdoor activities. 

(6) 	
As visual buffers between areas of development and adjacent roads and properties.  

B. 	
Because of their resource values, all woodlands on any tract proposed for subdivision or land development shall be evaluated by the applicant to determine the extent to which such woodlands should be designated partly or entirely as open space or development lands. Evaluation criteria shall include: 

(1) 	
Configuration and size. 

(2) 	
Present conditions, i.e., stocking, health and species composition. 

(3) 	
Site potential, i.e., the site's capabilities to support woodlands, based upon its topographic, soil and hydrologic characteristics.  

(4) 	
Ecological functions: i.e., in protecting steep slopes, erodible soils, maintaining stream quality and providing for wildlife habitats. 

(5) 	
Relationship to woodlands on adjoining and nearby properties and the potential for maintaining continuous woodland areas. 

C. 	
The evaluation of the tract's woodlands shall be undertaken by a forester, landscape architect, horticulturist or another qualified professional acceptable to the municipality. This evaluation shall be submitted as a report and made a part of the application for a preliminary plan. At a minimum, that report shall include one or more maps indicating boundaries and conditions of woodland areas accompanied by a report addressing the criteria in paragraph 1 above. 

D. 	
In designing a subdivision and land development plan for any tract, the applicant shall be guided by the following standards: 

(1) 	
Healthy woodlands exceeding one acre shall be preserved and designated as open space areas, to the maximum extent possible. Proposed site improvements shall be located, designed and constructed to minimize the loss or degradation of woodland areas. 

(2) 	
Subdivisions shall be designed to preserve woodlands along roadways, property lines and lines occurring within a site such as streams, swales, stone fences and hedgerows. Such lines and the native vegetation associated with them shall be preserved as buffers between adjacent properties and between areas being subdivided within a property. Preservation shall include ground, shrub, understory and canopy vegetation. 

(3) 	
Disturbance or removal of woodlands occupying environmentally sensitive areas shall be undertaken only when approved by the Board and on a limited, selective basis to minimize the adverse impacts of such actions. This shall include but not necessarily be limited to, vegetation performing 

important soil stabilizing functions on wet soils, stream banks and sloping lands. 

(4) 	
No clearing or earth disturbance (except for minimal disturbance needed to perform soil analysis for proposed sewage disposal systems) shall be permitted on a site before the completion of subdivision and land development agreements. The determination of sight distance clearances along roadways shall be made graphically and not by clearing on-site prior to final plan approval. 


5. 	Upland Rural-Agricultural Areas. These areas comprise fields, pastures, meadows, and former agricultural areas in early stages of woodlands succession, with fences, stone walls, and hedgerows, typically bordered by stream valleys and upland woodlands. These comprise the Township’s historic working landscape, dotted with historic houses, barns and other structures and give West Sadsbury Township much of its rural character. They also contain the greatest concentration of prime agricultural soils. Because of their openness and high visibility, development in these areas is likely to be most readily seen and disruptive to the historic landscape. They sometimes provide habitat for wildlife, in conjunction with nearby woodlands and stream valleys. However, it is recognized that these areas also frequently offer the fewest constraints for development. 
A. 	Several elements of these working landscapes lend themselves to incorporation into 
the Township’s open space network. These include prime agricultural soils and 
natural features which visually punctuate the landscape, such as hedgerows, tree copses, stone walls, and visually prominent places such as knolls and hilltops. 
B. 	These areas can also accommodate development, with preferred locations being the non-prime agricultural soils and lower topographic settings where development will be visually less obtrusive. Compact clustered residential designs, with coordinated architectural and landscape architectural themes, are encouraged in highly visible locations where future development cannot be avoided (such as at the far edge of open fields). 
6. 	Slopes. Moderately steep sloping lands fifteen percent to twenty-five percent (15% to 25%) and steeply sloping lands (over 25%) are prone to severe erosion if disturbed. Erosion and the resulting overland flow of soil sediments into streams, ponds and public roads, are detrimental to water quality and aquatic life, and a potential hazard to public safety. 
A. 	Areas of steep slope shall be preserved in accordance with the Zoning Ordinance and as required below. 
B. 	All grading and earthmoving on slopes exceeding fifteen percent (15%) shall be minimized. 
C. 	No site disturbance shall be allowed on slopes exceeding twenty-five percent (25%) except grading for a portion of a driveway accessing a single family dwelling when it can be demonstrated that no other routing which avoids slopes exceeding twenty-five percent (25%) is feasible. 
D. 	On slopes of fifteen percent to twenty-five percent (15% to 25%), the only permitted grading beyond the terms described above, shall be in conjunction with the siting of a single family dwelling, its access driveway and the septic system (which should typically be designed with a long, narrow drainage field following the land contours. 
E. 	Grading or earthmoving on all sloping lands of fifteen percent (15%) or greater shall not result in earth cuts or fills whose highest vertical dimension exceeds six feet, except where in the judgment of the Board no reasonable alternatives exist for construction of roads, drainage structures and other public improvements, in which case such vertical dimensions shall not exceed twelve (12) feet. Roads and driveways shall follow the line of existing topography to minimize the required cut and fill. Finished slopes of all cuts and fills shall be as required to minimize disturbance of natural grades. 
7. 	Significant Natural Areas and Features. Natural areas containing rare or endangered plants and animals, as well as other features of natural significance exist throughout West Sadsbury Township. Some of these features and areas have been carefully documented by the Pennsylvania Natural Diversity Inventory (PNDI), whereas for others, only their general locations are known. Subdivision applicants shall take all reasonable measures to protect significant natural areas and features either identified by the Township’s Comprehensive Open Space and Recreation Recommendations Map found in the Township’s Open Space, Recreation and Environmental Resources Plan or by the applicant's Existing Resources and Site Analysis Plan by incorporating them into proposed open space areas or avoiding their disturbance in areas proposed for development. 
8. 	Historic Structures and Sites. West SadsburyTownship’s documented historical resources begin with settlement in the early 18th century and extend through its colonial agricultural, residential and industrial development in the late 18th and 19th centuries. Many of the Township’s historic structures and sites remain intact. 
A. 	All subdivisions and land developments shall comply with Part 8D of the Zoning 
Ordinance, “Historic Resource Impact Study and Mitigation.” 
B. 	Plans requiring subdivision and land development approval shall be designed to protect existing historic resources of all classes. The protection of an existing historic resource shall include the conservation of the landscape immediately associated with and significant to that resource, to preserve its historic context. Where, in the opinion of the Board, a plan will have an impact upon an historic resource, the developer shall mitigate that impact to the satisfaction of the Board by modifying the design, relocating proposed lot lines, providing landscape buffers, or other approved means. 
C. 	Municipal participation, review and approval of the applicant's interaction with the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission with regard to the preservation of historic resources, as required for DEP approval of proposed sewage disposal systems, shall be required prior to Final Plan approval. 
9. 	
Scenic Roads and Scenic Vistas. The Township’s Open Space, Recreation and Environmental Resources Plan identifies a number of scenic roads in various parts of the municipality. All applications for subdivision and land development shall attempt to preserve the scenic visual corridors along such roads by incorporating them into open space 

areas or otherwise providing for building setbacks and architectural designs to minimize their intrusion. In instances where such designs fail to satisfactorily protect corridors, applicants will be required to provide naturalistic landscape buffers to minimize their adverse visual impacts. The species specified for such buffers shall be selected on the basis of an inventory of tree and shrub species found in existing hedgerows and along wooded roadside edges in the vicinity of the development proposal. 

10. 	
Trails. When a subdivision or land development proposal is traversed by or abuts an existing trail customarily used by pedestrians and/or equestrians, the Board may require the applicant to make provisions for continued recreational use of the trail. 


A. 	The applicant may alter the course of the trail within the tract for which development is proposed under the following conditions: 
(1) 	
The points at which the trail enters and exits the tract remain unchanged. 

(2) 	
The proposed alteration exhibits quality trail design according to generally accepted principles of landscape architecture (For example: Bureau of State Parks publication Non-Motorized Trails). 

(3) 	
The proposed alteration does not coincide with a paved road intended for use by motorized vehicles. 

B. 	
When trails are intended for public or private use, they shall be protected by a permanent conservation easement on the properties on which they are located. The width of the protected area in which the trail is located should be a minimum of ten  

(10) 
feet. The language of the conservation easement shall be to the satisfaction of the Board of Supervisors upon recommendation of the West Sadsbury Township Solicitor. 

C. 	
The land area permanently designated for trails for public use may be credited toward open space land requirements of Chapter 27, the West Sadsbury Township Zoning Ordinance. 

D. 	
An applicant may propose and develop a new trail. If said trail is available for use by the general public and connects with an existing trail, the land area protected for said trail may be credited toward the open space requirement described in the RLD, RMD and RU Zoning Districts of Chapter 27, the West Sadsbury Township Zoning Ordinance. 

E. 	
Trails shall be designed in accordance with the specifications of the Chester County Park and Recreation Department. 

F. 	
Trails shall have a vertical clearance of no less than ten (10) feet. 

G. 	
Width of the trail surface may vary depending upon type of use to be accommodated, but in no case shall be less than three (3) feet or greater than six (6) feet. 

H. 	
No trail shall be designed with the intent to accommodate motorized vehicles. 


§635. 	Design Process For Residential Subdivisions With Open Space Lands. 
1. 	
Resource Inventory and Analysis. The tract's resources shall be delineated on an Existing Resources and Site Analysis Plan, as required in §402 and §403. 

2. 	
Four-Step Design Process. Following the resource inventory and analysis, all residential subdivisions with open space lands shall generally follow a four-step design process as described below. Applicants will be required to document the design process as described in §402. 


A. 	Step 1:  Delineation of Open Space Lands. 
(1) 	Proposed open space lands shall be designated using the required density and open space calculations for the selected design option as set forth in the corresponding zoning district in Chapter 27, the West Sadsbury Township 
Zoning Ordinance. The Township’s Comprehensive Municipal Environmental Resources Map and the Open Space, Recreation and Environmental Resources Plan shall also be referenced and considered. 
(2) 	
All lands deducted from the gross tract area to determine the Adjusted Tract Area (ATA), shall be delineated in their entirety as “Constrained Land.” 

(3) 	
Class A Open Space lands shall consist of flood plains, wetlands, and slopes greater than twenty-five percent (25%), which are Primary Resource Conservation Areas. All Primary Resource Conservation Areas shall be contained within the open space lands. 

(4) 	
Class B Open Space lands shall consist of all other resources contained in the Constrained Land calculation, and are considered Secondary Resource Conservation Areas.  

(5) 	
The locations and boundaries of Primary Resource Conservation Areas shall follow the actual boundaries of floodplains, wetlands and slopes. 

(6) 	
The locations and boundaries of Secondary Resource Conservation Areas shall be based upon the applicant's analysis of the tract's resource features, using the design standards in Section 403. The applicant shall also be guided by any written recommendations provided by the municipality regarding the delineation of Secondary Resource Conservation Areas lands, following the Site Inspection or the Pre-Sketch Conference. 

(7) 	
Development areas constitute the remaining lands of the tract outside of the designated open space areas, where house sites, streets and lots are to be delineated in accordance with steps 2, 3 and 4 below. 

B. 	
Step 2:  Location of House Sites. 

(1) 	
Applicants shall identify house site locations in the tract's designated development areas, designed to: fit the tract's natural topography, served by adequate water and sewerage facilities, and provide views of and access to adjoining open space areas (without encroaching upon them in a manner visually intrusive to users of such areas). House sites shall be located no closer than one hundred (100) feet and fifty (50) feet from Primary Resource and Secondary Resource Conservation Areas, respectively. 

C. 	
Step 3:  Alignment of Streets and Trails. 

(1) 	
After house site locations have been identified, applicants shall delineate a street system to provide vehicular access to each house in a manner conforming to the tract's natural topography and providing for a safe pattern of circulation and ingress and egress to and from the tract. 

(2) 	
Streets shall avoid or at least minimize adverse impacts on the open space areas. Wetland crossings and new streets or driveways traversing slopes over fifteen percent (15%) shall be avoided. 

(3) 	
Street connections shall generally be encouraged to minimize the number of new cul-de-sacs to be maintained by the municipality and to facilitate easy access to and from homes in different parts of the tract (and on adjoining parcels). 

(4) 	
A tentative network of trails shall also be shown, connecting streets with various natural and cultural features in the conserved greenway lands. Potential trail connections to adjacent parcels shall also be shown, in areas where a municipal trail network is envisioned. 

D. 	
Step 4:  Design of Lot Lines. 


Lot lines for the subdivision shall be drawn as the last step in the design procedure. They should follow the configuration of house sites and streets in a logical and flexible manner. 

§636. 	Open Space Design Review Standards. 
1. 	Prioritized List of Resources to be Conserved. The design of open space lands in any subdivision or land development plan shall reflect the standards set forth in Section 601, and, to the fullest extent possible, incorporate any of the following resources if they occur on the tract (listed in order of significance): 
A. 	Stream channels, floodplains, wet soils, swales, springs and other lowland areas, including adjacent buffer areas which may be required to insure their protection. 
B. 	Significant natural areas of species listed as endangered, threatened, or of special concern, such as those listed in the Pennsylvania Natural Diversity Inventory. 
C. 	Moderate to steep slopes, particularly those adjoining water courses and ponds, where disturbance and resulting soil erosion and sedimentation could be detrimental to water quality. 
D. 	Healthy woodlands, particularly those performing important ecological functions such as soil stabilization and protection of streams, wetlands and wildlife habitats. 
E. 	Areas where precipitation is most likely to recharge local groundwater resources because of topographic and soil conditions affording high rates of infiltration and percolation. 
F. 	Hedgerows, groups of trees, large individual trees of botanic significance, and other vegetational features representing the site's rural past. 
G. 	Class I, II and III agricultural soils as defined by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service. 
H. 	Historic structures and sites. 
I. 	Visually prominent topographic features such as knolls, hilltops and ridges, and scenic viewsheds as seen from public roads (particularly those with historic features). 
J. 	Existing trails connecting the tract to other locations in the municipality. 
2. 	Other Design Considerations. The configuration of proposed open space lands set aside for common use in residential subdivisions shall comply with the following standards: 
A. 	They shall be free of all structures except historic buildings, stone walls, and structures related to open space uses. The Board may grant approval of structures and improvements required for storm drainage, sewage treatment and water supply within the open space provided that such facilities would not be detrimental to the open space (and that the acreage of lands required for such uses is not credited towards minimum open space acreage requirements for the tract, unless the land they occupy is appropriate for passive recreational use). 
B. 	They shall not include parcels smaller than three (3) acres, have a length-to-width ratio of less than 4:1, or be less than seventy-five (75) feet in width, except for such lands specifically designed as neighborhood greens, playing fields or trail links. 
C. 	They shall be directly accessible to the largest practicable number of lots within the subdivision. Non-adjoining lots shall be provided with safe and convenient pedestrian access to open space land. 
D. 	They shall be suitable for active recreational uses to the extent deemed necessary by the Board, without interfering with adjacent dwelling units, parking, driveways, and roads. 
E. 	They shall be interconnected wherever possible to provide a continuous network of open space lands within and adjoining the subdivision. 
F. 	They shall provide buffers to adjoining parks, preserves or other protected lands. 
G. 	Except in those cases where part of the open space area is located within private houselots, they shall provide for pedestrian pathways for use by the residents of the subdivision. Consideration shall be given to providing for public access on such trails if they are linked to other publicly-accessible pathway systems within the municipality. Provisions should be made for access to the open space lands, as required for land management and emergency purposes. 
H. 	They shall be undivided by public or private streets, except where necessary for proper traffic circulation. 
I. 	They shall be suitably landscaped either by retaining existing natural cover and wooded areas and/or according to a landscaping plan to protect open space resources. 
J. 	They shall be made subject to such agreement with the municipality and such conservation easements duly recorded in the office of the Chester County Recorder of Deeds as may be required by the Board for the purpose of preserving the common open space for such uses. 
K. 	They shall be consistent with the municipality's Comprehensive Plan and its Open Space, Recreation and Environmental Resources Plan. 
3. 	Ownership and Maintenance. Applicants shall demonstrate compliance with open space ownership and maintenance standards in Part 11B of the Zoning Ordinance. 

§637. 	Resource Conservation Standards for Site Preparation and Cleanup. 
1. 	Conservation Practices During Site Preparation and Clean-Up. 
A. 	Protection of Vegetation from Mechanical Injury. Where earthwork, grading, or construction activities will take place in or adjacent to woodlands, old fields or other significant vegetation or site features, the Board may require that the limit of disturbance be delineated and vegetation protected through installation of temporary fencing or other approved measures. Such fencing shall be installed prior to commencing of and shall be maintained throughout the period of construction activity. 
B. 	Protection of Vegetation from Grading Change. Grade changes to occur at any location of the property shall not result in an alteration to soil or drainage conditions which would adversely affect existing vegetation to be retained following site disturbance, unless adequate provisions are made to protect such vegetation and its root systems. 
C. 	Protection of Vegetation from Excavations 
(1) 	
When digging trenches for utility lines or similar uses, disturbances to the root zones of all woody vegetation shall be minimized. 

(2) 	
If trenches must be excavated in the root zone, all disturbed roots shall be cut as cleanly as possible. The trench shall be backfilled immediately following installation of the utility line. 

D. 	
Protection of Topsoil 

(1) 	
No topsoil shall be removed from the site. 

(2) 	
Prior to grading operations or excavation, topsoil in the area to be disturbed shall be removed and stored on site. 

(3) 	
Topsoil removed shall be redistributed and stabilized immediately following the establishment of required grades for a project or project phase. All exposed earth surfaces shall be stabilized by hydroseeding on slopes of less than ten percent (10%), and by sodding, hydroseeding, or rip-rap on slopes exceeding ten percent (10%). 

(4) 	
Grading and earthmoving operations shall be scheduled to minimize site disturbance during the period from November 1 to April 1, when revegation of exposed ground is difficult. 


PART 7 
MODIFICATION AND/OR WAIVER OF REQUIREMENTS AND STANDARDS 

§701. 	Roads. 
Standards for roads included in this Chapter 22 are intended to provide for safe and intelligent layout of streets which can be easily maintained. There are several aspects which may lead to varying the size or design of specific streets. 
1. 	Road Width. 
A. 	Where a street is designed as a minor residential street and overflow parking is provided, a reduction in width may be permitted. 
B. 	Where a street is utilized for residential parking, an increase in width will be required. 
2. 	
Right-of-Way Width. Right-of-way width is intended to provide enough land for roads, sidewalks, or other utilities. Secondly, it is intended to provide an additional buffer between homes and streets. Where sidewalks are not constructed along streets, cartway widths may be reduced where utilities are located outside of the right-of-way, or where houses do not front on the street, a reduction in the width of the right-of-way may be permitted. 

3. 	
Curbs. Curbs are used to channel water to storm water systems and to keep cars in the cartway. In low-intensity developments, natural drainage should be encouraged. The soils and topography will be considered.  Swales should be saucer-shaped in profile and seeded to prevent erosion. 

4. 	
Design Speed. In the case of local streets, the Board may allow a design speed less than thirty (30) miles per hour, provided the street will be posted with a maximum speed limit no greater than the design speed. Horizontal and vertical alignment of the street shall correspond to AASHTO standards for the permitted design speed. 



§702. 	Sidewalks. 
Sidewalks are intended to provide a safe means of movement for pedestrians. Modern design practice encourages placing sidewalks away from streets. In doing so, the function of sidewalks must be kept in mind. First, the walks must be all-weather and easily cleared of snow. Second, they must be convenient and facilitate their intended use, such as children walking to school bus stops. Where deemed appropriate by the Board, one or both sidewalks within street rights-of-way may be eliminated.  
PART 8 



CONSTRUCTION AND ACCEPTANCE OF PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS 
§801. 	Completion of Improvements or Guarantee Thereof Prerequisite to Final Plat Approval. 
1. 	No plat shall be finally approved unless the streets shown on such plat have been improved to a mud-free or otherwise permanently passable condition, or improved as may be otherwise required by this Chapter 22 and any walkways, curbs, gutters, street lights, fire hydrants, shade trees, water mains, sanitary sewers, storm sewers and other improvements as may be required by this Chapter 22 have been installed in accordance with this Chapter 
22. In lieu of the completion of any improvements required as a condition for the final approval of a plat, including improvements or fees otherwise required by this Chapter 22, the developer may deposit with the Township of West Sadsbury financial security in an amount sufficient to cover the costs of such improvements or common amenities including basins and other related drainage facilities, recreational facilities, open space improve­ments, or buffer or screen plantings which may be required. 
2. 	
When requested by the developer, in order to facilitate financing, the Board, shall furnish the developer with a signed copy of a resolution indicating approval of the final plat contingent upon the developer obtaining a satisfactory financial security.  The final plat or record plan shall not be signed nor recorded until the financial improvements agreement is executed. The resolution or letter of contingent approval shall expire and be deemed to be revoked if the financial security agreement is not executed within ninety (90) days unless a written extension is granted by the Board; such extension shall not be unreasonably withheld and shall be placed in writing at the request of the developer. 

3. 	
Without limitation as to other types of financial security which the Board may approve, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, Federal or Commonwealth chartered lending institution irrevocable letters of credit and restrictive or escrow accounts in such lending institutions shall be deemed acceptable financial security for the purposes of this Part 8. 

4. 	
Such financial security shall be posted with a bonding company or Federal or Commonwealth chartered lending institution chosen by the party posting the financial security, provided said bonding company or lending institution is authorized to conduct such business within the Commonwealth. 

5. 	
Such bond, or other security shall provide for, and secure to the public the completion of any improvements which may be required on or before the date fixed in the formal action of approval or accompanying agreement for completion of the improvements. 

6. 	
The amount of financial security to be posted for the completion of the required improvements shall be equal to one hundred ten (110%) percent of the cost of completion estimated as of ninety (90) days following the date scheduled for completion by the developer. Annually, the Board may adjust the amount of the financial security by 

comparing the actual cost of the improvements which have been completed and the estimated cost for the completion of the remaining improvements as of the expiration of the ninetieth (90th) day after either the original date scheduled for completion or a rescheduled date of completion. Subsequent to said adjustment, the Board may require the developer to post additional security in order to assure that the financial security equals said one hundred ten (110%) percent. Any additional security shall be posted by the developer in accordance with this Part 8. 

7. 	
The amount of financial security required shall be based upon an estimate of the cost of completion of the required improvements, submitted by the applicant or developer and prepared by a professional engineer licensed as such in this Commonwealth and certified by such engineer to be a fair and reasonable estimate of such cost including an allowance and line item for removal of rock that may be encountered during construction. The Board, upon the recommendation of the Township engineer, may refuse to accept such estimate for good cause shown. If the applicant or developer and the Board are unable to agree upon an estimate, then the estimate shall be recalculated and recertified by another professional engineer licensed as such in this Commonwealth and chosen mutually by the Board and the applicant or developer. The estimate certified by the third (3rd) engineer shall be presumed fair and reasonable and shall be the final estimate.  In the event that a third (3rd) engineer is so chosen, fees for the services of said engineer shall be paid equally by the Board and the applicant or developer. 

8. 	
If the party posting the financial security requires more than one (1) year from the date of posting of the financial security to complete the required improvements, the amount of financial security may be increased by an additional ten (10%) percent for each one (1) year period beyond the first anniversary date from posting of financial security or to an amount not exceeding one hundred ten (110%) percent of the cost of completing the required improvements as reestablished on or about the expiration of the preceding one (1) year period by using the above bidding procedure. 

9. 	
In the case where development is projected over a period of years, the Board may authorize submission of final plats by sections or stages of development subject to such requirements or guarantees as to improvements in future section or stages of development as it finds essential for the protection of any finally approved section of the development. 

10. 	
As the work of installing the required improvements proceeds, the party posting the financial security may request the Board to release or authorize the release, from time to time, of such portions of the financial security necessary for payment to the contractor or contractors performing the work. Any such requests shall be in writing addressed to the Board, and the Board shall have forty-five (45) days from receipt of such request within which to allow the Township engineer to certify, in writing, to the Board that such portion of the work upon the improvements has been completed in accordance with the approved plat. Upon such certification the Board shall authorize release by the bonding company or lending institution of an amount as estimated by the Township engineer fairly representing the value of the improvements completed or, if the Board fails to act within said forty-five 


(45) day period, the Board shall be deemed to have approved the release of funds as requested. The Board may, prior to final release at the time of completion and certification by its engineer, require retention of ten (10%) percent of the estimated cost of the aforesaid improvements. 
11. 	
Where the Board accepts dedication of all or some of the required improvements following completion, the Board may require the posting of financial security to secure structural integrity of said improvements as well as the functioning of said improvements in accordance with the design and specifications as depicted on the final plat for a term not to exceed eighteen (18) months from the date of acceptance of dedication. Said financial security shall be of the same type as otherwise required in this Section with regard to installation of such improvements, and the amount of the financial security shall not exceed fifteen (15%) percent of the actual cost of installation of said improvements. 

12. 	
If water mains or sanitary sewer lines, or both, along with apparatus or facilities related thereto, are to be installed under the jurisdiction and pursuant to the rules and regulations of a public utility or municipal authority separate and distinct from the Township of West Sadsbury, financial security to assure proper completion and maintenance thereof shall be posted in accordance with the regulations of the controlling public utility or municipal authority and shall not be included within the financial security as otherwise required by this Part 8. 

13. 	
If financial security has been provided in lieu of the completion of improvements required as a condition for the final approval of a plat as set forth in this Part 8, the Board shall not condition the issuance of building, grading or other permits relating to the erection or placement of improvements, including buildings, upon the lots or land as depicted upon the final plat upon actual completion of the improvements depicted upon the approved final plat. Moreover, if said financial security has been provided, occupancy permits for any building or buildings to be erected shall not be withheld following the improvement of the streets providing access to and from existing public roads to such building or buildings to a mud-free or otherwise permanently passable condition, as well as the completion of all other improvements as depicted upon the approved plat, either upon the lot or lots or beyond the lot or lots in question if such improvements are necessary for the reasonable use of or occupancy of the building or buildings. 



§802. 	Construction. 
All streets, storm drains, sewers and sewer laterals, water mains and services, monuments, street signs and other public improvements required shall be installed in accordance with the approved plans, the applicable regulations of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation Specifications, Form 408, dated 1976, or the latest revision thereof, or other applicable regulations. The construction or installation of all public improvements shall, at all times, be subject to inspection by a designated representative of the Township. If such inspection reveals that work is not in accordance with approved plans and specifications or that construction is not being done in a workmanlike manner, said representative is empowered to stop work and/or to require corrections to be made. The developer shall notify the Board of the schedule of anticipated road or other improvement construction and upon completion of subgrade, base course and surface course. 
§803. 	Release from Improvement Bond. 
1. 	
When the developer has completed all of the necessary and appropriate improvements, the developer shall notify the Board, in writing, by certified or registered mail, of the completion of the aforesaid improvements and shall send a copy thereof to the Township engineer. The Board shall, within ten (10) days after receipt of such notice, direct and authorize the Township engineer to inspect all of the aforesaid improvements. The Township engineer shall, thereupon, file a report in writing, with the Board, and shall promptly mail a copy of the same to the developer by certified or registered mail. The report shall be made and mailed within thirty (30) days after receipt by the Township engineer of the aforesaid authorization from the Board; said report shall be detailed and shall indicate approval or rejection of said improvements, either in whole or in part, and if said improvements, or any portion thereof, shall not be approved or shall be rejected by the Township engineer, said report shall contain a statement of reasons for such nonapproval or rejection. 

2. 	
The Board shall notify the developer, within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the engineer's report, in writing by certified or registered mail of the action of said Board with relation thereto. 

3. 	
If the Board or the Township engineer fails to comply with the time limitation provisions contained herein, all improvements will be deemed to have been approved and the developer shall be released from all liability, pursuant to its performance guaranty bond or other security agreement. 

4. 	
If any portion of the said improvements shall not be approved or shall be rejected by the Board, the developer shall proceed to complete the same and, upon completion, the same procedure of notification, as outlined herein, shall be followed. 

5. 	
Nothing herein, however, shall be construed in limitation of the developer's right to contest or question by legal proceedings or otherwise, any determination of the Board or the Township engineer. 

6. 	
Where herein reference is made to the Township engineer, he shall be as a consultant thereto. 

7. 	
The applicant or developer shall reimburse the Township of West Sadsbury for the reasonable and necessary expense incurred for the inspection or improvements according to a schedule of fees adopted by resolution of the Board and as from time to time amended. Such expense shall be reasonable and in accordance with the ordinary and customary fees charged by the Township engineer or consultant for work performed for similar services in the community, but in no event shall the fees exceed the rate or cost charged by the engineer or consultant to the Township of West Sadsbury when fees are not reimbursed or otherwise imposed on applicants. 


A. 	In the event the applicant disputes the amount of any such expense in connection with the inspection of improvements, the applicant shall, within ten (10) working days of the date of billing, notify the Board that such expenses are disputed as unreasonable or unnecessary, in which case the Board shall not delay or disapprove a subdivision or land development application or any approval or permit related to development due to the applicant's request over disputed engineer expenses. 
B. 	If, within twenty (20) days from the date of billing, the Board and the applicant cannot agree on the amount of expenses which are reasonable and necessary, then the applicant and the Board shall jointly, by mutual agreement, appoint another professional engineer licensed as such in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to review the said expenses and make a determination as to the amount thereof which is reasonable and necessary. 
C. 	The professional engineer so appointed shall hear such evidence and review such documentation as the professional engineer in his or her sole opinion deems necessary and render a decision within fifty (50) days of the billing date. The applicant shall be required to pay the entire amount determined in the decision immediately. 
D. 	In the event that the Board and applicant cannot agree upon the professional engineer to be appointed within twenty (20) days of the billing date, then, upon application of either party, the President Judge of the Court of Common Pleas of the judicial district in which the Township of West Sadsbury is located (or if at the time there be no President Judge, then the senior active judge then sitting) shall appoint such engineer, who, in that case, shall be neither the Township engineer nor any professional engineer who has been retained by, or performed services for, the Township of West Sadsbury or the applicant within the preceding five (5) years. 
E. 	The fee of the appointed professional engineer for determining the reasonable and necessary expenses shall be paid by the applicant if the amount of payment required in the decision is equal to or greater than the original bill. If the amount of payment required in the decision is less than the original bill by one thousand ($1,000) dollars or more, the Township of West Sadsbury shall pay the fee of the profes­sional engineer, but otherwise the Township of West Sadsbury and the applicant shall each pay one-half (½) of the fee of the appointed professional engineer. 

§804. 	Remedies to Effect Completion of Improvements. 
In the event that any improvements which may be required have not been installed as provided in this Chapter 22 or in accord with the approved final plat the Board is hereby granted the power to enforce any corporate bond, or other security by appropriate legal and equitable remedies. If the proceeds of such bond, or other security are insufficient to pay the cost of installing or making repairs or corrections to all the improvements covered by said security, the Board may, at its option, install part of such improvements in all or part of the subdivision or land development and may institute appropriate legal or equitable action to recover the moneys necessary to complete the remainder of the improvements. All of the proceeds, whether resulting from the security or from any legal or equitable action brought against the developer, or both, shall be used solely for the installation of the improvements covered by such security, and not for any other Township purpose. 

§805. 	As-Built Plans. 
Within thirty (30) days after completion and approval by the Board of public improvements, as shown on the Final Plans, and before acceptance of such public improvements, the applicant shall submit to the Board a corrected copy of said Plans, showing actual dimensions and conditions of streets and all other improvements by the applicant to be in accordance with actual construction. 

§806. 	Dedication and Acceptance of Public Improvements. 
Upon completion of any public improvements shown on an approved Final Plan, the Board may require that a developer offer such public improvements for dedication. In such a case, the developer shall prepare a deed of dedication and forward same to the Secretary of the Township for review by the Solicitor. Deeds of Dedication for public improvements may be accepted by resolution of the Board at a regular meeting thereof. 

§807. 	Recording Plats and Deeds. 
1. 	
Upon the approval of a final plat, the developer shall within ninety (90) days of such final approval record such plat in the office of the recorder of deeds of Chester County. The recorder of deeds shall not accept any plat for recording unless such plat officially notes the approval of the Board, and review by the county planning agency. 

2. 	
The recording of the plat shall not constitute grounds for assessment increases until such time as lots are sold or improvements are installed on the land included within the subject plat. 

3. 	
After a plat has been approved and recorded as provided in this Chapter 22, all streets and public grounds on such plat shall be, and become, a part of the official map of the Township of West Sadsbury without a public hearing. 


PART 9 



ADMINISTRATION 

§901. 	Preventive Remedies. 
1. 	
In addition to other remedies, the Board may institute and maintain appropriate actions by law or in equity to restrain, correct or abate violations, to prevent unlawful construction, to recover damages and to prevent illegal occupancy of a building, structure or premises. The description by metes and bounds in the instrument of transfer or other documents used in the process of selling or transferring shall not exempt the seller or transferor from such penalties or from the remedies herein provided. 

2. 	
The Board may refuse to issue any permit or grant any approval necessary to further improve or develop any real property which has been developed or which has resulted from a subdivision of real property in violation of this Chapter 22. This authority to deny such a permit or approval shall apply to any of the following applicants: 

A. 	The owner of record at the time of such violation. 
B. 	The vendee or lessee of the owner of record at the time of such violation without regard as to whether such vendee or lessee had actual or constructive knowledge of the violation. 
C. 	The current owner of record who acquired the property subsequent to the time of violation without regard as to whether such current owner had actual or constructive knowledge of the violation. 
D. 	The vendee or lessee of the current owner of record who acquired the property subsequent to the time of violation without regard as to whether such vendee or lessee had actual or constructive knowledge of the violation. 

3. 	
As an additional condition for issuance of a permit or the granting of an approval to any such owner, current owner, vendee or lessee for the development of any such real property, the Board may require compliance with the conditions that would have been applicable to the property at the time the applicant acquired an interest in such real property. 



§902. 	Enforcement Remedies. 
1. 	
Any person, partnership or corporation who or which has violated the provisions of this Chapter 22 shall, upon being found liable therefor in a civil enforcement proceeding commenced by the Township of West Sadsbury, pay a judgment of not more than one thousand ($1,000.00) dollars plus all court costs, including reasonable attorney fees incurred by the Township of West Sadsbury as a result thereof. No judgment shall commence or be imposed, levied or payable until the date of the determination of a viola­tion by the district justice. If the defendant neither pays nor timely appeals the judgment, the Township of West Sadsbury may enforce the judgment pursuant to the applicable rules of civil procedure. Each day that a violation continues shall constitute a separate violation, 

unless the district justice determining that there has been a violation further determines that there was a good faith basis for the person, partnership, or corporation violating this Chapter 22 to have believed that there was no such violation, in which event there shall be deemed to have been only one such violation until the fifth (5th) day following the date of the determination of a violation by the district justice and thereafter each day that a violation continues shall constitute a separate violation. 

2. 	
The court of common pleas, upon petition, may grant an order of stay, upon cause shown, tolling the per diem judgment pending a final adjudication of the violation and judgment. 

3. 	
Nothing contained in this Section shall be construed or interpreted to grant to any person or entity other than the Township of West Sadsbury the right to commence any action for enforcement pursuant to this Section. 

4. 	
District justices shall have initial jurisdiction in proceedings brought under this Section. 



§903. 	Reconsideration. 
Any applicant aggrieved by a finding, decision, or recommendation of the Board may request and receive opportunity to appear before the Board, present additional relevant information and request reconsideration of the original finding, decision, or recommendation. 

§904. 	Modifications. 
1. 	
The Board may grant a modification of the requirements of one (1) or more provisions of this Chapter 22 if the literal enforcement will exact undue hardship because of peculiar conditions pertaining to the land in question, provided that such modification will not be contrary to the public interest and that the purpose and intent of this Chapter 22 is observed. 

2. 	
All requests for a modification shall be in writing and shall accompany and be a part of the application for development. The request shall state in full the grounds and facts of unreasonableness or hardship on which the request is based, the provision or provisions of this Chapter 22 involved and the minimum modification necessary. 

3. 	
The request for modification shall be referred to the West Sadsbury Township Planning Commission for advisory comments. 

4.

Appendix A 

Residential Site Capacity Determination 
§A1. General. 
In order to promulgate the objectives of the West Sadsbury Township Comprehensive Plan, this Chapter 22 requires that prior to development of any tract or parcel of land a determination be made as to the intensity of development appropriate for the site. 
These regulations shall apply to any tract or parcel of land or fraction thereof under single ownership as of the effective date of this Chapter 22. 

§A2. Base Site Area. 
Certain portions of tracts may not be usable for the proposed activities and shall be subtracted from the site area to determine the Base Site Area: 
1. 
Site Area as determined by survey: 	Ac. 

2. 
Subtract land which is not contiguous: 	Ac. 

A. 	A separate parcel which does not abut or adjoin the development. Ac. 
B. 	Land which is cut off from the main parcel by a road, railroad, existing land use, or so that it is isolated and unavailable for development purposes: Ac. 

3. 	
Subtract land previously reserved as permanent open space: Ace. 

4. 	
Subtract land  used or zoned for another use Ac. 

5. 	
Equals Base Site Area 



§A3. Resource Protection Land. 
All land within the base site area shall be mapped and measured for the purpose of determining the amount of open space needed to protect it. 
Resource Protection Acres of Land Land (Acres in Resource RESOURCE Open Space Ratio in Resource X Open Space Ratio) 
Floodplains 1.00 Floodplain soils 1.00 Streams 1.00 Lakes or ponds 1.00 Wetlands 1.00 Limestone 0.90 + Steep Slope (25% or more) 0.90 Woodland 0.66* Agricultural soil 0.80 Pond shore 0.80 Lake shore 0.80 Steep slope (15% to 25%) 0.80

. 1.00 in the case of the AG-Agricultural District, except as noted in §347 of Chapter 27. 




§A4. Recreation Land. 
While some of the open space required may be resource protection land, the intent of this §903 is to provide for usable public or common open space as near to each residential unit as possible. Thus, there is a need for specific guidelines insuring that a minimum amount of land not restricted by §901 and §902 is retained for this purpose. 
1. 	
Base Site Area as determined under §A2: Ac. 

2. 	
Subtract total land with resource restrictions as determined under §A2: Ac. 

3. 	
Equals Total Unrestricted Land Ac. 

4.

following as applicable: 



A. 	0.10 for residential developments 
wherein the net lot area of the lots is 
less than one (1) acre or utilizing 
attached or semi-detached dwellings 

5. Equals Total Recreation Land 	Ac. 

§A5. Determination of Site Capacity. 
Individual site capacity is found by calculating the net buildable site area. The number of allowable dwelling units is determined by multiplying the net buildable site area by the permitted dwelling unit density. 
1. 	
Base Site Area as determined under §A2: Ac. 

2. 	
Subtract Resource Protection land as determined under §A3: Ac. 

3. 	
Subtract Recreation Land as determined under §A4: Ac. 

4. 	
Equals Net Buildable Site Area Ac. 

5.

ARTICLE I – GENERAL PROVISIONS
Section 101. Short Title
This Ordinance shall be known as the West Sadsbury Township Stormwater
Management Ordinance.” This Ordinance shall be inserted as Chapter 28, Part 1 of the
Code of Ordinances of West Sadsbury Township entitled “Stormwater Management”.
Section 102. Statement of Findings
The Governing Body of West Sadsbury Township finds that:
A. Inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting from land
disturbance and development throughout a watershed increases flooding, flows and
velocities, contributes to erosion and sedimentation, overtaxes the capacity of streams
and storm sewers, greatly increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage
stormwater, undermines floodplain management and flood reduction efforts in
upstream and downstream communities, reduces infiltration and groundwater
recharge, increases nonpoint source pollution to waterways, and threatens public
health and safety.
B. Inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting from land
disturbance and development throughout a watershed can harm surface water
resources by changing the natural hydrologic patterns, accelerating stream flows
(which increase scour and erosion of stream beds and stream banks, thereby elevating
sedimentation), destroying aquatic habitat, and elevating aquatic pollutant
concentrations and loadings such as sediments, nutrients, heavy metals, and
pathogens. Groundwater resources are also impacted through loss of recharge.
C. A comprehensive program of stormwater management, including minimization of
impacts of New Development, Redevelopment, and other Earth Disturbance
Activities causing accelerated runoff and erosion and loss of natural infiltration, is
fundamental to the public health, safety, and general welfare of the people of the
Municipality and all of the people of the Commonwealth, their resources, and the
environment.
D. Stormwater is an important water resource that provides infiltration and groundwater
recharge for water supplies and baseflow of streams, which also protects and
maintains surface water quality.
E. Impacts from stormwater runoff can be minimized by reducing the volume of
stormwater generated and by using project designs that maintain the natural
hydrologic regime and sustain high water quality, infiltration, stream baseflow, and
aquatic ecosystems. Cost-effective and environmentally sensitive stormwater 
West Sadsbury Township Stormwater Ordinance

management can be achieved through the use of nonstructural Site design techniques
that minimize Impervious Surfaces, reduce disturbance of land and natural resources,
avoid sensitive areas (i.e., riparian buffers, floodplains, steep slopes, wetlands, etc.),
and consider topography and soils to maintain the natural hydrologic regime.
F. Public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an essential
component in successfully addressing stormwater.
G. Federal and State regulations require the Municipality to implement a program of
stormwater controls. The Municipality is required to obtain a permit and comply with
its provisions for stormwater discharges from its Separate Storm Sewer System under
the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES).
H. Non-stormwater discharges to municipal or other storm sewer systems can contribute
to pollution of the Waters of the Commonwealth.
Section 103. Purpose
The purpose of this Ordinance is to protect public health, safety and general welfare,
property and water quality by implementing drainage and stormwater management
practices, criteria, and provisions included herein for land development, construction and
Earth Disturbance Activities, to achieve the following throughout the Municipality:
A. Reduce the frequency and magnitude of flooding and stormwater impacts affecting
people, property, infrastructure and public services.
B. Sustain or improve the natural hydrologic characteristics and water quality of
groundwater and surface waters.
C. Protect natural resources, including riparian and aquatic living resources and habitats.
D. Maintain the natural hydrologic regime of Land Development Sites and their
receiving watersheds.
E. Minimize land disturbance and protect and incorporate natural hydrologic features,
drainage patterns, infiltration, and flow conditions within land development Site
designs.
F. Reduce and minimize the volume of stormwater generated, and manage and release
stormwater as close to the source of runoff as possible.
G. Provide infiltration and maintain natural groundwater recharge to protect groundwater
supplies and stream baseflows, prevent degradation of surface water and groundwater
quality, and to otherwise protect water resources.

H. Reduce stormwater pollutant loads to protect and improve the chemical, physical, and
biological quality of ground and surface waters.
I. Reduce scour, erosion and sedimentation of stream channels.
J. Reduce flooding impacts and preserve and restore the natural flood-carrying capacity
of streams and their floodplains.
K. Protect adjacent and downgradient lands from adverse impacts of direct stormwater
discharges.
L. Minimize Impervious Surfaces and connected Impervious Surfaces to promote
infiltration and reduce the volume and impacts of stormwater runoff.
M. Provide proper long-term operation and maintenance of all permanent stormwater
management facilities, BMPs and Conveyances that are implemented within the
Municipality.
N. Reduce the impacts of runoff from existing developed land undergoing
Redevelopment while encouraging New Development and Redevelopment in urban
areas and areas designated for growth.
O. Implement an illicit discharge detection and elimination program that addresses nonstormwater discharges.
P. Provide performance standards and design criteria based on watershed-based
stormwater management planning.
Q. Provide standards to meet certain NPDES stormwater permit requirements.
R. Meet legal water quality requirements under State law, including regulations at 25 PA
Code Chapter 93, to protect, maintain, reclaim and restore the existing and designated
uses of the Waters of the Commonwealth.
S. Implement the requirements of Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDLs) where
applicable to waters within or impacted by the Municipality.
T. Provide review procedures and performance standards for stormwater planning and
management.
U. Fulfill the purpose and requirements of PA Act 167 (PA Act 167, Section 3):
“(1) Encourage planning and management of storm water runoff in each
watershed which is consistent with sound water and land use practices. 
West Sadsbury Township Stormwater Ordinance

(2) Authorize a comprehensive program of stormwater management
designated to preserve and restore the flood carrying capacity of
Commonwealth streams; to preserve to the maximum extent practicable
natural storm water runoff regimes and natural course, current and crosssection of water of the Commonwealth; and to protect and conserve
ground waters and ground-water recharge areas.
(3) Encourage local administration and management of storm water
consistent with the Commonwealth's duty as trustee of natural resources
and the people's constitutional right to the preservation of natural,
economic, scenic, aesthetic, recreational and historic values of the
environment.”
Section 104. Statutory Authority
The Municipality is empowered or required to regulate land use activities that affect
runoff and surface and groundwater quality and quantity by the authority of:

intermittent waterways, water bodies (lakes, ponds, etc.) and wetlands, except for
activities otherwise approved by State or local agencies (e.g. stream restoration
projects, road crossings, subsurface utility projects, etc.). At the Municipal Engineer’s
discretion, and with Conservation District and PADEP approval where necessary, the
non-disturbance buffer may be reduced because of setback or other Site constraints,
but never be less than ten (10) feet. 
West Sadsbury Township Stormwater Ordinance

U. Areas immediately adjacent to the Township's perennial streams, Watercourses where
the drainage Area to the wetland or Watercourse exceeds 20 acres, and Areas deemed
by the Township to possess environmental value shall be defined as the Riparian
Buffer Zone (RBZ). In the RBZ, special requirements as set forth in this Section
shall apply in order to maintain important natural functions. These RBZ requirements
are based on both the heightened sensitivity of the RBZ and the potential to
negatively impact the stream system when this RBZ is disturbed, as well as the
potential of this RBZ to mitigate to the maximum extent the negative effects of
Development in Areas adjacent to the stream system. The RBZ shall include three
sub-zones, Zones 1 through 3, extending landward from the top of the streambank
where different requirements are imposed. These RBZs are to be established and
protected, as defined below:
1. Zone 1, a 35-foot setback zone, measured from the top of the bank of the
Watercourse, where no disturbance of vegetation and soil except for restoration
shall occur, in order to shade the stream with natural vegetation, to provide a
source of numerous other organic inputs to the aquatic system, to anchor the
streambank and Floodplain Area, and to consume and otherwise remove nitrogen,
sediment, and other substances which can adversely affect stream systems.
2. Zone 2, a managed buffer zone, extending a distance equal to 45 feet outward
from Zone 1 or to the 100 year Floodplain boundary, whichever is larger, where
disturbance of natural vegetative cover shall be limited to activities which
minimally disrupt existing tree cover, in accordance with applicable zoning
restrictions, and soil mantle, in order to maximize filtering and overall physical
removal of particulate-form pollutants from Runoff generated upgradient and to
promote subsurface vegetative uptake of nitrogen and other non-particulate
elements from Stormwater generated upgradient. The Developer shall use land
within Zone 2 only for those uses authorized within the 100-year floodplain as
allowed in the Zoning Ordinance, even if portions of Zone 2 are located outside of
the 100-year floodplain.
3. Zone 3, a zone of 20 feet extending outward from Zone 2; Zone 3 is defined in
those cases where upslope Areas adjacent to the RBZ are being disturbed during
the Land Development process and where direct discharge of Stormwater would
otherwise occur; Zone 3 must include level spreading devices as necessary to
ensure that any directly discharged Stormwater flows are properly distributed as
sheet flow. Developer shall avoid channelization and point source discharges.
4. An RBZ adjacent to "High Quality Waters" and "Exceptional Value Waters"
designated by the DEP shall be subject to the provisions of the most recent edition
of DEP Special Protection Waters Implementation Handbook and its
amendments. To the extent that the Township and DEP requirements are not
consistent, the more restrictive requirements shall apply.
5. For Areas immediately adjacent to the Township's perennial streams and
Watercourses where the drainage Area to the Watercourse is less than 20 acres,
the RBZ shall be defined as a zone extending 35 feet outward from the top of the 
West Sadsbury Township Stormwater Ordinance
31
bank(s) of the Watercourse. Within this Area, no disturbance of vegetation and
soil except for restoration shall occur.
Section 302. Permit Requirements by Other Governmental Entities
The following permit or other regulatory requirements may apply to certain Regulated
Activities and shall be met prior to (or as a condition of) final approval by the
Municipality of the SWM Site Plan and prior to commencement of any Regulated

and natural resources, and to maintain the natural hydrologic regime, drainage patterns
and flow conditions. For Regulated Activities with ten thousand (10,000) or more square
feet of proposed Earth Disturbance OR two thousand (2,000) or more square feet of
Proposed Impervious Surfaces, the Applicant shall demonstrate in its SWM Site Plan (as
required in Subsection 402.C) that the design sequence, objectives and techniques
described below were applied to the maximum extent practicable in the Site design of the
Regulated Activity while complying with all other requirements of this Ordinance. The
Site design shall:
A. First, identify and delineate all existing natural resources and natural and man-made
hydrologic features listed in Subsection 402.B.8 that are located within the Site, or
receive discharge from, or may be impacted by the proposed Regulated Activity.
B. Second, provide a prioritized listing of these resources and features to identify:
1. Those to be incorporated into the Site design in a manner that provides protection
from any disturbance or impact from the proposed Regulated Activity;
2. Those to be protected from further disturbance or impact but for which the
proposed Regulated Activity will provide improvement to existing conditions;
3. Those that can be incorporated into and utilized as components of the overall Site
design in a manner that protects or improves their existing conditions while
utilizing their hydrologic function within the limits of their available capacity
(e.g., for infiltration, evapotranspiration, or reducing pollutant loads, runoff
volume or peak discharge rates, etc.) to reduce the need for or size of constructed
BMPs; and
4. Those that may be considered for alteration, disturbance or removal.
West Sadsbury Township Stormwater Ordinance
33
C. Third, develop the Site design to achieve the following:
1. Recognize and incorporate the priorities identified in Section 304.B as the basis
for the proposed Site layout, grading, construction, and permanent ground cover
design;
2. Minimize Earth Disturbance (both surface and subsurface);
3. Maximize protection of or improvement to natural resources and special
management areas;
4. Minimize the disturbance of natural Site hydrology, in particular natural drainage
features and patterns, discharge points and flow characteristics, natural infiltration
patterns and characteristics, and natural channel and floodplain conveyance
capacity;
5. Incorporate natural hydrologic features and functions identified in Subsection
304.B into the Site design to protect and utilize those features and their hydrologic
functions to reduce the need for or size of constructed BMPs;
6. Maximize infiltration and the use of natural Site infiltration features, patterns and
conditions, and evapotranspiration features;
7. Apply selective grading design methods to provide final grading patterns or
preserve existing topography in order to evenly distribute runoff and minimize
concentrated flows;
8. Minimize the cumulative area to be covered by Impervious Surfaces and:
a. Minimize the size of individual Impervious Surfaces,
b. Separate large Impervious Surfaces into smaller components,
c. Disconnect runoff from one Impervious Surface to another, and
d. Utilize porous materials in place of impervious wherever practicable;
9. Minimize the volume and peak discharge rates of stormwater generated;
10. Avoid or minimize stormwater runoff pollutant loads and receiving stream
channel erosion;
11. Locate infiltration and other BMPs:
a. At or as near to the source of generation as possible, and 
West Sadsbury Township Stormwater Ordinance
34
b. At depths that are as shallow as possible;
12. Prioritize the selection and design of BMPs as follows:
a. Nonstructural and vegetation BMPs, then
b. Structural (surface and subsurface) BMPs;
13. For flow volumes requiring conveyance from the source of generation to a BMP
for management, give preference to open channel conveyance techniques that
provide infiltration and water quality benefits, and landscaped-based management
in common open space areas, where practicable; and
14. Consider additional guidance for incorporating natural hydrology into the Site and
BMP designs, methods and techniques that support the objectives of Subsections
304.B and 304.C. Appendix B presents additional discussion of natural hydrology
site design and sources of information for “Conservation Design”, “Low Impact
Design”, and “Sustainable Design”.
D. The procedures set forth above shall be utilized to the maximum extent practicable
for the overall Site design and selection, location and design of features and BMPs to
be used to comply with the requirements of Sections 305, 306, 307 and 308.
Section 305. Water Quality and Runoff Volume Requirements
To control Post-construction stormwater impacts from Regulated Activities and meet
State water quality requirements, BMPs shall be provided in the Site design that replicate
Predevelopment stormwater infiltration and runoff conditions, such that Post-construction
stormwater discharges do not degrade the physical, chemical, or biological characteristics
of the receiving waters. The Applicant shall comply with the following water quality
and runoff volume requirements for all Regulated Activities, including all New
Development and Redevelopment activities:
A. The Post-construction total runoff volume shall not exceed the Predevelopment total
runoff volume for all storms equal to or less than the two (2)-year, twenty-four (24)-
hour duration precipitation (design storm). The water quality and runoff volume to be
managed shall consist of any runoff volume generated by the proposed Regulated
Activity over and above the Predevelopment total runoff volume and shall be
captured and permanently retained or infiltrated on the Site. Permanent retention
options may include, but are not limited to, reuse, evaporation, transpiration, and
infiltration.
B. For modeling purposes, the Predevelopment ground cover conditions shall be
determined using the corresponding ground cover assumptions presented in
Subsection 309.D of this Ordinance.
West Sadsbury Township Stormwater Ordinance
35
C. The design of the facility outlet shall provide for protection from clogging and
unwanted sedimentation.
D. BMPs that moderate the temperature of stormwater shall be used to protect the
temperature of receiving waters. The Applicant shall fulfill the requirements of the
PADEP “Thermal Impact Analysis” for the “PAG-02 Stormwater Discharges
Associated with Construction Activities, NOI for Coverage under General or
Individual Permit” if they cannot meet the volume control requirements.
E. Water quality improvement shall be achieved in conjunction with achieving the
infiltration requirements of Section 306. The infiltration volume required under
Section 306 may be included as a component of the water quality volume. If the
calculated water quality and runoff volume is greater than the volume infiltrated, then
the difference between the two (2) volumes shall be managed for water quality and
runoff volume control through other techniques or practices but shall not be
discharged from the Site.
F. Runoff from the Disturbed Area shall be treated for water quality prior to entering
existing waterways or water bodies. If a stormwater management practice does not
provide water quality treatment, then water quality BMPs shall be utilized to provide
pre-treatment prior to the runoff entering the stormwater management practice.
G. The Municipality may require additional water quality and runoff control measures
for stormwater discharging to special management areas such as those listed in
Subsection 301.P.
H. When the Regulated Activity contains or is divided by multiple drainage areas, the
water quality and runoff volume shall be separately addressed for each drainage area.
I. Weighted averaging of runoff coefficients shall not be used for manual computations
or input data for water quality and runoff volume calculations.
J. Areas located outside of the Site (i.e., areas outside of the Regulated Activity) may be
excluded from the calculation of the water quality and runoff volume requirements.
K. Water quality and volume control practices shall be selected and designed to meet the
criteria of Subsection 304.C that apply to water quality and volume control.
Section 306. Infiltration Requirements
Providing for infiltration consistent with the natural hydrologic regime is required to
compensate for the reduction in the recharge that occurs when the ground surface is
disturbed or Impervious Surface is created or expanded. The Applicant shall achieve the
following infiltration requirements:
West Sadsbury Township Stormwater Ordinance
36
A. Wherever possible, infiltration should be designed to accommodate the entire water
quality and runoff volume required in Section 305.
B. For Regulated Activities involving New Development, the volume of a minimum of
one (1)-inch of runoff from all Proposed Impervious Surfaces shall be infiltrated.
C. For Regulated Activities involving Redevelopment, whichever is less of the following
volume options shall be infiltrated:
1. The volume of a minimum of one (1)-inch of runoff from all Proposed
Impervious Surfaces;
OR
2. The total water quality and runoff volume required in Section 305 of this
Ordinance.
D. If the requirements of Subsections 306.B or 306.C cannot be physically
accomplished, then the Applicant shall be responsible for demonstrating with data or
calculations to the satisfaction of the Municipal Engineer why this infiltration volume
cannot be physically accomplished on the Site (e.g., shallow depth to bedrock or
limiting zone, open voids, steep slopes, etc.) and what alternative volume can be
infiltrated; however in all cases at least the first one-half (0.5) inch of runoff volume
shall be infiltrated.
E. Only if a minimum of at least one-half (0.5) inch infiltration requirement cannot be
physically accomplished on the Site, shall a waiver from Section 306 be considered
by the Municipality.
F. If Site conditions preclude capture of runoff from portions of the Impervious
Surfaces, the infiltration volume for the remaining area shall be increased an
equivalent amount to offset the loss.
G. When a project contains or is divided by multiple watersheds, the infiltration volume
shall be separately addressed for each watershed.
H. Existing Impervious Surfaces located in areas outside of the Site (i.e., outside of the
Regulated Activity) may be excluded from the calculation of the required infiltration
volume.
I. A detailed soils evaluation of the Site shall be conducted by a qualified professional
and at a minimum shall address soil permeability, depth to bedrock, and subgrade
stability. The general process for designing the infiltration BMP shall be conducted
by a qualified Licensed Professional and shall be consistent with the PA BMP
Manual (as amended) (or other guidance acceptable to the Municipal Engineer) and in
general shall: 
West Sadsbury Township Stormwater Ordinance
37
1. Analyze hydrologic soil groups as well as natural and man-made features within
the Site to determine general areas of suitability for infiltration practices. In areas
where development on fill material is under consideration, conduct geotechnical
investigations of sub-grade stability; infiltration may not be ruled out without
conducting these tests.
2. Provide field tests such as double ring infiltrometer or other hydraulic
conductivity tests (at the elevation of the proposed infiltration surface) to
determine the appropriate hydraulic conductivity rate. Standard septic/sewage
percolation tests are not acceptable for design purposes.
3. Design the Infiltration Facility for the required retention (infiltration) volume
based on field-determined infiltration capacity (and apply safety factor as per
applicable design guidelines) at the elevation of the proposed infiltration surface.
4. On-lot infiltration features are encouraged; however, it shall be demonstrated to
the Municipal Engineer that the soils are conducive to infiltration on the identified
lots.
J. Infiltration BMPs shall be selected based on suitability of soils and Site conditions
and shall be constructed on soils that have the following characteristics:
1. A minimum depth of twenty-four (24) inches between the bottom of the BMP and
the top of the Limiting Zone. Additional depth may be required in areas underlain
by karst or carbonate geology (see Subsection 306.N).
2. An infiltration rate sufficient to accept the additional stormwater volume and
drain completely as determined by field tests conducted by the Applicant.
3. The Infiltration Facility shall completely drain the retention (infiltration) volume
within three (3) days (seventy-two (72) hours) from the end of the design storm.
K. All infiltration practices shall:
1. Be selected and designed to meet the criteria of Subsection 304.C that are
applicable to infiltration;
2. Be set back a minimum of twenty-five (25) feet from all buildings and features
with sub-grade elements (e.g., basements, foundation walls, etc.), unless
otherwise approved by the Municipal Engineer;
3. For any infiltration practice that collects runoff from shared or multiple features
and that is located within twenty-five (25) feet of a building or feature with subgrade elements (e.g., basements, foundation walls, etc.), the bottom elevation
shall be set below the elevation of the sub-grade element. 
West Sadsbury Township Stormwater Ordinance
38
L. Infiltration Facilities shall, to the maximum extent practicable, be located to avoid
introducing contaminants to groundwater:
1. When a Hotspot is located in the area draining to a proposed infiltration facility,
an evaluation of the potential of groundwater contamination from the proposed
infiltration facility shall be performed, including a hydrogeologic investigation (if
necessary) by a qualified Licensed Professional to determine what, if any, pretreatment or additional design considerations are needed to protect groundwater
quality.
2. When located within a “well head protection area” of a public water supply well,
infiltration practices shall be in conformance with the applicable approved source
water protection assessment or source water protection plan.
3. The Applicant shall provide appropriate safeguards against groundwater
contamination for land uses that may cause groundwater contamination should
there be a mishap or spill.
M. During Site construction, all infiltration practice components shall be protected from
compaction due to heavy equipment operation or storage of fill or construction
material. Infiltration areas shall also be protected from sedimentation. Areas that are
accidentally compacted or graded shall be remediated to restore soil composition and
porosity. Adequate documentation to this effect shall be submitted to the Municipal
Engineer for review. All areas designated for infiltration shall not receive runoff until
the contributory drainage area has achieved final stabilization.
N. Consideration of infiltration BMPs for areas underlain by karst or carbonate geology
is encouraged, but only where the design, supporting calculations, results of soils or
other Site investigations or other documentation are provided to the Municipality
demonstrating that the potential or likelihood of subsidence or sinkholes is minimal.
Evaluation of Site conditions and infiltration design shall rely on guidance in the PA
BMP Manual (as amended) or other guidance acceptable to the Municipal Engineer.
O. Groundwater quality of the carbonate aquifer shall be protected from infiltration of
pollutants. At a minimum, stormwater runoff from Hotspots (i.e., sources of
significant pollutant runoff) shall first be discharged through a water quality BMP(s)
to remove pollutants prior to infiltration. Where soil characteristics are insufficient to
provide removal of pollutants from sources other than Hotspots, stormwater runoff
shall first be discharged through a water quality BMP(s) to remove pollutants prior to
infiltration.
P. Where sediment transport in the stormwater runoff is anticipated to reach the
infiltration system, appropriate permanent measures to prevent or collect sediment
shall be installed prior to discharge to the infiltration system. 
West Sadsbury Township Stormwater Ordinance
39
Q. Where roof drains are designed to discharge to infiltration practices, they shall have
appropriate measures to prevent clogging by unwanted debris (for example, silt,
leaves and vegetation). Such measures shall include but are not limited to leaf traps,
gutter guards and cleanouts.
R. All infiltration practices shall have appropriate positive overflow controls.
S. No sand, salt or other particulate matter may be applied to a porous surface material
for winter ice conditions.
T. The following procedures and materials shall be required during the construction of
all subsurface facilities:

will not compact the bottom of the seepage bed/trench or like facility.
2. The bottom of the bed and/or trench shall be scarified prior to the placement of
aggregate.
3. Only clean aggregate with documented porosity, free of fines, shall be allowed.
4. The tops, bottoms and sides of all seepage beds, trenches, or like facilities shall be
covered with drainage fabric. Fabric shall be non-woven fabric acceptable to the
Municipal Engineer.
5. Stormwater shall be distributed throughout the entire seepage bed/trench or like
facility and provisions for the collection of debris shall be provided in all
facilities.
Section 307. Stream Channel Protection Requirements
For Regulated Activities involving New Development with one (1) or more acres of
Earth Disturbance, the Applicant shall comply with the following stream channel
protection requirements to minimize stream channel erosion and associated water quality
impacts to the receiving waters:
A. The peak flow rate of the Post-construction two (2)-year, twenty-four (24)-hour
design storm shall be reduced to the Predevelopment peak flow rate of the one (1)-
year, twenty-four (24)-hour duration precipitation, using the SCS Type II distribution.
B. To the maximum extent practicable, and unless otherwise approved by the Municipal
Engineer, the Post-construction one (1)-year, twenty-four (24)-hour storm flow shall
be detained for a minimum of twenty-four (24) hours and a maximum not to exceed
seventy-two (72) hours from a point in time when the maximum volume of water
from the one (1)-year, twenty-four (24)-hour storm is stored in a proposed BMP (i.e., 
West Sadsbury Township Stormwater Ordinance
40
when the maximum water surface elevation is achieved in the facility). Release of
water can begin at the start of the storm (i.e., the invert of the orifice is at the invert of
the proposed BMP).
C. For modeling purposes, the Predevelopment ground cover conditions shall be
determined using the corresponding ground cover assumptions presented in
Subsection 309.D of this Ordinance.
D. The minimum orifice size in the outlet structure to the BMP shall be three (3) inches
in diameter unless otherwise approved by the Municipal Engineer, and a trash rack
shall be installed to prevent clogging. For Sites with small drainage areas contributing
to the BMP that do not provide enough runoff volume to allow a twenty-four (24)
hour attenuation with the three (3)-inch orifice, the calculations shall be submitted
showing this condition.
E. When the calculated orifice size is below three (3) inches, gravel filters (or other
methods) are recommended to discharge low-flow rates subject to the Municipal
Engineer’s satisfaction. When filters are utilized, maintenance provisions shall be
provided to ensure filters meet the design function.
F. All proposed stormwater facilities shall make use of measures to extend the flow
path and increase the travel time of flows in the facility.
G. When a Regulated Activity contains or is divided by multiple drainage areas, the
peak flow rate control shall be separately addressed for each drainage area.
Section 308. Stormwater Peak Rate Control Requirements
The Applicant shall comply with the following peak flow rate control requirements for all
Regulated Activities including those that involve New Development and Redevelopment.

A. Post-construction peak flow rates from any Regulated Activity shall not exceed
the Predevelopment peak flow rates as shown for each of the design storms
specified in Table 308.1.

B. For modeling purposes, the Predevelopment ground cover conditions shall be
determined using the corresponding ground cover assumptions presented in
Subsection 309.D of this Ordinance.
C. For Regulated Activities involving only Redevelopment, no peak flow rate controls
are required when and only if the total Proposed Impervious Surface area is at least
twenty percent (20%) less than the total existing Impervious Surface area to be
disturbed by the Regulated Activity. In all cases where this requirement is not met,
the Redevelopment Regulated Activity shall achieve the peak flow rate controls
presented in Table 308.1, using the Redevelopment Ground Cover Assumptions
presented in Subsection 309.D.
D. Only the area of the proposed Regulated Activity shall be subject to the peak flow
rate control standards of this Ordinance. Undisturbed areas for which the discharge
point has not changed are not subject to the peak flow rate control standards.
E. Areas located outside of the Site (i.e., areas outside of the Regulated Activity) that
drain through a proposed Site are not subject to peak flow rate control requirements.
Drainage facilities located on the Site shall be designed to safely convey flows from
outside of the Site through the Site.
F. When a Regulated Activity contains or is divided by multiple drainage areas, the peak
flow rate controls shall be separately addressed for each drainage area.
G. The effect of structural and non-structural stormwater management practices
implemented as part of the overall Site design may be taken into consideration when
calculating total storage volume and peak flow rates.

Section 309. Calculation Methodology
A. Stormwater runoff from all Regulated Activity Sites with a drainage area of greater
than five (5) acres shall be calculated using a generally accepted calculation
technique(s) that is based on the NRCS Soil Cover Complex Method. Table 309.1
summarizes acceptable computation methods. The method selected for use shall be
based on the individual limitations and suitability of each method for a particular Site.

I. Introduction:
This design manual has been created as a tool to help property owners manage stormwater on
their property and streamline the process of designing on-site stormwater management facilities
for Regulated Activities that are new, relatively minor residential and accessory structure
projects (less than 2,000 square feet). Through the use of this manual, residents have the ability
to determine the appropriate facilities for their property, project and budget. This design method
is not intended to be used with large-scale subdivision / land development projects or activities
that include infrastructure such as roadways.
The Stormwater Best Management Practices (Stormwater BMPs) listed in this manual should be
used as a guide and are not a comprehensive list of options. Residents should contact West
Sadsbury Township to discuss alternative solutions for site specific applications.
II. Importance of Stormwater Management:
Stormwater is the runoff produced by precipitation, snow melt, or ice melt. When land is
developed or changed, the flow patterns of water, volume of water and quality of water are also
changed. Land development activities can affect characteristics of stormwater runoff, including
the rate of runoff, volume of runoff, and quality of runoff. When runoff is not managed, the
increased volume may aggravate flooding.
The objective of stormwater management is to prevent or mitigate the adverse impacts of the
increase in rate and volume of stormwater runoff, while also protecting health, safety, and
property. Stormwater BMPs aim to maintain water quality, encourage infiltration in appropriate
areas, promote groundwater recharge, maintain the natural drainage characteristics of the site to
the maximum extent practicable, and protect stream banks and beds.
III. Standard Terms Used in the Manual:
BMP (Best Management Practice) – Activities, facilities, designs, measures, or procedures
used to manage stormwater impacts from Regulated Activities, to provide water quality
treatment, infiltration, volume reduction, and/or peak rate control, to promote groundwater
recharge, and to otherwise meet the purposes of this Ordinance. Stormwater BMPs are
commonly grouped into one (1) of two (2) broad categories or measures: “structural” or
“nonstructural.” In this Ordinance, nonstructural BMPs or measures refer to operational and/or
behavior-related practices that attempt to minimize the contact of pollutants with stormwater
runoff whereas structural BMPs or measures are those that consist of a physical device or
practice that is installed to capture and treat stormwater runoff. Structural BMPs include, but are
not limited to, a wide variety of practices and devices from large-scale retention ponds and
constructed wetlands to small-scale underground treatment systems, infiltration facilities, filter
strips, low impact design, bioretention, wet ponds, permeable paving, grassed swales, riparian or
forested buffers, sand filters, detention basins, and manufactured devices. Structural stormwater
BMPs are permanent appurtenances to the Site.
4
Disturbed Area – Land area disturbed by or where an Earth Disturbance Activity is occurring or
has occurred.
Earth Disturbance (or Earth Disturbance Activity) – A construction or other human activity
which disturbs the surface of the land, including, but not limited to, clearing and grubbing;
grading; excavations; embankments; road maintenance; land development; building construction;
and the moving, depositing, stockpiling, or storing of soil, rock, or earth materials.
Flow Path – The path that stormwater follows from the discharge point to the nearest property
line or channelized flow (i.e. stream, drainage ditch, etc.). The length of the path is measured
along the ground slope.
Impervious Surface (or Impervious Area) - A surface that has been compacted or covered
with a layer of material so that it prevents or is resistant to infiltration of water, including but not
limited to: structures such as roofs, buildings, storage sheds; other solid, paved or concrete areas
such as streets, driveways, sidewalks, parking lots, patios, swimming pools, tennis or other paved
courts; or athletic playfields comprised of synthetic turf materials. For the purposes of
determining compliance with this Ordinance, compacted soils or stone surfaces used for vehicle
parking and movement shall be considered impervious. Surfaces that were designed to allow
infiltration (i.e. areas of porous pavement) will be considered on a case-by-case basis by the
Municipal Engineer, based on appropriate documentation and condition of the material, etc.
Karst – A type of topography that is formed over limestone or other carbonate rock formations
by dissolving or solution of the rock by water, and that is characterized by closed depressions,
sinkholes, caves, a subsurface network of solution conduits and fissures through which
groundwater moves, and no perennial surface drainage features.
Minor Stormwater Site Plan – A site plan prepared and submitted for Regulated Activities
which meet the Small Project and Minor Stormwater Site Plan criteria. The plan depicts existing
conditions on the property, proposed impervious areas, and, if required, the location of proposed
Stormwater BMPs.
Regulated Activities – Any Earth Disturbance Activity(ies) or any activity that involves the
alteration or development of land in a manner that may affect stormwater runoff.
Runoff – Any part of precipitation that flows over the land surface.
Small Project - Regulated Activities that involve less than two thousand (2,000) square feet of
Proposed Impervious Surfaces and less than ten thousand (10,000) square feet of proposed Earth
Disturbance are eligible to apply the modified requirements presented in this manual, Simplified
Approach to Stormwater Management for Small Projects, provided that there are not known Site
or local conditions that may preclude the use of any techniques included in the Simplified
Approach.
5
IV. Determining What Type of Stormwater Management Submission is
Needed:
The following chart provides a guide to determine what type of stormwater submission is
needed. Some projects will be eligible for an exemption from preparing a stormwater
management plan, but documentation of the project must still be filed with West Sadsbury
Township. Completion of the West Sadsbury Township Stormwater Management
Worksheets will determine what type of documentation is required for each project.
This manual is designed to assist those with Regulated Activities that qualify for the use of a
Minor Stormwater Site Plan. If a SWM Site Plan is required in accordance with the West
Sadsbury Township Stormwater Management Ordinance, please consult a qualified
professional (ex. Engineer, Surveyor).
*Note: Regulated Activities must meet BOTH Proposed New Impervious Area and Proposed Earth
Disturbance requirements to be eligible for an Exemption or a Small Project.
The Applicant should first review the planned project with West Sadsbury Township to confirm
the following:
? That the proposed project is not otherwise exempt from the stormwater management
control and the engineered Stormwater Management Site Plan requirements of the
Municipality’s Stormwater Management Ordinance;
? That the proposed project is eligible to follow the Small Project-Minor Stormwater
Site Plan requirements;
? To determine which components of the proposed project must be included in the
calculation of “impervious surfaces (areas)”; and,
? Whether any local conditions are known to the Municipality that would preclude the
use of any of the techniques included in this Simplified Approach.
The following shall be submitted to West Sadsbury Township depending on the proposed
project:
? Eligible for Exemption

recorded at the Chester County Office of the Recorder of Deeds, so that the
Agreement will be applicable to future landowners.
? Non-Exempt
o SWM Site plan and associated calculations prepared by a Professional
Engineer, Landscape Architect or Surveyor
V. Using the Stormwater Management Worksheets:
Determining the new impervious area of a proposed project is the first step in using this
Simplified Approach. Completing the West Sadsbury Township Stormwater Management
Worksheets will assist the property owner, or applicant, and West Sadsbury Township in
determining the impervious area of a proposed project and providing guidance through ensuing
steps.
Stormwater Management Worksheets can be obtained from the West Sadsbury Township
Municipal Office.
Step 1: Step 1 of the West Sadsbury Township Stormwater Management Worksheet provides a
table and directions on how to calculate the new impervious area proposed to be created. If the
total new impervious area is less than 1,000 square feet, the project may be exempt from the
volume, rate, and SWM Site Plan requirements of the West Sadsbury Township Stormwater
Management Ordinance. After completing Step 1 of the worksheet, the applicant will sign the
Acknowledgement at the top of the sheet and file it with West Sadsbury Township.
West Sadsbury Township will use this as a record of exempt projects and keep a running total of
proposed impervious area since the adoption of the West Sadsbury Township Stormwater
Management Ordinance. After exceeding 1,000 square feet of impervious area since the
adoption of the West Sadsbury Township Stormwater Management Ordinance, a property owner
will need to prepare a Minor Stormwater Site Plan or a Stormwater Management Site Plan in
accordance with Article IV.
However, applicants shall note that Regulated Activities that meet the exemption criteria may be
required to manage stormwater runoff and provide plans and/or calculations as required in this
ordinance should West Sadsbury Township determine that there is a potential for stormwater
runoff associated with the proposed Regulated Activity to adversely affect adjacent or
downstream public or private properties.
7
If the total new impervious area is 1,000 square feet or greater and less than 2,000 square feet,
the applicant will go on to Step 2. If the Regulated Activity involves only Earth Disturbance
between 5,000 square feet to less than 10,000 square feet, the applicant shall contact West
Sadsbury Township for additional guidance.
Step 2: Step 2 of the West Sadsbury Township Stormwater Management Worksheet provides
guidance to calculate the total volume of stormwater runoff from new impervious surfaces that
must be controlled using stormwater BMPs. Upon completion of these calculations, continue to
Step 3.
Step 3: Step 3 of the West Sadsbury Township Stormwater Management Worksheet provides
guidance regarding the preparation of a Minor Stormwater Site Plan, as outlined in this design
manual, for approval by West Sadsbury Township. This includes determining the types, sizes,
and location of proposed Stormwater BMPs to be employed for a given project. The worksheets,
Minor Stormwater Site Plan, and Owner Acknowledgement will be submitted to West Sadsbury
Township for approval. West Sadsbury Township will use this submission as a record to keep a
running total of proposed impervious area since the adoption of the West Sadsbury Township
Stormwater Management Ordinance, and to monitor the installation of the required Stormwater
BMPs necessary to support the project.
VI. Minor Stormwater Site Plan Requirements
A Minor Stormwater Site Plan depicts the existing conditions of a property and the location of
proposed impervious surfaces. Depicting the relationship between the Regulated Activities and
distances to things like property lines, streams, and vegetated areas will help determine if the
stormwater runoff created by the proposed project can be managed naturally within the property
or if additional Stormwater BMPs are needed to accommodate the stormwater runoff.
If a project requires the submission of a Minor Stormwater Site Plan or a plan in support of an
Exemption, the applicant shall prepare and submit to West Sadsbury Township a Minor
Stormwater Site Plan and the West Sadsbury Township Stormwater Management Worksheet.
The Chester County GIS Office can provide assistance to applicants to obtain property maps of
existing features. A Minor Stormwater Site Plan depicting the key features of the site must be
drawn to scale and show the following:
? Property owner name, address, email and phone number
? Property address (if different from owner address)
? Tax Parcel ID number
? Name, address, phone number & email address of plan preparer
? Property boundary.
? Site conditions (grassed areas, agricultural fields, direction of slope and stormwater
flow on the property).
? Location of all existing and proposed structures (house, driveway shed, addition, etc.)
and any existing and proposed downspouts. Include the dimensions of proposed
structures.
8
? Distance from proposed downspouts to property line.
? All existing and proposed driveways and other impervious areas (stone and gravel
driveways are considered impervious).
? Natural features such as streams, wetlands, floodplains, tree lines and other vegetation
on the property and within 50 feet of the property line.
? Distance from proposed structures or downspouts along the stormwater flow path to
any stream or wooded area.
? Any other pertinent information that may be significant to the project site (existing
drainage ways, steep slopes, exposed bedrock, upslope drainage areas, etc.).
? Wells and on-site sanitary sewer systems (septic tank, drainfield, etc.).
? Surface and subsurface utilities.
? Existing and proposed easements (gas, electric, stormwater, water, sewer, etc.).
If Stormwater BMPs are required, the following information must also be shown on the
plan:
? Location and size of proposed Stormwater BMPs.
? Details of BMPs as necessary for construction.
Other Considerations for Minor Stormwater Management Plans:
? For Minor Stormwater Management Plans, soil testing is highly recommended to
select and apply the appropriate Stormwater BMPs. The use of soil maps, infiltration
tests, and/ or perc tests may provide the applicant basic information about soil
characteristics.
? Proposed stormwater management facilities must be designed to handle flows from
the contributing area.
? The site shall not have any pre-existing stormwater drainage-related problems (as
verified by West Sadsbury Township), at the discretion of West Sadsbury Township.
? Water quality shall be protected per Chapter 93 of PA Code.
? West Sadsbury Township may inspect all Stormwater BMPs during and after
construction / installation.
? Infiltration BMPs should not be constructed nor receive runoff until the entire
contributory drainage area has achieved final stabilization.
? Ensure that infiltration in geologically susceptible areas such as, but not limited to,
carbonate geology / karst topography do not cause adverse effects. The Minor
Stormwater Site Plan should incorporate steps to ensure that salt or chloride will not
contaminate the groundwater.
? Selected Stormwater BMPs shall be designed, constructed, and maintained in
accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendation, the PA Stormwater
Management BMP Manual, or other written guidance acceptable to West Sadsbury
Township.
? Proposed sump pumps shall discharge to infiltration or vegetative Stormwater BMPs
to the maximum extent practicable and not adversely impact adjacent and
downstream properties.
9
VII. Selecting Stormwater BMPs
If the submission of a Minor Stormwater Management Plan including the use of Stormwater
BMPs is required, the applicant should review the compiled information in the PA Stormwater
Management BMP Manual. This document identifies Stormwater BMPs that have been deemed
to be of a nature and cost that will accomplish the goals of the Chester County Stormwater
Management Plan, while not unduly burdening the residents. It will then be the Owner’s
responsibility to select a facility, determine the appropriate size and agree to construct and
maintain that facility or facilities. The property owner is encouraged to utilize both multiple and
hybrid versions of the facilities, as outlined in the documents mentioned above.
The applicant may choose to install a Stormwater BMP facility as shown in the Stormwater
Management Worksheets. The Stormwater BMP facility shall be constructed in accordance with
the associated construction details, requirements and notes.
VIII. Stormwater Management Worksheets
Stormwater Management Worksheets can be obtained from the West Sadsbury Township
Municipal Office.
IX. Stormwater Management/BMP Facilities and Maintenance Agreement
It is the Landowner’s responsibility to properly maintain BMPs. It is also the Landowner’s
responsibility to inform any future buyers of the function, operation, and maintenance needed for
any BMPs on the property prior to the purchase of the property. The maintenance agreement
outlines the inspection and maintenance required for each type of BMP, the responsibilities of
the Landowner, and the rights of the Municipality in regards to inspection and enforcement of
the maintenance requirements.
The Operation, Maintenance and Inspection Plan and Agreement must be signed, notarized and
submitted to the Municipality. Following approval and signature by the Municipality, the
Landowner must have the Agreement recorded at the Chester County Office of the Recorder of
Deeds so that the Agreement will be applicable to future landowners.
The Operation, Maintenance and Inspection Plan and Agreement can be obtained from the West
Sadsbury Township Municipal Office.

ORDINANCE APPENDIX B
SITE DESIGN PROCESS 
1
NATURAL HYDROLOGY SITE DESIGN PROCESS
INTRODUCTION
Section 304 identifies a natural hydrology site design process that strives to minimize
disturbances to land, site hydrology, and natural resources, and maintain the natural hydrologic
regime, drainage patterns and flow conditions of a site to the maximum extent practicable. This
appendix is intended to build on that process by providing additional information for achieving
site designs that best maintain pre-construction stormwater runoff conditions, protect site
amenities, and preserve natural resources. This appendix describes the following components of
the natural hydrology site design process:
? Design Principles and Techniques;
? Design Process;
? Design Practices; and
? References.
Some common drainage design approaches for land development radically alter natural
hydrologic conditions by constructing collection and conveyance systems that are designed to
remove runoff from a site as quickly as possible and capture it in a detention basin. This
approach has often led to the degradation of water quality, reduced groundwater recharge, and
increased volumes of runoff, as well as the expenditure of additional resources for detaining and
managing increased volumes of concentrated runoff at some downstream location.
The natural hydrology site design process encourages land development site designs that
minimize post-development runoff rates and volumes, and that minimize needs for artificial
conveyance and storage facilities. This process strives to incorporate the desired land
development into the natural hydrologic landscape in a manner that maintains and utilizes
existing site hydrology features and functions to minimize generation of new stormwater. This
avoids cumulative environmental impacts often associated with land development, and reducing
the need for and size of constructed stormwater facilities. This approach minimizes the
disturbance of land area, natural features and site hydrology; preserves significant concentrations
of open space, woodlands, and corridors of environmentally sensitive features; and incorporates
landscape-based BMPs and low impact development techniques to minimize the utilization of
more intrusive structural stormwater facilities.
With this design process, the primary goals of a land development project can be achieved while
minimizing the negative environmental impacts and avoiding management costs associated with
unnecessary stormwater runoff. The fundamental principle of this design process is that site
hydrology features are considered “up front” in the land development design process and are
prioritized as integral aspects to be maintained and utilized within the site design, rather than
being first sacrificed for space needed for traditional site layout or for construction of more
intrusive stormwater facilities.
2
Natural hydrology site design is not a new approach but rather a holistic process that combines
certain principles of Low Impact Development, Conservation Design, and Sustainable Design,
and focuses on reducing unnecessary alterations to the natural patterns and functions of existing
on-site hydrologic features. These natural hydrologic features tend to perform their “hydrologic
function” (i.e., infiltration, evapotranspiration, flow attenuation, pollutant removal, etc.) very
efficiently and sometimes have the hydrologic capacity to perform that function on increased
runoff loadings from the built environment. However, care must be taken to adequately
characterize the capacity of their hydrologic function and avoid overwhelming the feature with
excessive runoff loadings, thus causing unintended impairments that are completely counterproductive to the purpose of natural hydrology site design.
Preserving natural hydrologic conditions requires careful site design considerations. Natural
hydrology site design should serve as the foundation of the overall site design approach, and
when applied in conjunction with the design professional’s overall land development goals and
desired outcomes, can help shape the overall vision and conceptual layout of the land
development project.
Site design practices include preserving natural drainage features, minimizing impervious
surface area, reducing the hydraulic connectivity of impervious surfaces, and protecting natural
depression storage. Applying this site design process helps maintain site hydrology and manage
stormwater by: minimizing the generation of stormwater runoff (achieved by designing to the
land, considering site drainage patterns and infiltration characteristics, reducing grading and
compaction, and considering scale and placement of buildings); managing stormwater as close to
the point of generation as possible (by disconnecting impervious surfaces and distributing storm
flows to landscaped-based BMPs); providing open and vegetated channel conveyance (as needed
to treat water quality, reduce velocity and infiltrate); and managing remaining conveyed
stormwater in common open space (as needed to disperse low velocity storm flows, treat water
quality, infiltrate, and release). A well-designed site will contain a mix of all those features.
DESIGN PRINCIPLES AND TECHNIQUES
Natural hydrology site design involves identifying and prioritizing natural resources and natural
and man-made hydrologic features, and incorporating such features into the overall site design to
take advantage of their efficiencies of hydrologic performance, their cost efficiencies of reducing
the need for or size of constructed stormwater facilities, and their aesthetic amenities. The five
Design Principles to be achieved by this approach are as follows:
? Minimize land disturbance – both surface and subsurface.
? Minimize the cumulative area to be covered by impervious and compacted surfaces.
? Designing to the land, so that the layout of constructed and landscape features utilizes the
natural topography and minimizes grading.
? Design the constructed stormwater management system to take advantage of the natural
hydrologic landscape to achieve the required stormwater runoff control standards.
? Refine the site design and layout to optimize the cumulative benefits of the natural 
3
hydrologic features, the constructed stormwater management system, and the land
development components to achieve the minimum post-construction runoff volume, peak
discharge rates and pollutant loads from the proposed land development site.
Techniques to be applied to achieve the design principles are presented in Table B.1.
DESIGN PROCESS
The first step in applying natural hydrology site design is to identify, delineate and assess the
functions of all existing natural resources and natural and man-made hydrologic features that: are
located within the project site; will receive discharge from the project site; or, may be impacted
by runoff or disturbance from the proposed land development project. This includes:
? Streams, waterways, springs, wetlands, vernal pools, and water bodies;
? Drainage patterns, conveyances and discharge points;
? Natural infiltration areas and patterns;
? Areas of natural vegetation that provide significant evapotranspiration, pollutant removal,
bank stabilization, flow attenuation, or riparian buffer functions;
? Floodplains; and
? Other features that contribute to the overall hydrologic function and value of the site and
its receiving streams.
Once this inventory and assessment are completed, these identified resources and features are
then prioritized for their ability to provide hydrologic function and performance for managing
runoff from the proposed site improvements. Specifically, they should be prioritized as follows:
? Those to be incorporated into the site design in a manner that provides for their protection
from any disturbance or impact from the proposed land development;
? Those to be protected from further disturbance or impact and for which the proposed land
development will provide improvement to existing conditions;
? Those that can be incorporated into and utilized as components of the overall site design
in a manner that protects or improves their existing conditions while utilizing their
hydrologic function (e.g., for infiltration, evapotranspiration, or reducing pollutant loads,
runoff volume or peak discharge rates, etc.) to reduce the need for or size of constructed
BMPs; and
? Those that may be considered for alteration, disturbance or removal.
These prioritizations are then applied as the basis on which to begin the site design lay-out,
grading, construction, and permanent ground cover designs to achieve the five (5) Design
Principles outlined above. The following section describes just a few of the many design
practices, methods and techniques that are available to achieve the landowner’s desired land
development goals and the desired environmental efficiencies intended by natural hydrology site
design.

Minimize land disturbance – both
surface and subsurface.
? Maintain the natural soil structure and vegetative cover that are often
critical components of maintaining the hydrologic functions of natural
infiltration, bioretention, flow attenuation, evapotranspiration, and
pollutant removal.
? Protect, or improve, natural resources to reduce the needs for
environmental mitigation, future environmental restoration, and
cumulative flow and water quality impacts of unnecessary disturbances
within the watershed system.
? Minimize the disturbance of natural surface and groundwater drainage
features and patterns, discharge points and flow characteristics, natural
infiltration and evapotranspiration patterns and characteristics, natural
stream channel stability, and floodplain conveyance, etc.
Minimize the cumulative area to
be covered by impervious and
compacted surfaces.
? Minimize the size of individual impervious surfaces.
? Separate large impervious surfaces into smaller components.
? Disconnect runoff from one impervious surface to another.
? Avoid unnecessary impervious surfaces.
? Utilize porous materials where suited in lieu of impervious materials.
Designing to the land, so that the
layout of constructed and
landscape features utilizes the
natural topography and
minimizes grading.
? Prioritize on-site hydrologic features (i.e., for protection, improvement,
utilization, or alteration) and natural site drainage patterns and
infiltration characteristics and consider them for the cornerstones of the
conceptual site design.
? Reduce grading and compaction by applying selective grading design
methods to provide final grading patterns tthat preserve existing
topography where it most benefits natural hydrologic functions and
where needed; this results in graded areas that evenly distribute runoff
and minimize concentrated runoff flows.
? Consider the scale and placement of buildings and other infrastructure to
minimize impact to natural hydrologic features.
? Incorporate unique natural, scenic, and historic site features into the
configuration of the development, and ensure flexibility in development
design to meet community needs for complimentary and aesthetically
pleasing development, such as can be achieved through Conservation
Design and Sustainable Design approaches.

Design the constructed
stormwater management system
to take advantage of the natural
hydrologic landscape to achieve
the required stormwater runoff
control standards.
? Incorporate natural hydrologic features that have been selected for their
available capacity and function into the overall system of site runoff
controls.
? Incorporate Low Impact Development (or similar) BMPs and distribute
storm flows to:
o Reduce runoff;
o Manage stormwater at or as close to the point of generation as
possible;
o Disconnect discharges from streets and municipal storm sewer
systems; and
o Select and design BMPs to give first priority to nonstructural
and vegetation (landscape-based) BMPs, second priority to
surface structural BMPs, third priority to subsurface structural
BMPs, and design subsurface BMPs as shallow as possible.
? Provide open channel conveyance, as needed, to:
o Treat water quality;
o Reduce runoff velocity; and
o Promote infiltration and evapotranspiration of runoff.
? Manage remaining conveyed stormwater from small storms in common
open space areas to achieve multiple objectives:
o Disperse storm flows and reduce velocity;
o Treat water quality; and
o Promote infiltrate and evapotranspiration of runoff.
? Provide for appropriate conveyance to retention or detention storage
facilities as needed for flows from large storm events.
? Maintain open space functions consistent with common area uses
(passive recreation, on-site sewage management, scenic vistas, etc).
Refine the site design and layout
to optimize the cumulative
benefits of the natural hydrologic
features, the constructed
stormwater management system,
and the land development
components to achieve the
minimum post-construction
runoff volume, peak discharge
rates and pollutant loads from the
proposed land development site.
Apply site design techniques and practices as appropriate based on:
? Conservation Design principles and practices.
? Sustainable Design principles and practices.
? Low Impact Development Design principles and practices.

DESIGN PRACTICES
Numerous practices and strategies can be considered where their aim is to sustain and utilize the
benefits of existing site hydrology and minimize the generation of new stormwater runoff.
Following are brief descriptions of various practices that can be used to achieve the principles of
the natural hydrology site design process.
Site Layout Practices
The following site layout practices are but a few of the methods by which the natural hydrology
site design process described above can be implemented. Such practices are less functions of
regimented codes and procedures than about understanding and recognizing the benefits and
values that existing resources can contribute to the desired outcomes of the land development
project. In some circumstances, communication among design engineers, land planning and
environmental professionals, knowledgeable developers, community representatives, and
regulatory authorities is also beneficial to combine their collective understanding and
perspectives to create effective planning efforts.
Preserving Natural Drainage Features. Protecting natural drainage features, particularly
vegetated drainage swales and channels, is desirable because of their ability to infiltrate and
attenuate flows and to filter pollutants. Unfortunately, some common land development practices
encourage just the opposite pattern -- streets and adjacent storm sewers typically are located in
the natural headwater valleys and swales, thereby replacing natural drainage functions with an
impervious system. As a result, runoff and pollutants generated from impervious surfaces flow
directly into storm sewers with no opportunity for attenuation, infiltration, or filtration.
Designing developments to fit site topography retains much of the natural drainage function. In
addition, designing with the land minimizes the amount of site grading, reduces the amount of
compaction that can alter site infiltration characteristics, and can result in cost savings to the
developer.
Protecting Natural Depression Storage Areas. Depressional storage areas have no surface
outlet, or drain very slowly following a storm event. They can be commonly seen as ponded
areas in fields during the wet season or after large runoff events. Some development practices
eliminate these depressions by filling or draining, thereby eliminating their ability to reduce
surface runoff volumes and trap pollutants. The volume and release-rate characteristics of
depressions should be protected in the design of the development site to assist in reducing runoff
volumes and reducing runoff rates. Designing around the depression, or incorporating its storage
as additional capacity in required detention facilities, treats this area as a site amenity rather than
a detriment.
Avoiding Introduction of Impervious Areas. Careful site planning should consider reducing
impervious coverage to the maximum extent possible. Building footprints, sidewalks, driveways,
and other features producing impervious surfaces should be evaluated to minimize impacts on
runoff. In many instances, municipalities have the ability to reduce impervious cover by
providing incentives or opportunities in their zoning and subdivision/ land development
ordinances to reduce road width, reduce or modify cul-de-sac dimensions, reduce or modify
curbing requirements, and reduce or modify sidewalk requirements.
7
Disconnecting Impervious Surfaces. Impervious surfaces are significantly less of a problem if
they are not directly connected to an impervious conveyance system (such as storm sewer). Two
basic ways to reduce hydraulic connectivity are routing roof runoff over lawns and reducing the
use of storm sewers. Site grading should promote increasing travel time of stormwater runoff
from these sources, and should help reduce concentration of runoff to a single point within the
project site.
Routing Roof Runoff Over Lawns. Roof runoff can be easily routed over lawns in most site
designs. The practice discourages direct connections of downspouts to “driveway-to-street-tostorm sewers” or parking lots. The practice also discourages sloping driveways and parking lots
to the street. Crowning the driveway, to run off to the lawn, uses the lawn as a filter strip.
Reducing Street Widths. Street widths can be reduced by either eliminating on-street parking
and/or by reducing roadway widths. Designers should select the narrowest practical street width
for the design conditions (speed, curvature, etc.). Narrower neighborhood streets should be
considered and encouraged under select conditions. Reduced street widths also can lower
maintenance needs and costs.
Limiting Sidewalks to One Side of the Street. A sidewalk on one side of the street may suffice in
low-traffic neighborhoods. The lost sidewalk could be replaced with bicycle/recreational trails
that follow back-of-lot lines as an alternative to reduced sidewalks, where appropriate.
Reducing Building Setbacks. Reducing building setbacks (from streets) reduces the size of
impervious areas of driveways and entry walks and is most readily accomplished along lowtraffic streets where traffic noise is not a problem.
Constructing Compact Developments or Conservation Design: Low impact cluster or compact
development can reduce the amount of impervious area for a given number of lots. Savings
result from reduced street length, which also contributes to a reduction in development and longterm maintenance costs. Reduced site disturbance and preservation of open space help buffer
sensitive natural areas and retain more of a site’s natural hydrology. Development can be
designed so that areas of high infiltration soils are reserved as stormwater infiltration areas.
Construction activity can be focused onto les -sensitive areas without affecting the gross density
of development.
Stormwater Best Management Practices
Stormwater best management practices (BMPs) are intended to supplement natural hydrology
site design techniques where needed. Structural in nature, such practices include bioretention
facilities, rain gardens, swales and other engineered stormwater BMPs. Listed here are
techniques intended to help manage stormwater predominantly at or near the source, rather than
traditional techniques that largely release runoff over an extended period of time to adjacent
properties and streams. This list, in no way exhaustive, gives examples of a few of the most
common practices.
8
Bioretention. This type of BMP combines open space with stormwater treatment. Soil and
plants, rather than sand filters, treat and store runoff. Infiltration and evapotranspiration are
achieved, often coupled with an underdrain to collect water not infiltrated or used in the root
zone.
Rain Gardens. Typically rain gardens are shallow depression areas containing a mix of water
tolerant native plant species. The intent is to capture runoff for storage and use in the root zone
of plants. Intended largely as a way of managing stormwater through evapotranspiration (ET),
rain gardens often function as infiltration facilities as well.
Reducing the Need for Storm Sewers. Increasing the use of natural or vegetated drainage swales
can reduce the need for extending storm sewers for draining streets, parking lots, and back yards,
the potential for accelerating runoff from the development can be greatly reduced. The practice
requires greater use of swales and may not be practical for some development sites, especially if
there are concerns for areas that do not drain in a “reasonable” time. The practice requires
educating local citizens, who may expect runoff to disappear shortly after a rainfall event.
Using Permeable Paving Materials. These materials include permeable interlocking concrete
paving blocks or porous bituminous concrete, among others. Such materials should be
considered as alternatives to conventional pavement surfaces, especially for low use surfaces
such as driveways, overflow parking lots, and emergency access roads. Surfaces for which seal
coats may be applied should refrain from using permeable paving materials.

WEST NILE VIRUS DESIGN GUIDANCE
WEST NILE VIRUS GUIDANCE
(This source is from the Monroe County, PA Conservation District that researched the potential
of West Nile Virus problems from BMPs due to a number of calls they were receiving)
Monroe County Conservation District Guidance:
Stormwater Management and West Nile Virus
Source: Brodhead McMichaels Creeks Watershed Act 167 Stormwater Management
Ordinance Final Draft 2/23/04
The Monroe County Conservation District recognizes the need to address the problem of
nonpoint source pollution impacts caused by runoff from impervious surfaces. The new
stormwater policy being integrated into Act 167 stormwater management regulations by the PA
Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) will make nonpoint pollution controls an
important component of all future plans and updates to existing plans. In addition, to meet postconstruction anti-degradation standards under the state National Pollutant Discharge Elimination
System (NPDES) permitting program, applicants will be required to employ Best Management
Practices (BMPs) to address nonpoint pollution concerns.
Studies conducted throughout the United States have shown that wet basins and in particular
constructed wetlands are effective in traditional stormwater management areas such as channel
stability and flood control and are one of the most effective ways to remove stormwater
pollutants (United States Environmental Protection Agency 1991, Center for Watershed
Protection 2000). From Maryland to Oregon, studies have shown that as urbanization and
impervious surfaces increase in a watershed, the streams in those watersheds become degraded
(CWP 2000). Although there is debate over the threshold of impervious cover when degradation
becomes apparent (some studies show as little as 6% while others show closer to 20%), there is
agreement that impervious surfaces cause nonpoint pollution in urban and urbanizing watersheds
and that degradation is ensured if stormwater BMPs are not implemented.
Although constructed wetlands and ponds are desirable from a water quality perspective, there
may be concerns about the possibility of these stormwater management structures becoming
breeding grounds for mosquitoes. The Conservation District feels that although it may be a valid
concern, municipalities should not adopt ordinance provisions prohibiting wet basins for
stormwater management.
Mosquitoes
The questions surrounding mosquito production in wetlands and ponds have intensified in recent
years by the outbreak of the mosquito-borne West Nile Virus. As is the case with all vectorborne maladies, the life cycle of West Nile Virus is complicated, traveling from mosquito to bird,
back to mosquito, and then to other animals including humans. Culex pipiens was identified as
the vector species in the first documented cases from New York in 1999. This species is still
considered the primary transmitter of the disease across its range. Today there are some 60
species of mosquitoes that inhabit Pennsylvania. Along with C. pipiens, three other species have 
been identified as vectors of West Nile Virus while four more have been identified as potential
vectors.
The four known vectors in NE Pennsylvania are Culex pipiens, C. restuans, C. salinarius, and
Ochlerotatus japonicus. All four of these species prefer, and almost exclusively use, artificial
containers (old tires, rain gutters, birdbaths, etc.) as larval habitats. In the case of C. pipiens, the
most notorious of the vector mosquitoes, the dirtier the water, the better they like it. The
important factor is that these species do not thrive in functioning wetlands where competition for
resources and predation by larger aquatic and terrestrial organisms is high.
The remaining four species, Aedes vexans, Ochlerotatus Canadensis, O. triseriatus, and O.
trivittatus, are currently considered potential vectors due to laboratory tests (except the O.
trivittatus, which did have one confirmed vector pool for West Nile Virus in PA during 2002).
All four of these species prefer vernal habitats and ponded woodland areas following heavy
summer rains. These species may be the greatest threat of disease transmission around
stormwater basins that pond water for more than four days. This can be mitigated, however, by
establishing ecologically functioning wetlands.
Stormwater Facilities
If a stormwater wetland or pond is constructed properly and a diverse ecological community
develops, mosquitoes should not become a problem. Wet basins and wetlands constructed as
stormwater management facilities should be designed to attract a diverse wildlife community. If
a wetland is planned, proper hydrologic soil conditions and the establishment of hydrophytic
vegetation will promote the population of the wetland by amphibians and other mosquito
predators. In natural wetlands, predatory insects and amphibians are effective at keeping
mosquito populations in check during the larval stage of development while birds and bats prey
on adult mosquitoes.
The design of a stormwater wetland must include the selection of hydrophytic plant species for
their pollutant uptake capabilities and for not contributing to the potential for vector mosquito
breeding. In particular, species of emergent vegetation with little submerged growth are
preferable. By limiting the vegetation growing below the water surface, larvae lose protective
cover, and there is less chance of anaerobic conditions occurring in the water.
Stormwater ponds can be designed for multiple purposes. When incorporated into an open space
design, a pond can serve as a stormwater management facility and a community amenity.
Aeration fountains and stocked fish should be added to keep larval mosquito populations in
check.
Publications from the PA Department of Health and the Penn State Cooperative Extension
concerning West Nile Virus identify aggressive public education about the risks posed by
standing water in artificial containers (tires, trash cans, rain gutters, bird baths) as the most
effective method to control vector mosquitoes. 
Conclusion
The Conservation District understands the pressure faced by municipalities when dealing with
multifaceted issues such as stormwater management and encourages the incorporation of water
quality management techniques into stormwater designs. As Monroe County continues to grow,
conservation design, infiltration, and constructed wetlands and ponds should be among the
preferred design options to reduce the impacts of increases in impervious surfaces. When
designed and constructed appropriately, the runoff mitigation benefits to the community from
these design options will far outweigh their potential to become breeding grounds for
mosquitoes.
