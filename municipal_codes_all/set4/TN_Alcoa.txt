PREFACE
The Alcoa Municipal Code contains the codification and revision of the
ordinances of the City of Alcoa, Tennessee. By referring to the historical citation
appearing at the end of each section, the user can determine the origin of each
particular section. The absence of a historical citation means that the section
was added by the codifier. The word "modified" in the historical citation
indicates significant modification of the original ordinance.
The code is arranged into titles, chapters, and sections. Related matter
is kept together, so far as possible, within the same title. Each section number
is complete within itself, containing the title number, the chapter number, and
the section of the chapter of which it is a part. Specifically, the first digit,
followed by a hyphen, identifies the title number. The second digit identifies the
chapter number, and the last two digits identify the section number. For
example, title 2, chapter 1, section 6, is designated as section 2-106.
By utilizing the table of contents and the analysis preceding each title and
chapter of the code, together with the cross references and explanations included
as footnotes, the user should locate all the provisions in the code relating to any
question that might arise. However, the user should note that most of the
administrative ordinances (e.g. Annual Budget, Zoning Map Amendments, Tax
Assessments, etc...) do not appear in the code. Likewise, ordinances that have
been passed since the last update of the code do not appear here. Therefore, the
user should refer to the city's ordinance book or the city recorder for a
comprehensive and up to date review of the city's ordinances.
Following this preface is an outline of the ordinance adoption procedures,
if any, prescribed by the city's charter.
The code has been arranged and prepared in loose-leaf form to facilitate
keeping it up to date. MTAS will provide updating service under the following
conditions:
(1) That all ordinances relating to subjects treated in the code or which
should be added to the code are adopted as amending, adding, or deleting
specific chapters or sections of the code (see section 8 of the adopting ordinance).
(2) That one copy of every ordinance adopted by the city is kept in a
separate ordinance book and forwarded to MTAS annually.
(3) That the city agrees to pay the annual update fee as provided in the
MTAS codification service charges policy in effect at the time of the update.
When the foregoing conditions are met MTAS will reproduce replacement
pages for the code to reflect the amendments and additions made by such
ordinances. This service will be performed at least annually and more often if
iii
justified by the volume of amendments. Replacement pages will be supplied
with detailed instructions for utilizing them so as again to make the code
complete and up to date.
The able assistance of Sandy Selvage, the MTAS Sr. Word Processing
Specialist and Bobbie J. Sams, the MTAS Word Processing Specialist who did
all the typing on this project, and Tracy Gardner, Administrative Services
Assistant, is gratefully acknowledged.

Sessions in the State of Tennessee. (1971 Code, § 1-701)
3-502. Reasons and procedure for issuing search warrants.
(1) A search warrant may be issued upon any grounds provided by the
general laws of the State of Tennessee.
(2) A search warrant may only be issued upon probable cause
supported by affidavit naming or describing the property and the place to be
searched.
(3) The city judge, before issuing the warrant, shall examine on oath
the complainant and any witnesses he may produce and take their affidavits in
writing and cause them to be subscribed by the persons making them; the
affidavits shall set forth facts tending to establish the grounds of the application
or probable cause for believing that they exist.
(4) If the city judge is satisfied of the existence of the grounds for the
application or that there is probable grounds to believe their existence, he shall
issue a search warrant signed by him directed to any police officer or other
lawful officer, commanding him forthwith to search the person or place named
for the property specified and to bring it forthwith before the city judge.
(5) The city judge shall prepare an original of said search warrant and
two exact copies of the same, one of which is to be kept by him as a part of his
official records and one of which shall be left with the person or persons on
whom said warrant is served. The original search warrant shall be served and
returned as provided by law. The city judge shall endorse the warrants showing
the hour, date and the name of the officer to whom the warrants were delivered
for execution and the exact copy of such warrant and the endorsement thereof
shall be admissible in evidence in the courts.

be executed and returned to the city judge within five days after its date, after
which time unless executed it is void. (1971 Code, § 1-704)
3-505. Execution of search warrants. The search warrant may be
executed by any officer of the city or any other person to whom it is directed or
by any person in aid of such officers.
In order to execute said warrant, any officer may break open any door or
window of a house or any part of a house and anything therein if after notice of
his authority and purpose, he is refused admittance. (1971 Code, § 1-705)
3-506. Seizure of property. (1) When any officer takes property under
a search warrant, he shall, if required, give a receipt to the person from whom
it was taken or in whose possession it was found.
(2) The officer shall make a proper return of the search warrant to the
city judge and shall specify with particularity the property taken.
(3) When property is taken under a search warrant and delivered to
the city judge, he shall, if it was stolen or embezzled, cause it to be delivered to
the owner on satisfactory proof of his title; but if the warrant was issued on the
grounds specified in § 3-502(1), (2), (3), (4), or (5), he shall retain the property
in his possession subject to the order of the court to which he is required to
return the property or of the court in which the offense is triable. (1971 Code,
§ 1-706)
3-507. Hearings. (1) If the grounds on which the search warrant was
issued be controverted, the city judge shall proceed to hear the testimony which
must be reduced to writing and authenticated in the manner prescribed in
§ 3-502(4).
(2) If it shall appear that the property is not the same as described in
the warrant or that there is no probable cause for believing the existence of the
grounds for which the warrant is issued, the city judge shall direct it to be
restored to the person from whom it was taken.
(3) The city judge shall, if the property is not directed to be restored
under the provisions of subsection (2) of this section, annex together the search
warrant, the return, and the affidavits and return them to the court having
3-8
power to inquire into the offense in respect to which the search warrant was
issued.
(4) If upon the hearing it appears that there was no probable cause for
suing out the warrant, the whole cost may be taxed against the complainant and
execution awarded. (1971 Code, § 1-707)
3-508. Code violation enforcement. Administrative inspection
warrants; definitions; penalties.
(1) (a) "Issuing officer," as used in this section, means:
(i) Any official authorized by law to issue search
warrants;
(ii) Any court of record in the county of residence of the
agency making application for an administrative inspection
warrant; or
(iii) Any municipal court having jurisdiction over the
agency making application for an administrative inspection
warrant, provided that the judge of the court is licensed to practice
law in the State of Tennessee.
(b) "Building official," as used in this section, means any local
government building official certified pursuant to § 68-120-113; provided,
that such official is acting in their capacity as an official of a municipality
or county, and provided that the official is seeking to enforce the
ordinances or codes of such local government; and
(c) "Agency," as used in this section, means any county, city, or
town employing a building official certified pursuant to § 68-120-113.
(2) In the event that a building official is denied permission to make
an inspection and a warrant is required by the Constitution of the United States
or the State of Tennessee to perform such inspection, a building official may
obtain an administrative inspection warrant in accordance with the procedures
outlined in this section. The provisions of title 40, chapter 6, part 1, shall not
apply to warrants issued pursuant to this section.
(3) The issuing officer is authorized to issue administrative inspection
warrants authorizing a building official to inspect named premises. In so doing,
the issuing officer must determine from the affidavits filed by the building
official, acting as an officer of the agency requesting the warrant, that:
(a) The agency has the statutory authority to conduct the
inspection;
(b) Probable cause exists to believe that a violation of law has
occurred or is occurring. For the purposes of this section, probable cause
is not the same standard as used in obtaining criminal search warrants.
In addition to a showing of specific evidence of an existing violation,
probable cause can be found upon a showing of facts justifying further
inquiry, by inspection, to determine whether a violation of any state law
3-9
or local building, fire, or life safety code is occurring. This finding can be
based upon a showing that:
(i) Previous inspections have shown violations of law and
the present inspection is necessary to determine whether those
violations have been abated;
(ii) Complaints have been received by the agency and
presented to the issuing officer, from persons who by status or
position have personal knowledge of violations of law occurring on
the named premises;
(iii) The inspection of the premises in question was to be
made pursuant to an administrative plan containing neutral
criteria supporting the need for the inspection; or
(iv) Any other showing consistent with constitutional
standards for probable cause in administrative inspections;
(c) The inspection is reasonable and not intended to arbitrarily
harass the persons or business involved;
(d) The areas and items to be inspected are accurately described
and are consistent with the statutory inspection authority; and
(e) The purpose of the inspection is not criminal in nature and
the agency is not seeking sanctions against the person or business for
refusing entry.
(4) The issuing officer shall immediately make a finding as to whether
an administrative inspection warrant should be issued and if the issuing officer
so determines, issue such warrant. No notice shall be required prior to the
issuance of the warrant.
(5) All warrants shall include at least the following:
(a) The name of the agency and building official requesting the
warrant;
(b) The statutory or regulatory authority for the inspection;
(c) The names of the building official or officials authorized to
conduct the administrative inspection;
(d) A reasonable description of the property and items to be
inspected;
(e) A brief description of the purposes of the inspection; and
(f) Any other requirements or particularity required by the
Constitutions of the United States and the State of Tennessee regarding
administrative inspections.
(6) All warrants shall be executed within ten (10) days of issuance.
(7) Any person who willfully refuses to permit inspection, obstructs
inspection or aids in the obstruction of an inspection of property described in an
administrative inspection warrant commits a Class C misdemeanor.
(8) Any person aggrieved by an unlawful inspection of premises named
in an administrative inspection warrant may in any judicial or administrative
3-10
proceeding move to suppress any evidence or information received by the agency
pursuant to such inspection.
(9) If the court or the administrative agency finds that the inspection
was unlawful, such evidence and information shall be suppressed and not
considered in the proceeding. (as added by Ord. #06-105, Dec. 2006)

located. (1971 Code, § 2-202, as replaced by Ord. #05-048, Jan. 2005,

8-203. Beer board; monitoring and enforcement. (1) There is hereby
created a beer board which shall be composed of the city manager, city recorder
and one (1) member appointed by the mayor who shall serve for a three (3) year
term, whose duty it shall be to regulate and supervise the issuance of permits
to manufacture, distribute, and/or sell beverages regulated by this chapter to the
persons and in the manner hereinafter provided. The board shall provide such
other duties and have such other powers and authority as herein provided in
this chapter.
(2) If the beer board determines that a sale to a minor or underage

reapply for a new certificate for a period of one (1) year from the date of the beer
board's determination. (Adopted from Tennessee Code Annotated, § 57-5-607.)

8-205. Permit fees and privilege tax. (1) It shall be unlawful for any
person to sell, store for sale, distribute for sale, or manufacture beverages
regulated by this chapter without first making application to and obtaining a
permit from the beer board. The application shall be made on such form as the
board shall prescribe and/or furnish, and pursuant to Tennessee Code
Annotated, § 57-5-104(a), and shall be accompanied by a non-refundable

applications of this chapter.
(2) There is hereby imposed on the business of selling, distributing,
storing, giving away, or manufacturing beverages regulated by this chapter an
annual privilege tax of one hundred and no/100ths dollars ($100.00). Any person
engaged in the sale, distribution, storage, gifting, or manufacture of beverage
regulated by this chapter shall remit the tax on January 1 of each year to the
city. If the permittee does not pay the tax by January 31, then the city shall
send notice of the delinquency by certified mail. Once the notice is received, the
permittee has ten (10) days to remit the tax. If it is not remitted within that
period, the permit automatically becomes void. At the time a new permit is
issued to any business subject to this tax, the permittee shall be required to pay
the privilege tax on a prorated basis for each month or portion thereof remaining
until the next tax payment date. (1971 Code, § 2-205, as replaced by Ord. #05-
048, Jan. 2005, Ord. #07-115, Feb. 2007, and Ord. #13-320, Oct. 2013)

transferable. Each permittee or licensee shall display and keep displayed such
permit and license in conspicuous places on the premises where he is licensed
to conduct such business. Permits and licenses shall not be transferable. A
separate permit and license shall be obtained for each location where any
applicant is to manufacture, distribute or sell said legalized beverages. When a
permittee shall discontinue business or ceases to be associated on a day-to-day
basis with the business, then the permit terminates, and no refund of any
8-12
licenses or fees of any nature will be made. Sales of alcoholic beverages shall
immediately cease unless or until someone else is issued a permit. (1971 Code,
§ 2-206, as replaced by Ord. #05-048, Jan. 2005, and Ord. #13-320, Oct. 2013)
8-207. Permits shall be restrictive. (1) It shall be unlawful for any
person, and no permit shall be issued, to sell or distribute beverages regulated

to sell or distribute beverages regulated by this chapter for consumption upon

obtained a license for the sale of alcoholic beverages for consumption on the
premises pursuant to Tennessee Code Annotated, §§ 57-4-101, et seq.:
(a) To any person occupying any vehicle; except, however, when
sold in package form.
(b) At any place except the places where meals or lunches are
regularly served and regularly licensed therefore and then only to persons
seated at tables or bars, except for taverns which are governed by § 8-213
herein.
(c) Except in premises which are located within areas in which
commercial activity is permitted, and no permit will be issued therefor
except for premises located therein. (1971 Code, § 2-207, as amended by
Ord. #99-029, Sept. 1999, and replaced by Ord. #05-048, Jan. 2005, and
Ord. #13-320, Oct. 2013)
8-208. Violations of ordinance; permit suspension or revocation;
civil penalties. (1) In the event of the failure or refusal of any person holding
a permit issued hereunder to comply with the requirements of this chapter, or
in the event of his/her violation of any of the provisions of this chapter, it shall
be the duty of the beer board to give said permittee at least twenty-four (24)
hours' notice of a hearing before the board.
(2) The beer board has the authority to impose sanctions for violation
of this title, including civil penalties, and including suspension or revocation, as
further set forth herein.
(3) After a finding by the beer board for violation of the ordinance the
beer board may impose a penalty, as follows:
(a) Assess the permit holder with a per-offense civil penalty a
maximum of:
(i) One thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500.00) for
making or permitting to be made any sales to minors or underaged
persons, or one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) for any other offense.
(ii) Any civil penalty so assessed shall be paid within
seven (7) calendar days at the city recorder's office. Any failure by
8-13
the permit holder to promptly pay any civil penalty so assessed
shall constitute a separate offense for which the permit holder may
be subject to additional action by the beer board to include
suspension or revocation of any existing permit as well as the
assessment of additional civil penalties as provided in this part.
Each day of late payment shall constitute a separate offense.
(iii) Any civil penalty imposed under this (a) is in addition
to any permit suspension or revocation.
(b) May suspend the permit holder's permit for the following
periods:
(i) For a first or second violation of the ordinance within
one (1) year, the beer board may suspend a permit, depending on
the circumstances, including consideration of any aggravating
factors.
(ii) For the following minimum periods, unless state or
federal law requires a different suspension or revocation period:
(A) For a third violation of the ordinance within
one (1) year of the first violation, a ten (10) day suspension;
(B) For a fourth violation of the ordinance within
two (2) years of the first violation, a three (3) month
suspension;
(C) For a fifth violation of the ordinance within two
(2) years of the first violation, a six (6) month suspension.
(c) In lieu of a beer permit suspension, offer a permit holder the
alternative of paying a per-offense civil penalty of a maximum of:
(i) Two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00) for
making or permitting to be made any sales to minors or underaged
persons, or
(ii) One thousand dollars ($1,000.00) for any other
offense.
(iii) The procedure for imposition of a civil penalty in lieu
of a suspension of the permit shall be as follows:
(A) The beer board shall make a ruling and set a
penalty of suspension.
(B) The board may then offer the alternative of
allowing the permit holder the opportunity to pay a
per-offense civil penalty as defined above.
(C) The permit holder will then have seven (7)
days to pay a per-offense penalty as defined above. If the
civil penalty is paid within that time, the suspension shall
be deemed withdrawn.
(D) Payment of the civil penalty constitutes
admission of the violation.
8-14
(E) If the civil penalty is not paid by the end of the
regular business day on the seventh day, then the original
recommended suspension shall be imposed and become
effective on the eighth day.
(d) Revoke the beer permit, only when a permit holder has more
than two (2) violations of this ordinance within a twelve (12) month
period.
It is a defense to the revocation of a permit, for sale of beer to a
minor or underaged person, if the minor or underaged person purchasing
the beer exhibited identification indicating the person's age to be
twenty-one (21) or over, if the minor or underaged person reasonably
appeared to presumably be of such age, and the minor or underaged
person was unknown to the clerk making the sale. In such case, the
permit may be suspended for a period not to exceed ten (10) days, or a
civil penalty up to one thousand five hundred ($1,500) dollars may be
imposed. (See Tennessee Code Annotated,§ 57-5-108(b).)
(e) Consider the following aggravating factors warranting the
imposition of a more serious penalty:
(i) Sales to minors;
(ii) Sales by different agents or employees of the permit
holder;
(iii) Sales on different dates by agents or employees of the
permit holder;
(iv) Sales by minors employed by the business;
(v) Additional sales made after the ordinance violation
citation but prior to a court disposition or beer board hearing;
(vi) Failure to take appropriate disciplinary action against
the employee or employees who made the sales;
(vii) Repeated violations of other city ordinances against
the peace or persons, laws related to nuisance, or state or federal
laws.
(f) Responsible vendors. (i) A permit held by a responsible
vendor, as that certification is determined by the TABC, may not
be suspended or revoked by the beer board based on a clerk's
illegal sale of beer to a minor or underaged person, for off-premises
consumption, if:
(A) The clerk is properly certified and has attended
annual meetings since the original certification; or
(B) Is within sixty-one (61) days of the date of
hire at the time of the violation. In such case, however, the
beer board may impose a civil penalty not to exceed one
thousand ($1,000.00) dollars for each offense of making or
permitting to be made any sales to minors or underaged
8-15
person or for any other offense. (See Tennessee Code
Annotated, § 7-5-608(a).)
(ii) If the TABC revokes a responsible vendor's
certification for the illegal sale to a minor or underaged person, the
vendor shall be penalized for the violation by the board as if the
vendor had not been certified. (See Tennessee Code Annotated,
§ 57-5-608(b).)
(g) Revocation, suspension or imposition of civil penalty may
also be made whenever it shall satisfactorily appear that the premises of
any person, firm or corporation holding a permit is being maintained and
operated in such manner as to be detrimental to public health, safety or
morals. In considering the suspension or revocation of such permit, the
beer board shall consider repeated violations of any local ordinance or
state law involving prohibited sexual contact on the premises of an adult
oriented establishment.
(4) Violations of this title 8 which result in municipal or state court
judgments, or which are reported to the city by the TABC, without a finding by
the beer board, will nonetheless be considered as prior violations for
determining the applicability of suspension or revocation of a beer permit, or
other appropriate penalty. (1971 Code, § 2-208, as replaced by Ord. #05-048,
Jan. 2005, Ord. #13-320, Oct. 2013, and Ord. #17-427, Nov. 2017)
8-209. Special event permits. (1) The beer board is hereby authorized
and empowered to permit the retail sale or free distribution of beer for onpremises
consumption of beer at any public or private property within the city
pursuant to a special event permit at such times and as part of such events and
under such terms and conditions, rules and regulations as the Alcoa Beer Board
may establish which are not inconsistent with state laws regulating the sale of
beer.
(2) Any person conducting a special event in the city in which beer is
contemplated to be sold or given away other than within the premises of a
permittee's establishment shall apply for a special event permit, at least fortyfive
(45) days in advance, in writing to the chairman of the beer board with a
copy to the city recorder. The application required by this part shall include but
not be limited to the following:

(b) The date and time of event;
(c) The address, and phone number of individual applicants, or
the name, address, and phone number of a contact person for corporate
applicants;
(d) The specific location where beer is to be sold outside the
premises of an establishment for which a beer permit previously has been
issued;
(e) The specific parameters of the event area;
8-16
(f) The identity of any persons, establishments, or entities
which are contemplated to participate in dispensing beer at locations
other than their usual premises and the number of the current beer
permit(s) for each applicant;
(g) Any plans for proposed temporary closure of public rights-ofway;
(h) Plans for security and policing the event;
(i) The anticipated number of persons attending such event;
(j) A certificate of insurance;
(k) A signed statement allowing the beer board to run a
background check on the police records of each individual applicant, if
such applicants are not already in possession of a beer permit; and
(l) Any other requirements deemed necessary by city staff.
(3) Upon receipt, the proposed application for a special event permit
shall be placed on the beer board's agenda at its next regularly scheduled
meeting following receipt of the notice. Applicants shall send a representative
or representatives to such beer board meeting to address any questions or issues
arising out of the proposed special event.
(4) If such application for a special event permit is granted, the
applicant shall pay a special event permit fee of two hundred fifty dollars
($250.00).
(5) The special event permit shall state on its face the name of the
proposed vendor(s) of beer, the respective permit number(s), and the specific
location(s) and date(s) where such vendor(s) is permitted to sell beer under the
special event permit. A copy of the special event permit and a copy of the
vendor's regular beer permit (if applicable) must be displayed at each location
where beer is sold by such vendor. (1971 Code, § 2-209, as replaced by Ord.
#05-048, Jan. 2005, and Ord. #13-320, Oct. 2013)
8-210. Hours of sale regulated. It shall be unlawful for any person to
sell the beverages regulated by this chapter, nor shall it allow the same to be

Oct. 2013)
8-211. Inspection of beer business. The police officers of the City of
Alcoa shall have the right to inspect at any and all times the entire premises
and property where or upon or in which the beverages regulated by this chapter
are sold, stored, transported, or otherwise dispensed or distributed or handled,
whether at retail or wholesale, in the city for any law violations. (1971 Code,

8-17
8-212. Prima facie evidence of possession for sale. It shall be
unlawful for any person to sell, offer to sell, or distribute any beverages
regulated by this chapter without having obtained the permit and license
provided for by this chapter, and possession of five (5) gallons or more of such
beverages shall be prima facie evidence that such beverage was being stored or
possessed for sale. (1971 Code, § 2-212, as amended by Ord. #1043, Dec. 1996,
and replaced by Ord. #05-048, Jan. 2005, and Ord. #13-320, Oct. 2013)

to the latest official census of the City of Alcoa. (Ord. #932, July 1993, as
replaced by Ord. #05-048, Jan. 2005, and Ord. #13-320, Oct. 2013)
8-214. Restaurants and clubs. It shall be lawful to sell, store, possess,
and/or distribute beverages regulated by this chapter for consumption onpremises
at a restaurant or club, provided that, the establishment obtains an
appropriate permit and complies with the regulations set out in this chapter and
in state law. In accordance with Tennessee Code Annotated, § 57-5-103(3)(B),
a permit will allow restaurants and clubs to distribute beer in an outdoor
serving area including, but not limited to, any deck, patio, courtyard, or exterior
area provided that said area:
(1) Must be contiguous to the building;
(2) Must be owned and operated by the business; and
(3) Must be fenced in by a barrier of at least forty inches (40") high.
The barrier need not be permanent, but must be constructed of a sturdy
material and may only allow for gaps at designated entrances and exits. The
boundaries of this outdoor serving area must remain ten feet (10') back from the
property line, except that establishments within the "mixed-use district E-3"
area may have outdoor serving areas up to the property line. Neither the
outdoor serving area, nor the constructed barrier shall restrict or obstruct the
visibility of traffic traveling on any adjacent roadway. If the outdoor serving
area utilizes any part of a public space, such as a parking lot, the area
designated for serving beer will no longer act in its capacity as a public space.
No vehicles will be allowed in the portion of the parking lot where beer is being
served as long as it is designated as a serving area, except for display or exhibit
vehicles. (1971 Code, § 2-214, as replaced by Ord. #05-048, Jan. 2005, and

distribute any beverages regulated by this chapter for consumption on premises
at a hotel/motel, provided that the establishment obtains a beer permit and acts
in accordance with all of the regulations laid out herein and in state law. Said
8-18
beverages may be distributed in multiple areas within the hotel/motel including,
but not limited to, guests' rooms, suites and banquet rooms. Such hotel/motel
shall in all respects comply with the applicable provisions of Tennessee Code
Annotated, § 57-5-107. (1971 Code, § 2-215, as replaced by Ord. #05-048, Jan.

distribute any beverages regulated by this chapter for consumption on-premises
at an event stadium or convention center, provided that a beer permit is
obtained and the organization acts in accordance with all of the regulations laid
out herein and in state law. In the case of a reoccurring event, such as a sporting
event, the organization may obtain an on-premises license. In the case of an
infrequent event, such as a concert, the organization may obtain a special event
permit. Pursuant to Tennessee Code Annotated, § 57-4-203(i)(2), a bona fide
convention group may distribute beer or other alcoholic beverages at no cost to

8-217. Beer board procedures and hearings. (1) Proceedings by the
beer board may be initiated in the following manner:
(a) Complaint from law enforcement, the TABC, court system,
or alcohol related community outreach program(s), of non-compliance by
a permit holder, or employee or agent of such, which constitutes a
violation of title 8 of this code, based on either:
(i) A reasonable belief that a noncompliance offense has
occurred and a reasonable belief that the named defendant is the
permit holder; or
(ii) The conviction in any municipal, state or federal court
of a beer or alcoholic beverage offense occurring on the premises
where a city permit has been issued or upon the conviction in any
court for a beer or alcoholic beverage or a felony by any person who
holds a city beer permit.
(b) Complaints hereunder shall be filed with the city recorder
who shall serve as the clerk of the beer board. The city recorder shall
then notify the offending permit holder by sending a copy of the complaint
or notification and scheduling a hearing before the beer board no less
than thirty (30) days nor more than sixty (60) days from receipt of the
complaint or notification.
(c) Copies of the complaints or notification of noncompliance
along with the notice of hearing containing the date, time and place for
hearing and the alleged offending permit holder's right to counsel, shall
be served on the alleged offending permit holder either by hand delivery
8-19
by a city police officer to the manager on duty at the business address on
the permit, or by service via certified mail, return receipt requested, to
the permit holder at the address set forth in said permit holder's most
recent application for a beer permit.
(2) A permit holder's failure to appear at the beer board hearing shall
be deemed a default authorizing the beer board to make a finding of
noncompliance and issuing such orders and imposing such sanctions as are
appropriate for the alleged offense. However, at the time a default is entered,
the beer board shall make a finding of fact pertaining to the offense, thereby
constituting the record of the proceeding.
(3) Hearings of the beer board shall be conducted by the city manager
or his designee. Nonetheless, the city manager shall remain as a member of the
beer board at all times regardless of the decision to designate a person to
conduct the hearings.
(4) The standard of proof for the beer board to make a finding of a
violation is by a preponderance of the evidence, or that all the evidence
examined leads to the conclusion that it is more likely than not that the permit
holder is guilty of noncompliance.
(5) The decision of the beer board will be made at the conclusion of the
hearing or within forty-eight (48) hours of the hearing. A written report setting
forth the facts relied upon in reaching the decision, the findings and the orders
of the beer board shall be issued within fifteen (15) days of the hearing date.
The report shall be maintained by the city recorder and a copy thereof sent to
the permit holder and counsel therefore. The date of filing of the report with the
city recorder shall constitute the final action of the beer board.
(6) In the event the beer board and permit holder reach an agreement
as to the finding and outcome of the alleged noncompliance, a consent order may
be issued and signed by the city manager and permit holder, or counsel
therefore, in lieu of a report by the beer board.
(7) The city recorder has the authority to issue subpoenas for witness
testimony. Subpoenas must be timely requested and may not serve as a reason
for continuance of a hearing. Subpoenas may be served by a city police officer
or other person authorized under state law to serve subpoenas.
(8) All tape recordings and evidence used at a beer board hearing shall
be maintained by the city recorder until all appeal periods have passed and a
final decision rendered. (1971 Code, § 2-217, as replaced by Ord. #05-048, Jan.

8-218. Court action following beer board orders. (1) The exclusive
method of review of the beer board orders are to the Blount County Circuit or
Chancery Courts for review by statutory writ of certiorari, with a trial de novo

that are made available through the general wholesale/retail distribution
system; provided that, the provisions of Tennessee Code Annotated,
§ 57-3-204(g) related to the delivery of alcoholic beverages by wholesalers shall
be applicable, and that the manufacturer complies with all other applicable

imposed on the wholesale price of the HACB supplied pursuant to Tennessee
Code Annotated, § 57-3-204(f)(7)(B) by a wholesaler for those products
manufactured and sold by the manufacturer at its retail store as authorized
pursuant to Tennessee Code Annotated, § 57-3-204(f)(7). The manner and
method of collection, reporting, enforcement and use of the inspection fee
imposed by this section shall be as that provided for retail liquor stores as set
forth in chapter 5 of this title 8.

inclusive, is hereby adopted so as to be applicable to all sales of intoxicating
liquors, HACB, or wine for on-premises consumption which are regulated by the
said code when such sales are conducted within the city. It is the intent of the

City of Alcoa General Fund to be paid annually as provided in this chapter) upon
any person engaging in the business of selling at retail in the city intoxicating

becomes legally permissible for the city to collect said tax. (as added by

canvasser, agent, solicitor, or other representative for the purpose of receiving
an order from a consumer for any alcoholic beverages at the residence or place
of business of such consumer nor shall any licensee receive or accept any such
order which shall have been solicited and received at the residence or place of
business of such consumer. This subsection shall not be construed as to prohibit
the solicitation by a state licensed wholesaler of any order from any licensed
retailer at the licensed premises. (as added by Ord. #13-320, Oct. 2013, and
amended by Ord. #18-456, Oct. 2018 Ch15_12-10-19)
8-507. Fees. (1) Amounts generally. There is hereby levied on each
licensee an inspection fee of up to eight percent (8%), with the exact amount of
8-30
such percentage to be determined from time to time by board of commissioners,
on the gross purchase price of all alcoholic beverages acquired by the licensee for
retail sale from any wholesaler or any other source. In the event co-licensees
holding a liquor store privilege license for a single liquor store, such inspection
fee shall be the same as if the local liquor store privilege license were held by a
single licensee.
(2) Collection. Collection of such inspection fee shall be made by the
wholesaler or other source vending to the licensee at the time the sales is made
to the licensee. Payment of the inspection fee by the collecting wholesaler or
other source shall be made to the city recorder on or before the twentieth (20th)
day of each calendar month for all collections in the preceding calendar month.
Nothing herein shall relieve the licensee of the obligation of payment of the
inspection fee, and it shall be the licensee's duty to see that the payment of the
inspection fee for his or her liquor store is made to the city recorder on or before
the twentieth (20th) day of each calendar month for the preceding month.
Wholesalers collecting and remitting the inspection fee to the city shall be
entitled to reimbursement for this collection service in a sum equal to five
percent (5%) of the total amount of inspection fees collected and remitted, such
reimbursement to be deducted and shown on the monthly report to the city.
(3) Reports. The city recorder shall prepare and make available to each
wholesaler and other source vending alcoholic beverages to licensees sufficient
forms for the monthly report of inspection fees payable by such licensee making
purchases from such wholesaler or other source. Such wholesaler shall timely
complete and return the forms and the required information and inspection fees
within the time specified above.
(4) Failure to pay fees. The failure to pay the inspection fees and to
make the required reports accurately and within the time required by this
chapter shall, at the sole direction of the city manager, be cause for suspension
of the offending licensee's local liquor store privilege license for as much as
thirty (30) days and, at the sole discretion of the board of commissioners, be
cause for revocation of such local liquor store privilege license. Each such action
may be taken by giving written notice thereof to the licensee, no hearing with
respect to such an offense being required. If a licensee has his or her license
revoked, suspended or otherwise removed and owes the city inspection fees at
the time of such suspension, revocation, or removal the city attorney may timely
file the necessary action in a court of appropriate jurisdiction for recovery of
such inspection fees. Further, each licensee who fails to pay or have paid on his
or her behalf the inspection fees imposed hereunder shall be liable to the city for
a penalty on the delinquent amount due in an amount of ten percent (10%) of
the inspection fee.
(5) Use of fees. All funds derived from inspection fees imposed herein
shall be used to defray expenses in connection with the enforcement of this title
including particularly the payment and compensation of officers, employees, and
other representatives of the city in investigating and inspecting licensees and
8-31
applicants and in seeing that all provisions of this title are observed. The board
of commissioners finds and declares that the amount of these inspection fees is
reasonable, and that the funds expected to be derived from these inspection fees
will be reasonably required for such purposes. (as added by Ord. #13-320, Oct.
2013)
8-508. Records kept by licensee. In addition to any records specified
in the state rules and regulations, each licensee shall keep on file, at such
licensee's liquor store, the following records:
(1) The original invoices of all alcoholic beverages bought by the
licensee;
(2) The original receipts for any alcoholic beverages returned by such
licensee to any wholesaler;
(3) A current daily record of the gross sales by such licensee with
evidence of cash register receipts for each day's sales; and
(4) An accurate record of all alcoholic beverages lost, damaged, or
disposed of other than by sale and showing for each such transaction the date
thereof, the quantity and brands of alcoholic beverages involved and the name
of the person or persons receiving the same.
All such records shall be preserved for a period of at least fifteen (15)
months unless the city recorder gives the licensee written permission to dispose
of such records at an earlier time. In the event of co-licensees holding a single
license, one (1) set of records per liquor store satisfies the requirements of this
part. (as added by Ord. #13-320, Oct. 2013)
8-509. Inspections generally. The city manager, the city recorder, the
city finance director, the chief of police or the authorized representatives or
agents of any of them are authorized to examine the premises, books, papers
and records of any liquor store at any time the liquor store is open for business
for the purpose of determining whether the provisions of this chapter are being
observed. Refusal to permit such revocation shall be a violation of this chapter
and shall constitute sufficient reason for revocation of the liquor store privilege
license of the offending licensee or for the refusal to renew the local liquor store
privilege license of the offending licensee. (as added by Ord. #13-320, Oct. 2013)
8-510. Enforcement. Any violation of the terms of this chapter shall be
punishable by a penalty of up to five hundred dollars ($500.00) per violation,
temporary suspension, permanent revocation of the local liquor store privilege
license, or any combination thereof at the discretion of the board of
commissioners. Enforcement provisions are also applicable as found under state
law. (as added by Ord. #13-320, Oct. 2013)
8-511. Certificate of compliance. As a condition precedent to the
issuance of a state liquor retailer's license by the state alcoholic beverage
8-32
commission, board of commissioners may authorize the issuance of certificates
of compliance by the city according to the terms contained herein. (as added by
Ord. #13-320, Oct. 2013)
8-512. Application. (1) Filing--content. An applicant or applicant group
for a liquor store shall file with the city recorder a completed written application
on a form to be provided by the city recorder which shall contain all of the
following information and whatever additional information the board of
commissioners or city manager may require:

8-513. Consideration. In issuing the initial certificate of compliance
sufficient for the licensing of up to three (3) liquor stores in the city permitted

persons deemed by it in its sole discretion to have qualifications required by law
and the most suitable circumstances for the lawful operation of a liquor store
without regard to the order of time in which the applications are filed. Such
persons and only such persons shall receive the initial certificates of compliance
issued by the city. If thereafter, an additional license becomes available due to

Such person or persons and only such person or persons will receive certificates
of compliance issued by the city sufficient to allow the operation of the liquor
store contemplated by the chosen application. Applications shall be retained by
the city until such time as all liquor stores for which certificates of compliance
have been issued by the city are opened for business. At that time, all pending
applications which did not result in the granting of certificates of compliance
after consideration by board of commissioners will expire and be disposed of by
the city. Applications can only be submitted to the city during the time frame
the board of commissioners has set forth for receipt of such applications.
Applications and all matters submitted with or as a part of such applications
become at the time they are submitted the sole and exclusive property of the city
and constitute public records open to public inspection. (as added by
Ord. #13-320, Oct. 2013)
8-514. Restrictions upon issuance. (1) Additional certificates of
compliance. The board of commissioners shall refuse to issue a certificate of
compliance whenever the number of previously issued and outstanding
certificates of compliance when added to the number of outstanding licenses
equals the number of licenses authorized by this chapter.

unless a license issued on the basis thereof can be exercised without violating

the board of commissioners as a suitable location for the operation of a
liquor store; and
(c) The application has been considered at a public meeting of

members thereof.
(4) Time period for action. Any applicant or applicant group who has

amount of time and a certification thereof will be sent to the alcoholic beverage

appointed members of boards or commissions who have no duties covering the
regulation of alcoholic beverages or beer.
(3) Felons. No licensee shall be a person who has been convicted of a
felony within ten (10) years prior to the time he or she or the legal entity which
he or she is connected shall receive a license; provided that this provision shall
not apply to any person who has been so convicted but whose rights of
citizenship have been restored or judgment of infamy has been removed by a
court of competent jurisdiction. In case of such conviction occurring after a
license has been issued and received, the license shall immediately be revoked
if such convicted felon is an individual licensee and, if not, the partnership,
corporation, limited liability company or association with which he or she is
connected shall immediately discharge him or her and he or she shall have no
further interest therein or else such license shall be immediately revoked.

such period been engaged in business, alone or with others, in violation of any
such laws or rules and regulations.
(6) Disclosure of interest. It shall be unlawful for any person to have
ownership in or participate in, either directly or indirectly, the profits of any
liquor store unless his or her interest in such business and the nature, extent
and character thereof shall appear on the application or if the interest is
acquired after the issuance of a license unless it be fully disclosed to the city
manager and approved by him or her in a timely manner.
(7) Age. No licensee shall be a person under the age of twenty-one (21)
years and it shall be unlawful for any licensee to employ any person under the

place of business to engage in the storage, sale or distribution of alcoholic
beverages.
(8) Interest in only one liquor store. A person shall have an interest,
either direct or indirect, in no more than one (1) liquor store licensed under this
title in the City of Alcoa. (as added by Ord. #13-320, Oct. 2013)
8-37
8-518. Nature of license-suspension or revocation. The issuance of
a license does not vest a property right in the licensee but is a privilege subject
to revocation or suspension. Any license shall be subject to suspension or
revocation by board of commissioners for any violation of this title by the
licensee or by any person for whose acts the licensee is responsible. The licensee
shall be given reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard before the board
of commissioners suspends or revokes a license for any violation unless provided
otherwise specifically herein. If the licensee is convicted of a violation of this
title by a final judgment in any court and the operation of the judgment is not
suspended by an appeal, upon written notice to the licensee, the city manager
may immediately suspend the license for a period not to exceed sixty (60) days,

conviction thereafter. A license shall be subject to revocation or suspension

provide for the animals care and keeping for at least thirty (30) days,
inclusive of the date on which the animal was taken into custody. Even
if a bond or security is posted, the administrator may humanely dispose
of the animal at the end of the time for which expenses of care and
keeping are covered by the bond or security, unless there is a court order
prohibiting the disposition. The court is authorized to require a bond in
the amount necessary to protect the administrator from any cost of the
care, keeping or disposal of the animal. The authority taking custody of
an animal under this section shall give notice of this section by posting
a copy of it at the place where the animal is taken into custody or by
delivering it to a person residing on the property. (as added by

(3,500 lbs.) by a freight motor vehicle, as described in the preceding
sentence, shall not be applicable whenever a converter dolly or equivalent
fixed connection having the same safety characteristics is appropriately
installed or placed under the trailer to be hauled by this freight motor
vehicle. For the purposes of this subsection (2)(e), "trailer" means a
vehicle without motive power designed or used for carrying freight or
property wholly on its own structure; provided, that it is not unlawful for
any motor vehicle subject to this part to have a semitrailer, which, for the
purposes hereof, is defined as a vehicle for the carrying of property or
freight and so designed that some part of the weight of the semitrailer or
its load rests upon or is carried by the motor vehicle to which it is
attached. The hauling of a trailer (to the extent herein permitted) or a
semitrailer shall be subject to the further provisions hereof. This part is
not intended to prohibit the movements of spools carrying wire or cable,
when used for construction or repair purposes. The weight limitation

that vehicular traffic shall not enter or cross the intersection when
the red or "Stop" signal is exhibited; and
(ii) Pedestrians facing the signal are advised that there
is insufficient time to cross the roadway, and any pedestrian then
starting to cross shall yield the right-of-way to all vehicles;
(c) Red alone or "Stop":
(i) Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall stop before
entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or if
there is a clearly marked stop line preceding the crosswalk, then
before such stop line, but if there is neither a crosswalk nor a stop
line, then before entering the intersection, and the vehicular traffic
shall remain standing until green or "Go" is shown alone. A right
turn on a red signal shall be permitted at all intersections within
the City of Alcoa; provided, that the prospective turning car shall
come to a full and complete stop before turning and that the
turning car shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians and cross
traffic traveling in accordance with their traffic signal; provided
further, that such turn will not endanger other traffic lawfully
using the intersection. A right turn on red shall be permitted at all
intersections, except those that are clearly marked by a "No Turns
On Red" sign, which may be erected by the City of Alcoa at
intersections which they decide to require no right turns on red in
the interest of traffic safety;
(ii) No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the
roadway unless entry can be made safely and without interfering
with any vehicular traffic; and
(iii) A left turn on a red or stop signal shall be permitted
at all intersections within the City of Alcoa where a one-way street
intersects with another one-way street moving in the same
direction into which the left turn would be made from the original
one-way street. Before making such a turn, the prospective turning
15-55
car shall come to a full and complete stop and shall yield the
right-of-way to pedestrians and cross traffic traveling in
accordance with the traffic signal so as not to endanger traffic
lawfully using the intersection. A left turn on red shall be
permitted at any applicable intersection except those clearly
marked by a "No Turn on Red" sign, which may be erected by the
City of Alcoa at intersections that these governments decide to
require no left turns on red in the interest of traffic safety;
(d) Red with green arrow:
(i) Vehicular traffic facing this signal may cautiously
enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by the
arrow, but shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully
within a crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the
intersection; and
(ii) No pedestrian facing the signal shall enter the
roadway unless entry can be made safely and without interfering
with any vehicular traffic;
(e) In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, this section shall be
applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature can have
no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or before the
stop line, but in the absence of any sign or stop line the stop shall be
made at the signal;
(f) The operator of any streetcar shall obey the signals in
subdivisions (1)(a)-(e) as applicable to vehicles;
(g) All electric highway, street and road vehicular traffic-control
signals in Tennessee shall have a uniform arrangement of the colored
lenses in the various signal faces of the signals, as follows: In each signal
face, all red lenses in vertical signals shall be located above all yellow and
green lenses, and in horizontal signals, to the left of all yellow and green
lenses. Yellow lenses shall be located between any red lens or lenses and
all other lenses; and
(h) Whenever in the City of Alcoa three (3) light traffic-control
signals are used displaying successively green, yellow, and red lights for
the direction of motorists and pedestrians, the minimum time exposure
of the yellow light shall be three (3) seconds. Any city agency or any
political subdivision of the City of Alcoa that installs, owns, operates, or
maintains any such traffic-control signal light shall set or cause to be set
the timing-control device for the signal light in compliance with this
subdivision (1)(h). No city agency or any political subdivision of the City
of Alcoa that installs, owns, operates, or maintains a traffic-control signal
light in an intersection that employs a surveillance camera for the
enforcement or monitoring of traffic violations shall reduce the time
15-56
exposure of the yellow light at the intersection with the intended purpose
of increasing the number of traffic violations.
(2) Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, the driver of a motorcycle
approaching an intersection that is controlled by a traffic-control signal utilizing
a vehicle detection device that is inoperative due to the size of the motorcycle
shall come to a full and complete stop at the intersection and, after exercising
due care as provided by law, may proceed with due caution when it is safe to do
so. It is not a defense to a violation that the driver of a motorcycle proceeded
under the belief that a traffic-control signal utilized a vehicle detection device
or was inoperative due to the size of the motorcycle when the signal did not
utilize a vehicle detection device or that the device was not in fact inoperative
due to the size of the motorcycle.
(3) The driver of any vehicle approaching an intersection that is
controlled by a traffic-control signal that is inoperative because of mechanical
failure or accident shall come to a full and complete stop at the intersection, and
may proceed with due caution when it is safe to do so; provided, that if two (2)
or more vehicles enter such an intersection from different directions at
approximately the same time, after having come to full and complete stops, the
driver of the vehicle on the left shall yield the right-of-way to the vehicle on the
right. A traffic-control signal shall not be considered inoperative if the signal is
operating in flashing mode. If a signal is operating in flashing mode, it shall
require obedience by vehicular traffic.
(4) Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, the rider of a bicycle
approaching an intersection that is controlled by a traffic-control signal utilizing
a vehicle detection device that is inoperative due to the size of the bicycle shall
come to a full and complete stop at the intersection and, after exercising due
care as provided by law, may proceed with due caution when it is safe to do so.
It is not a defense to a violation that the rider of a bicycle proceeded under the
belief that a traffic-control signal utilized a vehicle detection device or was
inoperative due to the size of the bicycle when the signal did not utilize a vehicle
detection device or that the device was not in fact inoperative due to the size of
the bicycle.
(5) It is not a violation of subdivision (1)(c), unless the front tires of a
vehicle cross the stop line after the signal is red (T.C.A. § 55-8-110). (1971 Code,
§ 9-402, as repealed and replaced by Ord. #06-105, Dec. 2006, and replaced by

15-603. Pedestrian-control signals. Whenever special
pedestrian-control signals exhibiting the words or pictures depicting "Walk" or
"Wait" or "Don't Walk" are in place, these signals shall indicate as follows:
(1) Walk. Pedestrians facing the signals may proceed across the
roadway in the direction of the signal and shall be given the right-of-way by the
drivers of all vehicles; and
15-57
(2) Wait or Don't Walk. No pedestrian shall start to cross the roadway
in the direction of the signal, but any pedestrian who has partially completed
crossing on the walk signal shall proceed to a sidewalk or safety island while the
wait signal is showing (T.C.A. § 55-8-111). (1971 Code, § 9-403, as repealed and
replaced by Ord. #06-105, Dec. 2006, and replaced by Ord. #19-484, Oct. 2019

15-604. Flashing signals. (1) Whenever an illuminated flashing red or
yellow signal is used in a traffic sign or signal, it shall require obedience by
vehicular traffic as follows:
(a) Flashing red (stop signal). When a red lens is illuminated
with rapid intermittent flashes, and the light is clearly visible for a
sufficient distance ahead to permit stopping, drivers of vehicles shall stop
before entering the nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at a limit line
when marked, or, if none, then before entering the intersection, and the
right to proceed shall be subject to the rules applicable after making a
stop at a stop sign; and
(b) Flashing yellow (caution signal). When a yellow lens is
illuminated with rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles may
proceed through the intersection or past the signal only with caution.
(2) This section shall not apply at railroad grade crossings. Conduct
of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be governed by
the rules set forth in this title (T.C.A. § 55-8-112). (1971 Code, § 9-404, as
repealed and replaced by Ord. #06-105, Dec. 2006, and replaced by by Ord.

15-605. Unauthorized signs, signals, or markings. (1) No person
shall place, maintain or display upon or in view of any highway any
unauthorized sign, signal, marking or device that purports to be or is an
imitation of or resembles an official traffic control device or railroad sign or
signal, or that attempts to direct the movement of traffic, or that hides from
view or interferes with the effectiveness of any official traffic control device or
any railroad sign or signal.
(2) No person shall sell or offer for sale any traffic control signal or
device for use on any street, road, or highway in this city unless the device
conforms to the requirements of this title.
(3) No person shall place or maintain nor shall any public authority
permit upon any highway any traffic sign or signal bearing any commercial
advertising.
(4) This section shall not be deemed to prohibit the erection upon
private property adjacent to highways of signs giving useful directional
information and of a type that cannot be mistaken for official signs.
(5) Every prohibited sign, signal or marking is declared to be a public
nuisance and the authority having jurisdiction over the highway is empowered
15-58
to remove the sign, signal or marking or cause it to be removed without notice
(T.C.A. § 55-8-113). (1971 Code, § 9-405, and replaced by by Ord. #19-484, Oct.

ownership of its sign, signal, marker and device in letters on the back of those
items in letters not less than one-fourth inch (1/4") nor more than three-fourths
inch (3/4") in height by use of a metal stamp, etching, or other permanent
marking. Unlawful possession of any such sign, signal, marker, or device is a
civil ordinance violation (T.C.A. § 55-8-184). (as added by Ord. #19-484, Oct.

vehicle when traveling upon a roadway outside of a business or residence
district and which is following another motor truck or motor vehicle towing
another vehicle shall, whenever conditions permit, leave sufficient space so that

the ground or pavement and of making the refill if this is done by the

which shall be safe for travel and convenient for users. (1971 Code, § 12-105)
16-206. Restoration of streets, etc. Any person, firm, corporation,
association, or others making any excavation or tunnel in or under any street,
alley, or public place in this municipality shall restore said street, alley, or
public place to its original condition except for the surfacing, which shall be done
by the municipality, but shall be paid for by such person, firm, corporation,
association, or others promptly upon the completion of the work for which the
excavation or tunnel was made. In case of unreasonable delay in restoring the
street, alley, or public place, the recorder shall give notice to the person, firm,
corporation, association, or others that unless the excavation or tunnel is refilled
16-6
properly within a specified reasonable period of time, the municipality will do
the work and charge the expense of doing the same to such person, firm,
corporation, association, or others. If within the specified time the conditions
of the above notice have not been complied with, the work shall be done by the
municipality, an accurate account of the expense involved shall be kept, and the
total cost shall be charged to the person, firm, corporation, association, or others
who made the excavation or tunnel. (1971 Code, § 12-106)
16-207. Insurance. In addition to making the deposit or giving the bond
hereinbefore required to insure that proper restoration is made, each person
applying for an excavation permit shall file a certificate of insurance indicating
that he is insured against claims for damages for personal injury as well as
against claims for property damage which may arise from or out of the
performance of the work, whether such performance be by himself, his
subcontractor, or anyone directly or indirectly employed by him. Such insurance
shall cover collapse, explosive hazards, and underground work by equipment on
the street, and shall include protection against liability arising from completed
operations. The amount of the insurance shall be prescribed by the city
engineer in accordance with the nature of the risk involved; provided, however,
that the liability insurance for bodily injury shall not be less than $100,000 for
each person and $300,000 for each accident, and for property damages not less
than $25,000 for any one (1) accident, and a $75,000 aggregate. (1971 Code,
§ 12-207)
16-208. Time limits. Each application for a permit shall state the
length of time it is estimated will elapse from the commencement of the work
until the restoration of the surface of the ground or pavement, or until the refill
is made ready for the pavement to be put on by the municipality if the
municipality restores such surface pavement. It shall be unlawful to fail to
comply with this time limitation unless permission for an extension of time is
granted by the city engineer. (1971 Code, § 12-108)
16-209. Supervision. The city engineer shall from time to time inspect
all excavations and tunnels being made in or under any public street, alley, or
other public place in the municipality and see to the enforcement of the
provisions of this chapter. Notice shall be given to him at least ten (10) hours

by a professional engineer competent in civil and site design and licensed
to practice in the State of Tennessee.
(e) The approved stormwater management plan shall be
adhered to during grading and construction activities. Under no
circumstance is the owner of land development activities, or any person(s)
acting on the owner's behalf, allowed to deviate from the approved s
management plan without prior approval of a plan amendment by the
director.
(f) The approved stormwater management plan shall be
amended if the proposed site conditions change after plan approval is
obtained, or if it is determined by the director during the course of
grading or construction that the approved plan is inadequate.
(g) Other state and/or federal permits that may be necessary for
construction in and around streams and/or wetlands shall be approved
through the appropriate lead regulatory agency prior to final approval of
a stormwater management plan to the City of Alcoa.
(h) Best management practices, stormwater management
facilities, water quality buffers and water quality volume credit areas
shown in stormwater management plans shall be maintained through the
declaration of a protective covenant, entitled "Covenants for Permanent
Maintenance of Stormwater Best Management Practices." The covenant
must be approved and shall be enforceable by the City of Alcoa. The
covenant shall be recorded with the deed, run with the land, and continue
in perpetuity.
(i) Best management practices, stormwater management
facilities, water quality buffers and water quality volume credit areas
shall be placed into a permanent easement that is recorded with the deed
to the parcel. A maintenance right-of-way or easement, having a
minimum width of fifteen feet (15') from a public road or private road
shall also be provided to access such permanent easements.
(j) Owners of land development activities not exempted from
submitting a stormwater management plan may be subject to additional
watershed or site specific requirements other than those stated in this
chapter in order to satisfy local, state or federal requirements, or where
the director has determine through stormwater master plans,
16-25
engineering studies, a history of existing or documented water quality
problems, or engineering judgment that additional restrictions are needed
to limit adverse impacts of the proposed development on water quality,
channel protection, overbank flooding and/or extreme flooding. Areas
subject to additional requirements may also include developments,
redevelopments or land uses that are considered pollutant hotspots.
(k) The director may waive or modify the requirements of the
chapter if adequate water quality treatment, channel protection,
overbank flood protection and/or extreme flood protection are suitably
provided by a downstream or shared off-site best management practice
or if engineering studies determine that installing the required best
management practice(s) would actually cause adverse impact to water
quality or cause increase channel erosion or downstream flooding.
(l) This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair
any existing easements, covenants, deed restrictions or existing
ordinances and regulations. However, where the provisions of this
chapter and other regulations conflict or overlap that provision which is
more restrictive or imposes higher standards or requirements shall
prevail. It is required that the director be advised of any such regulatory
conflicts upon submittal of the plan.
(2) Applicability--stormwater management plan. (a) Any nonresidential

stormwater management plan was not required prior to the effective date
of this chapter shall be exempted from the requirements of a stormwater
management plan.
(3) Conformity to plans. (a) The approved stormwater management
plan, upon which subsequent permits may be issued by the City of Alcoa,
shall be adhered to during grading and construction activities. Under no
circumstance is the owner or operator allowed to deviate from the
approved stormwater management plan without prior approval of a plan
amendment by the director. Amendments to the approved plan must
comply with this chapter.
(b) The director shall require that an approved stormwater
management plan be amended if it is determined that the approved plan
16-26
is inadequate. The approved stormwater management plan shall be
amended if the proposed site conditions change after plan approval is
obtained or if it is determined by the director during the course of grading
or construction that the approved plan is inadequate.
(4) Stormwater quality treatment requirements. All new developments
or redevelopments required to submit a stormwater management plan shall
provide treatment of stormwater runoff in accordance with the following
requirements:
(a) Stormwater runoff generated from the development or
redevelopment must be treated for water quality prior to discharges from
the property in accordance with the stormwater pollutant removal
treatment standard and criteria provided in the policy manual.
(b) The treatment of stormwater runoff shall be achieved
through the use of one (1) or more best management practices that are
designed and constructed in accordance with the design criteria, guidance
and specifications provided in the policy manual.
(c) Methods, designs or technologies for best management
practices that are not provided in the policy manual for stormwater
management may be submitted for approval by the director if it is proven
that such methods, designs or technologies will meet or exceed the
stormwater treatment standards set forth in the policy manual and this
chapter. Proof of such methods, designs, or technologies must meet the
minimum testing criteria set forth in the policy manual.
(d) Best management practices shall not be installed within the
public right-of-way without prior approval of the director.

redevelopments that are required to submit a stormwater management
plan shall provide downstream channel erosion protection by capturing
the channel protection volume (the runoff volume from the 1-year
frequency, 24-hour storm) and discharging such volume over no less than
a 24-hour period using the design methods provided in the policy manual.
(b) Downstream channel erosion protection may be provided by
an alternative approach in lieu of controlling the channel protection
volume, subject to prior approval by the director. Sufficient hydrologic
and hydraulic analysis demonstrating that the alternative approach will
offer adequate channel protection from erosion must be presented in the
stormwater management plan.
(6) Overbank flood protection and extreme flood protection.
(a) Overbank flood protection shall be provided such that the
calculated peak discharge of stormwater runoff resulting from the 2-year,
10-year, and 25-year return frequency, 24-hour duration storm events
shall be no greater after development or redevelopment of the site than
that which would result from the same 2-year, 10-year, and 25-year
16-27
return frequency, 24-hour duration storms on the same site prior to
development or redevelopment.
(b) Extreme flood protection shall be provided such that the
calculated peak discharge of stormwater runoff resulting from a 100-year
frequency, 24-hour duration storm shall be no greater after development
or redevelopment of the site than that which would result from a 100-year
frequency, 24-hour duration storm on the same site prior to development
or redevelopment.
(c) A downstream hydrologic analysis shall be performed to
determine if the proposed development or redevelopment causes an
increase in peak discharge as compared to predevelopment runoff rates
for the same site, or has the potential to cause downstream channel and
streambank erosion. This analysis must be done for the 2-year, 10-year,
25-year and the 100-year return frequency, 24-hour duration storm
events, at the outfall(s) of the site, and at each downstream tributary
junction and each public or major private downstream stormwater
conveyance structure to the point(s) in the stormwater system where the
area of the portion of the site draining into the system is less than or
equal to ten percent (10%) of the total drainage area above that point.
(d) If peak discharge increases are identified in the ten percent
(10%) downstream analysis area, as defined in § 16-505(6)(c),
downstream flood protection shall be provided such that calculated peak
discharges for the 2-year, 10-year and 100-year return frequency, 24-hour
duration storm events after development or redevelopment are no greater
after development or redevelopment of the site than that which would
result from the same duration storms in the same downstream analysis
area prior to development or redevelopment. These criteria must be
applied throughout the ten percent (10%) downstream analysis area.
(e) Downstream flood protection can be provided by downstream
conveyance improvements and/or purchase of flow easements in lieu of
peak discharge controls subject to prior approval by the director and
satisfaction of the following requirements:
(i) Sufficient hydrologic and hydraulic analysis must be
presented that shows that the alternative approach will offer
adequate protection from downstream flooding for all potentially
affected downstream property owners.
(ii) The applicant is responsible for all state and federal
permits that may be applicable to the site including, but not
limited to TDEC, NPDES, ARAP permits, U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers section 404 permits, and TVA section 26A permits.
(iii) Developments and redevelopments that do not cause
an increase in peak discharges are not exempt from conformance
with water quality treatment and downstream channel protection
requirements stated in this chapter.
16-28
(7) Sinkhole requirements. The following sinkhole and drainage well
plan information and/or approval from the appropriate regulatory agency must
be provided prior to the alteration of the natural drainage for a watershed
discharging to such features as sinkholes and/or drainage wells.
(a) Proposed onsite and offsite drainage channels that are
tributary to a sinkhole throat or drainage well inlet shall be delineated,
along with appropriate hydraulic calculations, to define the existing and
altered (if appropriate) 100-year flood plain and to confirm that offsite
flooding will not be increased.
(b) Detailed contours are to be shown for all sinkholes that are
to receive stormwater runoff from the site. These contours are to have a
maximum interval of two feet (2') and are to be verified by field surveys.
(c) The extent of the area considered to be a sinkhole is, at a
minimum, the limits determined by the 100-year water surface elevation,
assuming plugged conditions (zero outflow).
(d) A geologic investigation of all sinkholes receiving
stormwater runoff from the site shall be performed. The report from this
investigation shall be signed and sealed by a registered professional
experienced in geology and groundwater hydrology and shall contain the
following:
(i) Location and nature of aquifers;
(ii) Potential for siltation problems;
(iii) Foundation problems that may be expected around
sinkholes;
(iv) Details of drainage structures to be built in sinkholes;
(v) Any other factors relevant to the design of drainage
from sinkholes;
(vi) Plans showing the 100-year flood plain;
(vii) This flood plain shall be designated as a drainage
easement on final subdivision plat;
(viii) Details of plan for grading and clearing of vegetation
within the 100-year flood plain.
(d) Compliance with any and all conditions that may be
required by the federal government or the State of Tennessee shall be
documented. The Tennessee Division of Groundwater Protection is the
primary regulatory agency for sinkholes and drainage wells.
(e) Demonstration that development will not occur within the
area flooded by the 100-year flood. The 100-year elevation may be lowered
by construction of a detention pond. Calculations that document a
lowering of the 100-year flood elevation shall be based on the 100-year,
24-hour storm using an appropriate safety factor for discharge into the
sinkhole. (as added by Ord. #04-041, Nov. 2004, and replaced by
Ord. #08-154, Feb. 2008, and Ord. #13-304, March 2013)
16-29
16-506. Grading, construction, erosion prevention and sediment
control. (1) Purpose. The City of Alcoa has in the past experienced development
causing the displacement of large quantities of earth. Soil erosion and
sedimentation can result from such development. Sediment is one (1) cause of
the contamination of water supplies and water resources and a cause of
pollution. A build-up of sediment can negatively impact resources, clog
watercourses and cause flooding, which can result in damage to public and
private lands. The result is a threat to the health, safety, and general welfare
of the community.
(2) Existing eroding areas. Upon written notification from the director,
the owner of a parcel of land, which exhibits unstable or eroding soil conditions
shall correct such conditions within a thirty (30) calendar day period. This
period may be extended upon request if conditions warrant. Minimum correction
measures shall include stabilizing slopes and re-vegetating all exposed soil
surfaces. Before commencing corrective measures, the owner shall consult with
the director to determine an acceptable method of correction.
(3) EPSC and sketch plan required components. (a) Erosion
Prevention and Sediment Control plans (EPSC plans) submitted to the
director shall contain the required components, as listed in and in
accordance with the State of Tennessee General NPDES Permit
Discharge of Stormwater Associated with Construction Activities, this
chapter, the policy manual and as applicable to the proposed landdisturbing
activity.
(b) Sketch plans submitted to the director shall contain the
required components, as listed in and in accordance with this chapter, the
policy manual and as applicable to the proposed land-disturbing activity.
(c) The director may request that additional information be
submitted as necessary to allow a thorough review of the site conditions
and proposed erosion prevention and sediment control measures.
(d) Omission of any required items shall render the plans
incomplete and the plans will be returned to the applicant prior to review
by the director.
(e) All sketch plans shall be developed by the owner and/or
his/her agent.
(f) All EPSC plans shall be prepared and stamped according to
§ 16-505(1)(d).
(g) Any legally protected state or federally listed threatened or
endangered species and/or critical habitat located in the area of landdisturbing
activities (if any) shall be identified in the EPSC plan. The
EPSC plan shall also include written documentation from the United
States Fish and Wildlife Service that indicates:
(i) Approval of the best management practices that will
be utilized to eliminate potential impacts to legally protected state
or federally listed threatened or endangered species and/or critical
16-30
habitat. Said best management practices shall also be included on
the EPSC plan; or
(ii) A finding of no potential impact as a result of the
proposed land-disturbing activity.
(4) Conformity and amendments to approved plans. (a) The approved
EPSC or sketch plan, upon which subsequent permits may be issued by
the City of Alcoa, shall be adhered to during all grading and construction
activities. Under no circumstance is the owner or operator allowed to
deviate from the approved EPSC or sketch plan without prior approval
of a plan amendment by the director.
(b) The director shall require the grading permit holder to take
corrective actions, which may include amendment of an approved EPSC
or sketch plan, if it is determined that the approved plan does not
adequately protect against erosion, sedimentation or discharges of other
construction related wastes despite the adherence of the owner or
operator with approved protective practices.
(c) The owner or operator is required to resubmit an EPSC or
sketch plan for approval by the director if site plans or conditions change
during land-disturbing activities.
(d) Plan amendments must comply with this chapter and the
policy manual.
(6) Documentation kept at the project site. Owners or operators of land
disturbing activities that require an EPSC, sketch plan and/or coverage of the
State of Tennessee General NPDES Permit for Discharges of Stormwater
Associated with Construction Activities shall keep documentation listed below
at the site of the land-disturbing activity from the date that the grading permit
is approved to the date of termination of coverage:
(a) A copy of the approved EPSC or sketch plan;
(b) A copy of the current grading permit;
(c) A copy of the approved SWPPP and notice of coverage;
(d) A copy of the plans as approved by the department of public
works and engineering; and
(e) Documentation and inspection of the erosion prevention and
sediment control practices located on the site of the land-disturbing
activity, prepared in accordance with the inspection documentation
requirements of State of Tennessee General NPDES Permit for
Discharges of Stormwater Associated with Construction Activities, if
applicable.
(f) Any other records required by the Tennessee General
NPDES Permit for Discharges of Stormwater Associated with
Construction Activities.
(7) Inspections. During grading or construction, site inspections shall
be performed in accordance with the following:
16-31
(1) The owner or operator, or his/her designee, shall perform regular,
documented inspections of the land-disturbing activity in accordance with the
inspection requirements of the State of Tennessee NPDES Permit for
Discharges of Stormwater Associated with Construction Activities, this chapter
and the policy manual.
(2) Site inspection documentation shall be maintained on-site during
normal working hours by the owner or operator or designee and shall be made
available for review by the director immediately upon request.
(8) Fees. The Board of Commissioners of the City of Alcoa at its
discretion may set fees for obtaining a grading permit. Such fee schedule may
be established by resolution.
(9) General criteria. The following general criteria are minimum
requirements for the control of pollutants from land-disturbing activities. All soil
erosion prevention and sediment control measures and practices shall conform
to the requirements of this chapter. The application or measures and practices
shall apply to all features of the site including street, utility installations,
drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements.
Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion and sediment pollution
during all stages of any land-disturbing activity.
(a) Requirements for best management practices. Owners and
operators of land-disturbing activities shall implement appropriate
erosion prevention and sediment control Best Management Practices
(BMPs) in accordance with the State of Tennessee General NPDES
Permit for Discharges of Stormwater Associated with Construction
Activities and the Tennessee Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook,
latest edition.
(b) Technical design criteria. The design of erosion prevention
and sediment and pollution management controls, including BMPs,
stabilization practices and structural practices, shall be performed in
accordance with criteria and requirements stated in the State of
Tennessee General NPDES Permit for Discharges of Stormwater
Associated with Construction Activities and the Tennessee Erosion and
Sediment Control Handbook, latest edition, except where more stringent
criteria are set forth in this chapter or are required by the director.
(c) Control measure construction and maintenance standards.
The installation, inspection and maintenance of erosion prevention and
sediment control practices, stabilization practices and structural practices
shall be performed in accordance with the standards provided in the
State of Tennessee General NPDES Permit for Discharges of Stormwater
Associated with Construction Activities and the Tennessee Sediment and
Erosion Control Handbook, latest edition, except where more stringent
standards are required by the director. If periodic inspections or other
information indicate that a control measure has been used
16-32
inappropriately or incorrectly, the owner or operator must replace or
modify the control for relevant site situations.
(d) More stringent criteria or standards. The director may
require more stringent criteria and standards where deemed necessary
to reduce the potential for pollution impacts to streams, public property
or adjacent property from sediment-laden stormwater runoff or
discharges of other construction related wastes.
(e) Control of other construction related wastes. Owners and
operators of land-disturbing activities shall control other construction
related wastes, as defined in this chapter, in accordance with the State
of Tennessee General NPDES Permit for Discharges of Stormwater
Associated with Construction Activities, or as required by the director.
The discharge of such wastes in the stormwater discharges from a landdisturbing
activity shall be prevented or minimized in accordance with
the EPSC or sketch plan for the site of the activity.
(f) Installation of controls before grading begins. Erosion
prevention and sediment controls and measures for the control of other
construction related wastes shall be in place and functional before a
grading permit will be issued and earth moving operations begin. EPSC
controls shall be constructed and maintained throughout land-disturbing
activities. Temporary controls and measures may be removed at the
beginning of the work day when they conflict with the day's activities, but
must be replaced at the end of the work day.
(g) Establishment of permanent vegetation. A permanent
vegetative cover shall be established on disturbed areas not otherwise
permanently stabilized. Permanent vegetation shall not be considered
established until ground cover is achieved which, in the opinion of the
director, is mature enough to control soil erosion satisfactorily and to
survive seasonal weather conditions. If it is determined by the director
that the vegetation will not withstand seasonal weather conditions, the
release of un-obligated monies or bonds may be delayed.
(h) Protection of adjacent properties. Sediment controls shall be
designed to retain mobilized sediment on the site of the land-disturbing
activity. Properties adjacent to the site of a land-disturbance activity
shall be protected from sediment deposition. If sediment escapes the
construction site, off-site accumulations of sediment that have not
reached a stream must be removed as soon as possible (e.g., fugitive
sediment that has escaped the construction site and has collected in a
street must be removed so that it is not subsequently washed into storm
sewers and streams by the next rain and/or so that it does not pose a
safety hazard to users of public streets) and measures implemented to
prevent the reoccurrence of the same. Should sediment deposition occur
in waters of the state, owners or operators shall not initiate remediation/
restoration of a stream without first receiving approval from the City of
16-33
Alcoa and TDEC. Approval for remediation/restoration efforts from the
City of Alcoa does not authorize access to private property. Arrangements
concerning removal of sediment on adjoining property must be settled by
the owner or operator with the adjoining landowner.
(i) Timing and stabilization of sediment trapping measures.
Sediment basins and traps, perimeter dikes, and other measures
intended to trap sediment on-site must be constructed as a first step in
grading and be made functional before up slope land disturbance takes
place.
Earthen structures such as dams, dikes, and diversions must be
stabilized within seven (7) days of construction. These measures must be
maintained in good working order and must remain in lace until such
time as the director deems the area to be stabilized and/or as required by
the State of Tennessee General NPDES Permit for Discharges of
Stormwater Associated with Construction Activities.
(j) Sediment basins. Temporary basins shall be designed in
accordance with the State of Tennessee General NPDES Permit for
Discharges of Stormwater Associated with Construction Activities, except
where more stringent criteria are required by the director. Any
equivalent control measure that is substituted for a temporary sediment
basin must be justified and approved by the director.
Permanent detention ponds that will be used as sediment basins
during construction shall be designed so that the permanent detention
pond outlet structure serves as the outlet structure of the sediment basin.
All permanent detention ponds used as sediment basins shall be cleaned
of loose sediments, re-graded to ensure design capacity, and stabilized
prior to conversion. Sod shall be used as the stabilization method on
sediment basins that must remain in place for an indefinite period of
time, such as during residential subdivision development. Sod shall be
installed from the permanent pool elevation to the top of the berm.
Stabilization measures other than sod may be approved by the director.
In addition, converted detention ponds must meet the criteria as set forth
in § 16-510 prior to release of bond and/or Certificate of Occupancy (CO).
(k) Sodding detention ponds, ditches and draining swales. Sod
shall be used on detention ponds, ditches and drainage swales or if
velocities warrant other stabilization techniques. Stabilization methods
other than sodding may be approved by the director. The owner or
operator shall maintain sodded areas until vegetation is permanently
established.
(l) Cut and fill slopes. Cut and fill slopes must be designed and
constructed in a manner which will prevent erosion. Consideration must
be given to the length and steepness of the slope, the soil type, upslope
drainage area, groundwater conditions, and other applicable factors.
Slopes which are found to be eroding excessively within one (1) year of
16-34
project completion must be provided with additional slope stabilizing
measures until the problem is corrected. The following guidelines shall
be utilized to prepare and implement an adequate design for cut and fill
slopes:
(i) Topsoil for the area should be stockpiled and then
used for replacement on the graded area.
(ii) Roughened soil surfaces are generally preferred to
smooth surfaces on slopes.
(iii) Diversions should be constructed at the top of long
steep slopes which have significant drainage areas above the slope.
Diversions or terraces may also be used to reduce slope length.
(iv) Concentrated stormwater should not be allowed to
flow down cut or fill slopes unless contained within an adequate
temporary or permanent channel, flume, or slope drain structure.
(v) Wherever a slope face crosses a water seepage plane
which endangers the stability of the slope, adequate drainage or
other protection should be provided.
(vi) Slopes 3:1 or steeper shall be stabilized with erosion
control matting or approved equal. The owner or operator shall
maintain matted areas until vegetation is permanently
established.
(m) Working in or crossing watercourses. Construction vehicles
shall be kept out of watercourses. The channel (including bed and banks)
must always be re-established immediately after in-channel work is
completed. Where a live watercourse must be crossed by construction
vehicles regularly during construction, a temporary stream crossing must
be provided, the design of which must be approved by the director and the
State of Tennessee where appropriate.
(n) Underground utility construction. The construction of
underground utility lines shall be subject to trench dewatering devices or
other methods. Water shall be discharged in a manner which will not
adversely affect flowing streams, drainage systems, or off-site property.
(o) Temporary stone construction entrance. Wherever
construction access routes intersect paved public and/or private roads,
provisions must be made to minimize the transport of sediment by runoff
or vehicle tracking onto the paved surface by clearing the area at the
entrance of all vegetation, roots, and other objectionable material and
placing a two inch (2") to three inch (3") diameter stone layer at least six
inches (6") thick for a minimum of fifty feet (50') from the edge of the hard
surface public road. The construction entrance must be underlain with
filter fabric. This entrance shall be a minimum of twenty feet (20') in
width, a minimum length of fifty feet (50'), and shall be maintained for
the duration of the project or until a permanent access drive is
constructed. The stone layer shall be replaced or overlain with new stone
16-35
when necessary to ensure that sediment is not transported off the site of
the land-disturbing activity. Where sediment is transported onto a public
road surface, the roads shall be cleaned thoroughly at the end of each day
or more often if deemed necessary. Sediment shall be removed from roads
by shoveling or sweeping and be transported to a sediment-controlled
disposal area. Street washing shall be allowed only after sediment is
removed in this manner.
(p) Removal of temporary measures. All temporary erosion
prevention and sediment control measures shall be disposed of within
thirty (30) days after final site stabilization is achieved or after the
temporary measures are no longer needed, unless otherwise authorized
by the director. Trapped sediment and other disturbed soft areas
resulting from the disposition of temporary measures shall be properly
disposed of and/or permanently stabilized to prevent further erosion and
sedimentation.
(q) Stripping, cleaning and grading to be minimized. Stripping
of vegetation, re-grading, and other development activities shall be
conducted so as to minimize erosion. Clearing and grubbing must be held
to the minimum necessary. Pre-construction vegetative cover shall not be
destroyed, removed, or disturbed more than ten (10) calendar days prior
to grading or earth moving. Construction must be sequenced to minimize
the exposure time of cleared surface areas. (as added by Ord. #04-041,
Nov. 2004, and replaced by Ord. #08-154, Feb. 2008, and Ord. #13-304,
March 2013)
16-507. Water quality buffers. (1) Purpose. It is the purpose of the
water quality buffers to:
(a) Protect public and private water supplies;
(b) Minimize thermal stream pollution by adding or preserving
stream canopy;
(c) Trap sediment, nutrients and other pollutants in surface
run-off;
(d) Promote bank stabilization;
(e) Protect wetlands;
(f) Minimize the impact of floods;
(g) Reduce stormwater runoff velocities;
(h) Protect channel bank area from erosion and scour;
(i) Protect wildlife habitat; and
(j) Generally maintain water quality.
(2) General requirements for the water quality buffer. (a) The water
quality buffer shall be established, managed and maintained to protect
the physical and ecological integrity of the buffered water body, reduce
the potential for flooding, provide tree canopy, stabilize streambanks, and
filter runoff from developed areas. Management of the water quality
16-36
buffer includes specific limitations on alteration of the natural conditions
as set forth in this chapter and the policy manual.
(b) Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, the water
quality buffer must be maintained in a use-restricted, undisturbed state
in accordance with this chapter. The water quality buffer must meet, or
have the ability to meet through vegetation improvement and growth, the
minimum vegetated targets defined for the buffer in this chapter.
(3) Applicability--water quality buffer. All non-residential new
development, modifications to existing developments, and/or redevelopments of
any size, or any residential development or redevelopment that will result in a
land-disturbing activity that is greater or equal to one (1) acre shall establish,
protect and maintain water quality buffers along all streams, rivers, lakes,
ponds and wetlands that are located in, or portions of which are located in, the
City of Alcoa as set forth in this chapter and in the policy manual.
(4) Standards for buffer width. Except as otherwise provided in this
chapter, the water quality buffer must be maintained in a vegetated state as
defined in this chapter and the policy manual. Any property or portion thereof
that lies within the WQB is subject to the restrictions of the WQB as well as any
and all zoning restrictions that apply to the parcel as a whole. The water quality
buffer width shall be determined as follows:
(a) The water quality buffer width shall follow state and/or
federal regulatory buffer zone and/or riparian buffer zone requirements
as set forth in the policy manual and/or other applicable publications.
(b) A water quality buffer shall be provided along each side of
a stream, as measured perpendicular from the top of bank of the active
channel and extending landward. The WQB may be divided into two (2)
zones:

shall be adjusted to include an additional twenty feet (20') from the
outer edge of the WQB. The additional twenty feet (20') shall follow
the outer zone criteria.
(ii) The water quality buffer in the steep slope area shall
have a minimum width of the total required buffer width and
follow the inner zone criteria.
(5) Standards for buffer vegetation. The vegetative goal is a userestricted,
vegetated buffer that is located along the perimeter of community
waters within the City of Alcoa, containing natural vegetation and grasses,
enhanced or restored, that are native in origin.
(a) The inner zone and wetland vegetative targets are native
mature, moderately dense forest with woody shrubs and under story
vegetation.
(b) The outer zone vegetative targets are a minimum of mowed
dense grass that covers the entire zone.
(c) The minimum pond or lake buffer vegetative targets shall
be the same as the outer zone.
(d) If community waters do not have an established water
quality buffer, then a water quality buffer enhancement plan shall be
required when land adjacent to such a water body is proposed for
development or redevelopment. Such a buffer plan shall be submitted to

16-39
(xviii) Stormwater retention and detention facilities except
those built as constructed wetland that meet the approval of the
department of public works and engineering.
(b) The following activities are allowed within the inner zone of
the water quality buffer:
(i) The limited use or application of pesticides and
herbicides.
(ii) Individual trees within the WQB may be removed if
in danger of falling, causing damage to dwellings or other
structures, causing blockage of the stream, standing in the path of
an approved water, sanitary sewer, storm main; and/or the roots
of a tree are penetrating or in danger of penetrating a sewer, water
or storm drainage line at a joint or pipe connection. The root wad
or stump should be left in place, where feasible, to maintain soil
stability.
(iii) With prior approval by the director, infrastructure
such as roads, bridges, storm drainage, stormwater management
facilities that are appropriate for use in a riparian zone (i.e.,
wetlands, buffers), and utilities provided that they adhere to the
following standards:
(A) The width should be the minimum width
needed to allow for maintenance access and installation;
(B) WQB crossings shall be at an angle that
minimizes clearing requirements; and
(C) The minimum number of WQB crossings
should be used within each development, with no more than
one (1) crossing every one thousand (1,000) linear feet. The
director may approve additional crossing if justified by
traffic, safety, or access issues.
(iv) Paths and green way trails, provided the design and
location are approved by the City of Alcoa.
(v) Access areas for utilities that are located in the water
quality buffer shall be allowed. Access areas must be minimized to
the extent possible and shall be located at intervals no less than
four hundred feet (400') unless warranted by valid safety, access,
or service issues.
(vi) Removal of forest vegetation that has the potential to
impact traffic safety or limit access, to areas immediately
surrounding the approved stream or utility crossing. Such areas
shall be vegetated with a minimum of dense grass.
(vii) Bank stabilization/restoration/habitat alteration
projects.
16-40
(viii) Disturbances as required to establish and/or restore
buffer areas in accordance to an approved buffer enhancement
plan.
(ix) The pruning of native vegetation is allowed provided
that the health and function of the vegetation is not compromised.
However, only the individual removal of under-story nuisance nonnative
vegetation (i.e. honeysuckle, kudzu, privet) causing minimal
soil disturbance is permitted. On land where the removal of such
nuisance vegetation would cause a reduction in the amount of
stream canopy by fifty percent (50%) or more, re-vegetation with
native plants is required to provided, at a minimum, fifty percent
(50%) of the previous canopy. For areas where such nuisance
vegetation removal would cause a reduction in the amount of
stream bank vegetation, re-vegetation with native plants is
required to meet the previous coverage.
(x) Other uses permitted and approved by TDEC or
under section 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act.
(xi) Education/scientific research that does not require
any prohibited activities identified in this section.
(c) The following activities are allowed within the outer zone of
the water quality buffer:
(i) All activities that are allowed within the inner zone.
(ii) Land disturbance and grading, but must be revegetated
according to § 16-507(5).
(iii) Clearing, grubbing and re-vegetation, performed in
accordance with an approved stormwater management,
comprehensive development, buffer enhancement and/or EPSC
plan.
(iv) Disturbances necessary for the construction of utility
access areas and approved stream crossings.
(v) Ongoing vegetative maintenance activities such as
mowing, bush-hogging, and weed-eating.
(7) Protection of the water quality buffer. All water quality buffers
must be protected during construction/development activities.
(a) Prior to the initiation of land disturbing activities,
construction layout surveys must include staking and labeling of the
water quality buffer perimeter. A combination of stakes, flagging and/or
silt fence may be used to insure adequate visibility of the WQB. The
layout must be inspected and approved by the director before the grading
permit issuance.
(b) All areas of the water quality buffer, including stream
banks, must be left in a stabilized condition upon completion of
construction activities. No activity eroding bare or unstable stream banks
shall remain, unless approved by the director. Placement of riprap and
16-41
other hard armor is allowed only when bioengineering alternatives are
not feasible.
(c) Water quality buffers cannot be encroached upon or
disturbed during project construction, unless they are being established,
restored, or enhanced in accordance with an approved buffer
enhancement plan.
(d) Once construction is completed and the certificate of
occupancy or final plat is accepted, water quality buffers must be
maintained in accordance with the recorded covenants for permanent
maintenance of stormwater best management practices. In order to
provide for long-term protection and maintenance, the City of Alcoa shall
require that the water quality buffer be protected in perpetuity by placing
the buffer in a permanent water quality or other easement that is
recorded with the property's deed. If the area is not publicly owned, the
easement should be held by one (1) of the following non-governmental
entities:
(i) A variable third party such as a land trust, land
management company or utility. The purpose of the third party is
to provide monitoring and oversight to ensure the perpetual
protection of the area in accordance with the requirements of a
buffer area. The organization shall:
(A) Have the legal authority to accept and
maintain such easements;
(B) Be bona fide and in perpetual existence; and
(C) Have conveyance instruments that contain an
appropriate provision for re-transfer in the event the
organization becomes unable to carry out its functions.
(ii) A Homeowners Association (HOA), provided that the
following criteria are met:
(A) Membership in the HOA is mandatory and
automatic for all property owners of the subdivision and
their successors;
(B) The HOA shall have lien authority to ensure
the collection of dues from all members; and
(C) The HOA assumes the responsibility for
protecting, monitoring and maintaining the area as a
conservation easement, in perpetuity.
(iii) If neither of the above-stated non-governmental
entities is able to provide perpetual protection of the buffer area,
then the property owner must assume responsibility for the
maintenance and protection for the buffer area.
(8) Water quality buffer enhancements. The property owner may
restore or enhance vegetation within a water quality buffer with prior approval
of a buffer enhancement plan by the director.
16-42
The director shall have the authority to require a property owner to
restore or enhance water quality buffers that have been disturbed or do not
meet, or have the potential to meet through natural vegetative succession, the
vegetative targets for buffer areas that are defined herein.
(a) Enhancement of water quality buffers must be performed in
accordance with the requirements of § 16-507(5) and the guidance
provided below:
(i) All areas/zones of the buffer being enhanced must be
planted with vegetation that is appropriate to achieve the
vegetative targets stated in § 16-507(5).
(ii) All areas/zones of the buffer being enhanced must be
stabilized against erosion.
(iii) If the outer zone of the WQB and the buffer around a
pond or a lake will consist largely of grasses after enhancement,
seeding must be performed at a rate sufficient to provide healthy,
dense, permanent vegetative cover for one hundred percent (100%)
of the buffer area within one (1) growing season. Mulch, pebbles,
wood chips and other non-vegetative ground cover are not
acceptable for buffer enhancement.
(iv) Where the removal of such vegetation would cause a
reduction in the amount of stream canopy by fifty percent (50%) or
more, re-vegetation with native plants is required to provide the
cover of the previous canopy at a minimum. For areas where such
vegetation, re-vegetation specifications with native plants is
required to return the amount of vegetative cover to its previous
state, at a minimum. To reduce the potential for stream bank
erosion, re-vegetation measures along stream banks must include
sufficient erosion control measures, such as turf reinforcement
mats, erosion control blankets, straw wattles, etc., to stabilize the
area in the short- and long-term.
(v) To increase the chances for the success and health of
the buffer area, the plant species, density, placement, and diversity
proposed in the buffer enhancement plans must be appropriate for
stream, wetland, and pond/lake buffers to achieve the vegetative
target that is defined for the buffer through natural succession.
Proposed planting and long-term maintenance practices must also
be appropriate and properly performed.
(vi) Vegetation mortality must be accounted for all
planting densities that are proposed in buffer enhancement plans.
(9) Water quality buffer averaging. A reduction in the water quality
buffer width over a portion of property in exchange for an increase in buffer
width elsewhere on the same property such that the average WQB width
remains the required total minimum width may be granted. Provided that the
following conditions are met:
16-43
(a) The width of the averaged buffer within the boundaries of
the property to be developed shall not be less than the minimum total
required width; and
(b) The width of the buffer shall not be less than thirty-five feet
(35') at any location, except where stream crossings have been approved
by the director.
(c) Those areas of the water quality buffer having a minimum
width of thirty-five feet (35') (or less at the stream crossing) can comprise
no more than fifty percent (50%) of the buffer length.
(d) Buffer averaging is required for WQB that have stream
crossings.
(e) Buffer averaging is prohibited for any portion of the
developments that have or have planned land use as described:
(i) Areas that have slopes greater than fifteen percent
(15%) that are located within fifty feet (50') of the stream to be
buffered;
(ii) Developments or facilities that include on-site sewage
disposal and treatment system drainfields (i.e., septic systems),
raised septic systems, subsurface discharges from a wastewater
treatment plant, or land application of bio-solids or animal waste;
(iii) Landfills (active or closed);
(iv) Junkyards or similar scrap-metal facilities;
(v) Commercial or industrial facilities that store and/or
service motor vehicles;
(vi) Commercial greenhouses or landscape supply
facilities;
(vii) Developments or facilities that have commercial or
public pools;
(viii) Agricultural facilities, farms, feedlots, and confined
animal feed operations; and
(ix) Animal care facilities, kennels, and commercial/
business developments or facilities that provide short-term or longterm
care of animals; and
(x) Other land uses deemed by the director to have the
potential to generate higher than normal pollutant loadings.
(10) Plats prepared for recording. Unless otherwise provided herein, all
site development plans and plats prepared for recording shall:
(a) Show the extent of any WQB on the subject property by
metes and bounds and be labeled as "Water Quality Buffer."
(b) Provide a note with reference to the WQB stating that there
shall be no clearing, grading, construction or disturbance of vegetation
except as permitted by the City of Alcoa Public Works and Engineering
Department.
16-44
(c) Permanent boundary markers, in the form of sign age as
specified in the policy manual or otherwise approved by the director shall
be required to be installed prior to the recording of the final plat or the
issuance of a certificate of occupancy.
(11) Conflict with state requirements. The State of Tennessee may
require water quality buffers during construction activities via provisions
contained in Tennessee Construction General Permit (CGP) or other regulatory
permits and processes. The state's requirements may, or may not, align with the
City of Alcoa's requirements and policies for water quality buffers. It is the
responsibility of the site developer to be informed and educated on any statelevel
buffer requirements. If a site developer intends to apply the City of Alcoa's
buffer requirements in lieu of any requirements of the State of Tennessee, the
developer must first obtain approval from TDEC and provide the City of Alcoa
with written documentation of such approval. In instances where the city and
TDEC requirements conflict, the more stringent shall apply. (as added by

16-47
(d) If the director finds that any of the activities listed in
subsection (c) above are found to cause or may cause sewage, industrial
wastes or other objectionable wastes to be discharged into the stormwater
system, the director shall so notify the person performing such activities
and shall order that such activities be stopped or conducted in such a
manner as to avoid the discharge of sewage, industrial wastes or other
wastes into the stormwater system.
(3) Notification of spills and illicit discharges. As soon as anyh person
has knowledge of any illicit spills or discharges to the stormwater system in
violation of this chapter, such person shall immediately notify the director of
this discharge. If such person is directly or indirectly responsible for such
discharge or responsible for the operation of the system or business, then such
person shall also take immediate action to ensure the containment and cleanup
of such discharge and shall confirm such telephone notification with a written
report to the director within three (3) calendar days.
(a) At a minimum, the written report for any illicit discharge
shall include:

monitoring of any discharge(s) to the stormwater system operated by the city
and to furnish periodic detailed reports of such discharges. (as added by
Ord. #04-041, Nov. 2004, and replaced by Ord. #08-154, Feb. 2008, and
Ord. #13-304, March 2013)
16-509. Performance bonds. (1) General requirements.
(a) Performance bonds shall name the City of Alcoa as
beneficiary and shall be guaranteed in the form of a surety bond, cashier's
check, or letter of credit from an approved financial institution or
insurance carrier. The surety bond, cashier's check, or letter of credit
shall be provided in a form and in an amount to be determined by the
director. The actual amount shall be based on submission of plans and
16-48
estimated construction, installation or potential maintenance and/or
remediation expenses.
(b) The director may refuse brokers or financial institutions the
right to provide a surety bond, letter of credit, or cashier's check based on

appropriate sources of reference information.
(2) Prior to issuance of a grading permit. (a) When reviewing any
application for a grading permit, the city shall consider the past record
of the permit applicant in complying with previous grading permits,
plans, and this chapter. The city may require the permit applicant to post
a performance bond prior to issuing the grading permit. If a permit
applicant has had three (3) or more violations of previous permits or this
chapter as amended within three (3) years prior to the date of filing of the
application under consideration, the city shall require a performance
bond before the grading permit is issued.
(b) Upon forfeiture, the city at its election may use the
performance bond proceeds or any part thereof to hire a contractor and/or

18-104. Water usages regulated during periods of shortage.
(1) When the flow downstream at City of Alcoa withdrawal operations
in Little River at mile 9.7 is thirty (30) Cubic Feet per Second (CFS) or less or
when the flow downstream of the City of Maryville withdrawal operations in
Little River at mile 17.3 is less than thirty-seven and six-tenths (37.6) CFS, then
Alcoa will appeal to the water customers of the system through the news media
for voluntary water conservation. During periods of drought, the City of Alcoa
will work cooperatively with the City of Maryville and Tuckaleechee Utility
District (hereinafter, along with the City of Alcoa, collectively referred to as "the
utilities") to regulate and conserve water usage.
(2) All further requests for water conservation and/or curtailment of
water use shall be based on the available water supply from all sources
including, but not limited to, auxiliary raw water supply lines and supply
connections from other water providers and the ability of the utilities'
distribution system to maintain proper levels in their respective water storage
tanks/reservoirs.
(3) It is the intent of this section to address water supply both during:
(a) Drought conditions; and
(b) Other emergency conditions that may limit the available
potable water within one (1) or more of the utilities' water distribution
systems.
Each of the utilities shall maintain operational control within its own
system to implement water usage controls during a period of source water
shortage or other catastrophic event when any such period of source water
shortage or other catastrophic event affects their respective system exclusively
or cooperatively when deemed necessary by the Mayors and/or City Managers
of Alcoa and Maryville or the TUD District Manager. Further actions requesting
water use reductions are based on the following:
(a) When the potable water demand to allow the utilities' tanks/
reservoirs to remain full is eighty-five percent (85%) or less than the total
available potable water supply from all sources, then voluntary water
18-3
conservation measures shall be put into effect; no other measures to
encourage or require conservation will be taken.
(b) When the potable water demand to allow the utilities' tanks/
reservoirs to remain full is greater than eighty-five percent (85%) and less
than ninety-five percent (95%) of the total available potable water supply
available from all sources, then measures will be implemented to
eliminate use for "non-essential purposes" as defined below.
(c) When the potable water demand to allow the utilities' tanks
to remain full is greater than or equal to ninety-five percent (95%) and
less than one hundred percent (100%) of the total available potable water
supply available from all sources, then industrial and commercial
customers will be required to implement water conservation measures as
defined below.
(d) Water conservation definitions. (i) Voluntary water
conservation measures. "Voluntary water conservation measures"
means a call for water customers to voluntarily decrease their use
of potable water to assist in alleviating the current source water
shortage. Voluntary water conservation demand measures may
include any and all measures to reduce potable water consumption
by customers of the respective utilities.
(ii) Non-essential purposes. The term "non-essential
purposes" shall include, but not necessarily be limited to, the
filling of swimming pools, residential car washing, operation of
display fountains and the watering of trees, lawns, gardens and
other vegetation. However, upon application and good cause
shown, one (1) or more of the utilities may issue a temporary
limited watering permit, upon such terms and conditions as the
respective utility deems appropriate, for:
(A) Landscaping installed less than six (6) months
prior to the implementation of water conservation measure;
and/or
(B) Commercial nurseries; such permits shall be
for a duration of less than thirty (30) days.
Such temporary limited watering permits may be extended
upon application to the utility and for good cause shown, any such
extension not to exceed the time of the initial permit. The
elimination of water usage for "non-essential purposes" shall be
included in a call for mandatory water conservation measures.
(iii) Industrial and commercial water conservation
measures. When called for, "industrial and commercial water
conservation measures" shall require industrial and commercial
customers, excluding medical care facilities, to reduce their water
usage by at least ten percent (10%) of their average daily
18-4
consumption until notice is given that the restriction is no longer
in effect.
(4) When any of the conditions specified in subsections (1), (2) and (3)
of this section are existing or eminent, official notice of these restrictions will be
given promptly to the public through the local news media. The city will also
notify its larger customers of the emergency via telephone calls, U.S. Mail,
electronic messages, and/or other practical means of communications.
(5) It shall be unlawful for any person, firm, association, partnership
or corporation to violate or fail to comply with any of the provisions of this
section, and any person, firm, association, partnership or corporation shall upon
conviction of any violation be fined not less than twenty-five dollars ($25.00) nor
more than fifty dollars ($50.00) for each separate offense. Each day that a
violation occurs shall be construed a separate offense and punished accordingly.

the use of administrative rather than civil (judicial) procedures.
(39) "Garbage." Solid wastes from the domestic and commercial
preparation, cooking, and dispensing of food and from the handling, storage and
sale of produce.
(40) "Grab sample." A sample which is taken from a waste stream on

substantially independent, factors such as the extent to which the new
facility is integrated with the existing plant, and the extent to which the
new facility is engaged in the same general type of activity as the existing
source should be considered.
(i) Construction on the site at which an existing source
is located results in a modification rather than a new source if the
construction does not create a new building, structure, facility or
installation meeting the criteria of this section but otherwise
alters, replaces or adds to existing process or production
equipment.

18-204. Discharge regulations. (1) General discharge prohibitions. No
user shall contribute or cause to be contributed, directly or indirectly, any
pollutant or wastewater which will pass-through or interfere with the operation
or performance of the POTW. These general prohibitions apply to all such users
of a POTW whether or not the user is subject to national categorical
pretreatment standards or any other national state or local pretreatment
standards or requirements. A user may not contribute the following substances
to the POTW:
(a) Any liquids, solids or gases which by reason of their nature
or quantity are, or may be, sufficient either alone or by interaction with
other substances to cause fire or explosion or be injurious in any other
way to the POTW or to the operation of the POTW. No pollutant shall be
discharged which creates a fire or explosion hazard in the POTW,
including but not limited to, waste streams with a closed cup flash point
of less than 140F or 60C using the test methods specified in 40 C.F.R.
261.21. At no time shall two (2) successive readings on an explosion
hazard meter at the point of discharge into the system (or at any point in
the system) be more than five percent (5%), nor any single reading over
ten percent (10%) of the Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the meter.
(b) Solid or viscous substances which may cause obstruction to
the flow in a sewer or other interference with the operation of the
wastewater treatment facilities such as, but not limited to, grease,
garbage or improperly shredded garbage with particles greater than onehalf
inch (1/2") in any dimension.
(c) Any wastewater having a pH less than 5.0 or greater than
9.5, or wastewater having any other corrosive property capable of causing
damage or hazard to structures, equipment, and/or personnel of the
POTW.
(d) Any wastewater containing toxic pollutants in sufficient
quantity, either singly or by interaction with other pollutants, to injure
18-16
or interfere with any wastewater treatment process, constitute a hazard
to humans or animals, create a toxic effect in the receiving waters of the
POTW, or to exceed the limitation set forth in a categorical pretreatment
standard. A toxic pollutant shall include, but not be limited to, any
pollutant identified pursuant to section 307(a) of the Act.
(e) Any noxious or malodorous liquids, gases, or solids which
either singly or interaction with other wastes are sufficient to create a
public nuisance or hazard to life or are sufficient to prevent entry into the
sewers for maintenance and repair.
(f) Any substance which may cause the POTW's effluent or any
other product of the POTW such as residues, biosolids, sludges, or scums,
to be unsuitable for reclamation and reuse or to interfere with the
reclamation process. In no case shall a substance discharged to the POTW
cause the POTW to be in non-compliance with the sludge use or disposal
criteria, guidelines or regulations developed under section 405 of the Act;
any criteria, guidelines or regulations affecting sludge use or disposal
developed pursuant to the Solid Waste Disposal Act, the Clean Air Act,
the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Clean Water Act, or federal or state
criteria applicable to the sludge management method being used.
(g) Any substance which will cause the POTW to violate its
NPDES and/or state disposal system permit, the receiving water quality
standards, or cause pass-through violation.
(h) Any wastewater with objectionable color not removed in the
treatment process, such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and vegetable
tanning solutions.
(i) Any wastewater having a temperature which will inhibit
biological activity in the POTW treatment plant resulting in interference,
but in no case wastewater with a temperature at the introduction into the
POTW which exceeds 65C (150F) or cause the influent of the wastewater
treatment plant to exceed 40C (104F) unless the POTW treatment plant
is designed to accommodate such temperature.
(j) Any pollutants, including oxygen demanding pollutants
(BOD, etc.) released at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration which
will cause interference to the POTW. In no case shall a slug discharge
have a flow rate or contain concentration or quantities of pollutants that
exceed for any time period longer than fifteen (15) minutes more than five
(5) times the average twenty-four (24) hour concentration, quantities, or
flow during normal operation.
(k) Any wastewater containing any radioactive wastes or
isotopes of such half life or concentration as may exceed limits established
by the control authority in compliance with applicable state or federal
regulations.
(l) Any wastewater which causes a hazard to human life or
creates a public nuisance.
18-17
(m) Any stormwater (flow occurring during or following any form
of natural precipitation and resulting therefrom), surface water,
groundwater, roof runoff, subsurface drainage, to any sanitary sewer.
Stormwater drainage shall be discharged to such sewers as are
specifically designated as storm sewers or to a natural outlet approved by
the state. Uncontaminated industrial cooling water or unpolluted process
waters may be discharged on approval of the state to a storm sewer or
natural outlet. Landfill leachate and discharge from temporary
groundwater remediation projects may be discharged to the sewer system
in accordance with this chapter upon approval by the control authority.
(n) Any wastewater containing fats, wax, grease, petroleum oil,
non-biodegradable cutting oil or products of mineral oil origin, or other
substances which may solidify or become viscous at temperatures
between 0C (32F) and 40C (104F) and/or cause interference or passthrough
at the POTW treatment plant.
(o) Pollutants which result in the presence of toxic gases, vapors
or fumes within the POTW in a quantity that may cause acute worker
health and safety problems.
(p) Any trucked or hauled pollutants, except at discharge points
designated by the POTW and in accordance with the requirements of this
chapter.
(2) When the control authority determines that a user(s) is
contributing to the POTW any of the above enumerated substances in such
amounts as to interfere with the operation of the POTW, the control authority
shall:
(a) Advise the user(s) of the impact of the contribution on the
POTW;
(b) Develop effluent limitations for such user(s) to correct the
interference with the POTW.
(3) Federal categorical pretreatment standards. Upon the
promulgation of the federal categorical pretreatment standards for a particular
industrial subcategory, the federal standard, if more stringent than limitations
imposed under this chapter for sources in that subcategory, shall immediately
supersede the limitations imposed under this chapter. The affected users shall
come into compliance with said limitations by the date specified by the federal
regulation.
(4) Modification of federal categorical pretreatment standards. Where
the city's wastewater treatment system achieves consistent removal of
pollutants limited by federal pretreatment standards, the control authority may
apply to the approval authority for modification of specific limits in the federal
pretreatment standards. "Consistent removal" shall mean reduction in the
amount of a pollutant or alteration of the nature of the pollutant by the
wastewater treatment system to a less toxic or harmless state in the effluent
which is achieved by the system in ninety-five percent (95%) of the samples
18-18
taken when measured according to the procedures set forth in section 403.7(c)(2)
of (title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, part 403)-- "General Pretreatment
Regulations for Existing and New Sources of Pollution" promulgated pursuant
to the Act. The control authority may then modify pollutant discharge limits in
the federal pretreatment standards if the requirements contained in 40 C.F.R.,
part 403, section 403.7 are fulfilled and prior approval from the approval
authority is obtained.
(5) Limitations on wastewater strength. No person or user shall
discharge wastewater to the POTW in excess of the concentration set forth in
table 18-204(4) unless:
(a) An exception has been granted the user by the control
authority; or
(b) The wastewater discharge permit of the user provides as a
special permit condition a higher interim concentration level in
conjunction with a requirement that the user construct a pretreatment
facility or institute changes in operation and maintenance procedures to
reduce the concentration of pollutants to levels not exceeding the
standards set forth in table 18-204(4) within a fixed period of time.
Any user discharging wastewater having pollutants in excess of the
concentrations listed in the table may be subject to fines and/or other
enforcement actions as outlined in § 18-217 hereinafter.

requirements for all or a part of these parameters.
The control authority shall monitor the treatment works influent for the
parameters in table 18-204(5). In the event that the influent at the treatment
works reaches or exceeds the levels established by said table, the control
authority shall initiate technical studies to determine the cause of the influent
violation, and shall recommend to the city council such remedial measures as
are necessary, included, but not limited to, recommending the establishment of
new or revised pretreatment levels for these parameters. The control authority
shall also recommend changes to any of these criteria in the event the POTW
effluent standards are changed or in the event that there are changes in any
18-20
applicable law or regulation affecting same or in the event changes are needed
for more effective operation of the POTW.

Compatible pollutants. The POTW treatment plant was designed to treat
specific waste load concentrations and mass loading of certain compatible
pollutants, which include five (5) day Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD5),
Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Total Suspended Solids (TSS), Total
Dissolved Solids (TDS) and Ammonia-Nitrogen (NH3-N). If a user discharges
concentrations or mass loadings of compatible pollutants which exceed the limits
set forth in the wastewater discharge permit, added operation and maintenance
costs will be incurred by the POTW, and this additional cost may be passed on
to the user through surcharges for excess compatible pollutants. Surcharges
shall be established by the control authority based on the cost to treat the excess
compatible pollutants. The control authority reserves the right to establish
maximum allowable discharge limits for compatible pollutants in order to
protect the POTW treatment plant and to revise surcharges based on changes
in operating costs.
(7) State requirements. State requirements and limitation on
discharges shall apply in any case where they are more stringent than federal
requirements and limitations or those in this chapter.
(8) Control authority's right of revision. The control authority reserves
the right to establish by ordinance more stringent limitations or requirements
on discharges to the wastewater disposal system if deemed necessary to comply
with the objectives presented in § 18-201 of this chapter.
(9) Dilution of discharge. No user shall ever increase the use of process
water or, in any way, attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete
substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the limitations
contained in the federal categorical pretreatment standards, or in any other
pollutant-specific limitation developed by the city or state. The combination of
process wastes and domestic wastes prior to discharge is not considered dilution.
(10) Slug discharges. (a) Protection from slug discharges. Each user
shall provide protection from slug discharge of prohibited materials or
other substances regulated by this chapter. Facilities to prevent slug
discharge of prohibited material shall be provided and maintained at the
owner or user's own cost and expense. Detailed plans showing facilities
and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to
the control authority for review, and shall be approved by the control
18-22
authority before construction of the facility. All existing users shall
complete such a plan within one hundred eighty (180) days from the
effective date of the ordinance comprising this chapter. No user who
commences contribution to the POTW after the effective date of the
ordinance comprising this chapter shall be permitted to introduce
pollutants into the system until a slug discharge control plan has been
approved by the control authority. Significant industrial users are
required to notify the control authority immediately of any changes at its
facility affecting potential for a slug discharge.
Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall
not relieve the industrial user from the responsibility to modify the user's
facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this chapter. In the case
of a slug discharge, it is the responsibility of the user to immediately
telephone and notify the POTW of the incident. The notification shall
include location of discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume,
and corrective actions.
(b) Written notice of slug discharges. Within five (5) days
following a slug discharge the user shall submit to the control authority
a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the
measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences.
Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage,
or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the
POTW, fish kills, or any other damage to person or property, nor shall
such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties, or other
liability which may be imposed by this chapter or other applicable law.
(c) Notice to employees. A notice shall be permanently posted
on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees
whom to call in the event of a slug discharge. Employers shall insure that
all employees who may cause or suffer such a slug discharge to occur are
advised of the emergency notification procedure. In lieu of placing notices
on bulletin boards, the user may submit an approved slug control plan.
(11) Discharge of hazardous wastes. All industrial users shall notify the
control authority, the EPA Region IV Waste Management Division Director, and
the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation Division of Solid
Waste Management in writing of any discharge into the POTW of a substance
which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 C.F.R.
part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge
(continuous, batch or other).
If the industrial user discharges more than one hundred kilograms (100
kg) of such wastes per calendar month to the POTW, the notification shall also
contain the following information to the extent such information is known and
readily available to the industrial user:
(a) An identification of the hazardous constituents contained in
the wastes;
18-23
(b) An estimate of the mass and concentration of such
constituents discharged during the calendar month; and
(c) An estimate of the mass and concentration of such
constituents expected to be discharged during the following twelve (12)
months.
Notification shall be provided within one hundred eighty (180)
days of the discharge. Notification need be submitted only once for each
hazardous waste discharged; however, advance notification of substantial
change is required.
Industrial users are exempt from notification requirements if:
(i) During a calendar month in which they discharge no
more than fifteen kilograms (15 kg) of hazardous wastes, unless
the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in Tennessee
Rule 1200-1-11-.02(4)(a) and (4)(d).
(ii) Less than fifteen kilograms (15 kg) of non-acute
hazardous wastes are discharged within a calendar month.
If new regulations identify additional characteristics of hazardous
wastes or list new hazardous wastes, notification of the appropriate
authorities by the industrial user is required within ninety (90) days of
the effective date of such regulations.
If notification is required, the industrial user shall certify that it
has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous
wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically
practical.
(12) Limitations on the use of garbage grinders. Garbage grinders shall
discharge only properly shredded garbage into the POTW. Such grinders must
shred the waste to a degree that all particles will be carried freely under normal
flow conditions prevailing in the POTW sewers. Garbage grinders shall not be
used for the grinding of plastic, paper products, inert materials, or garden
refuse.
(13) Limitations on point of discharge. No person shall discharge any
substance directly into a manhole or other opening in a POTW sewer other than
through an approved building sewer unless he shall have been issued a
temporary permit by the control authority. The control authority shall
incorporate in such temporary permit such conditions as it deems reasonably
necessary to insure compliance with the provisions of this chapter and the user
shall be required to pay applicable charges and fees therefor. (As replaced by
Ord. #00-003, Feb. 2000, and Ord. #13-305, April 2013)
18-205. Private sewage disposal and holding tank waste disposal.
(1) Private sewage disposal systems. Where any residence office,
recreational facility or other establishment used for human occupancy is not
accessible to the POTW, the user shall provide a private sewage disposal system.
Where any residence, office, recreational facility or other establishment used for
18-24
human occupancy has the building drain located below the elevation necessary
to obtain a sufficient grade in the building sewer, but is otherwise accessible to
the POTW, the owner shall provide a private on-site sewage pumping station
subject to review and approval by the control authority.
A private sewage disposal system may not be constructed within the city
limits unless a certificate is obtained from the control authority stating that the
POTW is not accessible to the property and no POTW extension is proposed for
construction in the immediate future. No certificate shall be issued for any
private sewage disposal system employing subsurface soil absorption facilities
where the area of the lot is less than that specified by the City of Alcoa and the
Blount County Environmental Health Department.
Any private sewage disposal system must be constructed in accordance
with the requirements of the State of Tennessee, the Blount County
Environmental Health Department and the City of Alcoa, and must be inspected
and approved by an authorized representative of the city manager. The owner
shall operate and maintain the private sewage disposal facilities in a sanitary
manner at all times. When access to the POTW becomes available, the building
sewer shall be connected to the POTW within sixty (60) days of the date of
availability, and the private sewage disposal system shall be cleaned of solids
and filled with suitable material. No statement contained in this chapter shall
be construed to interfere with any additional requirements that may be imposed
by the Blount County Environmental Health Department.
(2) Septic tank pumping, hauling and discharge. No person owning
vacuum, septic tank or "cess pool" pump trucks or other liquid waste transport
trucks shall discharge directly or indirectly such sewage into the POTW, unless
such person shall first have applied for and received a truck discharge operation
permit from the control authority. All applicants for a truck discharge operation
permit shall complete such forms as required by the control authority, pay
appropriate fees, and agree in writing to abide by the provisions of this chapter
and any special conditions or regulations established by the control authority.
The owners of such vehicles shall affix and display the permit number on the
side of each vehicle used for such purposes. Such permits shall be valid for a
period of one (1) year from the date of issuance provided that such permit shall
be subject to revocation by the control authority for violation of any provision of
this chapter or reasonable regulation established by the control authority. Such
permits shall be limited to the discharge of domestic sewage waste containing
no industrial waste collected from septic tanks located in Blount County,
Tennessee.
(3) Other holding tank waste. No person shall discharge any other
holding tank waste into the POTW unless he shall have applied for and have
been issued a permit by the control authority. Unless otherwise allowed under
the terms and conditions of the permit, a separate permit must be secured for
each separate discharge.
18-25
The permit shall state the specific location of discharge, the time of day
the discharge is to occur, the volume of the discharge, and shall limit the
wastewater constituents and characteristics of the discharge. Such user shall
pay any applicable charges or fees therefor, and shall comply with the conditions
of the permit issued by the control authority and the Solid Waste Disposal Act
(42 U.S.C. 6901, et seq.). Provided, however, no permit will be required to
discharge domestic waste from a recreational vehicle holding tank, provided
such discharge is made into an approved facility designed to receive such waste.
(4) Fees. For each permit issued under the provisions of this chapter,
an annual service charge set as specified in § 18-204 shall be paid to the city or
the control authority. Any such permit granted shall be for one (1) full fiscal
year or fraction of the fiscal year and shall continue in full force and effect from
the time issued until the ending of the fiscal year unless sooner revoked and
shall be non-transferable. The number of the permit granted under the
provisions of this chapter shall be plainly painted on each side of the motor
vehicle used when conducting the business permitted hereunder. All users
discharging septic tank or holding tank wastes to the POTW shall pay
appropriate fees to be established as specified under § 18-206.
(5) Designated disposal locations. The control authority shall
designate approved locations for the emptying and cleaning of all equipment
used in the performance of the services rendered under the permit herein
provided for, and it shall be a violation hereof for any person, firm, association
or corporation to empty or clean such equipment at any place other than a place
so designated. The control authority may refuse to accept any truckload of waste
at his absolute discretion where it appears that the waste could interfere with
the effective operation of the POTW.
(6) Revocation of permit. Failure to comply with all the provisions of
this chapter shall be sufficient cause for the revocation of the disposal permit by
the control authority. The possession within the service area by any person or
any motor vehicle equipped with a body type and accessories of a nature and
design capable of serving as a septic tank or wastewater or excreta disposal
system cleaning unit shall be prima facie evidence that such person is engaged
in the business of cleaning, draining or flushing septic tanks or other
wastewater or excreta disposal systems within the service area of POTW. (As
replaced by Ord. #00-003, Feb. 2000, and Ord. #13-305, April 2013)

monitoring reports. Within either one hundred eighty (180) days after the
effective date of a categorical pretreatment standard or the final administrative
decision on a category determination under 40 C.F.R. 403.6(a)(4), whichever is
later, existing categorical industrial users currently discharging to or scheduled
to discharge to the POTW shall submit to the control authority a report which
contains the information listed below. At least ninety (90) days prior to
commencement of their discharge, new sources, and sources that become
categorical industrial users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable
categorical standard, shall submit to the control authority a report which
contains the information listed in below. A new source shall report the method
of pretreatment it intends to use to meet applicable categorical standards. A
new source also shall give estimates of its anticipated flow and quantity of
pollutants to be discharged.
(a) Users described above shall submit the information set forth
below:
(i) The name and address of the facility, including the
name of the operator and owner.
(ii) A list of any environmental control permits held by or
for the facility.

processes, and rate of production), and standard industrial
classifications of the operation(s) carried out by such user. This
description should include a schematic process diagram, which
indicates points of discharge to the POTW from the regulated
processes.
(iv) Information showing the measured average daily and
maximum daily flow, in gallons per day, to the POTW from
regulated process streams and other streams, as necessary, to
allow use of the combined wastestream formula in accordance with
40 C.F.R. 403.6(e).
(b) Measurement of pollutants. (i) The user shall provide the
information required in § 18-209(2)(c).
(ii) The user shall take a minimum of one (1)
representative sample to compile that data necessary to comply
with the requirements of this subsection.
(iii) Samples should be taken immediately downstream
from pretreatment facilities if such exist or immediately
18-32
downstream from pretreatment facilities if such exist or
immediately downstream from the regulated process if no
pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed with the
regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment the user should
measure the flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the
combined wastestream formula in 40 C.F.R. 403.6(e) to evaluate
compliance with the pretreatment standards. Where an alternate
concentration or mass limit has been calculated in accordance with
40 C.F.R. 403.6(e) this adjusted limit along with supporting data
shall be submitted to the control authority.
(iv) Sampling and analysis shall be performed in
accordance with § 18-210(3)(c);
(v) The control authority may allow the submission of a
baseline report which utilizes only historical data so long as the
data provides information sufficient to determine the need for
industrial pretreatment measures;
(vi) The baseline report shall indicate the time, date and
place of sampling and methods of analysis, and shall certify that
such sampling and analysis is representative of normal work
cycles and expected pollutant discharges to the POTW.
(c) Compliance certification. A statement, reviewed by the
user's authorized representative as defined in § 18-201(11) and certified
by a qualified professional, indicating whether pretreatment standards
are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not, whether additional
Operation and Maintenance (O&M) and/or additional pretreatment is
required to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements.
(d) Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or
O&M will be required to meet the pretreatment standards, the shortest
schedule by which the user will provide such additional pretreatment
and/or O&M must be provided. The completion date in this schedule shall
not be later than the compliance date established for the applicable
pretreatment standard. A compliance schedule pursuant to this section
must meet the requirements set out in § 18-209(2)(f) of this chapter.
(e) Signature and report certification. All baseline monitoring
reports must be certified by a qualified professional and signed by an
authorized representative as defined in § 18-201(11).
(2) Compliance date report. Within ninety (90) days following the date
for final compliance with applicable pretreatment standards or in the case of a
new source, following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the
POTW, any user subject to pretreatment standards and requirements shall
submit to the control authority a report indicating the nature and concentration
of all pollutants in the discharge from the regulated processes which are limited
by pretreatment standards and requirements and the average and maximum
daily flow for these process units in the user facility which are limited by such
18-33
pretreatment standards or requirements. The report shall state whether the
applicable pretreatment standards or requirements are being met on a
consistent basis and, if not, what additional O&M and/or pretreatment is
necessary to bring the user into compliance with the applicable pretreatment
standards or requirements. This statement shall be signed and certified by an
authorized representative of the user and certified by a qualified professional
engineer registered in the State of Tennessee.
(3) Periodic compliance reports. (a) Any user subject to a pretreatment
standard after the compliance date of such pretreatment standard or, in
the case of a new source, after commencement of the discharge into the
POTW, shall submit to the control authority during the months of June
and December, unless required more frequently in the pretreatment
standard or by the control authority, a report indicating the nature and
concentration of pollutants in the effluent and the measured or estimated
average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period, which are
limited by such pretreatment standards. In addition, this report shall
include a record of all daily flows which, during the reporting period,
exceeded the average daily flow reported in the permit application. At the
discretion of the control authority and in consideration of such factors as
local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, etc., the control
authority may agree to alter the months during which the above reports
are to be submitted. In cases where the pretreatment standard requires
compliance with a Best Management Practice (BMP) or pollution
prevention alternative, the user must submit documentation required by
the control authority or the pretreatment standard necessary to
determine the compliance status of the user.
(b) The control authority may impose mass limitation on users
which the control authority has reason to believe are using dilution to
meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements or in other cases
where the imposition of mass limitations are appropriate. In such cases
the periodic compliance report required in subsection (a) of this section
shall indicate the mass of pollutants regulated by pretreatment standards
in the effluent of the significant industrial user. These reports shall
contain the results of sampling and analysis of the discharge, including
the flow and the nature and concentration, or production and mass where
requested by the control authority, of pollutants contained therein which
are limited by the applicable pretreatment standards. The frequency of
monitoring shall be prescribed in the wastewater discharge permit. All
analyses shall be performed in accordance with procedures established by
the administrator pursuant to section 304(g) of the Act and contained in
40 C.F.R., part 136 and amendments thereto or with any other test
procedures approved by the administrator. Sampling shall be performed
in accordance with the techniques approved by the administrator. Where
40 C.F.R. part 136 does not include a sampling or analytical technique for
18-34
the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be performed in
accordance with the procedures set forth in the EPA publication
"Sampling and Analytical Procedures for Screening of Industrial
Effluents for Priority Pollutants," dated April 1977 and amendments
thereto, or with any other sampling and analytical procedures approved
by the administrator.
(c) All analyses shall be performed in accordance with
procedures established by the administrator pursuant to section 304(g)
of the Act and contained in 40 C.F.R., part 136 and amendments thereto
or with any other test procedures approved by the administrator.
Sampling shall be performed in accordance with the techniques approved
by the administrator. Where 40 C.F.R. part 136 does not include a
sampling or analytical technique for the pollutant in question, sampling
and analysis shall be performed in accordance with the procedures set
forth in the EPA publication "Sampling and Analytical Procedures for
Screening of Industrial Effluents for Priority Pollutants," dated April,
1977 and amended thereto, or with any other sampling and analytical
procedures approved by the administrator.
(4) Permit limit violations. If sampling performed by a user indicates
a violation, the user shall notify the control authority within twenty-four (24)
hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the
sampling and analysis for the parameter(s) violated and submit the results of
the repeat analysis to the control authority within thirty (30) days after
becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also provide written notice of the
violation within five (5) days of becoming aware of the violation. (As replaced by
Ord. #00-003, Feb. 2000, and Ord. #13-305, April 2013)
18-211. Monitoring facilities. (1) The control authority shall require
to be provided and operated at the user's own expense, monitoring facilities to
allow inspection, sampling and flow measurement of the building sewer and/or
internal drainage systems. The monitoring facility should normally be situated
on the user's premises, but the control authority may, when such location would
be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be
constructed in the public street or sidewalk area and located so that it will not
be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles.
(2) There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or
facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples or analysis. The
facility, sampling, and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times
in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user. The failure
of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be
grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its
discharge.
(3) Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling
and monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the control
18-35
authority's requirements and all applicable local construction standards and
specifications. Construction shall be completed within ninety (90) days following
written notification by the control authority. (As replaced by Ord. #00-003, Feb.
2000, and Ord. #13-305, April 2013)
18-212. Inspection and sampling. (1) The control authority shall
inspect the facilities of any user to ascertain whether the purpose of this chapter
is being met and all requirements are being complied with. Persons or occupants
of premises where wastewater is created or discharged shall allow the control
authority or their representative ready access at all reasonable times to all parts
of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination
or in the performance of any of their duties. The control authority, state, and
EPA shall have the right to set up on the user's property such devices as are
necessary for them to conduct sampling inspections, compliance monitoring
and/or metering operations.
(2) The control authority will establish those pollutants to be sampled,
at the user's expense, at the prescribed minimum frequency shown in the user's
permit. The user must collect samples using twenty-four (24) hour flowproportional
composite sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite
sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the control authority. Where timeproportional
sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the control authority,
the samples must be representative of the discharge. Using protocols (including
appropriate preservation) specified in 40 C.F.R. part 136 and appropriate EPA
guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a twenty-four (24) hour period
may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols,
and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for
volatile organic and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the
laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the
compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be
authorized by the control authority, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples
may be required to show compliance with instantaneous limits. All analysis
shall be performed in accordance with procedures established by the
administrator pursuant to section 304(g) of the Act and contained in 40 C.F.R.
part 136 as amended. Where 40 C.F.R. part 136 does not include a sampling or
analytical technique for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall
be performed in accordance with the procedures set forth in the EPA publication
"Sampling and Analytical Procedures for Screening of Industrial Effluents for
Priority Pollutants" dated April 1977 and amendments thereto, or with any
other sampling and analytical procedures approved by the administrator. The
user shall submit monitoring reports to the control authority of those priority
pollutants to be sampled at the frequency prescribed in the wastewater
contribution permit. The results of any and all sampling of the user's discharge
shall be reported, including sampling which exceeds the required minimum
18-36
frequency. Failure to comply with these requirements may result in enforcement
action as set forth in § 18-217.
(3) For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and ninety
(90) day compliance reports required in section 205.4, a minimum of four (4)
grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide
and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data
do not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the
control authority may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by
§ 18-205(4), the industrial user is required to collect the number of grab samples
necessary to assess and assure compliance by with applicable pretreatment
standards and requirements.
(4) Where a user has security measures in force which would require
proper identification and clearance before entry into their premises, the user
shall make necessary arrangements with their security guards so that, upon
presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the city, state, and EPA
will be permitted to enter, without delay, for the purposes of performing their
specific responsibilities. (As added by Ord. #00-003, Feb. 2000, and replaced by
Ord. #13-305, April 2013)
18-213. Pretreatment. Users shall provide necessary wastewater
treatment as required to comply with this chapter and shall achieve compliance
with all federal categorical pretreatment standards within the time limitations
as specified by the federal pretreatment regulations. Any facilities required to
pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the control authority shall be
provided, operated and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans
prepared by a professional engineer registered in the State of Tennessee
showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted
to the control authority for review, and shall be acceptable to the control
authority before construction of the facility. The review of such plans and
operating procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of
modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to the
control authority under the provisions of this chapter. Any subsequent changes
in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported to and be
acceptable to the control authority prior to the user's initiation of the changes.
All records relating to compliance with pretreatment standards shall be
made available to officials of the city, EPA or state upon request. (As added by
Ord. #00-003, Feb. 2000, and replaced by Ord. #13-305, April 2013)
18-214. Confidential information. Information and data on a user
obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits and
monitoring programs and from inspections shall be available to the public or
other governmental agency without restriction unless the user specifically
requests and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the control authority
18-37
that the release of such information would divulge information, processes or
methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets of the user.
When requested by the person furnishing a report, the portions of a report
which might disclose trade secret processes shall not be made available for
inspection by the public but shall be made available upon request to the state
and/or EPA for uses related to this system permit and/or the pretreatment
programs; provided, however, that such portions of a report shall be available
for use by the state, any state agency, or the EPA in judicial review or
enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater
constituents and characteristics will not be recognized as confidential
information. (As added by Ord. #00-003, Feb. 2000, and replaced by
Ord. #13-305, April 2013)
18-215. Public notification. In compliance with 40 C.F.R. part 403.8,
the control authority shall annually publish in the local newspaper a list of
industrial users which, during the previous twelve (12) months, were in
significant noncompliance with the pretreatment program requirements. (As
added by Ord. #00-003, Feb. 2000, and replaced by Ord. #13-305, April 2013)
18-216. Building sewers and connections. (1) Building sewer permit.
No unauthorized person shall uncover, make any connections with or opening
into, use, alter, or disturb any POTW or appurtenances thereof. Authorization
may be obtained from the city upon review of pertinent plans and payment of
the appropriate fees.
There shall be two (2) classes of building sewer permits:
(a) For residential customers; and
(b) For non-residential customers.
In either case, the customer or his/her agent shall make application on a
special form furnished by the city. The permit application shall be supplemented
by any plans, specifications or other information such as grease traps needed by
restaurants, dining halls or other types of eating establishments, considered
pertinent in the judgment of the city and/or control authority. A fee schedule is
in effect for residential and non-residential connections; said fees shall be paid
to the control authority at the time the application is filed. Applicants for nonresidential
sewer permits shall provide a description of the constituents of the
waste and may be required to provide a laboratory analysis of the waste, or of
a similar waste stream if there are other facilities in operation.
(2) Connections. All costs and expense incident to the installation and
connection of the building sewer shall be borne by the customer. The customer
shall indemnify the city from any loss or damage that may directly or indirectly
be occasioned by the installation of the building sewer. The connection to the
POTW shall be inspected by the city before the underground portion is buried.
(3) Installation and maintenance. The new building sewer may be
brought into the building below the basement floor when gravity flow from the
18-38
building to the POTW at a minimum grade consistent with the requirements of
the city is possible. Where basement or floor elevations to be served are lower
than the ground overflow elevation of the upstream manhole of the POTW line
servicing the property, adequate precautions by the installation of check valves
or other approved backflow prevention devices to help protect against flooding
shall be provided by the owner. The city shall have the right to review and
approve all check valves and backflow prevention devices. Said check valves or
backflow prevention devices shall be located such as to provide access for
maintenance and shall be installed in a valve pit to allow access without
excavation for normal maintenance operations. In all buildings in which a
building drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the POTW, wastes carried by
said building drain shall be lifted by an approved means and discharged to the
building sewer at the expense of the customer. Pumps or other devices shall be
reviewed and approved by the city.
(4) No person shall make connection of roof down spouts, exterior
foundation drains, areaway drains, or other sources of surface runoff or
groundwater to a building sewer or building drain which in turn is connected
directly or indirectly to the POTW. If, during periodic system inspections, the
city locates a point of entry of infiltration/inflow in an owner's building sewer,
the owner shall repair the defect(s) at his/her own expense and furthermore
notify the city upon completion so that an inspection of the repair can be made
prior to covering of the repair.
(5) All excavation for building sewer installation shall be adequately
guarded with barricades and lights or other means so as to protect the public
from hazard. Streets, sidewalks, parkways and other public property disturbed
in the course of the work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory to the city.
(6) All building connections and maintenance shall be subject to the
currently adopted version of the International Plumbing Code, as amended by
the City of Alcoa and the Water and Sanitary Sewer Service Rules, Regulations
and Construction Specifications of the City of Alcoa Public Works and
Engineering Department. The Rules, Regulations, and Construction Standards
of the City of Alcoa Public Works and Engineering Department are available
through the Public Works and Engineering Department and on file with the
State of Tennessee. In cases of conflict the stricter requirements shall rule. (As
added by Ord. #00-003, Feb. 2000, replaced by Ord. #13-305, April 2013, and
amended by Ord. #19-468, April 2019 Ch15_12-10-19)
18-217. Grease, oil and sand traps and separators. (1) General
requirements. Gravity-type separators, interceptors or other such devices for the
removal of oil, grease, sand, grit, glass, entrails or other such material likely to
create or contribute to a blockage of the wastewater collection system or
otherwise interfere with the operation of the POTW are required at:
(a) Applicable commercial sources;
18-39
(b) Where required by the International Plumbing Code adopted
by the city, and amended by the city; or
(c) Where required by other ordinance or regulation of the City
of Alcoa.
Such devices shall be of a type and capacity approved by the city's
inspector and shall be located as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning,
pumping and inspection.
(2) Design, review and approval of traps and separators. During the
plans review conducted by the City of Alcoa personnel of proposed commercial
and industrial developments, the need for traps or separators will be
determined. If a trap or separator is required, detailed plumbing plans shall be
submitted to and approved by the public works and engineering department
prior to commencement of construction.
Grease traps shall be sized by the following formula:
Grease trap size (gallons) = F.U. x 0.5 x 5 gpm x 20 minutes
where:
F.U. = fixture units plumbed into grease trap
(as listed in International Plumbing
Code adopted by the city, and as
amended by the city)
gpm = Gallons per minute
0.5 = factor to account for low probability of
all fixture units operating
simultaneously
Minimum grease trap size shall be 1,000 gallons.
The location of the trap or separator should be placed in an area that is
clear of the discharge and flow from rain water down spouts or other stormwater
conveyances. Traps or separators shall not be located in flood prone areas.
All grease traps shall meet design criteria noted above and as described
in the Wastewater Collection--Construction Specifications of the Alcoa Public
Works and Engineering Department. Persons wishing to install precast concrete
septic tanks or concrete tanks shall submit to the control authority. A field
inspection shall be required to ensure that the installation complies with the
approved drawings and that adequate baffling has been installed.
(3) Exemptions. Commercial sources in operation prior to adoption of
this chapter are excluded from the minimum requirements of this section, but
shall be required to install and maintain a gravity-type separator, interceptor
or other such device for removal of oil and grease. Such devices shall be the
largest type available that may be installed adjacent to the sink or other fixture
in question and shall not be connected to any dishwashers. Such devices will be
allowed to remain in service until such time as the control authority determines
18-40
that the device is not preventing prohibited substances from entering the
POTW, the device is not being maintained with adequate frequency, the
establishment changes ownership, the kitchen facilities or entire building are,
the establishment changes ownership, the kitchen facilities or entire building
is remodeled, and/or food handling/processing is expanded to include grease and
oil containing foods remodeled, and/or food handling/processing is expanded to
include grease and oil containing foods. If the control authority makes such a
determination, the establishment shall install a device in full compliance with
this section.
(4) Maintenance of traps and separators. It shall be the duty of every
establishment required to have traps or separators to maintain the devices, have
the devices pumped whenever the level of grease or other substance has reached
the top of the effluent pipe from the device, when the fats, oils, greases and/or
settleable solids become twenty-five percent (25%) of the tank's total working
depth, and/or when it appears to the control authority that prohibited
substances are leaving the device and are being discharged into the POTW.
Mechanical or manual agitation of the contents of the grease trap or
separator is prohibited during normal operation. However agitation is allowed
during cleaning to assist in the removal of the fat, oil and grease, or other
trapped solids but may not cause a discharge to the sanitary collection system.
The use of any additives or chemicals that liquify, emulsify, and/or
disperse fats, oils, and grease in the trap/separator or will cause fats, oils and
grease to discharge to the sanitary collection system is prohibited. Any biological
agents may only be used with prior approval of the City of Alcoa Public Works
Director. Such approvals will be granted on a case-by-case and site-specific
basis. High strength caustics and acids are prohibited from entering the grease
trap or separator. Approved agents may only be introduced prior to the
trap/separator and the dosage must not exceed the capacity of the
trap/separator.
Each establishment is required to maintain a maintenance log with an
original copy of the manifest on all traps and separators. The log shall show the
date of all cleanings, the name of the person and organization performing the
cleaning and the disposition of the removed substances. Copies of each pumping
manifest must be retained for twelve (12) months. The maintenance log shall be
available during business hours for examination by the city and a copy of the log
shall be submitted annually to the city. Failure to comply with the reporting
requirements shall be deemed a violation of this chapter of the Alcoa Municipal
Code.
(5) Disposal of trap and separator wastes. Acceptable disposal options
for the wastes removed from traps and separators include recycling collectors
and trash disposal or commercial collectors. All grease traps shall be pumped
out entirely and no portion of the removed material returned to the trap or
separator. Disposal methods shall comply with all state and local regulations.
18-41
(6) Periodic inspection of traps and separators. Personnel from the
City of Alcoa shall be permitted ready access to inspect all traps and separators
for compliance with the municipal code. A minimum inspection and pumping
violation, the user shall be issued a seven (7) day notice to come into compliance.
Failure to correct noncompliance within the seven (7) day period will result in
termination of water service. If termination of water service will possibly result
in a threat to public health, the trap or separator will be pumped and cleaned
by City of Alcoa personnel. The user shall reimburse the City of Alcoa for all
labor, equipment, supplies and disposal costs incurred by the city to pump and
clean the trap or separator. The charges will be added to the user's utility bill.
(7) Charges and fees. Users required to install and maintain a
gravity-type separator, interceptor or other such device shall be subject to
payment of fees that may be adopted by the city. All fees will appear on the
user's utility bill. In the event that the user fails to pay the fee, water service
shall be terminated until such time as all fees and any other charges, including
late charges, have been paid.
(8) Violations. Any person who willfully or negligently violates any
provision of this section or any orders or permits issued hereunder shall be
subject to enforcement action as set forth in § 18-208 herein. (As added by Ord.
#00-003, Feb. 2000, amended by Ord. #02-021, Sept. 2002, replaced by
Ord. #13-305, April 2013, and amended by Ord. #19-468, April 2019
Ch15_12-10-19)
18-218. Enforcement. (1) Enforcement policy. All enforcement actions
taken by the control authority against users that are in violation of this chapter
shall be in accordance with the Pretreatment Enforcement Response Plan as
adopted and amended by the Maryville City Council and the Alcoa City
Commission and with Tennessee Code Annotated, §§ 69-3-123 through 69-3-129
from which the authority for such action is derived.
(2) Administrative enforcement remedies. (a) Notification of violation.
Whenever the city and/or control authority finds that any user has
violated an order of the control authority or willfully or negligently failed
to comply with any provision of this chapter, and the orders, rules,
regulations and permits issued hereunder, the city and/or control
authority may serve upon such person a written notice by registered mail
stating the nature of the violation. Within ten (10) days of the date of the
notification of violation a plan fo the satisfactory correction thereof, to
include specific required actions, shall be submitted to the city and/or
control authority by the user. Submission of this plan in no way relieves
the user of liability for any violation occurring before or after the receipt
of the notice of violation.
(b) Consent orders. The control authority is hereby empowered
to enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other
similar documents establishing an agreement with the user responsible
18-42
for the noncompliance. Such orders will include specific action to be taken
by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period also
specified by the order. Consent orders shall have the same force and effect
as administrative orders issued pursuant to § 18-218(2)(d) and (e) below.
(c) Show cause hearing. The control authority may order any
user who causes or allows an unauthorized discharge to enter the POTW
or contributes to violation of this chapter or wastewater permit or order
issued hereunder, to show cause before the hearing authority why the
proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served
on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting to be held by the
hearing authority regarding the violation, the proposed enforcement
action and the reasons for such action, and directing the user to show
cause before the hearing authority why this proposed enforcement action
should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally
or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten
(10) days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any principal
executive, general partner or corporate officer. Whether or not a duly
notified user appears as noticed, immediate enforcement action may be
pursued.
The hearing authority may itself conduct the hearing and take the
evidence or may designate any of its members or any officer or employee
of the city to:
(i) Issue in the name of the hearing authority notices of
hearings requesting the attendance and testimony of witnesses
and the production of evidence relevant to any matter involved in
such hearings;
(ii) Take the evidence;
(iii) Transmit a report of the evidence and hearing,
including transcripts and other evidence, together with
recommendations to the hearing authority for action thereon.
At any hearing held pursuant to this chapter, testimony taken
shall be under oath and may, at the request of either party, be recorded
stenographically. The transcript, so recorded, will be made available to
any member of the public or any party to the hearing upon payment of
the usual charges thereof.
After the hearing authority has reviewed the evidence, it may issue
an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that, following
a specified time period, the sewer service be discontinued unless adequate
treatment facilities, devices or other related appurtenances shall have
been installed on existing treatment facilities, and/or these devices or
other related appurtenances are properly operated. Further orders and
directives as are necessary and appropriate may be issued, including the
installation of pretreatment technology, additional self-monitoring and
management practices.
18-43
Decisions of the hearing authority may be appealed to the appeal
authority within thirty (30) days. If an appeal is not made to the local
appeal authority within thirty (30) days of notification of such decision,
user shall be deemed to have consented to such decision and it shall
become final.
(d) Compliance order. In accordance with Tennessee Code
Annotated, § 69-3-123, when the control authority finds that a user has
violated an order of the control authority or willfully or negligently failed
to comply with any provision of this chapter, and the orders, rules,
regulations and permits issued hereunder, an order may be issued to the
user responsible for the discharge directing that, following a specific time
period, sewer service shall be discontinued unless adequate treatment
facilities, devices or other related appurtenances have been installed and
are properly operated. Orders may also contain such other requirements
as might be reasonably necessary and appropriate to address the
noncompliance, including the installation of pretreatment technology,
additional self-monitoring and management practices.
(e) Cease and desist order. In accordance with Tennessee Code
Annotated, § 69-3-123, when the control authority finds that a user who
is found to have violated an order of the control authority or who willfully
or negligently failed to comply with any provision of this chapter, and the
orders, rules, regulations and permits issued hereunder, the control
authority may issue an order to cease and desist all such violations and
direct those persons in compliance to:
(i) Comply forthwith;
(ii) Take such appropriate remedial or preventative
action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or
threatened violation, including halting operations and terminating
the discharge.
(f) Administrative penalties. Any user who is found to have
violated an order of the control authority or who willfully or negligently
failed to comply with any provision of this chapter, and the orders, rules,
regulations and permits issued hereunder shall be fined not more than
ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) per day as authorized by Tennessee
Code Annotated, § 69-3-115 for each offense. Each day on which
noncompliance shall occur or continue shall be deemed a separate and
distinct violation. In addition to the fines provided herein, the control
authority may recover reasonable attorney's fees, court costs, court
reporter's fees and other expenses of litigation by appropriate suit at law
against the person found to have violated this chapter or the orders,
rules, regulations and permits issued hereunder. Such assessments may
be added to the user's next scheduled sewer service charge, and the
control authority shall have the same collection remedies that the city
has to collect service charges.
18-44
(g) Emergency suspension. The control authority may, without
notice, suspend the wastewater treatment service and/or a wastewater
discharge permit of a user when such suspension is necessary, in the
opinion of the control authority, in order to stop an actual or threatened
discharge which presents or may present an imminent or substantial
endangerment to the health or welfare of persons, to the environment,
causes interference to the POTW or causes the city to violate any
condition of its NPDES permit.
Any user notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment
service and/or the wastewater discharge permit shall immediately stop
or eliminate the contribution. In the event of a user's failure to
immediately stop or eliminate the contribution. In the event of a user's
failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the
control authority shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including
immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize
damage to the POTW, its receiving stream or endangerment to any
individuals. The control authority shall reinstate the wastewater
discharge permit and/or the wastewater treatment service upon proof of
the elimination of the non-complying discharge, unless the termination
proceedings set forth in § 18-218(2)(h) are initiated against the user.
Any user whose wastewater treatment service and/or wastewater
discharge permit is suspended shall submit a detailed written statement
describing the cause of the harmful contribution and the measures taken
to prevent any future occurrence to the control authority within five (5)
days of the occurrence.
(h) Revocation of permit. Any user who is found to have violated
an order of the control authority or who willfully or negligently failed to
comply with any provision of this chapter, and the orders, rules,

federal regulations, is subject to having his permit revoked in accordance
with the procedures of this section of this chapter:
(i) Violation of conditions of the permit;
(ii) Failure of a user to accurately report the wastewater
constituents and characteristics of his discharge;
(iii) Failure of the user to report significant changes in
operations, or wastewater constituents and characteristics; or
(iv) Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for
the purpose of inspection or monitoring.
(3) Judicial remedies. (a) Legal action. If any person discharges
sewage, industrial wastes or other wastes into the city's wastewater
disposal system, in any other way violates this chapter or its industrial
wastewater discharge permit, contrary to the provisions of this chapter,
federal or state pretreatment requirements, or any order of the control
authority, the city and/or control authority, through the city attorney,
18-45
may commence an action for appropriate legal and/or equitable relief in
the chancery court for the county in which the violation occurred.
(b) Injunctive relief. Whenever a user is found to have violated
an order of the control authority or willfully or negligently failed to
comply with any provision of this chapter and the orders, rules,
regulations and permits issued hereunder, the city and/or control
authority, through counsel, may initiate proceedings in the chancery
court of the county in which the activities occurred for the issuance of
injunctive relief or any other relief available in law or equity.
(c) Civil penalties. (i) Any user who is found to have violated an
order of the control authority or who willfully or negligently failed
to comply with any provision of this chapter, and the orders, rules,
regulations and permits issued hereunder, shall be fined not more
than ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) for each offense. Each day
on which a violation shall occur or continue shall be deemed a
separate and distinct offense. In addition to the penalties provided
herein the city may recover reasonable attorney's fees, court costs,
court reporter's fees and other expenses of litigation by
appropriate suit at law against the person found to have violated
this chapter or the orders, rules, regulations and permits issued
hereunder.
(ii) (A) The control authority may assess any person
or user for damages to the POTW resulting from that
person's or user's pollution, violation, or failure or neglect in
complying with any permit(s) or order(s) issued pursuant to
the provisions of the pretreatment program, this chapter, or
Tennessee Code Annotated, §§ 69-3-123, 69-3-124, or
69-3-125.
(B) If any appeal from such assessment is not
made to the local appeal authority within thirty (30) days of
notification of such assessment, the person or user shall be
deemed to have consented to such assessment and it shall
become final.
(C) Damages may include any expenses incurred
in investigating and enforcing the pretreatment program,

because of a person's or user's failure to appeal within the
time provided, the control authority may apply to the
appropriate court for judgment, and seek execution of such
judgment. The court in such proceedings, shall treat failure
18-46
to appeal such an assessment as a confession of judgment
in the amount of the assessment.
(iii) The control authority may petition the court to
impose, assess, and recover such sums. In determining the amount
of liability the court shall take into account all relevant
circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm
caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the
violation, any economic benefits gained through the user's
violation, corrective actions taken by the user, the compliance
history of the user, and any other factors as justice requires.

noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and
requirements. The term significant noncompliance shall be applicable to
all significant industrial users which are found to be in significant
violation of this chapter.
(b) Performance bonds. The control authority may decline to
reissue a permit to any user who is found to have violated an order of the
control authority or who willfully or negligently failed to comply with any
provision of this chapter and the orders, rules, regulations and permits
issued hereunder unless such user first files with the control authority a
satisfactory bond, payable to the city, in a sum not to exceed a value
determined by the hearing authority to be necessary to achieve consistent
compliance.
(c) Liability insurance. The control authority may decline to
reissue a permit to any user who has failed to comply with the provisions
of this chapter or any order or previous permit issued hereunder unless

(d) Water supply severance. Whenever a user is found to have
violated an order of the control authority or willfully or negligently failed
to comply with any provision of this chapter, and the orders, rules,
regulations and permits issued hereunder, water service to the user may
be severed and service will only recommence, at the user's expense, after

results in an administrative penalty levied against the user, the control
authority is authorized to disburse up to ten percent (10%) of the collected
penalty to the informant up to a maximum of ten thousand dollars
($10,000.00) per reward payment.
(5) Affirmative defenses. (a) Treatment upsets.
(i) Any user which experiences an upset in operations
that places it in a temporary state of noncompliance, which is not
the result of operational error, improperly designed treatment
facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventative
maintenance or careless and improper operation, shall inform the
control authority thereof immediately upon becoming aware of the
upset. Where such information is given orally, a written report
shall be filed by the user within five (5) days. The report shall
contain:
(A) A description of the upset, its cause(s) and
impact on the discharger's compliance status;
(B) The duration or expected duration of
noncompliance, including exact dates and times of
noncompliance, and, if the noncompliance is continuing, the

for any noncompliance with this chapter, or any order or permit
issued hereunder to the user, which arises out of violation
attributable to and alleged to have occurred during the period of
the documented and verified upset.
(b) Treatment bypasses. (i) A bypass of the treatment system
or any portion thereof is prohibited unless all of the following
conditions are met:
18-48
(A) The bypass was unavoidable in order to
prevent loss of life, personal injury or severe property
damage;
(B) There was no feasible alternative to the
bypass, including the use of auxiliary treatment retention
of the wastewater; and
(C) The user properly notified the control authority
as described in § 18-218(5)(b)(ii) below.
(ii) Users must provide immediate notice to the control
authority upon discovery of an unanticipated bypass. A written
submission shall also be provided within five (5) days of the time
the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission
shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the
duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the
bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected
to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The control authority may
waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report
has been received within twenty-four (24) hours.
(iii) A user may request approval of the control authority
for a bypass which does not cause pretreatment standards or
requirements to be violated, but only if it is for essential
maintenance to ensure efficient operation of the treatment system.
Users anticipating such a bypass must submit notice to the control
authority at least ten (10) days in advance. The control authority
may only approve the anticipated bypass if the circumstances
satisfy those set forth in § 18-218(5)(b)(i) above. (As added by Ord.

18-302. Standards. The City of Alcoa Public Water System is to comply
with Tennessee Code Annotated, §§ 68-221-701 through 68-221-720 as well as
the Rules and Regulations for Public Water Supplies, legally adopted in
accordance with this code, and establish an effective on-going program to control
these undesirable water uses. (1971 Code, § 8-301)
18-303. Construction, operation and supervision. It shall be
unlawful for any person to cause a cross-connection to be made; or allow one to
exist for any purpose whatsoever unless the construction and operation of same
have been approved by the Tennessee Department of Health and the operation
of such cross-connection, auxiliary intake, by-pass or inter-connection is at all
times under the direct supervision of the City Manager of the Alcoa Public
Water System. (1971 Code, § 8-303)
18-304. Statement required. Any person whose premises are supplied
with water from the public water supply and who also has on the same premises
a separate source of water supply or stores water in an uncovered or unsanitary
storage reservoir from which the water stored therein is circulated through a
piping system, shall file with the city manager a statement of the non-existence
of unapproved or unauthorized cross-connections, auxiliary intakes, by-passes,
or inter-connections. Such statement shall also contain an agreement that no
cross-connection, auxiliary intake, by-pass, or inter-connection will be permitted
upon the premises. (1971 Code, § 8-304)
18-305. Inspections required. It shall be the duty of the City Manager
of the Alcoa Public Water System, or authorized representative, to cause
inspections to be made of all properties served by the public water supply where
cross-connections with the public water supply are deemed possible. The
frequency of inspections and re-inspections based on potential health hazards
involved shall be established by the City Manager of the Alcoa Public Water
System and as approved by the Tennessee Department of Health. (1971 Code,
§ 8-305)

permission of the property owner, the city manager or authorized representative
shall have the right to enter at any reasonable time any property served by a
connection to the City of Alcoa Public Water System for the purpose of
18-51
inspecting the piping system or systems therein for cross-connections, auxiliary
intakes, by-passes, or inter-connections. On request, the owner, lessee, or
occupant of any property so served shall furnish to the inspection agency any
pertinent information regarding the piping system or systems on such property.
The refusal of such information or refusal of access, when requested, shall be
deemed evidence of the presence of cross-connections, and shall be grounds for
the disconnection of water service to the property. The city manager or
authorized representative shall give notice to the property owner who refuses
information or refuses access of the time and place of a hearing to determine
whether or not water service should be disconnected to that particular property.
Said hearing shall be conducted in accordance with the other rules and
regulations of the City of Alcoa regarding discontinuance of service. (1971 Code,
§ 8-306)
18-307. Correction of existing violations. Any person who now has
cross-connections, auxiliary intakes, by-passes, or inter-connections in violation
of the provisions of this chapter shall be allowed a reasonable time within which
to comply with the provisions of this chapter. After a thorough investigation of
existing conditions and an appraisal of the time required to complete the work,
the amount of time shall be designated by the City Manager of the City of Alcoa
Public Water System.
The failure to correct conditions threatening the safety of the public water
system as prohibited by this chapter and Tennessee Code Annotated,
§ 68-221-711, within a reasonable time and within the time limits set by the
City of Alcoa Public Water System, shall be grounds for denial of water service.
If proper protection has not been provided after a reasonable time, the utility
shall give the customer legal notification that water service is to be
discontinued, and shall further give the customer notice that a hearing will be
conducted to determine whether or not water service should be discontinued for
that particular property belonging to the customer. If at the public hearing it
is determined that the conditions are a threat to the safety of the public water
system, then the city manager or his authorized representative shall have the
right to discontinue water to the property creating the hazardous condition until
the public water system has been separated from the customer's on-site piping
system in such a manner that the two systems cannot again be connected by an
unauthorized person.
Where cross-connections, inter-connections, auxiliary intakes, or
by-passes are found that constitutes an extreme hazard of immediate concern
of contaminating the public water system, the management of the water system
shall require that immediate corrective action be taken to eliminate the threat
to the public water system. Immediate steps shall be taken to disconnect the
public water supply from the on-site piping system unless the imminent
hazard(s) is corrected immediately. (1971 Code, § 8-307)
18-52
18-308. Use of protective devices. Where the nature of use of the
water supplied a premises by the water system is such that it is deemed:
(1) Impractical to provide an effective air-gap separation.
(2) That the owner and/or occupant of the premises cannot, or is not
willing, to demonstrate to the official in charge of the water system, or his
designated representative, that the water use and protective features of the
plumbing are such as to propose no threat to the safety or potability of the water
system.
(3) That the nature and mode of operation within a premises are such
that frequent alterations are made to the plumbing.
(4) There is a likelihood that protective measures may be subverted,
altered, or disconnected.
The City Manager of the City of Alcoa Public Water System, or his
designated representative, shall require the use of an approved protective
device. Said protective device shall be installed on the service line serving the
premises. Said protective device is to assure that any contamination that may
originate in the customer's premises is contained therein. The protective devices
shall be a reduced pressure zone type backflow preventer approved by the
Tennessee Department of Health as to manufacture, model, and size. The
method of installation of backflow protective devices shall be approved by the
City Manager of the City of Alcoa Public Water System prior to installation and
shall comply with the criteria set forth by the Tennessee Department of Health.
The installation and maintenance of the protective device shall be at the
expense of the owner or occupant of the premises. The failure to install and
maintain the protective device when required by the City of Alcoa shall be
grounds for denial of water service. If the protective device has not been
installed within a reasonable time after the request by the City of Alcoa, then
the city manager or authorized representative shall give the customer legal
notice that water service is to be discontinued and shall further give the
customer notice that a hearing shall be conducted to determine whether or not
water service should be discontinued.
Personnel of the City of Alcoa Public Water System shall have this right
to inspect and test the device or devices on an annual basis or whenever deemed
necessary by the city manager, or his designated representative. Water service
shall not be disrupted to test the device without the knowledge of the occupant
of the premises.
Where the use of water is critical to the continuance of normal operations
or protection of life, property or equipment, duplicate units shall be provided to
avoid the necessity of discontinuing water service to test or repair the protective
device or devices. Where it is found that only one unit has been installed and
the continuance of service is critical, the City Manager of the Alcoa Water
System shall notify, in writing, the occupant of the premises of plans to
discontinue water service and arrange for a mutually acceptable time to test
and/or repair the device. The water system shall require the occupant of the
18-53
premises to make all repairs indicated promptly, to keep the unit(s) working
properly, and the expense of such repairs shall be borne by the owner or
occupant of the premises. Repairs shall be made by qualified personnel,
acceptable to the City Manager of the City of Alcoa Public Water System.
The failure to maintain backflow prevention device(s) in proper working
order shall be grounds for discontinuing water service to a premises, after
proper notice and hearing have been afforded to the customer. Likewise the
removal, by-passing or altering the protective device(s) or the installation
thereof so as to render the device(s) ineffective shall constitute grounds for
discontinuance of water service, after proper notice and hearing have been
afforded to the customer. Water service to such premises shall not be restored
until the customer has corrected or eliminated such conditions or defects to the
satisfaction of the City of Alcoa Public Water System. (1971 Code, § 8-308)
18-309. Unpotable water to be labeled. The potable water system
made available to premises served by the public water system shall be protected
from possible contamination as specified herein. Any water outlet which could
be used for potable or domestic purposes and which is not supplied by the
potable system must be labeled in a conspicuous manner as:
WATER UNSAFE
FOR DRINKING
Minimum acceptable sign shall have black letters at least one-inch high located
on a red background. (1971 Code, § 8-309)
18-310. Violations. The requirements contained herein shall apply to
all premises served by the City of Alcoa Public Water System whether located
inside or outside the corporate limits and are hereby made a part of the
conditions required to be met for the city to provide water services to any
premises. Such action, being essential for the protection of the water
distribution system against the entrance of contamination which may render the
water unsafe healthwise, or otherwise undesirable, shall be enforced rigidly
without regard to location of the premises, whether inside or outside the City of
Alcoa corporate limits.
Any person who neglects or refuses to comply with any of the provisions
of this chapter shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction
therefor, shall be fined not less than ten dollars ($10.00) nor more than five
hundred dollars ($500.00) and each day of continued violation after conviction
shall constitute a separate offense. (1971 Code, § 8-310, modified)
18-311. Assessment of fees. Any person whose premises are regulated
by this ordinance may be assessed fees adequately to recover the cost of the city
18-54
to conduct inspections, testing, maintenance of records, etc. that are necessary
to ensure the person's compliance with this ordinance and/or with applicable
state and federal regulations. (as added by Ord. #15-369, Oct. 2015)

consumers shall be subject to the city's cross-connection ordinance. (Ord. #1017,
Sept. 1996)
18-506. Deposits. (1) When premises have been supplied with customer
line and consumer desires a supply of water thereto, the consumer shall sign an
application for the furnishing of water and shall make a cash deposit to secure
payment for the water to be used and to secure payment of damages, if any, to
the meter and/or meter setting. The amount of deposit, where the consumer
desires ordinary or usual service, shall be in accordance with the schedule
included in Appendix 1.1 Where, at the time of making application for the
furnishing of water, it is apparent to the city manager that the consumer will
require a substantially larger quantity of water than is used by the average
consumer supplied through a meter of the size applied for, the city may require
a larger deposit than that just specified; such deposit, however, in no event to
exceed the annual minimum charge for water service for such sized meter.
(2) Deposits shall not be applied in payment of current monthly bills
and such deposit shall in no wise affect the city's rights to discontinue service
arising from non-payment of bills as provided for in these rules and regulations.
The city will pay interest on deposits using the same schedule used in the
electric utilities rules and regulations.
(3) The city will refund deposit upon written application to discontinue

consumer and for any meter damage, and/or damage to meter setting, for which
such consumer may be liable under these rules and regulations.
(4) The consumer or property owner shall notify the city at the time
each property becomes vacant. Otherwise, the consumer or property owner
shall be responsible for any damage to the property of the city, and for all water
metered to such property up until receipt of such vacancy notice.
(5) The city will presume service is being rendered from the time
water is turned on by application of the consumer until the consumer or
1Appendix 1 (and all amending ordinances and resolutions) is available in

Oct. 2015)
18-507. Private lines-future. From and after the effective date of these
rules and regulations, the city will make one, and only one, service connection
and one meter setting and will furnish one meter for each private line. Such
connection and meter setting will be made upon written application of a
responsible person, firm or corporation, and which person, firm or corporation
is eligible for private line service as defined in § 18-502 hereof. Each such
application shall be accompanied by an additional application for a service
connection on said private line. The applicant in such application shall assume
full liability for all water metered to such private line.
At the time of making such application the applicant shall pay to the city
the standard charge of the city as set forth in § 18-504 hereof. Every consumer
shall also make application and pay the charges as set forth in § 18-504.
All charges for water metered to a private line, and for damage to the
meter setting and/or meter as provided for in § 18-510 hereof, will be billed to
the person, firm or corporation who applies for such line, and such person, firm
or corporation will be responsible for all sums so billed.
The private line shall be installed and maintained by, and at the expense
of, the person, firm, or corporation making application therefor, and such line
shall be and remain the property of such person, firm, or corporation.
However, the city reserves the right to extend, at any time at its
discretion, its mains, and if by the construction and extension of any city main
such main is placed in or along a street, highway, or city right-of-way,
contiguous to the property of any user of water furnished by a private line, for
which private line application has been made after the effective date of these
rules, and which main is within two hundred feet of any water outlet of such
user, the city may, after the completion of such construction or extension, refuse
to furnish water to such private line until such time as such user is disconnected
therefrom. Such user, if water is desired by him from any of the city's mains,
shall obtain such water through a service connection from the main. A customer
line shall be constructed from such service connection in accordance with
§ 18-505 hereof. Service connection and meter setting for such line shall be
made and charges therefor shall be paid in accordance with § 18-504 hereof.
After connections have been made water will be supplied to such consumer in
accordance with § 18-506 hereof.
In all applications made from and after the effective date of these
regulations for service connection for a private line, the applicant shall expressly
agree that the foregoing provisions of this rule shall be binding upon him and
18-62
upon any and every other party served by or through such private line, and the
application for such private line shall expressly authorize the city to discontinue
furnishing any water to such private line until any service line connection
required by this rule has been made. (Ord. #1017, Sept. 1996)
18-508. Private lines-existing. Subsequent to the effective date of
these rules and regulations, whenever a main is placed in or along a street,
highway or city right-of-way contiguous to the property of any user of water
furnished by a private line (including any hereafter constructed addition to or
extension of such private line) and which main is within two hundred feet of any
water outlet of such user, the city may refuse to furnish water to such user
through such private line. If such user desires to obtain water from the city
mains, the same shall be furnished through a service connection and a customer
line constructed in accordance with § 18-505 hereof. Service connection and the
meter setting for such service line shall be made in accordance with § 18-504
hereof. Water will then be supplied to such consumer in accordance with
§ 18-506 thereof.
The city will not make or permit to be made any additional connections
to any private line which is in use on the effective date of these rules and
regulations unless the city has in its possession a written contract executed by
all individuals, firms, and corporations to whom water is metered and billed
from such line, and by which written agreement there is an acceptance of full
responsibility for maintenance of such private line and for any line loss of water
thereof.
Where the city has in its possession such written contract, such private
line may be extended, or additions made thereto, provided all persons, firms,
and corporations responsible for the maintenance and water loss on such line
agree in writing to such extension or addition, and provided written application
for connection to such private line is filed with the city. One meter must be set
for each additional consumer hereafter made to such private line, and all water
furnished through each such addition, will be metered through such meter, and
all charges therefor and for damages, if any, to the meter as provided in § 18-510
hereof, will be billed to such applicant who will be responsible for the payment
thereof.
Any such extension of, or addition to, an existing private line (including
the connection with the existing private line) shall be installed and maintained
by, and at the expense of, the person, firm or corporation making application
therefor, and such addition or extension shall be and remain the property of
such applicant. Any such meter setting shall be provided and installed by the
city in accordance with § 18-504 hereof, upon written application. Before any
meter is placed in such meter setting, and before any water is furnished to such
extension or addition, deposit shall be made with the city in accordance with the
provisions of § 18-506 hereof. (Ord. #1017, Sept. 1996)
18-63

18-510. Meters. Each consumer will be supplied through a separate
meter. A building under one ownership and having a number of apartments or
offices under one roof may, at the owner's discretion, be served by individual
meters for each such apartment, office, or other unit. The charge for such
installation and setting shall be made at the service charge provided for in
§ 18-504. Thereafter each regular tenant in such building shall be a consumer
and shall be subject to all of the applicable rules and regulations hereof.
All meters and meter settings shall be furnished, owned and maintained
by the city, except as otherwise provided in these regulations. Meters and meter
settings must be accessible at all times and not covered with rubbish or material
of any kind. No one other than an authorized agent of the city shall be
permitted to repair, adjust, remove or replace any meter or any part thereof.
The consumer shall be responsible for damage to meters and/or meter
settings where such damage is caused by a change in grade of the lot or by
carelessness or negligence of the consumer or his agent or employee, or of any
member of his family. Such consumer will be billed for the actual cost of repair
or replacement, and such bill shall be paid within ten days from the date of
mailing thereof. (Ord. #1017, Sept. 1996)
18-511. Meter tests. Should any consumer within twelve months from
the date of the last test of a meter doubt its correctness, the consumer may have
the meter tested by making written application to the city and by making a
deposit in accordance with the table found in Appendix 1.1
If in such test any error in the meter exceeding 4% is found, allowance
shall be made by the proper party to the other according to such error and
covering a period not to exceed the prior billing and the current consumption to
date of removal of the meter. Should the error be found to exceed 4%, all the
expenses incurred in the meter removal and test shall be borne by the city and
the deposit shall be refunded. If, however, the error of the meter does not
exceed 4%, the deposit shall be accepted by the city in payment of the expense
of such removal and test. If a meter 6 inches or larger is tested, no deposit shall
be required; but in the event the error of the meter does not exceed 4%, the
entire cost of such removal, test, and re-installation shall be billed by the city
to the consumer. The amount of such bill shall be paid by the consumer within

shall have access at all reasonable hours to premises supplied with water, for
the purpose of reading, inspecting, repairing or removing meters.
If a meter is found stopped at a meter-reading period, the bill will be
estimated from similar periods, but due consideration shall be given for any
excessive use of water or water wasted during such period.
All bills to consumers shall be due and payable immediately upon receipt
of notice. If a bill remains unpaid longer than ten days after its penalty date,
the city will discontinue water service. (Ord. #1017, Sept. 1996)
18-513. Location of meters. All new meters shall be installed adjacent
to the edge of a street right-of-way or utility easement and at locations approved
by the city. Unless by special exception, all new meters will be installed outside
of all driveways, streets, parking lots, and sidewalks.
All meters which, as of the effective date of these rules and regulations,
are located inside of buildings or in meter settings which the city deems to be
unsatisfactory may be moved to more suitable locations at the discretion of, and
at the expense of, the city.
The city may discontinue water service to any consumer who refuses
permission to remove a meter in accordance with this regulation.
If any meter is relocated upon application by, and to suit the convenience
of, the consumer, or where relocation of meter is required because of change in
grade of lot, such relocation and setting shall be made by the city at the expense
of the consumer. Bill rendered to the consumer for the expense thereof shall be
paid within ten days from the date of mailing of such bill. (Ord. #1017, Sept.

for non-payment of bills, or for violation of the rules of the city, service to such
consumer will not be resumed by the city until the unpaid bill including
penalties have been paid in full and/or the violation of any of the city's rules and
regulations has ceased or been eliminated.
In the event the water service discontinued be that of a private line
(either "existing" or "future" as such lines are designated in these rules), service
to such private line will not be resumed until the full amount of such unpaid bill
including penalties have been paid.
If a customer experiences an excessive leak that is a nuisance to a
neighbor or that results in an exorbitant bill that the customer is unable to or
refuses to pay, the city may discontinue water service. (Ord. #1017, Sept. 1996)
18-516. Connection/restoration of service. Water shall not be turned
into any water line and/or fire hydrants for any purpose by anyone except an
authorized employee of the city. Unauthorized operations will be subject to
further punitive action by the city.
In the event of termination of service due to any violation of any of these
rules and regulations, or upon any request of the consumer, a charge (see
Appendix 11) shall be made to cover the cost of special handling of the customers
account. This fee shall apply ten days after the penalty date and is collectible
when service shall be considered discontinued though not actually cut off. (Ord.
#1017, Sept. 1996)
18-517. Cross connections. In no event will cross connections between

cross connection is corrected. (Ord. #1017, Sept. 1996)
18-518. Special service. Persons, firms, or corporations desiring small
amounts of water for a short time, or service which will require the special
attention of an employee of the city, will be required to make a deposit, the
amount of which will be fixed by the city manager. For water used by such
person a charge will be made at rates fixed by the city manager in keeping with
the service rendered, and the deposit made shall be applied against such charge.

granted by Tennessee Code Annotated, §§ 68-221-1101 through 68-221-1116,
and for the purpose of providing stormwater management operations and
establishing a stormwater utility within the City of Alcoa, the Alcoa Stormwater
Utility Manual - Rules, Rates, Fees and Credits, is hereby adopted and
incorporated by reference as part of this code. (as added by Ord. #04-042, Nov.
2004, deleted by Ord. #08-154, Feb. 2008, and replaced by Ord. #08-153, Feb.
2008)
18-802. Findings. The Board of Commissioners of the City of Alcoa
(hereinafter referred to as the city) makes the following additional findings and
conclusions.
(1) Stormwater systems which provide for the collection, treatment,
storage and disposal of stormwater, provide benefits and services to all property
within the incorporated city limits. Such benefits include, but are not limited
to:
(a) The provision of adequate systems of collection, conveyance,
detention, treatment and release of stormwater.
(b) The reduction of hazards to property and life resulting from
stormwater runoff.
18-73
(c) Improvements in general health and welfare through
reduction of undesirable stormwater conditions.
(d) Improvements to the water quality in the stormwater and
surface water system and its receiving waters.
(2) An equitable approach to funding stormwater management
services and facilities can be provided by adopting a schedule of service fees
upon properties that is related to burden of stormwater quantity and quality
control service requirements and costs posed by properties throughout the city.
(3) A utility fee credit is an appropriate means of adjusting fees in
recognition that private stormwater systems and/or actions can effectively
reduce or eliminate the burden of stormwater quantity and quality control
service requirements and costs that a property or properties pose for the city.
In addition, the value to the stormwater utility of certain actions and practices
performed by property owners and other stormwater utility customers may be
recognized by credits based on other factors, including but not limited to the
avoided cost of public information and education realized by the utility when
public information and education about stormwater management is provided by
the public school system.
(4) Impervious area is the most important factor influencing
stormwater service requirements and costs posed by properties throughout the
city, and therefore is an appropriate parameter for calculating stormwater
utility fees and associated credits. (as added by Ord. #04-042, Nov. 2004,
deleted by Ord. #08-154, Feb. 2008, and replaced by Ord. #08-153, Feb. 2008)
18-803. Definitions. As used in this chapter, unless the context clearly
indicates otherwise, the following definitions apply:
(1) "Credit" shall mean a conditional reduction in the amount of a
stormwater utility fee to a qualifying individual property based on the provision
and continuing presence of an effectively maintained and operational on-site
stormwater system or facility or the provision of a service or activity by the
property owner, which system, facility, service, or activity reduces the
stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater services and facilities. Credits
for on-site stormwater systems shall be generally proportional to the positive
affect that such systems have on the peak rate of runoff and/or improved water
quality from the individual property. Credits shall be defined and implemented
in a stormwater utility manual, which shall be adopted and amended from time
to time, as necessary, by resolution of the Alcoa Board of Commissioners, and
shall be maintained and published in such form and manner as directed by the
Alcoa City Manager or his designee.
(2) "Customers of the stormwater utility" shall include all persons,
properties, and entities served by and/or benefiting from the utility's acquisition,
management, maintenance, extension, and improvement of the stormwater
management programs, systems, and facilities and regulation of public and
private stormwater systems, facilities, and activities related thereto, and
18-74
persons, properties, and entities which will ultimately be served or benefited as
a result of the stormwater management program as determined by applicable
law.
(3) "Detached dwelling unit" shall mean developed land containing one
(1) structure which is not attached to another dwelling and which contains one
(1) or more rooms with a bathroom and kitchen facilities designed for occupancy
by one family. Detached dwelling units may include houses, manufactured
homes, and mobile homes located on one or more individual lots or parcels of
land. "Developed land" shall be classified as a detached dwelling unit despite the
presence of incidental structures associated with residential uses such as
garages, carports, or small storage buildings. Detached dwelling unit can also
include developed land that has a non-residential use of a dwelling unit
designed for occupancy for one (1) family so long as such use does not result in
additional impervious areas, such as parking spaces, impervious surfaced
playgrounds, or structures or additions to the building which are used as offices,
storage facilities, meeting rooms, classrooms, houses of worship, or similar
non-residential uses. Detached dwelling unit shall not include developed land
containing: manufactured homes and mobile homes located within
manufactured home or mobile home parks where the land is owned by others
than the owners of the manufactured homes or mobile homes; or multiple-unit
residential properties.
(4) "Developed land" shall mean property altered from a natural state
by construction or installation of more than five hundred (500) square feet of
impervious surfaces as defined in this chapter.
(5) "Equivalent Residential Unit (ERU)" of impervious area shall mean
the median impervious coverage of detached dwelling unit properties in the City
of Alcoa as determined by the city, and shall be used as the basis for
determining stormwater utility fees to detached dwelling unit properties or
classes of detached dwelling unit properties and other developed land.
(6) "Flood control facilities" shall mean all natural and manmade
conveyances and structures for which the partial or full purpose or use is to
convey surface flood runoff water within the jurisdictional boundaries of the city
of Alcoa. This includes all natural conveyances for which the city has assumed
a level of maintenance responsibility, or has made improvements to prevent
flooding in order to satisfy the city's responsibility or obligation to protect public
and private property, or for to which the city has made improvements, against
the flooding of which the city must make provision to protect public and private
property, or for which the city is accountable under federal or state regulations
for protecting the water quality within its jurisdictional boundaries.
(7) "Impervious surfaces" shall mean those areas that prevent or
impede the infiltration of stormwater into the soil as it entered in natural
conditions prior to development. Common impervious areas include, but are not
limited to, rooftops, sidewalks, walkways, patio areas, driveways, parking lots,
18-75
storage areas, compacted gravel and soil surfaces, awnings and other fabric or
plastic coverings.
(8) "Multiple dwelling unit residential properties" shall mean other
developed land whereon two (2) or more attached residential dwelling units are
located and shall include, but not be limited to, apartment houses,
condominiums, town homes, attached single-family homes, duplexes, triplexes,
boarding houses, group homes, hotels and motels, retirement centers, and other
structures in which two (2) or more family groups commonly and normally
reside or could reside. In the application of stormwater utility fees, multiple
dwelling unit properties shall generally be treated as other developed lands.
However, multiple dwelling unit residential properties where individual
residential dwelling units are owned or occupied independently, such as
residential condominiums or apartments, may be treated as detached dwelling
unit properties in the application of stormwater utility fee rates.
(9) "Other developed land" shall mean, but shall not necessarily be
limited to, manufactured home and mobile home parks, commercial and office
buildings, public buildings and structures, industrial and manufacturing
buildings, storage buildings and storage areas covered with impervious surfaces,
parking lots, parks, recreation properties, public and private schools and
universities, research stations, hospitals and convalescent centers, airports,
agricultural uses covered by impervious surfaces, water reservoirs, and water
and wastewater treatment plants.
(10) "Public airport" shall mean any airport that is used or to be used
for public purposes, under the control of a public agency, of which the area used
or intended to be used for landing, take off or surface maneuvering of aircraft
is publicly owned (see, section 47102(20) of title 49 of the United States Code).
(11) "Stormwater" shall mean stormwater runoff, snow melt runoff,
surface runoff, street wash waters related to street cleaning or maintenance,
infiltration (other than infiltration contaminated by seepage from sanitary
sewers or by other discharges) and general drainage related to a precipitation
event.
(12) "Stormwater utility fee" shall mean the stormwater management
fee and/or charges applicable to a parcel of developed land, which fee/charges
shall be reflective of the City of Alcoa stormwater utility's cost of providing
stormwater management services and facilities. Stormwater utility fee may also
be termed "stormwater utility service charge."
(13) "Stormwater management facilities" shall mean those natural and
man-made drainage structures, conveyances, conduits, combined sewers,
sewers, and all device appurtenances by means of which storm water is
collected, transported, pumped, treated and/or disposed of.
(14) "Undeveloped land." Land in its unaltered state or which has been
modified to such minimal degree as to have a hydrologic response comparable
to land in an unaltered natural state shall be deemed undeveloped.
Undeveloped land shall have no pavement, asphalt, or compacted gravel
18-76
surfaces or structures which create an impervious surface that would prevent
infiltration of storm water or cause storm water to collect, concentrate, or flow
in manner materially different than that which would occur if the land was in
an unaltered natural state. For purposes of this chapter, undeveloped land shall
also include property altered from its natural state by the creation or
installation of less than five hundred (500) square feet of impervious surfaces.

18-804. Creation of stormwater utility. A stormwater utility is
created which shall consist of staff as designated by the city manager for the
operation and maintenance of the city's stormwater/drainage system.
The stormwater utility shall:
(1) Administer the acquisition, design, construction, maintenance
and/or operation of the stormwater utility system, including capital
improvements as may be designated in the capital improvement program;
(2) Administer and enforce this ordinance and all regulations and
procedures adopted relating to the design, construction, maintenance, operation

(3) Advise the municipality's governing body and other city
departments on matters relating to the utility;
(4) Review and approve or deny plans; inspect and accept extensions
and connections to the system; and require submission of as-built plans of
completed drainage improvements;
(5) Enforce regulations to protect and maintain water quality and
quantity within the system in compliance with water quality standards
established by local, state, regional and/or federal agencies as now adopted or
hereafter amended;
(6) Analyze the cost of services and benefits provided, and the system
and structure of fees, charges, civil penalties and other revenues of the utility.
(as added by Ord. #04-042, Nov. 2004, deleted by Ord. #08-154, Feb. 2008, and
replaced by Ord. #08-153, Feb. 2008)
18-805. Scope of responsibility for the city drainage system. The
city drainage system consists of all rivers, creeks, branches, lakes, reservoirs,
ponds, drainage ways, channels, ditches, swales, storm sewers, culverts, inlets,
catch basins, pipes, head walls and other structures, natural or manmade,
within the political boundaries of the City of Alcoa which:
(1) Are located within publicly dedicated streets, rights-of-way, and
easements;
(2) Are subject to publicly dedicated easements, easements-by-use,
rights-of-entry, rights-of-access, rights-of-use, or other permanent provisions of
18-77
adequate access of operation, maintenance, and/or improvement of systems and
facilities; or
(3) Are located on public lands to which the city has adequate access
for operations, maintenance, and/or improvement of systems and facilities.
Operation and maintenance of stormwater systems and facilities which
are located on private property or public property not owned by the City of Alcoa
and for which there has been no public dedication of such system and facilities
to the City of Alcoa for operation and maintenance, and/or improvements or the
system and facilities shall be and remain the legal responsibility of the property
owner, or its occupant, except as that responsibility may be otherwise affected
by the laws of the State of Tennessee and the United States of America. (as
added by Ord. #04-042, Nov. 2004, deleted by Ord. #08-154, Feb. 2008, and
replaced by Ord. #08-153, Feb. 2008)
18-806. Funding of stormwater utility. Funding of the stormwater
utility's activities may include, but not necessarily limited to, the following:
(1) Stormwater utility fees.
(2) Civil penalties and damage assessments imposed for or arising
from the violation of the city's stormwater management ordinance(s),
regulations, etc. as may be adopted and amended from time to time.
(3) Stormwater permit and inspection fees.
(4) Other funds or revenue obtained from federal, state, local, and
private grants, or revolving funds, and from revenue derived from the issuance
of debt obligations of the city or the stormwater utility pursuant to the Local
Government Public Obligations Act of 1986 (Tennessee Code Annotated, title 9,
chapter 21, as amended, or any other lawful source of revenue).
To the extent that the stormwater drainage fees collected are insufficient
to construct, operate, and maintain needed stormwater drainage facilities and
to comply with the requirements of this and other related ordinances,
regulations, etc., the cost of the same may be paid from such city funds as may
be approved by the Alcoa Board of Commissioners. (as added by Ord. #04-042,
Nov. 2004, deleted by Ord. #08-154, Feb. 2008, and replaced by Ord. #08-153,
Feb. 2008)
18-807. Stormwater fund. All revenues generated by or on behalf of
the stormwater utility shall be deposited in a stormwater utility fund and used
exclusively by the city for the stormwater utility. (as added by Ord. #04-042,
Nov. 2004, deleted by Ord. #08-154, Feb. 2008, and replaced by Ord. #08-153,
Feb. 2008)
18-808. Operating budget. The Alcoa Board of Commissioners shall
adopt an operating budget for the stormwater utility each fiscal year. The
operating budget shall set forth for such fiscal year the estimated revenues and
the estimated costs for operations and maintenance, extension and replacement
18-78
and debt service. (as added by Ord. #04-042, Nov. 2004, deleted by
Ord. #08-154, Feb. 2008, and replaced by Ord. #08-153, Feb. 2008)
18-809. Determinations and modification of stormwater utility
fees. Stormwater utility fees may be adopted and modified by resolution from
time to time by the Board of Commissioners of the City of Alcoa so that the total
revenue generated by said charges, in addition to all other revenue of the
stormwater utility, will be sufficient and any other sources of revenue that may
be made available to the stormwater utility will be sufficient to meet the cost of
services and facilities, including but not limited to:
(1) The payment of principal and interest on debt obligations of the
stormwater utility.
(2) Other expenses reasonably necessary or convenient in the
acquisition, construction, operation, maintenance, and regulation of the
stormwater system and of properties affecting the stormwater system.
Graduated stormwater utility fees shall be based on actual or estimated
use of the storm water and/or flood control facilities of the municipality and
stormwater utility. Each user or user class shall be required to pay its
proportionate share of the construction, administration, operation and
maintenance, including replacement costs, of such facilities based on the user's
actual or estimated proportionate contribution to the total storm water runoff
from all users or user classes.
To ensure a proportionate distribution of all costs to each user or user
class, the user's contribution shall be based on factors such as, but not
necessarily limited to, the amount of impervious area utilized by the user, the
water quality of user's storm water runoff, the volume, rate and/or velocity of
storm water runoff.
The use of any particular characteristic as a utility fee rate parameter
shall not preclude the use of other parameters, or of grouping of properties
having similar characteristics through the use of ranges or rounding up or down
to a consistent numerical interval, or the use of flat-rate charges for one (1) or
more classes of similarly-situated properties whose impact on the stormwater
utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and facilities are
relatively consistent. Stormwater utility fees may also include special charges
to individual customers for services or facilities related to stormwater
management, including but not limited to fees for plan review of development,
inspection of development projects and on-site stormwater control systems, and
enhanced levels of stormwater services above those normally provided by the
city. The purpose of classifications of properties through this process shall be to
establish and maintain fees, rates, and charges which are based upon objective
characteristics of the affected properties, and are levied and applied throughout
the stormwater utility so as to assess properties in a manner consistent with
other similarly situated properties. (as added by Ord. #04-042, Nov. 2004,
deleted by Ord. #08-154, Feb. 2008, and replaced by Ord. #08-153, Feb. 2008)
18-79
18-810. Effective date of stormwater utility fees. Stormwater utility
fees shall accrue beginning with the adoption of and as indicated in the first
schedule of fees by the Board of Commissioners of the City of Alcoa and shall be
billed periodically thereafter to customers except as specific exemptions and
adjustments may apply. Fees shall be due, delinquent charges applied, and/or
utility service terminated as specified in said fee schedule or as otherwise
specified by applicable city ordinances and/or regulations. (as added by
Ord. #08-153, Feb. 2008)
18-811. Alcoa Stormwater Utility Manual. The city manager or his
designee shall prepare an Alcoa stormwater utility manual containing the
Equivalent Residential Unit schedule (ERU), utility fee credits criteria and a
separate rate schedule for approval by the board of commissioners. Said manual
and rates shall be subject to review and adoption by resolution of the board of
commissioners and may be revised, amended or otherwise changed from time
to time by resolution. Copies of said manuals and rates shall be available at the
office of the Alcoa City Recorder. (as added by Ord. #08-153, Feb. 2008)
18-812. Stormwater utility fee rates. In order to fully recover the cost
of providing stormwater services and facilities while fairly and reasonably
apportioning the cost among developed properties throughout the city, the
following stormwater rates shall apply.
(1) Detached dwelling units. Detached dwelling units shall be charged
based upon one (1) Equivalent Residential Unit (ERU), or multiplied thereof, as
specified in the Alcoa Stormwater Utility Manual.
(2) Other developed lands. All developed lands not classified as
detached dwelling units shall be billed for one (1) ERU, or multiplier thereof, as
specified in the Alcoa Stormwater Utility Manual.
(3) Multiple dwelling unit residential properties. Multiple dwelling
unit residential properties where individual residential units are owned or
occupied independently, such as residential condominiums or apartments, may
be treated as detached dwelling unit properties in the application of the
stormwater utility fee.
(4) Exempt properties. There shall be no utility fee for exempt
property. (as added by Ord. #08-153, Feb. 2008)
18-813. Exemptions and credits applicable to stormwater utility
fees. Except as provided in this section, no public or private property shall be
exempt from stormwater utility fees or receive a credit or offset against such
service charges. No exemption, credit, offset, or other reduction in stormwater
utility fees shall be granted based on the age, tax, or economic status, race, or
religion of the customer, or other condition unrelated to the stormwater utility's
cost of providing stormwater services and facilities.
18-80
(1) The following exemptions from stormwater utility fees shall be
allowed:
(a) Undeveloped land (less than five hundred (500) square feet
of impervious area) as defined in this chapter shall be exempt from
stormwater utility fees;
(b) Railroad tracks shall be exempt from stormwater utility
fees. However, railroad stations, maintenance buildings, or other
developed land used for railroad purposes shall not be exempt from
stormwater utility fees.
(c) Improved public road rights-of-way that have been conveyed
to and accepted for maintenance by the City of Alcoa and/or Federal
governments, or any political subdivision thereof and are available for use
in common for vehicular transportation by the general public.
(d) Agricultural property. Any farming practice having a total
impervious area of less than ten percent (10%).
(e) Public parks, greenways, and other public recreational
facilities having a total impervious area of less than fifty percent (50%).
(f) Developed property having stormwater that discharge into
a zero-discharge pond, sinkhole or impounded reservoir of the Tennessee
Valley Authority without traveling through, over, or benefitting from any
portion of the city's stormwater system.
(g) Public airport runways and taxiways shall be exempt from
stormwater utility fees. However, terminals, maintenance buildings,
service roads or other developed land used for airport purposes shall not
be exempt from stormwater utility fees.
(2) Stormwater utility fee credits shall be allowed for the following
activities/occurrences when initiated at the discretion of the City of Alcoa and
in accordance with the Alcoa Stormwater Utility Manual as described in
§ 18-811 or as may be specified in duly adopted fee schedules:
(a) Other developed lands that have, and maintain in proper
working order, on-site stormwater detention and retention systems that
reduce the peak rate of stormwater discharge. Certification and
maintenance criteria shall be set forth in the Alcoa Stormwater Utility
Manual.
(b) Public and private schools and school systems located in the
City of Alcoa that teach approved stormwater conservation curricula.
This credit will be allowed when that portion of the city's NPDES phase
II permitted education program is in place.
(c) Other developed lands that have, and maintain in proper
working order, on-site stormwater best management practices that
reduce the impact of stormwater runoff on water quality in accordance
with water quality standards set forth in the Alcoa Stormwater Utility
Manual.

(d) Other developed lands that have, and maintain, a Tennessee
multi-sector general permit for industrial activities.
(e) Other developed lands that have, and maintain, a national
pollutant discharge elimination system industrial stormwater discharges
associated with industrial activity permit.
(f) Other developed lands that have a direct stormwater
discharge that is generated on the property immediately adjacent to a
stream and flows directly to the waterbody in accordance with criteria
set forth in the Alcoa Stormwater Utility Manual.
(3) The Alcoa Stormwater Utility Manual shall specify the design and
performance standards of on-site systems, facilities, activities, and services
which qualify for application of a fee credit, and how such credits shall be
calculated.
(4) The stormwater utility fee credit shall be determined based on the
technical requirements and standards contained in the Alcoa Stormwater Utility
Manual. The stormwater utility fee credit shall be proportional to the extent
that on-site systems, facilities, services, and activities provided, operated, and
maintained by the property owner reduce or mitigate the stormwater utility's
cost of providing services and facilities.
(5) Groups of detached dwelling units represented by a homeowner's
association providing on-site systems or facilities that reduce or mitigate the
stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and
facilities may receive a stormwater utility fee credit. The stormwater utility fee
credit shall be determined based on the technical requirements and standards
contained in the Alcoa Stormwater Utility Manual. The stormwater utility fee
credit available to groups of detached dwelling units shall be proportional to the
extent that on-site systems and facilities provided, operated, and maintained by
the homeowners association reduce or mitigate the stormwater utility's cost of
providing services and facilities.
(6) Any credit allowed against the stormwater utility fee is conditioned
on continuing compliance with the city's design and performance standards as
stated in Alcoa Stormwater Utility Manual and/or upon continuing provision of
the systems, facilities, services, and activities provided, operated, and
maintained by the property owner or owners upon which the credit is based. A
credit may be revoked by the city at any time for non-compliance. A thirty (30)
days notice of a non-complying condition and intent to revoke a stormwater
utility fee credit shall be provided to the stormwater utility customer receiving
a credit before the credit is revoked thereby allowing the customer the
opportunity to attain compliance. (as added by Ord. #08-153, Feb. 2008, as
amended by Ord. #08-181, Oct. 2008)
18-814. Stormwater utility fee billing, delinquencies, and
collections. A stormwater utility fee bill may be sent through the United
States mail or by alternative means, notifying all customers of the amount of the
18-82
bill, the date the payment is due, and the date when past due. Failure to receive
a bill is not justification for non-payment. Regardless of the status of the party
to whom the bill is initially directed, the owner of each parcel of developed land
shall be ultimately obligated to pay the stormwater utility fee. If a customer is
under billed or if no bill is sent for developed land, the city may backbill for a
period of up to the maximum allowed by state statute, but in such cases shall
not assess penalties for any delinquency. A late charge will be based upon the
unpaid balance in accordance with the applicable utility service policies of the
City of Alcoa. (as added by Ord. #08-153, Feb. 2008)
18-815. Application of utility fees billed in common. The
stormwater utility fee shall be billed and collected along with other city utility
services. Any payment of utility fees billed in common shall be applied to the
customer's bill as established through the prevailing policies and ordinances of
the City of Alcoa. (as added by Ord. #08-153, Feb. 2008)
18-816. Removal or cessation of utility services. The City of Alcoa
may remove or cease to provide any utility service(s) as it determines necessary
to enforce the payment of any/all city utility fees including the stormwater
utility fee. (as added by Ord. #08-153, Feb. 2008)
18-817. Alcoa Stormwater Board of Appeals. 1. Creation. An Alcoa
Stormwater Board of Appeals (ASBA) is hereby established, consisting of three

20-504. False alarms. (1) Whenever an alarm is activated in the city,
thereby requiring an emergency response to the location by police and/or fire
personnel, a police and/or fire supervisor shall determine whether the
emergency response was in fact required as indicated by the alarm system or
whether in some way the alarm system malfunctioned and thereby activated a
false alarm.
(2) If the police or fire supervisor, determines the alarm to be false and
no emergency seems necessary, then said supervisor shall submit a report of the
false alarm to the respective chief. A written notification of emergency response
and determination of the response shall be mailed or delivered to the alarm user

20-701. Definition.
20-702. Purpose.
20-703. Standards.
20-704. Safety.

20-701. Definition. Roadside memorial marker means any of the
various kinds of tributes, typically ornamental, placed alongside the roadway to
memorialize people who have died as a result of vehicular accidents. For the
purpose of this code, temporary memorial markers include, but are not limited
to, the various types of decorations, flags, flowers (cut and artificial) and other
lightweight objects or ornamentation commonly used at funerals or at
gravesides as a tribute to the dead. (as added by Ord. #07-122, April 2007)
20-702. Purpose. To establish regulations in allowing the placement of
temporary (not to be displayed more than thirty (30) days from the date of the
incident) roadside memorial markers within the public rights-of-way, located
within the City of Alcoa corporate limits. Currently, there are no defined
regulations regarding roadside memorials. To avoid potential traffic hazards
and problems within public rights-of-way, and to allow mourning families and
friends their time to grieve, these regulations have been established. (as added
by Ord. #07-122, April 2007)
20-703. Standards. Temporary roadside memorial markers are allowed
as follows:
(1) Displays are limited to thirty (30) days from the date of the
incident;
(2) Displays shall be constructed of materials that, if struck, do not
cause a hazard to the motoring public, bystanders, etc. (examples, no wooden
component greater than two by two nominal size, easily collapsible if struck,
etc.);
(3) Placed within the public right-of-way, as far from the travel lanes
as reasonably possible (as near the right-of-way line as practical) and not on
private property unless express permission is granted by property owners;
(4) Placed so that they are clear of ditches, culvert pipes, bridges and
other road features that require access for maintenance;
(5) Displays are not allowed within the median of a divided
highway/road, on any bridge, attached to trees, fences, signs, signals, utility
poles, etc.;
20-14
(6) Displays must be behind the guardrail, if one is present, or with
approval by city engineering, tied to a guardrail post with lightweight string,
wire or tape and must be easily removable for maintenance purposes;
(7) Displays shall not be a hazard to the motoring public in any way,
including but not limited to, obstructing the vision of motorists traveling along
and/or entering the roadway, having any light reflecting materials or
illumination by any means, or interfering with or obscuring any traffic control
device. Displays that violate any of these standards may be removed by the City
of Alcoa. Said displays will be stored for seven (7) days and, if not claimed said
memorials will be disposed. (as added by Ord. #07-122, April 2007)
20-704. Safety. Persons placing roadside memorial markers are
responsible for doing so by acting in a safe manner, including parking
completely clear of the travel lanes. The memorial may need to be placed near
the accident location, rather than exactly at the accident location, in order to
avoid endangering the persons placing or maintaining the memorial and to
avoid endangering the motoring public. (as added by Ord. #07-122, April 2007)
20-705. Removal of roadside memorial markers. Roadside memorial
markers must be removed thirty (30) days following the date of the incident.
Should the same not be removed in a timely manner, they will removed by city
staff and stored for seven (7) days. If not claimed, they will then be disposed of.
The city engineer has the authority to direct or cause the removal of any such
marker, without notice, within a public right-of-way upon determining that
removal is necessary for construction, maintenance, safety or other purpose,
following the same procedure stated above. (as added by Ord. #07-122, April

Example: To find the LUI number for a development contemplating living units of approximately
1200 sq. ft. and a desired density of 6 living units per gross acre, follow the horizon
line from 1200 to its intersection with the vertical line below 6, to determine a LUI of 3.8.
For combinations of living unit size and number per acre not shown on tables for Detached
Dwellings, or Apartments/Townhouses/Condominiums Land Use Intensity Numbers, LUI
numbers can be calculated as described under Land Use Intensity Number. Allowance for
common space can be calculated as described under Adjusted Floor Area for Low Apartments/
Townhouses/Condominiums or Adjusted Floor Area for High Apartments/Townhouses
/Condominiums. If exact figures for percentage of common space are available they can be
substituted for the 11% or 20% averages shown here.

(2) Definitions and Formulas
a. Building Area (BA). Building area is the total land covered by residential
buildings, measured horizontally from the faces of the exterior walls (or the exterior
lines of omitted walls) at main grade level. Entrance platforms, steps and terraces
are not countable as building area.
b. Floor Area (FA) and Floor Area Ratio (FAR). Floor area is the total
floor area for residential use on all floors of a building or buildings, measured from
the outside faces of the exterior walls, including halls, lobbies, stairways, elevator
shafts, enclosed porches, balconies and below grade floor areas used for habitation
and residential access.
c. Not Countable. (a) Open terrace, patio, atrium or balcony; (b) carport,
garage, breezeway or tool shed; (c) special purpose areas for the common use
of all the occupants, such as a recreation room or social hall; (d) staff space for
therapy or examination in care housing; (e) basement spaces not used for living accommodations,
or (f) any commercial or other non-residential space.
The floor area ratio (FAR) times the land area (LA) equals the maximum
amount of floor area (FA) acceptable for the development of a property. FAR x LA =
FA, or FA + LA = FAR.
d. Open Space (OS) and Open Space Ratio (OSR). Open space is the
sum of the uncovered open space and one half (1/2) of the covered open space.
Uncovered Open Space  The horizontal area of the site not covered by building
area (BA), plus open exterior balconies and roof area improved as recreation
space (RS).
Covered Open Space (COS)  The usable open space that is closed to the sky,
having two clear unobstructed open or partially opened sides (minimum 50 percent
open). The square foot amount countable as covered open space may not exceed
the square foot amount of the open sides. Examples: covered balconies, covered
portions of improved roof area or spaces under buildings supported by posts, columns
or cantilevers.
The open space ratio (OSR) times the land area (LA) equals the minimum
amount of open space acceptable for the development of a property. OSR x LA =
OS, or OS ÷ LA = OSR.
e. Livability Space (LS) and Livability Space Ratio (LSR). Livability space
is nonvehicular open space, including lawns, planting space, walks, and paved terraces
and sitting areas and the unpaved portions of street rights-of-way. No paved
areas for car traffic or parking can be included as livability space.
14-2.18
Rev. 10/27/04
The livability space ratio (LSR) times the land area (LA) equals the minimum
amount of livability space acceptable for the development of a property. LSR x LA =
LS, or LS ÷ LA = LSR.
f. Recreation Space (RS) and Recreation Space Ratio (RSR). Recreation
space is public or private exterior area improved for recreation of all residents.
Countable recreation space should be a minimum of 20 ft. from any residential wall
containing a window on the ground floor.
The recreation space ratio (RSR) times the land area (LA) equals the minimum
amount of recreation space acceptable for the development of a property. RSR
x LA = RS, or RS ÷ LA = RSR.
g. Occupant Car Space (OCS) and Occupant Car Ratio (OCR). Occupant
car space is garage, carport or other parking space available to the residents without
time limits.
The occupant car ratio (OCR) times the number of living units (LU) equals the
minimum number of car parking spaces (CPS) for residents in the development of a
property. OCR x LU = CPS, or CPS ÷ LU = OCR.
h. Total Car Space (TCS) and Total Car Ratio (TCR). Total car space is
occupant car space plus other parking space that is available for unlimited or seldom
limited time periods (primarily for guests).
The total car ratio (TCR) times the number of living units (LU) equals the
minimum number of car parking spaces acceptable for a development including
space for guest cars. TCR x LU = TCS, or TCS ÷ LU = TCR.
i. Reduced Site Area for Steep Slopes. For non-elevator building on sites
with 10 percent or more of their original area containing existing slopes of 20 percent
or more, the land area for LUI assignment considerations shall be reduced 1
percent for each total percentage point of average slope within the steep-sloped portion
of the site area.
Total site area 45,000 sq. ft.
Area of average 30% slope 26,250 sq. ft.
30% x 26,250 sq. ft. 7,875 sq. ft.
Less than 20% slop (PICTURE)
Average 30% slope
Total site area for LUI assignment
45,000 sq. ft.  7,875 sq. ft. = 37,125 sq. ft.
EXAMPLE, STEEP SITE LAND AREA REDUCTION FOR LUI ASSIGNMENT
j. Maximum Number of Living Units for a Project. To find the maximum
number of living units for a project in compliance with the LUI standards, multiply
the acceptable number of living units per acre used in identifying the LUI number by
the size of the project or land area.
Example: 6 LU per acre x 60 acres = 360 project LU.
14-2.19
Rev. 10/27/04
k. Minimum Land Area for a Project. To find the minimum amount of
land or gross site area for a project in compliance with the LUI standards, divide the
total number of living units needed for a project by the acceptable number of living
units per acre.
Example: A 160 unit townhouse development is needed for low rent housing,
to average 1200 square feet per living unit at a density of 8 living units per acre.
The land use intensity (LUI) number for this living unit density and size is 4.2 (See
the table for Detached Family Dwelling Land Use Intensity Numbers).
160 ÷ 8 = 20 acres needed, in a location where LUI 4.2 would be appropriate.
l. Land Area Range Determination Where Density Is Not Known. To find
the most favorable range of land area which will comply with LUI guidelines when
only the number of units, the floor area and the building type are known find the LUI
range for the building type on the table for Land Use Intensity Ranges for Various
Building Types. Find the related floor area ratios on tables for Detached Single Family
Dwellings or Apartment/Townhouses/Condominiums Land Use Intensity criteria.
To find the most favorable land area range, divide the total proposed residential floor
area by the floor area ratio for the highest and lowest LUI number shown for the
proposed building type on the table for Land Use Intensity Ranges for Various Building
Types.
Example: Proposed 100 each 1200 square feet 2 story townhouse. Problem,
how much land area is needed to comply with LUI standards.
The table for Land Use Intensity Ranges for Various Building Types shows for
2 story townhouses a LUI range of 3.0 to 5.4; the table for Detached Dwelling Land
Use Intensity criteria shows LUI 3.7 = FAR .162 and LUI 4.8 = .348.
Total proposed floor area = 100 LU x 1200 sq. ft. = 120,000 sq. ft.
Minimum site size = 12,000 sq. ft. = 344,828 sq. ft.
or 7.9 acres .348
Maximum site size = 12,000 sq. ft. = 740,740 sq. ft.
or 17.0 acres .162
Site area range needed to comply with LUI standards = 7.9 to 17 acres.
(as added by Ord. No. 773, Sec. 2)

14-2.405. Common Open Space.
(1) Common open space is defined as an area within a development designed and
intended for the use or enjoyment of all residents of the development or for the use and enjoyment
of the public in general.
(2) All land shown on the final plan as common open space must be conveyed
under one of the following options:
a. It may be conveyed to the City if the City agrees to accept the conveyance,
to maintain the common open space and any buildings, structures or improvements
which have been placed on it, but there shall be no requirement that as
a condition of the approval of the planned unit development that the land proposed
to be set aside for common open space be dedicated or made available for public
use.
b. It may be conveyed to trustees or a non-profit corporation provided in
an indenture establishing an association or a non-profit corporation or similar organization
for the maintenance of the common open space. The common open space
must be conveyed to the trustees or non-profit corporation subject to the convenants
to be approved by the Planning Commission which restrict the common open space
to the uses specified on the final plan, and which provide for the maintenance of the
common open space in the manner which assures its continuing use for its intended
purpose. The convenants and restrictions must contain provisions that the owners of
the lots in the planned development unit shall become members of the association or
non-profit corporation and that any attempt to separate the membership in the association
or non-profit corporation with the owner of lots in said planned unit development
shall be null and void. Such organization shall not be dissolved nor shall dispose
of any common open space by sale or otherwise without the approval of the
City.
(3) No common open space may be put to any use not specified in the final plan
unless the final development plan has been amended to permit that use.
(4) The organization owning the common space is hereby authorized to make
reasonable assessments to meet its necessary expenditures for maintaining the common
open space in reasonable order and condition in accordance with the plan. The assessments
shall be made ratably against the properties within the planned unit development that have
a right of enjoyment of the common open space.
(5) An organization established for the ownership and maintenance of common
open space which receives payments from owners of property within the planned unit development
for such maintenance shall:
a. Immediately deposit such payments in a separate trust account maintained
by it with some bank or recognized depository in this state.
b. Keep records of all such payments deposited therein and all disbursements
therefrom.
(6) Any assessment levied upon any property within the planned unit development
shall be a debt of the owner thereof at the time the assessment is made. The amount
of the assessment plus interest, costs including attorney fees and penalties shall be a lien
upon the property assessed when the organization causes to be recorded with the Registers
Office for Blount County, Tennessee, a notice of assessment which shall state:
14-2.22
Rev. 10/27/04
a. The amount of the assessment and interest, costs and penalties;
b. A description of the property against which the same has been assessed;
and
c. The name of the record owner of the property.
Such notice shall be signed by an authorized representative of the organization or as
otherwise agreed. Upon payment or other satisfaction of the assessment and charges, the
organization shall cause to be recorded a further notice stating the satisfaction and the release
of the lien.
(7) If the organization established to own and maintain common open space, or
any successor organization, at any time after the establishment of a planned unit development
fails to maintain the common open space in a reasonable order and condition in accordance
with the plan, the City may serve written notice upon such organization or upon
the owners of the planned unit development, setting forth the manner in which the organization
has failed to maintain the common open space in reasonable condition. Such notice
shall include a demand that such deficiencies of maintenance be cured within 30 days of the
receipt of such notice and shall state the date and place of a hearing thereon, which shall be
within 14 days of the receipt of such notice.
(8) At such hearing the City may modify the terms of the original notice as to the
deficiencies and may give an extension of time within which they shall be cured. If the deficiencies
set forth in the original notice or in the modification thereof, are not cured within
the 30 day period, or any extension thereof, the City, in order to preserve the taxable values
of the properties within the planned unit development and to prevent the common open
space from becoming a public nuisance, may enter upon such common open space and
maintain it for a period of 1 year.
(9) Such entry and maintenance shall not vest in the public any right to use the
common open space except when such right is voluntarily dedicated to the public by the
owners and accepted by the City.
(10) Before the expiration of the period of maintenance set forth above, the City
shall, upon its own initiative or upon the request of the organization previously responsible
for the maintenance of the common open space, call a public hearing upon notice to such
organization or to the owners of the planned unit development to be held by the City. At
this hearing such organization or the residents of the planned unit development shall show
cause why such maintenance by the City shall not, at the election of the City, continue for
succeeding year.
(11) If the City determines that such organization is ready and able to maintain
the common open space in a reasonable condition, the City shall cease its maintenance at
the end of such year.
(12) If the City determines such organization is not ready and able to maintain the
common open space in a reasonable condition, the City may, in its discretion, continue the
maintenance of the common open space during the next succeeding year, subject to a similar
hearing and determination in each year thereafter.
(13) The decision of the City in any such case referred to in this section constitutes
a final administrative decision subject to review in accordance with the provisions of law.
(14) The total cost of such maintenance undertaken by the City shall be assessed
ratably based upon the assessed values for ad valorem tax purposes against the properties
within the planned unit development that have a right of enjoyment of the common open
space and shall become a lien on such properties.
(15) The City, at the time of entering upon such common open space for the purpose
of maintenance, shall file a notice of such lien in the Registers Office for Blount
County, Tennessee, upon the properties affected by such lien within the planned unit development.
Such notice shall state:
a. A description of the property against which lien is impressed.
b. The names of the record owners of the property.
14-2.23
Rev. 10/27/04
(16) Liens of the organization and the City shall be subordinate to all taxes and
special assessments but shall be prior to any other liens and encumbrances recorded subsequent
to the recordation of the notice of assessment. Unless sooner satisfied and released
or its enforcement initiated as herein provided for, the liens shall expire and be of no further
force or effect 2 years from the date of recordation of the notice of assessment.
(17) Such liens may be enforced by the organization, its agent or attorney, or by
the City after failure of the owner to pay such assessment in accordance with its terms by
attachment levied upon the lot or parcel of ground upon which the lien exists in any court
with equity jurisdiction in Blount County, Tennessee. Any land so attached may be sold in
said attachment proceedings in bar of the equity of redemption and all other rights, legal or
equitable, belonging to the owners of such land. The organization, if it is a corporation, cooperative
association, partnership or natural person, and the City may bid in the property at
foreclosure sale and hold, lease, mortgage and convey it. (as added by Ord. No. 773, Sec.
2)
14-2.406. Procedure After Approval. Upon receiving the approval of the Planning
Commission the owner or proponent of the proposed planned development shall record
the approved plan in the office of the Registrar of Blount County. No building permit for
building construction or site preparation shall be issued for development in C-1 District until

2018)
14-2.1106. Approval of uses on review.
(1) In reviewing other similar commercial, or supporting quasi-commercial uses,
including reviews for added building height and increased residential density determinations,
which may be considered under certain provisions of the district, the Planning Commission,
in the exercise of its powers, shall be guided by adopted plans and policies, including but
not limited to, the Alcoa Land Use Plan and other land use or long range plans, Alcoa Zoning
Ordinance, Alcoa Municipal Code, and the following general standards:

approval of the hydrology, engineering, building codes, landscaping/buffering, signage,
etc.; and,
g. The use or determination will meet all requirements set out in the district.
(2) The Planning Commission may approve other similar commercial, or supporting
quasi-commercial uses, including increased building heights and residential densities,
when applicable, where it can be shown that the use or determination has been guided by
the general standards referenced above and is reasonably necessary for the convenience
and welfare of the community. The Planning Commission may deny uses not considered in
the totality of the circumstances to be consistent with the general standards above, including
increased building heights and residential densities, when or where applicable, or where
it can be shown that approval would have an adverse impact on the character of the district.
Whereas a use may be appropriate in one location and inappropriate in another location in
the district, the Planning Commission shall be guided by the adopted plans and policies referenced
above. The Planning Commission shall state conditions of approval or denial, including
substantive, factual statements of necessity and appropriateness or of adverse impact,
with such information being included in the minutes of the Planning Commission.
(3) In the exercise of its approval, the Planning Commission may impose such
conditions regarding the location, character, or other features of the use of buildings, including
the same for increased building heights and residential densities, as it may deem
advisable in the furtherance of the general purposes of this ordinance. (as added by Ord.
No. 773, Sec. 3, as rewritten by Ord. #18-444, June 2018)
14-2.1107. Maintenance of common open space.
(1) Maintenance of common open space, to include stormwater management
facilities NOT calculated to satisfy minimum open space requirements, is defined
as an area within a development designed and intended for the use of all owners
or tenants of the development or for the use of the public in general.
(2) All land area shown on the detailed development plan(s) as common
open space shall be conveyed under one (1) of the options below, as part of a final
plat recording:
a. It may be conveyed to the City if the City agrees to accept the conveyance,
to maintain the common open space and any buildings, structures or improvements
which have been placed on it, but there shall be no requirement that as
a condition of the approval of the detailed development plan(s) that the land proposed
to be set aside for common open space be dedicated or made available for
public use; or,
b. It may be conveyed to trustees or a non-profit corporation provided in
an indenture establishing an association or a non-profit corporation or similar organization
for the maintenance of the common open space. The common open space
must be conveyed to the trustees or non-profit corporation subject to the covenants
to be approved by the Planning Commission which restrict the common open space
to the uses specified on the detailed development plan(s) (to include the final plat),
and which provide for the maintenance of the common open space in the manner
which assures its continuing use for its intended purpose. The covenants and restrictions
must contain provisions that the owners of the lots in the planned development
shall become members of the association or non-profit corporation and that
any attempt to separate the membership in the association or non-profit corporation
with the owner of lots in said planned development shall be null and void. Such organization
shall not be dissolved nor shall dispose of any common open space by
sale or otherwise without the approval of the Planning Commission.
14-2.50
Rev. 06/13/18
(3) No common open space may be put to any use not specified on the final plat
recorded, unless the detailed development plan(s) has or have been amended to permit
that use. Such may also require a final plat amendment.
(4) The organization owning the common space shall make reasonable assessments
to meet its necessary expenditures for maintaining the common open space in reasonable
order and condition in accordance with the detailed development plan(s) (to include
the final plat). The assessments shall be made ratably against the properties within the
planned development that have a right of enjoyment of the common open space.
(5) An organization established for the ownership and maintenance of common
open space which receives payments from owners of property within the planned development
for such maintenance shall:
a. Immediately deposit such payments in a separate trust account maintained
by it with some bank or recognized depository in this state; and,
b. Keep records of all such payments deposited therein and all disbursements
therefrom.
(6) Any assessment levied upon any property within the planned development
shall be a debt of the owner thereof at the time the assessment is made.
The amount of the assessment plus interest, costs including attorney fees and penalties
shall be a lien upon the property assessed when the organization causes to be
recorded with the Office of the Blount County Register of Deeds, in the State of Tennessee,
a notice of assessment which shall state:
a. The amount of the assessment and interest, costs and penalties;
b. A description of the property against which the same has been
assessed; and,
c. The name of the record owner of the property.
Such notice shall be signed by an authorized representative of the organization
or as otherwise agreed. Upon payment or other satisfaction of the
assessment and charges, the organization shall cause to be recorded a further
notice stating the satisfaction and the release of the lien.
(7) If the organization established to own and maintain common open space, or
any successor organization, at any time after the establishment of a planned development
fails to maintain the common open space in a reasonable order and condition in accordance
with the detailed development plan(s) (to include the final plat), the City may serve written
notice upon such organization or upon the owners of the planned development, setting forth
the manner in which the organization has failed to maintain the common open space in reasonable
condition. Such notice shall include a demand that such deficiencies of maintenance
be cured within 30 days of the receipt of such notice and shall state the date and place of a
hearing thereon, which shall be within 14 days of the receipt of such notice.
(8) At such hearing the City may modify the terms of the original notice as to the
deficiencies and may give an extension of time within which they shall be cured. If the deficiencies
set forth in the original notice or in the modification thereof, are not cured within
the 30 day period, or any extension thereof, the City, in order to preserve the taxable values
of the properties within the planned development and to prevent the common open
space from becoming a public nuisance, may enter upon such common open space and
maintain it for a period of one (1) year.
(9) Such entry and maintenance shall not vest in the public any right to use the
common open space except when such right is voluntarily dedicated to the public by the
owners and accepted by the City.
(10) Before the expiration of the period of maintenance set forth above, the City
shall, upon its own initiative or upon the request of the organization previously responsible
for the maintenance of the common open space, call a public hearing upon notice to such
organization and to the owners of the planned development to be held by the City. At this
14-2.51
Rev. 06/13/18
hearing such organization or the residents of the planned development shall show the cause
why such maintenance by the City shall not, at the election of the City, continue for succeeding
year.
(11) If the City determines that such organization is ready and able to maintain
the common open space in a reasonable condition, the City shall cease its maintenance at
the end of such year.
(12) If the City determines such organization is not ready and able to maintain the
common open space in a reasonable condition, the City may, in its discretion, continue the
maintenance of the common open space during the next succeeding year, subject to a similar
hearing and determination in each year thereafter.
(13) The decision of the City in any such case referred to in this section constitutes
a final administrative decision subject to review in accordance with the provisions of law.
(14) The total cost of such maintenance undertaken by the City shall be assessed
ratably based upon the assessed values for ad valorem tax purposes against the properties
within the planned development that have a right of enjoyment of the common open space
and shall become a lien on such properties.
(15) The City, at the time of entering upon such common open space for the purpose
of maintenance, shall file a notice of such lien in the Office of the Blount County Register
of Deeds, in the State of Tennessee, upon the properties affected by such lien within the
planned development. Such notice shall state:
a. A description of the property against which lien is impressed; and,
b. The names of the record owners of the property.
(16) Liens of the organization and the City shall be subordinate to all taxes and
special assessments but shall be prior to any other liens and encumbrances recorded subsequent
to the recordation of the notice of assessment. Unless sooner satisfied and released
or its enforcement initiated as herein provided for, the liens shall expire and be of no further
force or effect two (2) years from the date of recordation of the notice of assessment.
(17) Such liens may be enforced by the organization, its agent or attorney, or by
the City after failure of the owner to pay such assessment in accordance with its terms by
attachment levied upon the lot or parcel of ground upon which the lien exists in any court
with equity jurisdiction in Blount County, Tennessee. Any land so attached may be sold in
said attachment proceedings in bar of the equity of redemption and all other rights, legal or
equitable, belonging to the owners of such land. The organization, if it is a corporation, cooperative
association, partnership or natural person, and the City may bid in the property at
foreclosure sale and hold, lease, mortgage and convey it.
(18) The provisions governing common open space under this section shall be in
conformance with current state statutes. (as added by Ord. No. 773, Sec. 3, as rewritten by

**Individual business establishments are limited to a maximum of 5,000 square feet
(per floor) in area. Larger establishments or expansions beyond 5,000 square feet (per
floor) require conditional use approval. (as added by Ord. #10-234, Aug. 2010, as amended
by Ord. #16-378, March 2016)
14-2.1304. Lot area per unit (density). The minimum lot areas apply below, as
follows:
(1) Sites less than one acre. For sites less than [1] acre, the minimum lot area
per dwelling unit shall be [1,500] square feet for mixed use buildings and [2,000] square
feet for all other buildings; and,
(2) Sites one acre or greater. For sites [1] acre or greater, the minimum lot area
per dwelling unit shall be [1,000] square feet for mixed-use buildings and [1,500] square
feet for all other buildings. (as added by Ord. #10-234, Aug. 2010).
14-2.1305. Street frontage. The minimum street frontages (for lot and façade
widths) apply below, as follows:
(1) Attached buildings. The minimum lot and building façade width shall be [20]
feet for attached buildings. Where a break occurs in a consecutive row of attached buildings,
lots shall be of sufficient width to accommodate side yard setback requirements; and,
(2) Detached buildings. The minimum lot width shall be [50] feet for detached
buildings. The minimum building façade width shall be [30] feet, unless otherwise approved
by the planning commission and where all of the following are met:
a. Lots are less than [64] feet in width.
b. Lots have not been provided access from an alleyway.
c. Sufficient driveway access, width and internal vehicular circulation are
determined to be limiting factors.
d. A minimum façade width of [26] feet is maintained. (as added by Ord.
#10-234, Aug. 2010, as amended by Ord. #17-418, August 2017 and Ord. #18-436,
January 2018)
14-2.1306. Setbacks. The minimum and maximum front yard building setbacks
apply, as follows:
(1) Front yard. A minimum front yard building setback of [10] feet is required.
The maximum may not exceed the average depth of the nearest two lots having a building
on either side of the subject lot or [12] feet, whichever is less. The following exceptions to
the front yard building setback apply:
a. Articulated façade or building entrance feature. A portion of the building
may be set back from the maximum setback line in order to provide an articulated
façade or accommodate a building entrance feature, provided that the total area
of the space created shall not exceed [1] square foot for every linear foot of building
frontage.
b. Outdoor eating, canopies, plantings and related features. The area
between the front lot line and the minimum [10] feet front yard building setback (or
building façade) is to be known as the store front zone. This area is where public
and private interaction occurs. Outdoor eating, canopies, balconies, plantings and
related features may be located within said area. When used for outdoor eating, this
zone may be extended [12] feet from the front lot line. Outdoor eating shall not exceed
[12] times the buildings linear street frontage. Said zone may be extended
further, as long as [40] percent of the building façade remains at a minimum front
yard building setback of [10-12] feet to preserve the continuity of the streetwall. At
14-2.62
Added 08/10/10 (Revised 01/23/18)
street corners or parking drive intersections, pedestrian and vehicular visibility shall
be maintained.
The following diagram, Diagram E-3 (6), provides an example for calculating
additional setback for outdoor eating areas.
c. Multiple frontages. When a property has multiple frontages, no maximum
building setback will be required for those entrances determined (by the planning
commission) to be secondary;
(2) Side yard. No minimum side yard building setbacks are required, except for
when property within this zone abuts property of a different zone, contains detached buildings,
or has a break in a consecutive row of attached buildings. In such cases, a minimum
setback of [10-25] feet shall be required (see Buffer Strip requirement), unless otherwise
approved by the planning commission and where a minimum of [10] feet is maintained between
buildings; and,
(3) Rear yard. A minimum rear yard building setback of [10-25] feet is required
(see Buffer Strip requirement). (as added by Ord. #10-234, Aug. 2010, as amended by
Ord. #17-418, August 2017)
14-2.1307. Site design. The below general site design features apply, as follows:
(1) Concept plan. Conceptual planning is required based on one of the following:
a. Unimproved Acreage. In addition to individual site plans, when developing
unimproved acreage, a conceptual development plan shall be approved by the
planning commission. Such plan shall communicate proposed rights-of-way, lot lay14-
2.63
Added 08/10/10 (Revised 01/23/18)
outs, site templates (i.e., buildings/other structures and surfaced parking), mix type
arrangement (i.e., horizontal and vertical mixed use areas for residential and nonresidential),
architectural styles (i.e., written guidelines and materials and/or elevation
examples), pedestrian circulation and open space amenities (i.e., water bodies,
parks, plazas and walking trails), as well as any other improvements to relay the
conceptual vision of the district. In addition to the above internal features, the concept
plan shall also identify existing/adjacent external features of the same.
b. Infill Development and/or Redevelopment. In addition to individual
site plans, infill development and/or redevelopment shall communicate its context
within the block. If the block contains no principle buildings, the nearest two adjacent
lots having principal buildings shall be included. This may be accomplished by
utilizing aerial photography, along with the identification of building materials and elevations,
to serve as a conceptual plan that shall be approved by the planning commission.
Realizing infill development may be of a contextual nature different (in
terms of scale, setback and density) of that which may be present, communication of
proposed differences and/or similarities (in relation to the existing development)
demonstrates the compact and pedestrian oriented form intended to be accomplished
over time.
(2) Maximum mix of uses. The following applies to the development of undeveloped
acreage and is intended to create a certain level of use mixes, irrespective of whether
those mix of uses are considered horizontal or vertical. No one use shall exceed 80 percent
of the total gross floor area within the established district. Further, vertical mixed use shall
occupy at least 20 percent of the established district.
(3) Mix of uses in phased developments. So that no one type of use is developed
exclusively in the district at any one time, or in successive phases, a mix of approved principal
uses must be granted in each phase.
(4) Blocks. The most important element in the physical and functional integration
of a mixed-use development is pedestrian orientation. Such can only be accomplished by
establishing a well-defined pattern of walkable blocks and intersecting streets, ensuring that
building facades and streetscapes are human-scaled, and pedestrian friendly, and that the
buildings relate appropriately to surrounding development. This in turn will create a heightened
sense of place by the provision of safe, efficient and convenient vehicular access, and
circulation patterns.
a. The minimum length of each block face shall be two hundred [200]
feet.
b. The maximum length of each block face shall be five hundred
[500] feet. A pedestrian pass-through connecting opposite sides of intersecting
blocks, in lieu of vehicular access (or a combination thereof), would
satisfy this requirement.
(5) Off-street and on-street parking. The following requirements apply to vehicular
surface and garage parking that may be accessory or non-accessory, as well as parking
for bicyclist:
a. Number required and design standards. The number of required vehicular
parking spaces, and design standards for such, are regulated under Title 14,
Zoning and Land Use Control, Zoning Ordinance, Sub-Chapter 2.22, Off-Street Vehicle
Parking. Required off-street parking spaces may be reduced, when on-street
parking has been provided (as per approved concept plan) along the lot frontage(s).
The reduction is calculated by substituting [1] off-street parking space for [1] onstreet
parking space. On-street parallel spaces shall be a minimum of [10] feet in
width and [22] feet in depth. For on-street angled parking, spaces shall be a minimum
of [9-1/2] feet in width and [18] feet in depth. The angle degree and adjacent
street width shall be determined per city engineering review and approval. Further
vehicular reductions may also qualify, as outlined within said off-street parking pro14-
2.64
Added 08/10/10 (Revised 01/23/18)
visions. In addition to vehicular parking, bicycle parking shall be required at [1]
space per [5,000] square feet of gross floor area.
b. Location. Accessory off-street surface parking spaces shall be located
to the side or rear of the principle building. Non-accessory (commercial) off-street
surface parking spaces shall be permitted upon conditional approval. The rights-ofway
of any surface parking area shall be screened, which may include buffering a
side (or rear) yard, per the below section, Section 14-2.1307, Site Design, (5) and
(6), Buffering and Landscaping. Non-accessory (commercial) parking garages shall
be permitted upon conditional approval. Access to said garages shall be a part of
that conditional approval, with emphasis to be on lower functional street classification.
All non-accessory parking garages shall be located on upper stories, or below
ground stories, of a building.
c. Driveway access. Curb cuts are not allowed on primary streets. Exceptions
may apply upon conditional approval, as per approved concept plan.
(6) Pedestrian circulation. Pedestrian circulation serves to safely connect pedestrians
and bicyclists to public and private spaces within the built environment, offering
transportation alternatives to be incorporated, as follows:
a. Primary street. The following applies to sidewalks and bicycle lanes
located within the public rights-of-way:
1. On-street parking provided. When on-street parking has been
provided, a public sidewalk shall be required at a minimum width of [15] feet.
Said sidewalk shall be measured starting from the back of curb to allow for
pedestrian access and furnishing (i.e., street lighting, benches, trash receptacles
and tree guards). Street trees (per Section 14-2.1307, Site design, (6),
Landscaping) shall be planted in wells [5] feet by [8] feet. To maintain a
clear passage for pedestrians, a minimum [10] feet walking zone shall remain
free of any obstructions.
2. On-street parking not provided. When on-street parking has
not been provided, a public sidewalk shall be required at a minimum width of
[10] feet. Said sidewalk shall be measured starting [5] feet from the back of
curb to maintain pedestrian separation from the vehicular travel lane and the
planting of street trees. To maintain a clear passage for pedestrians, a minimum
[10] feet walking zone shall remain free of any obstructions.
3. Bicycle lanes. Bicycle lanes shall be provided, along all primary
streets, at a minimum width of [4] feet.
b. Secondary street. The following applies to sidewalks and bicycle lanes
located within the public rights-of-way:
1. On-street parking provided. When on-street parking has been
provided, a public sidewalk shall be required at a minimum width of [10] feet.
Said sidewalk shall be measured starting from the back of curb to allow for
pedestrian access and furnishing (i.e., street lighting, benches, trash receptacles
and tree guards). Street trees (per Section 14-2.1307, Site design, (6),
Landscaping below) shall be planted in wells [5] feet by [8] feet. To maintain
a clear passage for pedestrians, a minimum [5] feet walking zone shall remain
free of any obstructions.
2. On-street parking not provided. When on-street parking has
not been provided, a public sidewalk shall be required at a minimum width of
[5] feet. Said sidewalk shall be measured starting [5] feet from the back of
curb to maintain pedestrian separation from the vehicular travel lane and the
planting of street trees. To maintain a clear passage for pedestrians, a minimum
[5] feet walking zone shall remain free of any obstructions.
3. Bicycle lanes. Bicycle lanes shall be provided, along all secondary
streets, at a minimum width of [4] feet.
14-2.65
Added 08/10/10 (Revised 01/23/18)
c. Store frontage zone and building entrances. The store frontage zone
is where public and private uses meet. Said area is between the front lot line and
the main building entrance of the building façade. A pedestrian connection, from
said main building entrance (and any adjacent parking area), shall be extended to
the public sidewalk at a minimum width of [10] feet for primary streets and [5] feet
for secondary streets. Other side (or rear) building entrances, accessing adjacent
parking, shall also include a pedestrian connection that is a minimum width of [5]
feet.
d. Greenway trails. Public greenway trails may be incorporated into open
space plans and shall be a minimum of [10] feet in trail width. Such trails apply toward
satisfying any required open space, as per Section 14-2.1307, Site design, (4),
Open space.
(7) Open space. For sites greater than [5] acres, a minimum of [10] percent of
the gross land area shall be dedicated to open space areas. Said areas shall provide for
flexibility of use and be incorporated per Article III (General Requirements and Minimum
Standards of Design, D, Community Open Space, Public Use and Service Areas) of the
Standards for Land Subdivision. Per said standards, open space may be used for active
and/or passive recreational use and may include playgrounds, lakes, greenway trails (or
other similar bike and pedestrian paths), recreational club houses, swimming pools, tennis
courts and other similar facilities. Additionally, other such facilities may include gathering
squares, courtyards, plazas, splash pads and rooftop gardens.
(8) Buffer strip. To maintain compatibility with surrounding land uses (as per approved
concept plan), a minimum [25] feet buffer strip may be required when the development
(or redevelopment) abuts residential property of a different zone. Upon said plan approval,
recreational trails may be located within a buffer strip. Detention (or retention) basins,
measured from top-of-slope to top-of-slope, and associated structures shall not be located
within a buffer strip; and,
(9) Landscaping. In addition to meeting all landscaping requirements established
herein, Title 14, Zoning and Land Use Control, Zoning Ordinance, Sub-chapter 2.20, Landscaping
Ordinance, shall apply:
a. Native trees that reach a minimum height of [40] feet at maturity shall
be planted along all primary and secondary streets at a maximum spacing of [40]
feet on center. For streets providing on-street parking, said trees shall be planted in
tree wells no less than [5] feet by [8] feet.
b. Off-street surface parking shall be screened, from public rights-of-way,
by planting native trees that reach a minimum height of [40] feet at maturity and
are spaced at a maximum of [40] feet on center. Said screening shall also include
shrub hedging spaced [12-18] inches on center and maintained at a height of no
more than [4] feet.
c. A combination of native deciduous and evergreen trees that reach a
minimum height of [40] feet at maturity, at a maximum spacing of [25] feet on center,
shall be planted within buffer strips. In addition, large shrubbery clusters (a
minimum of [3] shrubs), at a maximum spacing of [12.5] feet on center, shall be
planted between tree spacing.
d. At street corner or parking drive intersections, pedestrian and vehicular
visibility shall be maintained, as described in Title 14, Zoning and Land Use Control,
Zoning Ordinance, Sub-chapter 2.21, General Provisions, Section 14-2.2104,
Corner Visibility. (as added by Ord. #10-234, Aug. 2010, as amended by Ord. #16-

to mixed use buildings, as follows:
a. Floor-to-floor heights. All ground floor space of a building shall have a
minimum floor to ceiling height of [11] feet.
b. Floor area of ground floor space. All non-residential floor space provided
on the ground floor of a vertical mixed-use building shall contain the following
minimum floor area:
1. At least [800] square feet or [25] percent of the lot area
(whichever is greater) on lots with street frontage of less than [50] feet; or,
2. At least [20] percent of the lot area on lots with [50] feet of
street frontage or more.
(3) Transparency. Providing ground floor windows helps to foster a more pleasing

or structurally damaged trees on private property and when such trees constitute
a potential hazard to life and property within the right-of-way or on public property.
All stumps of public and street trees should be removed below the surface of
the ground by grinding or other methods.
(5) Protection of existing tree cover.
a. Industrial, commercial and residential developments must preserve
existing trees whenever practical. Adequate protection should be given to trees

be determined by measuring along the outside sidewalk line, or where no sidewalk exists, a
line in the street right-of-way line parallel to and four (4) feet from the line of the property.
The maximum allowable grade for any driveway shall be eight (8) percent, unless otherwise
approved by the City Engineer. Where more than one driveway approach on a street front
serves a residential property (i.e., circular drives), the planning commission must approve
the distance between approaches. The sides, edges, or curbs of driveway approaches shall
be at right angles to the street. The radius of curvature of the curb return shall not exceed
the distance between the curb and outside sidewalk line; or, if no sidewalk exists, a line in
the right-of-way parallel to and four (4) feet from the property line. No portion of a driveway
approach, except the curb return, shall be constructed within 18 feet from the point of
intersection of the lines of the two street curb faces extended into the street intersection.
No part of the driveway, including curb returns, shall extend beyond the property line projected.
(2) Access control standards in commercial districts.
a. In all commercial districts the distance between access points to a
public street shall be no less as set forth in the following table:
Classification of Street Distance between
14-2.100

Of Access* Access Points (in ft)
1. Principal Arterial (A-1) 1,000
Classification of Street
Of Access*
Distance between
Access Points (in ft)
2. Minor Arterial (A-2) 600
3. Major Collector (C) 300
4. Local Street (L-1) 200
5. Cul-de-sac (L-2) 200
*Based on the Functional Road Classifications System prepared by the State
Department of Transportation. Where there is a disagreement as to the classification
of the street, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall make the determination.
No access point shall be established to any public street nearer that one-half
(1/2) the above cited respective distances from the nearest point of intersection of
the centerline of public street, measured from centerline of access point along the
edge of the right-of-way of the street intersected to the centerline of the intersecting
street. Paved acceleration and deceleration lanes are required along any Principal
Arterial and may be required along any other public street.
b. In all commercial districts where a lot abuts more than one street
affording opportunity for access, that lot and all uses thereon shall be served from
the street with the lowest classification (No. 1 being the highest classification); however,
alternate or supplemental means of access may be allowed from any street if,
upon approval by the Planning Commission, such an arrangement accords with the
intent of this section.
c. Temporary access ways may be granted by the Planning Commission
at locations other than those specified for permanent access where it is expedient for
the purpose of staged development. Temporary access ways shall cease to exist at
such time that any other means of access to a property occurs.
d. Circulation drives (drives which interconnect all lot access points with
all vehicle parking, loading, servicing and like areas and structures) or frontage
roads (roads which parallel the public streets giving access and which extend along
the entire frontage of a particular property) shall be constructed in order to provide
safe and efficient vehicular movement between specified access points. All commercial
development which occurs adjacent to a principal arterial highway, shall be required
to provide a frontage road. The location, width, and design of all circulation
drives and frontage roads shall be approved by the City Engineer. All frontage roads
shall be dedicated as public streets and shall be maintained by the public.
e. Between the public street giving access to the property and the circulation
drives or frontage roads, an area of land not less than five (5) feet deep shall
be provided; however, in case where sidewalks are required by the Citys sidewalk
plan and policies, an area of land of not less than ten (10) feet shall be provided.
Such an area shall be landscaped and grassed provided, however; that no planting
shall interfere with corner visibility at intersections as described in Section 14-
2.1804. All circulation drives shall be clearly defined and marked appropriately with
14-2.101
Rev. 05/11/16
arrows and the like to assist public circulation into, on, and out of the property and
through parking lot areas.
f. Where, in the opinion of the Planning Commission, topographical or
other physical features make the construction of circulation drives and/or frontage
roads infeasible, the Planning Commission may determine the number and width of
access points to a particular property in accordance with the following table:
Lot Frontage Maximum Number
of Access Points
Maximum Width of
Access Points
Less than 75 ft. 1 30 ft.
75 ft.  149 ft. 1a 30 ft. a
150 ft.  299 ft. 2 30 ft.
Each additional 300 ft. 1b 30 ft.
(a.) Gasoline service stations may have 2 access points.
(b.) Or as determined by the Planning Commission.
g. A building permit for any property in a commercial district shall not be
issued until the Planning Commission for the City has reviewed and approved all
plans and specifications for proposed access points. Said plans and specifications
shall include site plans, construction plans, and elevations drawn to a scale of not
less than one (1) inch equals fifty (50) feet, showing proposed access points, drives,
walks, circulation, parking spaces, loading facilities, landscaping, planting materials,
structures, buildings, uses, heights, setbacks, and any additional information required
by the City. Such plans shall conform to the City Plan for access and traffic
control. No regular certificate of occupancy shall be issued for any use or activity
within a commercial district until all access control provisions, as outlined in this section,
have been met. (Ord. No. 338, Sec.13, as amended by Ord. No. 365, Sec. 2,
and Ord. No. 643)
14-2.2109. Sidewalks and other pedestrian facilities. To promote alternative
modes of transportation and contribute to a safe, healthy and viable city environment, pedestrian
access shall be provided to and from all lots developed for both non-residential and
residential multi-family uses. Provisions are as follows:
(1) Sidewalks: Where new construction or the redevelopment of a site necessitates
a site plan review by the Planning Commission, sidewalks shall be constructed within
the right-of way of all public street frontages where pedestrian traffic is permissible, except
as follows:
a. In instances where the construction of sidewalks is inappropriate or
otherwise unfeasible at the time of development or redevelopment, as determined by
the Planning Commission, a contribution to the City sidewalk fund in an amount
equivalent to the cost of sidewalk construction shall be required; and,
b. In instances where the development is adjacent to an existing greenway
or has the potential for a connection to an existing or planned greenway, the
Planning Commission at their discretion may require the construction of a greenway
or other appropriate pedestrian facility on either right-ofway or easement granted
to the City in lieu of sidewalk construction.
14-2.102
Rev. 05/11/16
Sidewalks shall be a minimum of five-5 feet in width, designed in conformity to city
specifications, and meet ADA standards for accessible design. When subdividing, Standards
for Land Subdivision shall apply.
(2) Pedestrian circulation: Where new construction or the redevelopment of a
site necessitates a site plan review by the Planning Commission, and a public/private sidewalk
or similar type of pedestrian path is present or planned to be constructed, connectivity
between main building entrances, parking areas and public/private sidewalks shall be provided.
Connections shall be incorporated onto a site, as follows:
a. A minimum of one (1) connection shall be provided. An additional
connection shall be provided for every 400 linear feet of property frontage, unless
otherwise approved by the Planning Commission;
b. Multiple connections shall be placed to maximize pedestrian movement,
as determined necessary by the Planning Commission, and shall include consideration
for parking areas otherwise secondary to connectivity between main building
entrances and public/private sidewalks; and,
c. Connections shall be clear for pedestrian traffic, which may be elevated
above the existing parking grade (when site conditions allow), and include pedestrian
crosswalks if traversing travel lanes.
Connections shall be a minimum of five (5) feet in width, designed in conformity to
city specifications, and meet ADA standards for accessible design. Although the above paragraphs
specifically address single lot development, to comply with community open space,
public use, and service areas, subdivision design within all zoning districts shall incorporate
pedestrian connections to present or planned adjacent public/private sidewalks or similar
type of pedestrian paths (see Standards for Land Subdivision). (Added by Ord. #06-
102, as amended by Ord. #14-342, Dec. 2014 and Ord. #16-381, May 2016)
14-2.2110. Exterior building design. To promote the health, safety and wellbeing
of Citys residents, these provisions are intended to direct development patterns that
create attractive, permanent building improvements that are harmonious in appearance,
enhancing the communitys character through high quality urban design, to further the likelihood
that such improvements continue to be long term community assets.
Before a building permit may be issued, the planning commission (designated as the
design review commission), shall review and either approve or disapprove exterior building
elevations in compliance with minimum standards. These standards apply to the design of
principal buildings and accessory structures constructed for all uses except for single-family
detached, including any entrances to developments of the same, where said buildings are
visible from a public roadway. While the overall intent of these standards shall be maintained,
flexibility in their application will be necessary to facilitate and ensure development
appropriately responds to changing market trends. All uses permitted within industrial or
mixed industrial zones are exempt, as well as those for the principle purpose of conducting
agricultural and livestock activities. For uses within zones otherwise not exempt, the below
criteria shall be met:
(1) Wall planes shall be staggered by occasional changes in surface planes or
changes of materials or architectural accents to reduce a monolithic box appearance.
Walls and roof planes shall be proportionally scaled to have a 12 to 36 inch projection or
recess every 30 to 60 feet, at a minimum, both horizontally and vertically. Flat roofs shall
have projecting parapet walls constructed at a sufficient height to properly screen mechanical
equipment. To reduce the repetitive use of architectural accents and broader features,
three (3) or more of following shall be integrated onto walls:
a. porches and columns;
b. sun-shading devices (awnings, canopies and/or trellises, with a
minimum ground clearance of eight (8) feet);
14-2.103
Rev. 05/11/16
c. cornices and moldings;
d. wall arches;
e. wall and structural columns and/or pilasters;
f. enhanced entry doorways, projected or recessed;
g. enhanced window treatments;
h. distinct textural changes in construction materials (integrating a
combination of brick, stone, cast stone, stucco and wood or wood substitute are
preferred); and,
i. any other similar decorative accent or broader feature that may be reviewed
for consideration.
(2) The glass area of all exterior windows shall be calculated to total a minimum
of five percent (5%) of the total wall area visible from a public roadway.
(3) Designers shall incorporate notable architecture accents and broader features
in their overall building design, providing for compatibility with surrounding structures and
thematic expression. Visual cues may include the combined use of brick, cornicing and arch
work found in many of the Citys past and present institutional buildings, which nod subtly
to the historical role of Alcoa, Inc. Stacked stone, trellises, tapered columns and other rustic
accents found in public spaces of Pellissippi Place are other visual cues to consider. A
few prominent examples have been included below (see figures 3A-3D).
Exterior walls visible from a public roadway shall not be comprised of exposed metal
or flat-faced concrete block. However, metal accents or broader features of the same may
be considered. Note that changes in paint color, color bands, flat tiles, narrow trim accents
(less than 12 inches) and shutters shall not be considered architectural accents or broader
features.

14-2.2111. Exterior lighting. To reduce the production of light pollution that
may encroach onto adjacent properties, pole lighting and other related fixtures shall be designed
to project light downward. Accent lighting fixtures that may be used on a building,
sign structure or within the landscape shall be aimed or directed to preclude light projection
beyond immediate objects intended to be illuminated. (As added by Ord. #15-356, Sept.
2015)

Rev. 05/11/16
14-2.2112. Underground utilities. All utilities including, but not limited to, electrical
power, telephone, television and internet cable, fiber optics and other such facilities
shall be installed underground, unless, in the opinion of the planning commission, special
conditions require otherwise. (As added by Ord. #15-356, Sept. 2015)
14-2.2113. Flood damage prevention regulations.
(1) Statutory Authorization, Findings of Fact, Purpose and Objectives:
a. Statutory Authorization.
The Legislature of the State of Tennessee has in Tennessee Code Annotated,
Sections 13-7-201 through 13-7-210, delegated the responsibility to units
of local government to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health,
safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the Alcoa, Tennessee Mayor
and Board of Commissioners, does ordain as follows:
b. Findings of Fact.
1. The Alcoa Mayor and Board of Commissioners wishes to establish
eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program and in order to do so
must meet the requirements of 60.3 of the Federal Insurance Administration
Regulations found at 44 CFR Ch. 1 (10-1-04 Edition) and subsequent amendments;
2. Areas of Alcoa are subject to periodic inundation which could
result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of
commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for
flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely
affect the public health, safety and general welfare; and,
3. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains, causing increases in flood heights and velocities;
and by uses in flood hazard areas which are vulnerable to floods; or construction
which is inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected
from flood damages.
c. Statement of Purpose.
It is the purpose of this Ordinance to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in
specific areas. This Ordinance is designed to:
1. Restrict or prohibit uses which are vulnerable to water or erosion
hazards, or which cause damaging increases in erosion, flood heights, or
velocities;
2. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including community facilities,
be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
3. Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels
and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of
flood waters;
4. Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which
may increase erosion or flood damage, and;
5. Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards, to other
lands.
d. Objectives.
The objectives of this Ordinance are:
1. To protect human life, health and property;
2. To minimize expenditure of public funds for costly flood control
projects;
3. To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated
with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
14-2.105
Rev. 05/11/16
4. To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
5. To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, street and bridges located
in floodable areas;
6. To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound
use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize
blight in flood areas;
7. To ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a
floodable area; and,
8. To establish/maintain eligibility for participation in the National
Flood Insurance Program.

living quarters for recreational, camping, travel or seasonal use.
"Regulatory Floodway" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively
increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height.
"Riverine" means relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including tributaries),
stream, brook, etc.
"Special Hazard Area" means an area having special flood, mudslide (i.e., mudflow)
and/or flood-related erosion hazards, and shown on an FHBM or FIRM as Zone A, AO, A1-
30, AE, A99, or AH.
"Start of Construction" includes substantial improvement, and means the date the
building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit
date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a
structure (including a manufactured home) on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or footings,
the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of
excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction
does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it
include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a
basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it
include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not
occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement,
the actual Start of Construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or
other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions
of the building.
"State Coordinating Agency" means the agency of the state government (Tennessee
Department of Economic and Community Development, Local Planning Assistance Office) or
other office designated by the Governor of the State or by state statute at the request of
the Administrator to assist in the implementation of the National Flood Insurance Program in
that state.
14-2.110
Rev. 05/11/16
"Structure", for purposes of this section, means a walled and roofed building that is
principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank, or other manmade
facilities or infrastructures.
"Substantial Damage" means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50
percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
"Substantial Improvement" means any repairs, reconstructions, rehabilitations, additions,
alterations or other improvements to a structure, taking place during a 5-year period,
in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds fifty percent of the market value of the
structure before the "Start of Construction" of the improvement. The market value of the
structure should be (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial
repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the
damage occurring. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage",
regardless of the actual repair work performed.
For the purpose of this definition, Substantial Improvement is considered to occur when
the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The
term does not, however, include either: (1) Any project for improvement of a structure to
correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been pre-identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum
necessary to assure safe living conditions and not solely triggered by an improvement
or repair project or; (2) Any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration
will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "Historic Structure".
"Substantially Improved Existing Manufactured Home Parks or Subdivisions" is where
the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads
equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair,
reconstruction or improvement commenced.
"Variance" is a grant of relief from the requirements of this Ordinance which permits
construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this Ordinance where specific enforcement
would result in unnecessary hardship.
"Violation" means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant
with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development
without the elevation certificate, other certification, or other evidence of compliance
required in this Ordinance is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation
is provided.
"Water Surface Elevation" means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical
Datum (NGVD) of 1929, (or other datum, where specified) of floods of various magnitudes
and frequencies in the flood plains of coastal or riverine areas.
(3) General Provisions:
a. Application.
This Ordinance shall apply to all areas within the incorporated area of
Alcoa, Tennessee.

In the interpretation and application of this Ordinance, all provisions shall be:
(1) considered as minimum requirements; (2) liberally construed in favor of the governing
body, and; (3) deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted
under state statutes.
g. Warning and Disclaimer of Liability.
The degree of flood protection required by this Ordinance is considered reasonable
for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations.
Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased
by man-made or natural causes. This Ordinance does not imply that land
outside the flood hazard areas or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damages. This Ordinance shall not create liability on the part of the
City of Alcoa, Tennessee or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages
that result from reliance on this Ordinance or any administrative decision lawfully
made hereunder.
h. Penalties for Violation.
Violation of the provisions of this Ordinance or failure to comply with any of
its requirements, including violation of conditions and safeguards established in connection
with grants of variance or special exceptions, shall constitute a misdemeanor
punishable as other misdemeanors as provided by law. Each day such violation continues
shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent
the City of Alcoa, Tennessee from taking such other lawful actions to prevent or

buildings that include ANY fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other
exterior walls below the base flood elevation, or required height above the
highest adjacent grade, shall be designed to preclude finished living space
and designed to allow for the entry and exit of flood waters to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls.
a. Designs for complying with this requirement must either
be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following
minimum criteria:
1. Provide a minimum of two (2) openings having a
total net area of not less than one (1) square inch for every
square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding;
2. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher
than one (1) foot above the finished grade; and,
3. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers,
valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the
automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions;
b. Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary
to allow for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage
of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises
(standard exterior door) or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator);
and,
c. The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be
partitioned or finished into separate rooms in such a way as to impede
the movement of floodwaters and all such petitions shall comply with
the provisions of 14-2.2110, (5), b. of this Ordinance.
4. Standards for Manufactured Homes and Recreational Vehicles

2.116
Rev. 05/11/16
proved, must meet the standards of 14-2.2110, (5), b, 4 of this Ordinance;
d. All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to
an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse
and lateral movement;
e. All recreational vehicles placed on identified flood hazard
sites must either:
1. Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive
days;
2. Be fully licensed and ready for highway use. (A
recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on
its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick
disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently
attached structures or additions; and,
3. The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements
for New Construction, including the anchoring and
elevation requirements of this section above if on the site for
longer than 180 consecutive days.
5. Standards for Subdivisions.
Subdivisions and other proposed new developments, including manufactured
home parks, shall be reviewed to determine whether such proposals
will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a subdivision proposal or other proposed
new development is in a flood-prone area, any such proposals shall be
reviewed to ensure that:

c. Standards for Areas of Special Flood Hazard with Established
Base Flood Elevations and with Floodways Designated.
Located within the Areas of Special Flood Hazard established in 14-
2.2111, (3), b, are areas designated as floodways. A floodway may be an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In
addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge
of the base flood without increased flood heights and velocities. Therefore,
the following provisions shall apply:
1. Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill material,
new construction, substantial improvements or other developments within the
regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is
demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance
with standard engineering practices that the cumulative effect of the
proposed encroachments or new development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not result in ANY increase the water
surface elevation of the base flood level, velocities or floodway widths during
the occurrence of a base flood discharge at any point within the community.
A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data
and certification thereof; and,
14-2.117
Rev. 05/11/16
2. New construction or substantial improvements of buildings shall
comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of 14-2.2110, (5).
d. Standards for Areas Standards for Areas of Special Flood
Hazard Zones AE with Established Base Flood Elevations but without
Floodways Designated.
Located within the Areas of Special Flood Hazard established in 14-
2.2111, (3), b, where streams exist with base flood data provided but where no
floodways have been designated, (Zones AE) the following provisions apply:
1. No encroachments, including fill material, new structures or
substantial improvements shall be located within areas of special flood hazard,
unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided
demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase
the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one (1) foot at
any point within the community. The engineering certification should be supported
by technical data that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering
principles; and,
2. New construction or Substantial Improvements of buildings
shall be elevated or flood-proofed to elevations established in accordance with
14-2.2110, (5), b.
e. Standards for Streams without Established Base Flood
Elevations or Floodways (A and X (shaded) Zones).
Located within the Areas of Special Flood Hazard established in 14-
2.2111, (3), where streams exist, but no base flood data has been provided (A and X
(shaded) Zones), OR where a Floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions
shall apply:
1. When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been
provided in accordance with 14-2.2110, (3), then the Administrator shall obtain,
review and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation
and floodway data available from a Federal, State or other source, in order
to administer the provisions of 14-2.2110, (5). ONLY if data is not available
from these sources, then the following provisions (2 & 3) shall apply:
2. No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be
located within an area equal to the width of the stream or twenty feet, whichever
is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification
by registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the
cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation
of the base flood more than one (1) foot at any point within the community.
The engineering certification should be supported by technical data
that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles.
3. In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data,
New Construction or Substantial Improvements of existing shall have the
lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less
than three (3) feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site.
Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters
shall be provided in accordance with the standards of 14-2.2110, (5), b, and
Elevated Buildings".
f. Standards for Areas of Shallow Flooding (AO and AH Zones).
Located within the Areas of Special Flood Hazard established in 14-2.2110,
(3), b, are areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have special
flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet (l'-3') where a
14-2.118
Rev. 05/11/16
clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable
and indeterminate; therefore, the following provisions apply:
1. All New Construction and Substantial Improvements of residential
and non-residential buildings shall have the lowest floor, including
basement, elevated to at least one (1) foot above the flood depth number
specified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), in feet, above the highest
adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including
basement, shall be elevated, at least three (3) feet above the highest
adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements
of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of 14-2.2110,
(5), b, and Elevated Buildings";
2. All New Construction and Substantial Improvements of nonresidential
buildings may be flood-proofed in lieu of elevation. The structure
together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities must be flood proofed
and designed watertight to be completely flood-proofed to at least one (1)
foot above the specified FIRM flood level, with walls substantially impermeable
to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability
of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy.
If no depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement,
shall be flood proofed to at least three (3) feet above the highest adjacent
grade. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the
design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards
of practice for meeting the provisions of this Ordinance and shall provide
such certification to the Administrator as set forth above and as required in
14-2.2110, (4), b;
3. Adequate drainage paths shall be provided around slopes to
guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures; and,
4. The Administrator shall certify the elevation or the highest adjacent
grade, where applicable, and the record shall become a permanent
part of the permit file.
g. Standards For Areas Protected by Flood Protection System (A-
99 Zones).
Located within the areas of special flood hazard, established in 14-2.2110,
(3), are areas of the 100-year floodplain protected by a flood protection system but
where base flood elevations and flood hazard factors have not been determined.
Within these areas (A-99 Zones) all provisions of 14-2.2110, (4) and (5), a, shall
apply.
h. Standards for Unmapped Streams.
Located within Alcoa, Tennessee are unmapped streams where areas of special
flood hazard are neither indicated nor identified. Adjacent to such streams the
following provisions shall apply:
1. In areas adjacent to such unmapped streams, no encroachments
including fill material or structures shall be located within an area of at
least equal to twice the width of the stream, measured from the top of each
stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided
demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development,
when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not
increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one (1) foot
at any point within the locality; and,
2. When new elevation data is available, New Construction or
Substantial Improvements of buildings shall be elevated or flood proofed to
elevations established in accordance with 14-2.2110, (4).

a. Board of Zoning Appeals.
1. The Alcoa Board of Zoning Appeals shall hear and decide Appeals
and requests for variances from the requirements of this Ordinance;
2. Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures (see definition) upon a determination that the proposed repair
or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic
character and design of the structure;
3. In passing upon such applications, the Board of Zoning Appeals
shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified
in other sections of this Ordinance, and:
a. The danger that materials may be swept onto other
property to the injury of others;
b. The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion;
c. The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage;
d. The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community;
e. The necessity of the facility to a waterfront location, in
the case of a functionally dependent facility;
f. The availability of alternative locations, not subject to
flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use;
g. The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive
plan and flood plain management program for that area;
h. The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
i. The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action,
if applicable, expected at the site; and,
j. The costs of providing governmental services during and
after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities
and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and
streets and bridges;
4. Upon consideration of the factors listed above, and the purposes
of this Ordinance, the Board of Zoning Appeals may attach such conditions
to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to effectuate the purposes
of this Ordinance; and,
5. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
b. Conditions for Variances.
1. Variances shall be issued upon a determination that the variance
is the minimum relief necessary, considering the flood hazard; and in the
instance of a historical building, a determination that the variance is the minimum
relief necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of
the building;
2. Variances shall only be issued upon (a) a showing of good and
sufficient cause, (b) a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship; and (c) a determination that the granting of a
variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public
14-2.120
Rev. 05/11/16
safety, extraordinary public expense, create a nuisance, cause fraud on or
victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or Ordinances;
3. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below
the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance,
and that such construction below the base flood level increases risks to
life and property; and,
4. The Administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions
and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA) upon request.
(7) Legal Status Provisions:
a. Conflict with Other Ordinances.

be invalid or unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, such holding
shall not affect any other section, clause, provision, or portion of this Ordinance
which is not of itself invalid or unconstitutional.
c. Effective Date.
This Ordinance shall become effective immediately after its passage, in accordance
with the Charter of Alcoa, Tennessee, and the public welfare demanding it.

SUB-CHAPTER 2.22
OFF-STREET PARKING
Section
14-2.2201. Purpose.
14-2.2202. Off-street vehicle parking.
14-2.2203. Off-street bicycle parking.
14-2.2201. Purpose. The quality of the built environment is largely determined
by established parking standards, whereby an overabundance of parking results in costs to
a communitys character, an increased urban heat island effect, more polluted runoff, and
unnecessary expense. To address these concerns, a well planned and executed parking
program accomplished by tailoring standards, managing demand and improving parking facility
design, is critical to ensure a more human-scale environment which emphasizes parking
efficiency. The purpose of this section is to institute standards that represent a more
accurate reflection of the local condition and needs, rather than produce a surplus of parking
and lots that are only full during the holiday season. (as added by Ord. #12-227, Jan.
2012)
14.2.2202. Off-street vehicle parking.
(1) Off-street parking shall be provided on any lot on which any of the following
uses are hereafter established; such space shall be provided with vehicular access to a

In the urban core of a mixed-use district, on-street parking will count toward the
parking requirement. In the case of a shopping center (i.e., a group of commercial establishments
planned, developed and owned, and managed as a unit, with off-street parking
provided on the property), shared parking shall be allowed. In such cases, the amount required
may be reduced to a ratio of one space per 275 square feet of gross floor area. For
those who wish to reserve a certain proportion of that parking to their particular use, no
more than 1 parking stall per 1,000 square feet of gross floor area may be provided.
(2) The planning commission may approve a parking reduction:
a. By up to five spaces for each car-share vehicle where an active carsharing
program is made available to residents and/or employees;
b. Where cars for the car-share program are available on the site or
within an 800 feet walking distance of the site; and,
c. For office, industrial and institutional uses, where there are more than
20 parking spaces on site, car-share/carpool parking will be allowed, subject to:
1. Five spaces or five percent of the parking on site, whichever is
less, must be reserved for carpool use before 9:00 a.m. on weekdays;
2. The spaces must be closest to the building entrance or elevator,
but not closer than the spaces for disabled parking and those signed for exclusive
customer use; and,
3. Signs must be posted indicating these spaces are reserved for
carpool use before 9:00 a.m. on weekdays.
14-2.125
Rev. 03/09/16
(3) For parking areas on sites being redeveloped and for which the applicant can
demonstrate that the number of parking spaces that could be constructed in compliance
with the provisions of this section would not comply with the number of parking spaces required
by this code, the planning commission may authorize a reduction of up to 10 percent
in the required number of parking spaces.
(4) If vehicle parking space required above cannot be reasonably provided on the
same lot on which the principal use is conducted, the planning commission may permit such
space to be provided on other off-street property, provided such space lies within eight
hundred (800) feet of the main entrance to such principal use. Such vehicle parking space
shall be deemed to be required open space associated with the permitted use and shall not
thereafter be reduced or encroached upon in any manner.
(5) No residence district lot or street shall be used for the parking or open storage
of any bus, taxi, construction equipment, farm equipment, trailer or truck larger than ¾
(three- quarter) ton net load capacity, exclusive of actively used private recreational vehicles
or trailers and except for the purpose of the immediate servicing of adjacent property.
(6) Parking spaces: Each parking space shall be a minimum of one hundred seventy-
one (171) square feet in area. Such spaces shall be designated by painted lines or
curb markers. Parking spaces shall be a minimum of nine and one-half (9-1/2) feet in width
and eighteen (18) feet in length. Areas reserved for motorcycle parking must be a minimum
of four (4) feet in width by eight (8) feet in length and be identified or designated
through the use of signage or pavement markings. Parallel parking stalls shall be a minimum
of ten (10) feet in width and twenty-two (22) feet in depth. In any determination of
parking required as set forth in this section, where the resultant figure contains a fraction
one-half (1/2) or more shall be counted as one (1) parking space.
a. Accessible parking: Accessible parking for typical spaces shall be a
minimum of thirteen (13) feet in total width and, when van accessible, sixteen (16)
feet in width. These spaces shall be designed to include (i) eight (8) feet in width
dedicated to parking and (ii) five (5) feet in width dedicated to an access aisle, when
typical, and eight (8) feet when van accessible. All spaces shall be a minimum of
eighteen (18) feet in length. Accessible parking spaces shall be conveniently located
to building entrances and meet ADA standards for accessible design in compliance
with the adopted 2006 International Building Code, or latest edition, and any
amendments adopted thereto. The total number of accessible parking spaces provided
shall be in accordance with the following table (see Exception (1) for hospital outpatient
facilities and (2) for rehabilitation facilities and outpatient physical therapy
facilities):
Minimum Number of Accessible Parking Spaces
Total # of
Parking Spaces
Provided
Typical Van Total Required

Rev. 03/09/16
Each accessible parking space shall be an identified by an above grade sign,
with the international symbol of accessibility, mounted high enough (five (5) feet
minimum for typical spaces and seven (7) feet for van) to be visible when a vehicle
is parked. Van accessible parking spaces shall include a sign stating such and shall
be placed below the international symbol of accessibility. The current fine for unauthorized
(or improper) parking in an accessible space, as authorized by the state of
Tennessee, shall be identified on all signs. In addition to an above grade sign, the
pavement shall also be identified with the international symbol of accessibility.
b. Minimum width of aisles and back-up areas: The minimum width of
parking lot aisles shall be as follows:

c. Parking Garages: Parking structures can be either single-level garages
with ground-level parking beneath the upper levels containing habitable floor area,
or multi-level garages with ramps leading to at least one elevated parking deck.
Parking structures are significantly more expensive to build than surface parking lots,
are commonly used in urbanized areas, and are expected to spread to corridors and
centers as the price of land increases. Additionally, parking structures are more efficient
than surface parking and facilitate a compact urban form. They screen the view
of parking areas and, when designed properly, can be more attractive than a surface
parking lot. The following standards shall apply to the design of all structured parking:
1. Must comply with the minimum setback for principal structures
in the zoning district in which they are located;
2. Must comply with the maximum height for structures in the
zoning district in which located;
3. Must comply with the minimum parking stall dimensions as set
forth in Section 14-2.2202, 6), above;

as follows:
a. Free flow entriesmeaning an entry into a parking garage
without controls, such as attendants or automatic dispensing ticket
controlsone (1) vehicle space per entry lane is required;
b. Automatic ticket dispensing entriesmeaning an entry
into a parking garage controlled by a machine dispensing tickets for
garage usetwo (2) vehicle spaces per entry lane are required;
c. Manual ticket dispensing entriesmeaning an entry into
a parking garage controlled by a person manually dispensing tickets
for garage usefour (4) vehicle spaces per entry lane are required;
and,
d. Manual key card entriesmean an entry into a parking
garage controlled by a key card for garage usetwo (2) vehicle spaces
per entry lane are required.
(7) Minimum site design: To provide for orderly, safe and systematic circulation
within parking areas, off-set parking areas shall meet the following general requirements:

loading areas access shall be submitted to insure that adequate services access for
loading and unloading for each structure is available. All turning radii must be adequate
for a truck of a minimum of thirty (30) feet in length, without encroaching on
any parking spaces or other vehicular lanes or aisles. No service loading space shall
be counted for required parking space;
f. Landscaping that does not interfere with the vehicular visibility at access
points along the frontage may be installed in the front yard ten (10) foot visibility
strip. All development proposals require a minimum of ten (10) foot visibility
strip. All development proposals require a minimum ten (10) foot landscaping strip
around the rear and side yards of the site, or a permanent commitment of at least
ten (10) percent of the gross area of the parcel to landscaped area. A landscaping

14-2.128
Rev. 03/09/16
however, in environmentally sensitive areas where the practice of sheet flow is
preferable, wheel stops are required and when used shall be installed within two (2)
feet of the front edge of the parking stall. (Ord. #338, as amended by Ord. #09-
189, Ord. #11-250, Jan. 2011, Ord. #12-227, Jan. 2012 and Ord. #16-379, March
2016)

vehicles on residential property.
14-2.2304. Storage of operable vehicles on residential property.
14-2.2305. Exemption from maximum number of operable vehicles that may be
parked or stored at residential property.
14-2.2306. Vehicle parking in front yard on residential lots.
14-2.2307. Vehicles stored in residential side and rear yards.
14-2.2308. Lot coverage for surfaced driveway, parking and vehicle storage areas.

14-2.2313. Notice of impoundment and repossession.
14-2.2314. Disposition of unclaimed vehicles.
14-2.2301. Purpose. The Board of Commissioners finds and declares that the accumulation
and storage of vehicles in disrepair, and/or inoperable condition, and the accumulation
and storage of operable vehicles in excessive numbers, and/or inappropriate locations,
falls into the category of rubbish and unsightly debris, constituting a detriment to the
health, safety and welfare of the community, and declares the same to be a nuisance. The
Commission thus declares that such conditions should be regulated, abated and prohibited
because they reduce the value of and enjoyment of private and public property and create,
extend and aggravate urban blight.
14-2.2302. Definitions. The following definitions shall apply in the interpretation
and enforcement of this chapter:
(1) Person  any person, firm, partnership, association, corporation, company,
or organization of any kind.
(2) Vehicle  any machine propelled by power other than human power designed
to travel along the ground or water by use of wheels, tread, runners, slides or motor
and transport persons or property or pull machinery and shall include, without limitation,
automobile, truck, trailer, motorcycle, tractor, buggy, wagon and boat.
(3) Property  any real property within the city which is not a street or highway.
(4) Inoperable  any vehicle which is immobilized and incapable of moving under
its own power due to an accident, mechanical breakdown, weather conditions or other
situation.
(5) Abandoned  any vehicle that is left unattended, whether in disrepair, illegally
parked, or for other reason, or is on private property without the consent of the owner
or person in control of the property for more than forty-eight (48) hours, or has been
stored, parked or left in a garage, trailer park, or any type of storage or parking lot for more
than thirty (30) consecutive days.
(6) Nuisance  any abandoned or inoperable vehicle, including but not limited
to vehicle which is rusted, wrecked, junked or partly dismantled, and which has been
parked, stored or left on property in violation of the provisions of this chapter.
14-2.130
Rev. 08/10/10
(7) Household  all persons who occupy a housing unit. A housing unit is a
house, an apartment, a mobile home, a group of rooms or a single room that is occupied (or
if vacant, is intended for occupancy) as separate living quarters. Separate living quarters
are those in which the occupants live and eat separately from any other persons in the
building and which have direct access from the outside of the building or through a common
hall. The occupants may be a single family, one person living alone, two or more families
living together or any other group of related or unrelated persons who share living arrangements
(people not living in households are classified as living in group quarters).
14-2.2303. Storage of rusted, wrecked, junked, partly dismantled, inoperable
or abandoned vehicles on residential property. No person shall park, store or
leave, or permit the parking storage or leaving of any vehicle that is rusted, wrecked,
junked, partly dismantled, inoperable or abandoned upon any residential property within the
city for a period of more than ten (10) days unless such vehicle is completely enclosed in a
building. All vehicles on residential property shall be parked or stored on asphalt, cement or
any other impervious surface, or gravel or similar driveway, parking and vehicle storage area.
14-2.2304. Storage of operable vehicles on residential property. No more
than four (4) operable vehicles may be parked or stored at a dwelling unit for more than a

may be parked or stored unenclosed at residential property. A household having
more than four drivers, each with their own vehicle, may apply for an exemption from the
City Manager, or designee, for consideration. Exemptions will be applicable for up to one
year from the date of their approval and will need to be renewed on an annual basis. Annual
exemptions shall be based on each driver having a valid Tennessee drivers license, with the
same address as that where the vehicle is to be parked. An application form, available at
the offices of the Department of Planning and Codes, must be completed with the required
documentation.
14-2.2306. Vehicle parking in front yard on residential lots. The parking of
vehicles on lawn compacts the soil, damages the landscaping and detracts from the visual
appearance of not only the individual property, but of the neighborhood as well. Further,
parking on an unimproved surface: 1) Stirs up dust; 2) Negatively impacts the aesthetics of
the area; 3) Allows oils and other unwanted substances to drip onto untreated dirt surface,
creating potential environmental problems. It is for that reason that no vehicle, including for
the purposes of this paragraph a passenger vehicle, truck, van, motorized recreational vehicle,
motorcycle, camper, golf cart, travel trailer, boat trailer, car trailer, or other similar vehicle,
shall be routinely parked or stored on unsurfaced areas, such as dirt and grass, in the
front yard of residential lots. Parking on sidewalks or bike paths is prohibited. The purpose
of this regulation is to prevent excessive use of required front yards for the parking of vehicles.
14-2.2307. Vehicles stored in residential side and rear yards. Up to two (2)
trailers, golf carts, boats, or similar vehicles may be stored on unsurfaced areas in the side
and rear yard of residential lots.
14-2.2308. Lot coverage for surfaced driveway, parking and vehicle storage
areas. Surfaced driveway, parking and vehicle storage areas include asphalt, cement, or
any other impervious surface, or gravel or similar driveway, parking and vehicle storage area.

said vehicles and the person in control (owner, tenant, occupant or guest) of the property
on which the vehicles are located shall be responsible for removal of the vehicles to a place
of lawful storage or an enclosed building.
14-2.2311. Enforcement and impoundment. The city manager or his authorized
representative is hereby empowered to enforce and/or remove any vehicle found in
violation of Subsections 14-2.2303, 14-2.2304, 14-2.2305, 14-2.2306, 14-2.2307 or 14-
2.2308 of this sub-chapter to a safe and secure place designated by him for that purpose.
In addition to the provisions provided herein, any owner, tenant, occupant or guest found to
be in violation of any part of this sub-chapter may be subject to a fine not to exceed fifty

the abandoned vehicle; set forth the location where the vehicle is being stored; inform the
owner and any lienholders of their right to reclaim the vehicle within thirty (30) days after
the date of the notice, upon payment of all towing, preservation and storage charges resulting

to exercise their right to reclaim the vehicle within the time provided shall be deemed a
waiver by the owner and all lienholders of all right, title and interest in the vehicle and consent
to the sale of the abandoned vehicle at a public auction.
(2) When there are reasonable grounds to believe a violation exists, if any registered
owner of a nuisance vehicle or person in lawful control of the property on which such
vehicle is located refuses to comply with the provisions of this chapter, the city manager or
his designee shall provide pre-seizure notice that the vehicle has been found to be abandoned,
inoperable or otherwise a nuisance. The pre-seizure notice shall consist of a tag being
placed on the vehicle with a notice specifying date and time after which the vehicle will
be removed, a minimum of ten (10) days, and the place to which the vehicle will be taken
into custody. Additionally, pre-seizure notice shall be sent by registered or certified mail,

address, and all lienholders of record of the nuisance vehicle. The pre-seizure notice shall
contain the year, make, model and vehicle identification number of the nuisance vehicle, if
ascertainable, the location of the nuisance vehicle, and a statement advising the owner that
the owner has ten (10) days to appeal the determination by the city manager that the vehicle

any lienholders of their right to reclaim the vehicle after it is taken into custody but before it
is sold or demolished, upon payment of all towing, preservation, storage or any other
charges resulting from placing the vehicle in custody, and state that the failure of the owner
or lienholders to exercise their right to reclaim the vehicle shall be deemed a waiver by the
vehicle owner and all lienholders of all right, title and interest in the vehicle and consent to
the demolition of the vehicle or its sale at a public auction. If the vehicle owner or lienholder
cannot be located through the exercise of due diligence, notice by publication shall be
given as set out in subsection (3). If the vehicle owner or lienholder of a nuisance vehicle
fails to appeal the determination that the vehicle is a nuisance vehicle or fails to remove the
vehicle within the time allowed for an appeal, the city manager may take the vehicle into
custody. If an appeal is made, the vehicle shall not be taken into custody while the appeal is
pending. Failure to appeal within the specific time period shall, without exception, constitute
waiver of the right to appeal.
(3) In the event the vehicle owner or lienholder cannot be located to send the notice
provided for in subsections (1) and (2), then there shall be notice by one (1) publication
in one (1) newspaper of general circulation for the area including the City of Alcoa setting

building or alternative tower structure and used in communications that radiate
or capture electromagnetic waves, digital signals, analog signals, radio frequencies
(excluding radar signals), wireless telecommunications signals or other communication
signals.
f. Co-location is the placement or installation of one (1) or more additional
wireless facilities on an existing tower or approved alternative tower structure.
g. Fall Zone is the area a wireless support structure may be expected to fall
in the event of a structural failure, as measured by engineering standards.
h. Opacity (fence screening) is the degree of openness for which light or views
are blocked or obscured by fencing, when viewed horizontally from grade level to the
top of the fence for each fence section between supports. Fences are said to sufficiently
block or obscure areas where screening is required, if they have an 80 percent
or greater opacity (as documented).
i. Opacity (vegetative screening) is the degree of openness for which light or
views are blocked or obscured by vegetative landscaping, when viewed horizontally
from grade level to the top of a continuous planting of trees or shrub hedges. Trees
or shrub hedges are said to sufficiently block or obscure areas where screening is required,
if they have been planted to produce (within two (2) years from the time of
planting) an 80 percent or greater opacity (as documented).
j. Tower is any structure that is designed and constructed primarily for the
purpose of supporting one or more antennas for telephone, radio and similar communication
purposes, including self-supporting lattice towers, guyed towers, or monopole
towers. The term includes radio and television transmission towers, microwave
towers, common-carrier towers, cellular telephone towers, alternative tower
structures, and the like. The term includes the structure and any support thereto.

suitable existing tower(s) within the coverage area are (i) available for a co-location or (ii)
qualify to meet the needed coverage area. Propagation maps shall also be included to identify
before and after coverage.
(3) Co-locations: Towers shall provide for co-locations and such shall be included in
the determination of need, unless otherwise approved by the planning commission.
(4) Setbacks: Towers shall be setback from adjacent property boundary lines by a
minimum distance equal to its engineered fall zone. The setback shall be measured by projecting
a straight line from the centerline of the tower to all adjacent property boundary
14-2.138
Rev. 01/14/15
lines. Guy wires for towers and above ground supports for guy wires shall be setback from
side and rear property lines a minimum of ten (10) feet. No guy wire shall be located in a
required front yard setback. Accessory ground equipment and structures shall be setback
according to the zoning district requirements where the tower is to be located.
(5) Height: Towers shall not exceed 200 feet in height and shall comply with Federal
Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations, which may include additional height limitations.
The overall height of a tower shall be measured from the surrounding grade to the top of
the structure, including the base pad and any antenna or lightening rod. The height of a
tower shall not be determined, nor restricted, by the height limitations of a zoning district.
Accessory ground equipment and structures shall be limited to the height requirements
within zoning district where the tower is to be located.
(6) Screening requirements: The base of towers, to include all accessory ground
equipment and structures, shall be screened from public view. These improvements shall
be securely fenced within a perimeter of no less than six (6) feet in height and have a
screening opacity of 80 percent or greater, when viewed horizontally from grade level to the
top of the screen. The perimeter fencing shall also be buffered by planting at least one
healthy row of evergreen trees or shrubs capable of forming a continuous hedge, which may
be used to support the required fencing opacity. Said trees or shrubs shall be capable of
growing to at least six (6) feet in height, within two years of planting, and maintained in a
healthy condition. A break in the hedge shall be allowed for access by maintenance personnel
and vehicles. New or existing vegetation, earth berms, existing topographic features,
walls, fences, buildings, as well as similar features other than those described above, may
be used to meet the requirements of these regulations if the planning commission finds that
they achieve the same degree of screening. No screening may be required when (i) not visible
from adjoining property or (ii) not otherwise visible from a dedicated public right-ofway.
Further, a screening waiver may be necessary for the continued operation of agricultural
or forestry uses. No screening will be required when such is explicitly prohibited by
Federal Communications Commission Regulations (FCC).
(7) Administrative approvals: Co-locations, to include accessory ground equipment
and structures, may be administratively approved, as well as the replacement of antenna,
ground equipment and accessory structures. Alternative tower structures, such as antennas
and accessory equipment disguised/hidden on buildings or structures may also be administratively
approved. An administrative approval does not exempt an applicant from building
or other necessary permitting requirements. Further, administrative approvals do not apply
in instances where (i) an existing perimeter will be expanded and/or (ii) an existing tower
will be extended.
(8) Special Exception: The Board of Zoning Appeals (BZA) may grant a special exception
approval to locate a tower within a residential zoning district. Consideration shall be
subject to the procedures and requirements as set forth for granting a special exception and
may include conditions to the extent the BZA concludes such conditions are necessary to
minimize adverse effects of the proposed tower on adjoining properties.
(9) Appeals: The setback requirements may be waived through an appeal to the
Board of Zoning Appeals (BZA). The BZA may grant a variance if the applicant demonstrates
that the tower with the waiver will not adversely affect adjacent property or constitute
a safety hazard. Further, any person dissatisfied with the decision, rules and regulations
contained herein or resulting from this ordinance shall have the right of appeal. An
appeal shall be submitted in accordance with the rules and regulations set forth by the Alcoa
Board of Commissioners. (As amended by Ord. #1042, Section 1, #15-344 and #15-344,

may be issued by the Building Inspector for a period not exceeding six months, during the
completion of alterations or during partial occupancy of a building pending its completion.

rights, duties or obligations of the owners or of the City relating to the use of occupancy of
the premises or any other matter covered by this ordinance, and such temporary certificate
shall not be issued except under such restrictions and provisions as will adequately insure
the safety of the occupants.

but only where by reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness or shape of a
specific piece of property, which at the time of the adoption of this ordinance, was a lot of
record; or where, by reason of exceptional topographic conditions or other extraordinary or
exceptional situation or condition of a piece of property, the strict application of the provisions
of this ordinance would result in practical difficulties to or undue hardship upon the

exception. An application for an extension shall be submitted, by the applicant,
in writing to the city manager, prior to the date of expiration of the special exception.
The city manager, or his designee, may deny a request for an extension of
time if he finds that there has not been a diligent effort made by the applicant to

shall not change the requirements that were stipulated when the special exception

SIGN ORDINANCE
SECTION
14-401 Purpose.
14-402 Scope.
14-403 Definition of Terms.
14-404 General Provisions.
14-405 Additional Sign Regulations.
14-406 Administration and Enforcement.
14-401. Purpose.
(1) It is the purpose of this sign ordinance to establish reasonable and impartial
regulations for the location of signs within the zoning districts of the City of Alcoa so as to
achieve a more desirable environment through the assurance that flexible and diversified
standards bring about adequate light, air and open spaces and a reduction in congestion
and hazardous conditions within the city.
(2) The underlying intent and structure of the sign ordinance is that only those
types, sizes, locations and illuminations of signs that are specifically identified in this ordinance
may be constructed, erected, applied or maintained within the City of Alcoa, and that
all others are prohibited. Notwithstanding this intent and structure, certain types and sizes
of signs are specifically prohibited for clarity and emphasis. This underlying intent and
structure allows the city to study new techniques and new technologies and then determine
whether, and if so to what extent, they should be allowed to be incorporated into signs
within the city. It is not possible to specifically prohibit or even to regulate that which has
not yet been brought to the attention of city officials or that which has not been invented or
even conceived. Accordingly, the Sign Administrators authority to render interpretations as
provided in Section 14-406 includes the authority to determine whether or not a new,
evolved, extended or improved process, technique or technology is sufficiently similar to an
allowable type of sign to be allowed under this sign ordinance, or whether such a new,
evolved, extended or improved process, technique or technology should be deemed prohibited
until approved by the city commission.
(3) Automated or electronic changeable signs are defined further in this ordinance
as signs which can be automated changeable copy, electronic graphic display, multi-vision
and/or video display. These definitions (as referenced in Section 14-403 below), may be
amended or superseded from time to time in the future, because of (i) the nature of automated
or electronic changeable signs (without regard to the specific method or mechanism
of effecting a change), (ii) the intensity of use afforded by automated or electronic changeable
signage, (iii) the potential for inappropriate intrusion into and abuse of the public
streets and rights-of-way by automated or electronic changeable signage, and/or (iv) the
public welfare and safety concerns raised by automated or electronic changeable signage.
All automated or electronic changeable signage is declared to be a use that is separate, different
and distinct from the use of or resulting from a permanent, fixed sign face of print or
design on or of paper, plastic glass, wood, metal, vinyl or any other opaque or translucent
material.
(4) All signs erected, replaced constructed, expanded or relocated on any property
within the city shall conform to all sections of this ordinance (Ord. #1075, Aug. 1997, as
amended by Ord. #10-244, Dec. 2010).
14-402. Scope. This section of the ordinance will regulate all signs within the
City of Alcoa, except:

materials so that such signs are not visible from public rights-of-way or adjacent properties;
and,
(2) Signs located within the interior of buildings and/or structures so as to be intended
for viewing from within such building and/or structure.
In keeping with the general purpose, intent and objectives of this ordinance, all signs
which are located either on or to the exterior of a building or are otherwise intended to be
visible from the exterior of a building (exterior signs) are to be regulated. All exterior signs
erected for other than regulatory purposes by local, state and federal governmental agencies
are subject to the provisions of this ordinance. All signs will be regulated so as to provide
for the public safety, area development, preservation of property values, and the general
welfare of the city. (Ord. #1075, Aug. 1997)

sign does not conform to the permit or that any sign is not properly maintained as required
by this ordinance, (please see Additional sign regulations, appearing later in this chapter) or
that any sign has become insecure, or otherwise unsafe in the opinion of the sign administrator

14-405. Additional Sign Regulations. The purpose of this section is to provide
relief for certain types of signs and sign conditions and to regulate signs or sign conditions,
which are considered hazardous.
(1) Signs in Disrepair and Unsafe Signs: All signs and supports, braces, guys and
anchors thereof shall be kept in good repair, refurbished and repaired from time to time, as
necessary, and perpetually maintained in safe condition, free from deterioration, defective
or missing parts, or peeling or faded paint and be able to withstand the wind pressure for
which it was originally designed. Any sign not in compliance with this provision is hereby
declared a nuisance.
The sign administrator, or his designee, may order the repair or removal of any such
signs that are not maintained in a safe condition and in good repair in accordance with the
provisions of this subsection. If the sign administrator, or his designee, shall find that any
sign is in violation of this subsection, then he shall give notice to the property owner specifying
the location of the hazard or deterioration sign, what needs to be done to render the
sign safe and in good repair, and that in the event the same is not done by the owner, that
the City of Alcoa will either do the same or remove the sign at the expense of the owner of
the property upon which it is located. Service of any notice may be by personal service or
by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested. Service shall be deemed complete
upon delivery; in the event the address of the person to be notified is unknown or the notice
which has been mailed is returned, such notice may be served by posting same in a conspicuous
place on the premises on which the nuisance is located and by advertising said notice
once a week for three weeks in a local newspaper, in which event service shall be
deemed complete after the preceding is accomplished. The person(s) notified shall remove
or initiate alteration of such sign within 15 days of such notice and such sign condition shall
be completely rectified within 60 days. In the case of the unavailability of critical replacement
parts, an additional 30 days for compliance may be granted by the sign administrator,
or his designee, but such availability of parts shall not be reason to delay repair of the sign
to the maximum extent feasible. If the person(s) so notified fail or refuse to remove or alter
such sign within the time periods specified hereinabove, then the sign administrator, or
his designee, may cause such sign to be removed or altered so that the sign is rendered in
good repair and safe at the expense of the owner of the property upon which it is located.
The sign administrator, or his designee, may without notice, cause any unsafe or insecure
sign to be immediately removed of the sign presents an immediate peril to the
14-4.18
Rev. 12/14/16
health and welfare of the city. In the event that any sign is damaged exceed 50 percent of
the reproduction value according to appraisal thereof by competent appraisers, such sign
may be restored, reconstructed, altered or repaired only to conform with all of the provisions
of this ordinance.
(2) Technical and Structural Requirements: The purpose of this section is to
provide the technical and structural requirements for signs erected within the City of Alcoa.
No sign or sign structure shall be erected in such a way that any portion of the sign or its
structure will interfere with the free use of a fire escape, exit, or standpipe; nor shall any
sign or sign structure, other than authorized governmental agency signs, be erected within
two (2) feet of any above-ground telephone cable or street light. Signs shall be separated
from all power lines by the distance required by all applicable laws, regulations or codes.
Signs constructed or installed in the City of Alcoa shall conform to and comply with
all requirements, standards and specifications of this sign ordinance. (Ord. #1075, Aug.
1997, as amended by Ord. #10-244, Dec. 2010)
14-406. Administration and Enforcement. It is the purpose and intent of
this section to establish the process of administering the ordinance  delineating the duties,
powers and limitations of officials, departments and any other entity which may be concerned
with the administration and enforcement of this ordinance. The City Manager shall
appoint a sign administrator to administer and enforce the provisions of this ordinance,
which shall include, though not be limited to, the following:
a. Issuance of sign permit applications and other forms, and approval or
denial of the same.
b. Providing of public information relating to sign matters.
c. Registration and maintenance of sign permit applications.
d. Periodic checks for violations of this ordinance and issuance of written
notices of violations and of work required to correct violations.
e. Permanent record collection relating to sign decisions and other sign
matters.
(1) Administrative Interpretation of Ordinance: In the event there is a question
concerning the general intent or meaning of any provision of this ordinance, the sign administrator
or his designee shall have the authority to make such administrative decisions and
interpretations. Administrative interpretation shall in no way be construed as permitting or
granting an exception to the provisions of the sign ordinance.
(2) Compliance and Enforcement: When the sign administrator, or his designee,
finds violations of the provisions of this ordinance, he shall document his findings and take
the appropriate action to correct said violations. A citation or warrant may be issued to the
owner or agent or employee for violations of this ordinance.
(3) Filing of Complaints: Whenever a violation of this ordinance occurs, or is alleged
to have occurred, any person may file a written complaint with the sign administrator.
Such complaint shall state fully the causes and basis thereof. The sign administrator, or his
designee, shall officially record such complaint, immediately initiate investigations, and take
such action thereon as required by the provisions of this ordinance.
(4) Penalties: Any person violating any of the provisions of this ordinance shall
be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof shall be fined in an amount
not exceeding $500.00. Each day such violation is committed or permitted to continue shall
constitute a separate offense and shall be punishable as such hereunder.
(5) Review of Sign Permit Applications: All applications for sign permits shall be
reviewed by the sign administrator, and shall be approved and permit issued or be disapproved
in consideration of meeting the applicable requirements of this ordinance. Such approval
and issuance or disapproval shall take place within 30 days of submission of an application
for a sign permit.
14-4.19
Rev. 12/14/16
(6) Legal Non-Conforming Sign Provision: Signs which were legally in existence
prior to the adoption of this ordinance which do not conform to the provisions of this ordinance
are declared non-conforming signs. It is the intent of this section to recognize that
the eventual elimination, as expeditiously and fairly as possible, of non-conforming signs is
as much a subject of health, safety and welfare as is the prohibition of new signs that would
violate the provisions of this ordinance. It is also the intent of this section that any elimination
of non-conforming signs shall be effected so as to avoid any unreasonable invasion of
established property rights.
(7) General Non-conforming Sign Provisions: Subject to the exceptions hereinafter
set forth, any non-conforming sign may be continued in operation and maintenance after
the effective date of this ordinance, providing that non-conforming signs shall not be:
a. Changed to or replaced with another non-conforming sign, including
changing the sign face. This section shall not be construed to prohibit the changing
of a message panel, provided there is no increase in the face area or height of
change in the face panel enclosing members.
b. Enlarged, expanded, extended or structurally altered so as to create
an additional non-conformity or to increase the extent of the existing non-conformity
when the change is declared a nuisance by this chapter. Nothing here allows a nonconforming
sign to be placed nearer to a right-of-way property line or power line
than permitted by this chapter.
c. Re-established after damage or destruction of more than 50 percent of
the value at the time of such damage.
d. No non-conforming sign shall be removed and replaced or reconstructed
on the same lot of record unless it conforms with the height and signable area
limitations set forth in each zoning district. A non-conforming sign that is removed
and replaced or reconstructed on the same lot of record is declared to be a public
nuisance if the sign area or height exceeds that specified in the accompanying zoning
district.
e. Modified in any way that would increase the degree of non-conformity
of such sign. Nothing in this ordinance shall prevent the strengthening or restoring
to a safe condition of any portion of a sign or structure declared unsafe by proper authority.
Such signs may be improved on to the extent that such improvement does
not exceed 50 percent of the current market value of the existing structure. (as
amended by Ord. No. 10-244, December 2010)
(8) Termination of Non-Conforming Sign Structures: Any permanent nonconforming
sign or sign structure which is partially destroyed or damaged by fire, accident
or natural causes beyond 50 percent of its original value shall thereafter be removed or reconstructed
in conformance to the regulations of this ordinance. Any permanent nonconforming
sign or sign structure which is improved and altered to comply with the provisions
of this ordinance shall thereafter be considered as conforming. Abandonment or obsolescence
of a non-conforming on-premise sign shall be removed or brought into compliance
with this ordinance immediately upon a change in principal use of the site.
(9) Obsolete and Abandoned Signs: Any sign which advertises or pertains to a
business, produce, service, event, activity, or purpose which is no longer available or conducted,
or which has not been in use for a consecutive period of six (6) months, or any sign
structure that for a consecutive six (6) month period does not display any sign copy and/or
advertising, shall be deemed to be an obsolete or abandoned sign. Permanent signs applicable
to a business temporarily suspended because of a change of ownership or management
shall not be deemed abandoned or obsolete unless the property remains vacant for a
period of six (6) months. Obsolete or abandoned signs are prohibited and shall be removed
by the owner of the property, his agent or person having the beneficial use of the site upon
which such sign or sign structure is erected, within 30 days after written notification from
the sigh administrator. In the event on non-compliance with the aforesaid terms and provi14-
4.20
Rev. 12/14/16
sions, then the sign administrator shall have the authority to effect immediate removal of
said sign as a public nuisance with the cost of said removal being assessed against the owner
of the sign, of known, and no liability shall attach to the city, its officials or agents for
said removal of such a public nuisance.
(10) Appeals: The Board of Zoning Appeals shall have the following responsibilities,
in addition to the responsibilities set forth in other ordinances:
a. To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged by the appellant that
there is an error in any order, requirement, permit, decision or refusal made by the
sign administrator or any other administrative official in the carrying or enforcement
of any provision of this ordinance.
b. To hear and decide, in accordance with the provisions of this ordinance,
requests for special exceptions or for decisions upon other special questions
upon which such board if authorized by this ordinance to pass. The special exception
shall be determined by such board to be the only means of relieving a peculiar
and/or exceptional condition. Approval of a request for special exception applies only
to the existing use by the applicant and is not a vested right assigned with the
property.
c. To authorize, upon an appeal relating to said property, a variance from
such strict application so as to relieve such difficulties or hardship, provided such relief
may be granted without substantial detriment to the public good and without
substantially impairing the intent and purpose of the sign ordinance.
An appeal must conform to the following procedures.
1. After a written denial of a sign permit from the sign administrator,
a party may make an application for special exception, interpretation or
variance using forms obtainable at the city office.
2. Upon receipt of an application, the Board of Zoning Appeals
shall hold a public hearing, having first given seven (7) days notice. Such notice
of the time and place of such hearing shall be published in a paper of
general circulation within the city. The Board shall consider and decide all
appeals within 30 days of such public hearing.
(11) Provisions Declared to be Minimum Requirements: The provisions of this ordinance
are for the promotion of the public health, safety, morals and general welfare for
the city and are considered to be minimum requirements. Wherever the requirements of
any other lawfully adopted rules, regulations, ordinances and deed restrictions or covenants
filed of record are not in conflict with the intent and purpose of this ordinance, the more restrictive
or higher standards shall govern.
(12) Violations  Separate Violations and Responsible Parties: Each day a violation
continues shall be considered a separate offense. The owner or tenant of any building, sign,
premises or sign thereon, and any architect, builder, contractor, agent or other person who
commits or participates in, assists in or maintains any violation hereunder, may be found
responsible of a separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the city from taking
such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. (Ord.

ANSWERS TO TEN OF THE MOST FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT SUBDIVISION
REGULATIONS
1. Are subdivision regulations fair to everyone?
Yes, the written regulations provide the regional planning commission with uniform
procedures, standards of design and construction by which to appraise equally and
fairly all plats for land subdivision.
2. Who is affected by the regulations?
Every owner of land within the planning region who divides land into smaller parcels,
or changes the size or shape of existing lots.
3. Am I affected if I subdivide my tract of land into one or two parcels?
Yes, subdivision means the division of a tract or parcel of land into one or more
lots, sites or divisions for immediate or future sale or building development, and includes
resubdivision. Removing or adjusting an existing lot line also constitutes a
subdivision.
4. Whats to prevent me from recording a subdivision plat without approval?
The county registrar of deeds is prevented by law from recording land subdivision lying
within planning regions without final approval in writing.
5. Can I sell by an unapproved plat and then record my lots by metes and bounds?
No, State law makes it a misdemeanor, punishable by law, to use an unapproved
subdivision plat even if metes and bounds description is used in the instrument of
transfer or sale.
6. What happens if I sell unapproved and unrecorded lots from my subdivision?
(a) A state law has been broken (Section 10, Chapter 22, Public Acts of 1951).
(b) Some cloud would exist on the title of the lot.
(c) Most lending agencies will not approve or guarantee loans.
(d) State law requires that public bodies shall not extend sewers, water mains,
lighting or other utilities in unauthorized roads.
(e) Where zoning is in effect a building permit to construct any building will be
withheld.
(f) Any building or structure erected in violation may be forced to be vacated or
removed.
(g) The legislative body of a county or municipality may stop sales by injunction
or other legal action.
Alcoa Subdivision Regulations 6
Revised 04/18/2019
7. What improvements will I need to install in my subdivision?
Alcoa Subdivision Regulations require the developer to grade and improve streets,
install storm drainage, sewers (where applicable), and water mains in accordance
with adopted specifications.
8. Why doesnt the lot buyer instead of the developer pay for improvements?
The lot buyer does  at the time he purchases his property. If lots are sold before
improvements are in, the community bears the expense of providing needed improvements
that should have been planned for and installed by the developer.
9. Wont subdivision regulations cause expensive development and cost me a lot of
money?
Quite the contrary! Property planned subdivisions make the best use of land with a
minimum of construction and operating cost. Good design takes advantage of all capabilities
of the site and results in a minimum amount of streets and utilities with a
maximum number of well-arranged and easier sold lots. Good land subdivision improves
the value of the land and the immediate return to the investor, while saving
the developer money.
10. How do I go about having a subdivision approved?
The Alcoa Regional Planning Commissions printed set of regulations includes the
procedure for having a plat approved. The planning commission meets at regular intervals
and your preliminary sketch plat is submitted in advance of the meeting at
which it is to be considered. It is suggested that you consult your planning commission
early so as to become familiar with the official plans that might affect your area.
11. What if I wish to layout a commercial or industrial subdivision?
The provisions of subdivision regulations apply to all subdivision of land, including
that for use of business and industry. Since space, parking and service requirements
will vary greatly; it is impossible to establish standards for all types of uses. For that
reason, specific requirements for lot sizes and area are set forth only for residential
areas.
12. Where can I get technical site planning assistance?
The planning commission will help by recommending several competent subdivision
designers who can contribute much to the financial success of your subdivision.

Revised 04/18/2019
SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS
OF THE MUNICIPALITY OF
ALCOA TENNESSEE, REGIONAL/MUNICIPAL PLANNING COMMISSION
(Hereafter referred to as the Planning Commission)
ARTICLE I. PURPOSE, AUTHORITY AND JURISDICTION
A. Purpose
Land subdivision is the first step in the process of community development. Once
land has been cut up into streets, lots and blocks and publicly recorded, the correction
of defects is costly and difficult. Subdivision of land sooner or later becomes a
public responsibility in that roads and streets must be maintained and various public
services customary to urban areas must be provided. The welfare of the entire
community is thereby affected in many important respects. It is therefore to the interest
of the public, the developer and the future owners that subdivisions be conceived,
designed and developed in accordance with sound rules and proper minimum
standards.
The following subdivision regulations guiding the planning commission are designed
the provide for the harmonious development of the planning region; to secure a coordinated
layout and adequate provision for traffic and also to secure adequate provision
for light, air, recreation, transportation, water, drainage, sewer and other
sanitary facilities.
B. Authority
These subdivision regulations are adopted under authority granted by Title 13, Section
13-3-201 and Section 13-3-301 through 13-3-411, Tennessee Code Annotated.
The planning commission has fulfilled the requirements set forth in these statues as
prerequisite to the adoption of such regulations.
C. Jurisdiction
These regulations shall govern all subdivision of land within the Alcoa Regional Planning
area as established by resolution of the Tennessee State Planning Commission
dated May 19, 1959 or as hereafter established by appropriate resolution.
Within these regulations, the term subdivision shall mean the division of a tract or
parcel of land into one or more lots, sites, or divisions for the purpose, whether immediate
or future, of sale or building development, and include resubdivision of the
land or area subdivided, as well as the removal or adjustment of a lot line. Any prospective
subdivider owning land located within this area shall submit his subdivision
plat to the Alcoa Regional Planning Commission. The plat is to be submitted according
to the procedures outlined in Article II, which plat shall conform to the minimum
requirements set forth in Article III. Improvement shall be installed as required by
Article IV of these regulations.
Alcoa Subdivision Regulations 8
Revised 04/18/2019
ARTICLE II. PROCEDURE FOR PLAT APPROVAL
The procedure for review and approval of a subdivision plat consists of three separate
steps. The initial step is the preparation and subdivision of a concept plan to
the planning commission. The second step is the preparation and submission to the
planning commission of a preliminary plat and the third step is the submission of a
final plat together with required certificates.
The concept plan allows the planning commission to review a subdivision proposal in
a workshop environment in which the developer can discuss his development goals,
the staff can verbalize their preliminary analysis, and the public can express any
concerns they may have on the project. Such a procedure provides the opportunity
for the development of an optimal subdivision, involving all the necessary parties,
prior to mounting extensive architectural and engineering costs. The resulting preliminary
plat is the construction plan for all proposed improvements. The final plat
becomes the instrument to be recorded in the office of the county register when duly
signed by the secretary of the planning commission.
A. General
1. Any owner of land lying within the area of jurisdiction of the planning commission
wishing to divide such land into two or more lots, sites, or divisions,
for the purpose, either immediate or future, of sale or building development,
or wishing to resubdivide for this purpose, shall submit a plan of such proposed
subdivision to the planning commission for approval and shall obtain
such approval prior to the filing of his subdivision plat for record. Any such
plat of subdivision shall conform to the minimum standards of design for the
subdivision of land as set forth in Article III of these regulations and shall be
presented in the manner specified in the following section of this Article. No
plat of a subdivision of land within these areas of jurisdiction shall be filed by
the county register without the approval of the planning commission.
2. The subdivider may submit the concept plan and should consult early and informally
with the planning commission and its technical staff for advice and
assistance before the preparation of the preliminary plat and its formal application
for approval. This will enable him to become thoroughly familiar with
these regulations, the Major Street and Road Plan and other official plans or
public improvements which might affect the area. Such informal review
should prevent unnecessary and costly revisions.
3. A subdivider may omit the submission of a preliminary sketch plat, combining
both a preliminary sketch and final plat (or otherwise considered to be a minor
subdivision), if the following conditions are met:
a. All public improvements as set forth in Article IV are already installed
or because of the nature of the development deemed not necessary by
the planning commission. Any construction, installations, or improvements
of any public improvements shall require the submission of a
preliminary sketch plat as prescribed by Section B of Article II.
Alcoa Subdivision Regulations 9
Revised 04/18/2019
b. The subdivider has consulted informally with the planning commission
staff for advice and assistance before the preparation of the final plat,
and its formal application for approval.
4. A subdivider may not be required to receive formal approval by the planning
commission in instances where the plat is deemed to constitute a plat of correction
(i.e., an omission is being corrected, which may include the removal or addition
of such items as general text, a plat note or an easement, and no lot is being
created nor a line removed or adjusted) and does not otherwise reverse the intent
of the original approval. Plat of corrections are reviewed administratively by staff
and signed by the secretary of the planning commission once all other signatures
have been executed.
B. Preliminary Sketch Plat
1. At least fifteen (15) days prior to the meeting at which it is to be considered,
the subdivider shall submit to the staff of the planning commission two (2)
copies of a preliminary sketch plat and a portable document format (pdf) of
the proposed subdivision in order to allow planning staff and utility directors/
staffs time to review and prepare recommendations to the planning
commission. The subdivision plan shall be drawn to a scale of not less than
one (1) inch equals 100 feet on sheets 18 x 24 inches in size. At the time of
such submission, the staff of the planning commission shall issue a receipt
acknowledging said submission. Neither the submission of the preliminary
sketch plat to the staff of the planning commission nor the receipt issued by
the staff of the planning commission shall constitute submission of the preliminary
sketch plat for consideration by the planning commission. If any portion
of the land being subdivided is subject to flood, as defined in Article III., Section
E., the limit of the base flood elevation (the 500 year flood boundary)
shall be platted along with minimum floor elevations.
2. The sketch plat which shall meet the minimum standards of design as set
forth in Article III and the general requirements for the construction of public
improvements as set forth in Article IV shall give the following information insofar
as possible.
(a) The proposed subdivision name and location, the name and address of
the owner or owners, and the name and seal of the designer of the
plat who shall be a Tennessee licensed engineer or Tennessee registered
surveyor. The Emergency Management Agency (E-911) shall be
responsible for approving street and subdivision names or
designating names appropriate to subdivision development (see Appendix
B)
(b) Date, approximate north point, and graphic scale.
(c) The location of existing and platted property lines, streets, buildings,

Revised 04/18/2019
modifications will be indicated.
4. The approval of the preliminary plat by the planning commission will not constitute
acceptance of the final plat and will not be indicated on the preliminary
sketch plat.
5. Failure of the planning commission to act on the preliminary sketch plat
within sixty (60) days after being presented at the planning commission
meeting in accordance with subsections B.1 and B.2 of this Article will be
deemed approval of this plat, and a certificate to that effect shall be issued by
the commission on demand, provided, however, that the applicant may waive
this requirement and consent to the extension of such period.
6. The subdivider will be provided, in writing, a list of specific changes to be
made to the preliminary plat at the time of its approval or disapproval. One
copy will be maintained in the planning commission files.
7. The approval of the preliminary sketch plat shall lapses unless a final plat
based thereon is submitted within one year from the date of such approval
unless an extension of time is applied for and granted by the planning commission.
8. If the subdivision is going to be developed and submitted as final plats in
portions of the preliminary plat, the portions must be designated and titled in
alphabetical characters.

a departure or variance from the Subdivision Regulations, a specific request
must be made in writing for such variance and an explanation provided to
support the request.
Once preliminary plat approval has been granted, the plat should be submitted
to the engineering department in digital format as prescribed when available.
Any as-built changes for final plat should also be submitted to the engineering
department in this format.
10. Once preliminary plat approval has been granted and the site preparation
completed on those roads or sections of roads proposed for final approval, the
developers engineering representative shall certify in writing to the city that
the as built profiles conform to the approved preliminary design, or approved
changes (see paragraph 9, above).
C. Final Plat
1. The final plat shall conform substantially to the preliminary sketch plat as approved,
and; if desired by the subdivider, it may constitute only that portion
of the approved preliminary sketch plat which he proposed to record and develop
at the time, provided, however, that such portion conforms to all requirements
of these regulations. If a proposed subdivision fronts upon an existing
public road and conforms to all the City of Alcoas requirements, the
planning commission may waive the requirements for preliminary approval,
and permit the developer to submit only a final plat. At the time of the subAlcoa
Subdivision Regulations 13
Revised 04/18/2019
mission of the final plat for approval by the planning commission, the developer
shall also submit copies of all Federal and state permits required for constitution
of the development as shown on the approved preliminary sketch
plat.
2. To allow sufficient time for review and processing by the planning commission
and staff, the subdivider shall submit two (2) copies of the final plat and a
portable document format (pdf), together with street profiles or other plans
required by the planning commission, at least fifteen (15) days prior to the
meeting at which it is to be considered. The plat shall be drawn to a scale of

than one (1) sheet is required, an index sheet of the same size shall be filed
showing the entire subdivision with the streets lettered in alphabetical order
as a key. When the plat has been approved by the planning commission, one
(1) copy shall be returned to the subdivider with the approval of the planning
commission certified thereon for filing with the county register as the official
plat of record. Two (2) reproducible copies shall be retained in the records of
the planning commission and one (pdf), displaying all executed signature
blocks, will be provided each of the following: any utility department or utility
district applicable; fire department; public works department; 911-
Addressing; and, Blount County Geographic Information Systems (GIS).
3. The planning commission shall approve or disapprove the final plat within sixty
(60) days after its submission. Failure of the planning commission to act
on the final plat within these sixty (60) days shall be deemed approval of it.
If the plat is disapproved, the grounds of disapproval shall be stated upon the
records of the planning commission.
4. Approval of the final plat by the planning commission shall not constitute the
acceptance by the public of the dedication of any streets or other public way
or ground.
5. The final plat shall show:
a. The lines of all streets and roads, alley lines, lot lines, building setback
lines, lot numbered in numerical order, reservations, easements and

Revised 04/18/2019
ARTICLE III. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS AND MINIMUM STANDARDS OF DESIGN
A. Streets
1. Conformity to the Major Thoroughfare Plan
The location and width of all streets and roads shall conform to the official
Major Road Plan of the City of Alcoa, Tennessee and Alcoa Planning Region.
2. Relation to Adjoining Street System
The proposed street system shall extend existing streets within proposed projects
at the same or greater width, but in no case less than the required minimum
width. Where right-of-ways and street widths change from larger to
smaller, but still meet the minimum width, the existing section shall be continued
to the next available logical street intersection where it can be transitioned
into the appropriate standard.
3. Access Streets to Subdivision Boundaries
Sufficient access to adjoining properties shall be provided in subdivisions to
permit harmonious development of the area. However, the planning commission
may encourage multiple connections to adjacent properties if it can be
established that the access has a beneficial effect on both developments.
Connections that add significant traffic volumes to existing streets shall be
avoided unless it can be demonstrated that the existing street was designed
to handle such additional traffic.
4. Right-of-way and Pavement Widths, Utility-Construction-Drainage Easements
The minimum width of any right-of-way, measured from lot line to lot line. The
width of pavement is measured from pavement edge to pavement edge thus excluding
the curb and gutter section. There shall be a minimum ten (10) foot utility,
construction, and drainage easement along and outside all front right-of-way
lines. Additionally, there shall be a minimum ten (10) foot utility, construction, and
drainage easement along all rear lot lines and exterior boundaries. A minimum
five (5) foot utility, construction, and drainage easement shall be platted along all
side lot line boundaries. Standards are included for both right-of-way and pavement
width for applications falling within the jurisdiction of these regulations and
shall not be less than these ranges (as determined to be sufficient by the planning
commission) as follows:
a. Interstates*
Such streets consist of four lanes, or greater, may have a median or median barrier
with access fully controlled, are used for fast and heavy traffic relating to or
connecting different states, and are located on the Major Road Plan. Since these
are typically constructed by the State Department of Transportation, any specifications
for their construction must adhere to state requirements.
Alcoa Subdivision Regulations 20
Revised 04/18/2019
b. Expressways*
Such streets consist of four lanes, or greater, may have a median or median barrier
with access fully or partially controlled, are used for fast and heavy local or
regional traffic, and are located on the Major Road Plan. Since these are typically
constructed by the State Department of Transportation, any specifications for
their construction must adhere to state requirements.
c. Major Arterial Streets*
? right-of-way 100-120 feet
? street width (face of curb to face of curb) 26-28 feet
? median width (face of curb to face of curb) 14-30 feet
? curb & gutter (barrier type) 30 inches
? lane width (two or more through lanes,
each direction, center turn lane as required) 11-12 feet
? sidewalks, each side (as may be required) 5-12 feet
Such streets are used primarily for fast or heavy traffic and are located on the
Major Road Plan. A turning lane and boulevard median may be required if
deemed necessary for the protection of the motorist, especially at intersections
with other arterial or collector streets. If a boulevard median is used, as shown in
Diagram (1) below, such design and construction must meet Best Management
Practices (BMPs). The typical width of a median shall range in size from a minimum
of 14 feet to 30 feet, measured from face of curb to face of curb, with the
overall designed speeds and improvements a guiding factor.
Diagram (1)
Note: This above diagram is to give an example only. Modifications may be
considered and other facilities may be included.
d. Minor Arterial Streets*
? right-of-way 80-100 feet
? street width (face of curb to face of curb) 26-28 feet
? median width (face of curb to face of curb) 14-30 feet
Alcoa Subdivision Regulations 21
Revised 04/18/2019
? curb & gutter (barrior type) 30 inches
? lane width (two through lanes, each
direction, center turn lane as required) 11-12 feet
? sidewalks, each side 5-12 feet
Such streets are used primarily to handle moderate to high traffic speeds and
volumes. These streets should be reflected on the Major Road Plan. A turning
lane and boulevard median may be required if deemed necessary for the protection
of the motorist, especially at intersections with other arterial or collector
streets. If a boulevard median is used, as an example shown in Diagram (2) below,
such design and construction must meet Best Management Practices
(BMPs). The typical width of a median shall range in size from a minimum of 14
feet to 30 feet, measured from face of curb to face of curb, with the overall designed
speeds and improvements a guiding factor.
Diagram (2)
Note: This above diagram is to give an example only. Modifications may be
considered and other facilities may be included.
e. Major Collector Streets*
? right-of-way 60-80 feet
? street width (face of curb to face of curb) 24-28 feet
? median width (face of curb to face of curb) 14 feet
? curb & gutter (barrior type) 30 inches
? lane width (one or two through lanes, each
direction, center turning lane as required) 10-12 feet
? sidewalks, each side 5-12 feet
Such streets are used primarily to carry slow to moderate traffic speeds and volumes.
These streets act primarily as the transition between local traffic and
through traffic. These streets should be reflected on the Major Road Plan. A center
turning lane may be required if deemed necessary at intersections of arterial
and other collector streets. If a boulevard median is used within this type of
street classification, then said median shall be a minimum of 14 feet in width,
Alcoa Subdivision Regulations 22
Revised 04/18/2019
measured from face of curb to face of curb, with the overall designed speeds and
improvements a guiding factor. If used, such median design and construction
must meet Best Management Practices (BMPs).
f. Minor Collector Streets*
? right-of-way 60 feet
? street width (face of curb to face of curb) 24-28 feet
? median width (face of curb to face of curb) 14 feet
? curb & gutter (barrior type) 30 inches
? lane width (one through lane, each
direction, center turning lane as required) 10-12 feet
? sidewalks, each side 5-12 feet
Such streets are used primarily to carry slow traffic speeds and volumes. The
streets primarily serve the internal movements of residential areas to major collector
status streets. A center turning lane may be required if deemed necessary
at intersections of arterial and other collector streets. Minor collector streets differ
from local residential streets due to the higher traffic volumes. If a boulevard median
is used within this type of street classification, as shown below in Diagram
(3), then said median shall be a minimum of 14 feet in width, measured from face
of curb to face of curb, with the overall designed speeds and improvements a
guiding factor. If used, such median design and construction must meet Best
Management Practices (BMPs).
Diagram (3)
Note: This above diagram is to give an example only. Modifications may be
considered and other facilities may be included.
g. Local Residential*
? right-of-way 40-50 feet
Alcoa Subdivision Regulations 23
Revised 04/18/2019
? street width (face of curb to face of curb) 24-28 feet
? curb & gutter (rolled type) 30 inches
? lane width (one through lane, each
? direction) 10-12 feet
? sidewalks, each side 5 feet
Such streets are used primarily to serve individual residential lots. Typically, both
speeds and volumes are very slow. In such cases where local streets intersect
with arterial or collector streets, a center turning lane may be required if deemed
necessary.
h. Local Commercial Streets*
? right-of-way 50 feet
? street width (face of curb to face of curb) 24-28 feet
? curb & gutter (barrier type) 30 inches
? lane width (one through lane, each
direction) 10-12 feet
? sidewalks, each side 5-12 feet
Such streets are used primarily to serve individual commercial lots within a commercial
subdivision. Typically, such streets primarily carry slow to moderate traffic
speeds and volumes and act as the transition between local traffic and
through traffic. A center turning lane may be required if deemed necessary at intersections
of arterial and collector streets.
i. Frontage Roads*
? right-of-way or easement 40 feet
? street width (face of curb to face of curb) 24-28 feet
? curb and gutter (barrier type) 30 inches
? lane width (one through lane, each
direction) 10-12 feet
? sidewalks, one side (as may be required) 5 feet
Typically, access or frontage roads are used in commercial and/or multi-family
developments to facilitate internal traffic movements within a commercial complex
or reduce the overall number of curb cuts to higher status streets in multifamily
projects. Such frontage roads shall conform to the radius requirements, at
points of ingress and egress, on arterial streets, as specified in the Alcoa Zoning
Ordinance.
Note: In extreme cases where topography or other physical conditions make a
street of the required minimum width impractical, the planning commission may
modify the above referenced requirements.
j. Alleyway Streets*
? right-of-way 15-25 feet
Alcoa Subdivision Regulations 24
Revised 04/18/2019
? street width (pavement edge to pavement
edge) 10-20 feet
? curb & gutter (rolled type/residential or
barrier type/commercial, as may be required) 30 inches
? lane width (one through lane or two,
each direction) 10-12 feet
? sidewalks no
Such streets are used as an alternative access option to serve the rear and sides
of individual residential and commercial lots. Speeds and volumes are very slow.
These streets may be designed to have a lane width for one or two-way circulation.
k. Other street facilities and widths that may be utilized or required*
? boulevard medians (face of curb to face
of curb) 14-30 feet
? roundabouts (circle diameter ranges) 45-300 feet
? on-street parking 10 feet
? bike lanes 4-6 feet
*Please refer to the City of Alcoa adopted engineering standards for street design
and construction. In certain instances, where state and federal roadways may be involved,
adopted state and federal highway standards may apply.
5. Additional Right-of-way Widths on Existing Streets
Subdivisions that adjoin existing streets shall dedicate additional right-of-way
to meet the above minimum street width requirements.
a. The entire right-of-way shall be provided where any part of the subdivision
is on both sides of the existing street.
b. When the subdivision is located on only one side of the existing street,
one half (1/2) of the required width of the right-of-way, measured
from the centerline of the existing right-of-way, shall be provided.
6. Restriction of Access
Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed major street
the planning commission may require frontage roads, or such other treatment
as may be required to afford separation to through and local traffic.
Subdivisions abutting or containing an existing or proposed major street shall
comply with the provisions of Title 11, Section 11-1608 of the Alcoa Zoning
Ordinance.
a. Paved acceleration and deceleration lanes may be required along any
arterial or collector streets or highway at the determination of the
planning commission.
Alcoa Subdivision Regulations 25
Revised 04/18/2019
b. Frontage roads (roads which parallel the public streets giving access
and which extend along the entire frontage of particular properties)
shall be constructed in order to provide safe and efficient vehicular
movement between specified access points. All frontage roads shall be
dedicated as public streets or easements and shall be maintained by
the public.
c. Frontage roads shall be constructed in conformance with standards of
the subdivision regulations.
d. Items a through c of this subparagraph shall apply in their entirety to
commercial property having road frontage greater than the distance
between access points specified in the access ordinance. For commercial
property of lesser road frontage the planning commission may
waive or reduce requirements (i.e. require dedicated right-of-way or
easement for frontage roads rather than constructed frontage roads).
7. Street Grades
Grades on streets shall not exceed the following:
a. ARTERIAL STREETS AND HIGHWAYS 6%
b. COLLECTOR STREET 8%
c. LOCAL STREETS 10%
d. DEAD END AND LOOP STREETS 12%
8. Horizontal Curves
When a deflection angle of more than three degrees in the alignment of a
street occurs, the following radii shall be used:
a. ARTERIAL STREETS AND HIGHWAYS 600 feet
b. COLLECTOR STREETS 400 feet
c. LOCAL STREETS 150 feet
d. DEAD END AND LOOP STREETS 100 feet
9. Vertical Curves
Vertical curves shall conform to AASHTO stopping sight distance for the following
design speeds:
Design Speed
a. ARTERIAL STREETS AND HIGHWAYS 50 mph
b. COLLECTOR STREET 40 mph
c. LOCAL STREETS 35 mph
d. DEAD END AND LOOP STREETS 30 mph
10. Intersections
Street intersections shall be as nearly at right angles as possible, and no intersection
shall be at an angle of less than sixty (60) degrees.
Alcoa Subdivision Regulations 26
Revised 04/18/2019
To permit the construction of a curb having a desirable radius, property line
radii at all street intersections shall not be less than twenty-five (25) feet.
Where the angle of the street intersection is less than ninety (90) degrees,
the planning commission may require a greater radius.
All intersections of two or more streets shall have a grade that does not exceed
four percent (4%) at the following distance from the intersection of
street centerlines.
a. ARTERIAL STREETS AND HIGHWAYS 150 feet
b. COLLECTOR STREETS 100 feet

Street jogs of less than two hundred (200) feet shall not be allowed, except
where both intersecting streets are cul-de-sacs in which case the street jogs
with centerline offsets of less than one hundred, twenty-five (125) feet shall
not be allowed.
13. Dead End Streets
a. Local streets or courts designed to have one end permanently closed
shall be not more than eight-hundred (800) feet long unless necessitated
by topography. They shall be provided at the closed end with a
turn-around having an outside roadway diameter of at least eighty
(80) feet and a street right-of-way diameter of at least one hundred
(100) feet. In such cases, the service provider for each utility shall indicate
whether special connections, specific routing, additional easements
or other requirements need to be included to allow the approval
of extensions to the maximum cul-de-sac length.
b. Where, in the opinion of the planning commission, it is desirable to
provide for street access to adjoining property, proposed streets shall
be extended to the boundary of such property. Such dead end streets
shall be provided with a temporary turn-around having a roadway diameter
of at least eighty (80) feet, or hammerhead turn around. Such
temporary turn-arounds shall be constructed of a material allowing all
weather use. Other acceptable alternatives to design and surface
treatments on temporary turn-arounds may be approved by the city
engineer.
Alcoa Subdivision Regulations 27
Revised 04/18/2019
c. Where, in the opinion of the planning commission, it is desirable they
may limit the use of cul-de-sacs in an effort to provide connectivity for
the purpose of providing for the health, safety and welfare of its citizenry.
d. Islands may be allowed within cul-de-sacs, provided that such cul-desac
retain a turn-around having an outside roadway diameter of at
least eighty (80) feet and a street right-of-way diameter of at least
one hundred (100) feet, with the design to be approved by the City
Engineer. The design and construction of such islands must meet Best
Management Practices (BMPs).
14. Private Streets and Reserve Strips
There shall be no private street platted in any subdivision except as such private
streets shall be used as a portion of the parking lot and access to the
public right-of-way. The Alcoa Regional Planning Commission discourages the
construction of private streets. Every subdivided property shall be served
from a publicly dedicated street or by an appropriately recorded legal instrument
which allows any property owner not fronting on such legal access way
perpetual access to a public right-of-way. The City of Alcoa, Tennessee, shall
not be responsible for the maintenance of any private street or access way.
Further, the City shall have sole discretion in which services and/or utilities it
extends, if any, into any development with private streets. There shall be no
reserve strips controlling access to streets, except where the control of such
strips is definitely placed with the community under conditions approved by
the planning commission.
15. Drainage
All streets and roads must be so designed as to provide for the discharge of
surface water from the right-of-way of all streets and roads by grading and
drainage as shall be approved by the planning commission. Where water
cannot be adequately discharged by surface drainage, the planning commission
shall require the installation of a storm sewer. However, except for shallow
grassed swales, surface drainage will only be allowed along rear lot lines.
Street drainage may not be discharged down individual driveways or otherwise
cause potential flooding to residential structures.
A street shall not carry water for a distance greater than four hundred (400)
feet from the beginning point of the runoff. Discharge from the street shall
be handled by means of a catch basinthe number, size, type and location to
be determined by the city engineer. Pipes under the right-of-way, for purposes
of discharging water into the pipe, must be no less than eighteen (18)
inches in diameter and be carried the full width of the public right-of-way.
Such pipe shall be made of concrete. Drainage shall not discharge into a
sinkhole as a means of an outlet for runoff, unless the depression has a storage
capacity for a five hundred (500) year flood without flooding any adjacent
properties, or creating overflow runoff that will adversely affect existing
drainage courses.
Alcoa Subdivision Regulations 28
Revised 04/18/2019
If the sinkhole is used for storage, as outlined above, the area shall be dedicated
as public land and fully enclosed with an eight (8) foot security fence
with two (2) - six (6) foot double-wide lockable gates before any building
permits are granted or lots sold. Standards for the construction of any drainage
ditch/swale shall be according to those established by the City Public
Works Department, and must meet approval of the city engineer.
16. Street Names
Proposed streets which are obviously in alignment with others already existing
and names shall bear the names of existing streets. In no case shall the
name for proposed streets duplicate existing street names, irrespective of the
use of the suffix street, avenue, boulevard, drive, place or court. The Blount
County E-11 shall have the power to approve or disapprove street names and
if necessary determine and may assign names to public right-of-ways on
submitted plats.
17. Street Elevations
The planning commission may require, where necessary, profiles and elevations
of streets for determination of proximity to flood plains. No street shall
be approved for construction within a floodplain if it is proposed to be constructed
more than one (1) foot below the elevation of the one hundred (100)
year flood as defined in Article III, Section E. Fill may be used for streets
provided such fill does not increase upstream flood heights. Drainage openings
shall be so designed as to not restrict the flow of floodwaters or increase
upstream flood heights.
18. Off-site Traffic Impact Analysis
When applicable, the city engineer may require an analysis of the off-site traffic
impact of a development. Total new trip generation, peak movements at
key intersections, and an overall impact analysis will be required of the developer,
to determine what off-site improvements might be required.
B. Blocks
1. Length
a. Blocks shall not be less than four hundred (400) feet nor more than
twelve hundred (1,200) feet in length, except as the planning commission
considers necessary to secure efficient use of land or desired
features of street pattern. In blocks over eight hundred (800) feet in
length, the planning commission may require one (1) or more public
crosswalks of not less than ten (10) feet in width to extend entirely
across the block and at locations deemed necessary.
b. In the Mixed Use District E-3, a block structure that reflects a walkable
arrangement and positioning of uses, thus a pedestrian-oriented
layout, requires that blocks not be less than two hundred (200) feet
nor more than five hundred (500) feet. A pedestrian pass-through
connecting opposite sides of intersecting blocks, in lieu of vehicular access
(or a combination thereof), would satisfy the separation between
blocks.
Alcoa Subdivision Regulations 29
Revised 04/18/2019
2. Width
Blocks shall be wide enough to allow two tiers of lots of minimum depth, except
where fronting on major streets or prevented by topographical conditions
or size of the property, in which case the planning commission may approve a
single tier of lots of minimum depth.
C. Lots
1. Slope of Lots
Slope of lots from the street right-of-way and property lines to the required
set back line should not exceed that of twenty-five (25) percent grade.
Where slopes are not cut, the natural topography should prevail.
2. Arrangement
Insofar as practical, side lot lines shall be at right angles to straight street
lines or radial to curved street lines. Each lot must front for a minimum of fifty
(50) feet upon a public street or road.
3. Minimum Size
The size, shape and orientation of lots shall be such as the planning commission
deems appropriate for the type of development and use contemplated.
Where public water and sanitary sewer systems are reasonably accessible,
the subdivider shall connect with such systems and provide a connection or
connections to each lot. Where a public sewer is not accessible, an alternate
method of sewerage disposal may be used, when meeting al applicable public
health regulations of the Blount County Health Department.
a. The following applies to residential lots for single-family and multifamily
dwelling units served by both water and sanitary sewer:
(1) Single-family Dwelling Units
Residential lots served by public water and sanitary sewer systems
for single-family dwelling units shall not be less than fifty
(50) to seventy-five (75) feet wide at the building setback line,
nor less than five thousand (5,000) to fifteen thousand
(15,000) square feet in total size, which shall be dependent upon,
but not limited to, available utilities, topography, traffic
generation and its impact on the adjacent road system, zoning
district minimums, and also future land use considerations.
(2) Two-Family and Multi-family Dwelling Units
Residential lots served by public water and sanitary sewer systems
for two-family and multi-family dwelling units shall not be
less than the requirements as set forth within the applicable
zoning district, which shall be dependent upon, but not limited
to, available utilities, topography, traffic generation and its imAlcoa
Subdivision Regulations 30
Revised 04/18/2019
pact on the adjacent road system, and also future land use
considerations.
(3) Exceptions
This part is not to limit the minimum lot widths and sizes within
zoning districts established for planned or mixed use developments.
The minimum lots widths and sizes for planned or mixed
use developments shall be per the applicable zoning districts,
which shall be dependent upon, but not limited to, available
utilities, topography, traffic generation and its impact on the
adjacent road system, and also future land use considerations.
b. The following applies to residential lots for single-family and multifamily
dwelling units not served by sanitary sewer:
(1) Single-family Dwelling Units
Residential lots not served by sanitary sewer systems for single-
family dwelling units shall not be less than seventy-five
(75) feet wide at the building setback line nor less than thirty
thousand (30,000) square feet for each dwelling unit.
(2) Two-Family and Multi-family Dwelling Units
In cases where multiple dwelling units may be located on the
same lot, the lot shall then be no less than thirty thousand
(30,000) square feet for each dwelling unit.
(3) Modifications
The planning commission may require greater lot areas for residential
lots, when said is indicated by data from percolation
tests and investigations. The determination of any lot area increase
shall be by the city or county health officer and soil scientist
after investigation of the soil conditions, the proposed
sewerage system and the depth of the ground water.
c. The minimum size of residential lots to be served by private source of
water supply shall be determined by the county health officer after investigation
of soil conditions, proposed sewerage system and depth of
ground water.
d. Size of properties reserved or laid out for commercial or industrial use
shall be adequate to provide for the off-street service and parking facilities
required by the type of use and development contemplated.
Platting of individual lots should be avoided in favor of an overall design
of the land to be used for such purposes.
e. The sizes and widths of lots shall in no case be less than the minimum
required by any zoning ordinance in effect.
Alcoa Subdivision Regulations 31
Revised 04/18/2019
4. Building Setback Lines and Yard Requirements
All such requirements shall conform to the Alcoa Zoning Ordinance. In the
event a developer desires to place on record a minimum building line, which
is over and above that required by the zoning classification, such building setback
line must be denoted on each of the lots platted, as well as appear in the
plat notes.
In the case of electric transmission lines where easements are not definitely
established, there shall be a minimum building setback line from the center of
the transmission line as follows:
VOLTAGE MINIMUM DEPTH BUILDING SETBACK LINE FROM
OF LINE CENTER OF TRANSMISSION LANE*
? 46 KV 38 feet
? 69 KV 50 feet
? 161 KV & over 75 feet
*As revised by utility regulations
5. Corner Lots
Corner lots shall be sufficiently wider and larger to permit the additional side
yard requirements of the zoning ordinance or building setback lines as outlined
above.
6. Identification Stakes
In subdivisions of ten or more lots, all lots approved by the panning commission,
by either final approval or bonding, shall be identified in the following
manner: A minimum stake size of one (1) inch times (x) four (4) inch, nominal,
with a minimum above-ground length dimension of twenty-four (24)
inches; to be painted white with red or black numbers (the numbers to be not
less than two inches tall); and to be located on the front right-of-way, between
lots. These stakes must be erected at the time of final approval and
shall be maintained by the developer for a period of two years. After the initial
two (2) year maintenance period, a stake must be erected by the applicant
at the time a building permit is issued and remain through the issuance
of a certificate of occupancy. This is in addition to the corner pins set by surveyor.
D. Community Open Space, Public Use and Service Areas
1. Community Open Space
a. Purpose and Intent
These regulations are established to provide for the minimum community
open space needs of the residents of new subdivisions; to assure
adequate maintenance of community open space and facilities, to provide
for attractive and stable residential areas, to protect and enhance
Alcoa Subdivision Regulations 32
Revised 04/18/2019
the natural resources and environment; and to implement the recreation
element and other applicable elements of the Comprehensive Plan
of the City of Alcoa.
b. Applicability
The subsection shall apply to all developments subject to subdivision
plat approval pursuant to these regulations.
c. Definition
For the purpose of this section, the following definition shall apply unless
the context otherwise requires:
Community Open Space means that open space that is designed and
improved for recreational use and/or open space that is designed or
preserved to enhance the visual, mental and physical enjoyment of the
residents of a subdivision and/or the community at large. Community
open space may be located on or off the subdivision site, but shall be
reasonably accessible to all dwelling units therein. Land designated as
community open space shall be suitable for active and/or passive recreational
use and may include playgrounds, tot lots, lakes, greenbelts,
bikeways, pedestrian paths, exercise trails, recreational club houses,
swimming pools, tennis courts and similar facilities. Community open
space shall not be deemed to include required minimum yards or other
areas as required by these or other applicable regulations of the town,
including but not limited to permanent structures used for the storage
or direction of water courses.
d. Required Community Open Space
(1) Amount
At least five (5) percent, of the gross area of a subdivision, or
one (1) developed lot, whichever is greater, shall be devoted to
community open space. In instances in which one (1) developed
lot would constitute more than fifteen (15) percent of the
gross area of the subdivision, the planning commission may
make a determination that an area of less than one (1) developed
lot may serve to meet the intent of these regulations. In
those cases where the gross area of a subdivision is less than
ten (10) acres, the developer may make a cash contribution
equivalent to the average lot value.
The planning commission may waive the required amount of
community open space in situations of minor revisions to existing,
recorded subdivided lots or in cases where the proposed
subdivision is completing the in-fill process and has no contiguous
area available for additional incremental subdivision. In
such cases, the developer will make a cash contribution equivalent
to the average lot value. This contribution will go to a
neighborhood park endowment for the City of Alcoa.
Alcoa Subdivision Regulations 33
Revised 04/18/2019
(a) Dedication to the City
The required community open space may be offered for
dedication to the City.
(b) Common Ownership by a Property Owners Organization
The required community open space may be held in
common ownership by a property owners organization
under the following circumstances:
In instances where developers chose to make significant
recreational improvements to the required community
open space, or post a performance bond, in accordance
with Article IV, Section B., of these regulations, and has
established a property owners association in a form acceptable
to the planning commission and city attorney.
(c) Dedication and Common Ownership
In certain instances, the planning commission may determine
that the community open space needs of the
subdivision are best served by portions of such space
being dedicated to the city with other portions of such
space being held in common ownership by a property
owners organization.
(2) Composition of Community Open Space
The primary intent of requiring community open space to be included
as part of a subdivision is to provide adequate space
suitable for development as neighborhood park areas. The
planning commission recognizes, however, that a subdivision
may have unique features in terms of age composition, family
size, or unique environmental, topographical and historic properties.
Therefore, the planning commission may determine that
all or a portion of the required community open space may be
devoted to areas other than those expressly suited for development
as active park areas. The following is a guide to be
used by the planning commission in determining the extent to
which areas other than those suitable for development as
neighborhood park areas may be used in fulfilling the community
open space requirement.
(a) Greenbelt Areas
For such areas to be considered in fulfilling the requirement for
community open space, the areas must be at least twenty-five
(25) feet in width. While no specifications are outlined for the
composition in terms of existing or installed plant materials, it
must be clearly demonstrated that the goals of preserving
community open space that will enhance visual, mental and
physical enjoyment will be achieved. The area devoted to
greenbelt areas shall be counted on a square foot for square
Alcoa Subdivision Regulations 34
Revised 04/18/2019
foot basis toward fulfilling the community open space requirement.
(b) Bike Paths, Pedestrian Paths, and Exercise Trails
(1) Where appropriate, bicycle/pedestrian paths shall be
constructed within the public right-of-way, as road improvements
are made.
(2) Developers shall be advised when a path included in the
citys overall plan is located within a proposed development,
and said development shall incorporate such path
as a part of the developers open space/amenities package.
Developers will be required to construct an eight
(8) to ten (10) foot path, as determined by the planning
commission.
(3) Bicycle/pedestrian paths shall be separated into lots of a
width of twenty (20) to thirty (30) feet, as determined
by the planning commission. Such lots shall be deeded,
in fee simple, to the city to insure a continual linkage of
public access and to insure the maintenance of such
paths. The planning commission may grant a variance
to this requirement, but shall ensure access and maintenance
in some other manner.
(4) An asphalt trail shall be constructed in compliance with
the construction standards of the City of Alcoa Public
Works Department. Standard bikeway markers and
signs shall be utilized, at the correct height, as well as
utilizing the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices.
(c) Landscaped Entrances
When more than two thousand (2,000) square feet are devoted
to identify the entrance to a subdivision, the area shall be
counted on a square foot per square foot basis toward fulfilling
the community open space requirement. The maximum
amount that can be counted toward fulfilling the community
open space requirement shall be four thousand (4,000) square
feet for each entrance.
(d) Boulevards and Other Street Improvements
Street improvements, such as boulevards, medians and related
additional rights-of-way greater than that required by these or
other regulations may be used toward fulfilling the community
open space requirement. The area in excess of that required
may be counted toward the required community open space on
a square foot for square foot basis.
(e) Other Areas
Alcoa Subdivision Regulations 35
Revised 04/18/2019
In some instances, subdivisions may contain certain unique
natural or man-made features that may allow such areas to
qualify as meeting the intent of these regulations in providing
community open space. In such cases, the planning commission
may consider such areas as counting toward fulfilling the
community open space requirement and may determine the
square footage which may be counted toward fulfilling this requirement.
(3) Plans
Community open space areas proposed for dedication to the city
and/or to be held in common ownership by a property owners organization
shall be indicated on the preliminary and final plat. When the
area is proposed to be held in common ownership by a property owners
organization, plans and documents relating to its improvement
and maintenance shall be included for review as set out in these regulations.
a. General Requirement
All required community open space shall either be dedicated to
the city or be held in common ownership by a property owners
organization.
(1) Dedication to City
Dedication of community open space shall be in a form
acceptable to the planning commission and City Attorney
prior to final plat approval and presentation to the City
for acceptance.
(2) Common Ownership by a Property Owners Organization
Prior to approval of the final subdivision plat, the developer
shall provide documents and other assurances satisfactory
to the planning commission and City Attorney,
establishing a means of common ownership and management,
as well as the continued maintenance and any
penalties for non-maintenance, of all common open
space and recreational improvements.
2. Easements for Drainage, Utilities, and Construction
Drainage, construction and utility easements shall be provided on each side,
front and rear lot lines or where deemed necessary by the planning commission.
The interior lot lines shall have no less than five (5) feet designations
on each side of a lot, and front and rear easements shall be no less than ten
(10) feet on each side of the lot line. Ten (10) foot easements shall be provided
along public rights-of-way to adequately provide for any construction to
be performed within these easements, and shall be for the sole use of the City
of Alcoa and its agents. Additionally, the front, rear and side easements shall
be designed to adequately provide utilities and drainage for all lots in the proposed
subdivision. Where drainage is proposed to cross any lot at any point
Alcoa Subdivision Regulations 36
Revised 04/18/2019
other than the side or corner of the lot, the plat shall indicate the size of the
easement necessary to carry the proposed runoff. Each cul-de-sac shall have
provisions for a ten (10) foot utility easement extending therefrom to prevent
dead end water mains. Easements of the same dimensions or greater width
may be required by the planning commission along the lines of or across lots
where necessary for the extension of existing utilities, planned utilities or for
the movement of town equipment.
a. Coordinating Work Within Drainage, Utility, and Construction Easements
Drainage, utility and construction easements are designed to provide
access for such public improvements as street widening, stormwater
drainage, the installation of sidewalks and water, sewer, telephone and
cable lines, etc. These improvements may involve public and private
utilities, including cable companies, the City of Alcoa, and state and
federal agencies. Coordination between each of these interests is imperative.
To ensure coordination, the City of Alcoa maintains complete control of
the drainage, utility, and construction easements. Therefore, whether
a public/private utility, or state or federal agency, any entity performing
work within these drainage and utility easements must submit
plans to the City of Alcoa and receive written approval of those plans
prior to undertaking such work. Work may not begin without first obtaining
City of Alcoa approval. Construction easements, to be located
along public rights-of-way, are for the sole use of the City of Alcoa and
its agents.
3. Easements for Signs/Landscaped Entrances
To provide for the maximum safety of persons using sidewalks and streets,
and to ensure that a sign or landscaping will not obstruct the vision at elevations
between two and one-half (2 ½) feet and seven (7) feet above the
crown of the adjacent roadway, no sign structure (nor landscaping greater
than thirty (30) inches in height) may be placed within a visibility triangle,
created by measuring twenty-five (25) feet from the rights-of-way intersection
along each right-of-way (see illustration 1). Additionally, to prohibit the
location of signs within visibility triangles, in new subdivisions where a
ground-mounted sign(s) is proposed, all subdivision plats must denote a platted
sign easement outside of the visibility triangle (see page 36, Figure 36A.
Alcoa Subdivision Regulations 37
Revised 04/18/2019
Visibility Triangles
Figure 36A
Once a subdivision plat with sign easement has been approved and recorded,
all new subdivision signs must be located within the platted sign easement.
4. Storm Sewers
Where in the opinion of the planning commission the flow of water cannot be
accommodated with surface drainage, storm sewers will be required. However,
except for shallow grassed swales, surface drainage will only be
allowed along rear lot lines. It shall be the responsibility of the developers
engineer to determine, on the basis of the watershed and the probable runoff,
the size of the storm sewers. In ascertaining the size of the storm sewers,
the planning commission may call upon its technical staff or any public or private
agency to assist it in its determinations.
5. Water Supply and Sewerage Connection
Where a development or a subdivision lies within the current service area of
the communitys water utility, but immediate connection is not possible, the
subdivider shall extend the appropriate size water and sewer lines to the development
or subdivision.
All lots less than twenty thousand (20,000) square feet shall be serviced by
both public water and sewer facilities. In subdividing lots of greater than
twenty thousand (20,000) square feet where public water and/or sewer is not
available, the subdivision plan must be submitted to the Blount County Health
Department (Environmental Health) for approval. Such approval must be certified
by the health department prior to final plat subdivision approval.
6. Community Assets
Alcoa Subdivision Regulations 38
Revised 04/18/2019
In all subdivisions due regard shall be shown for all natural features such as
large trees, water courses, historical sites and similar community assets
which, if preserved, will add attractiveness and value to the property.
E. Suitability of the Land
1. Public Agency Approval
The planning commission shall not approve the subdivision of land if, from
adequate investigations conducted by all public agencies concerned, it has
been determined that in the best interest of the public the site is not suitable
for platting and development purposes of the land proposed, unless adequate
methods are formulated by the developer for meeting the problems created
by the subdivision of the land. The planning commission shall not approve
what it considers to be scattered or premature subdivision of land involving
danger or injury to the health, safety or prosperity by reason of lack of water
supply, schools, proper drainage, good transportation and roads or other public
services, or would necessitate an excessive expenditure of public funds for
the supply of such services (such as undue maintenance costs for adequate
roads).
2. Land Subject to Flooding
a. Land within any (F) Floodway District shall not be platted for
residential occupancy or other building site and shall not be raised by
fill. Other lands subject to flood may be platted for use only if filled to
such height as will secure a building site at least one (1) foot above
the level of the base flood elevation (the five hundred (500) year
flood), based on data submitted by the subdivider and prepared by a
licensed engineer, provided such fill does not endanger life or property,
restrict the flow of floodwaters, or result in increased flood heights.
The following standards shall be applied in reviewing subdivision proposals
involving land within a (F) Floodway District:
(1) All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to
minimize flood damage;
(2) All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities,
such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and
constructed to minimize flood damage;
(3) All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided
to reduce exposure to flood hazards; and,
(4) Base flood elevation data (utilizing the five hundred (500) year
flood boundary) shall be provided for all subdivision proposals
and all other proposed developments, including manufactured
home parks and subdivisions.
b. Floodway  The channel of a stream or other watercourse and the adjacent
land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the five
Alcoa Subdivision Regulations 39
Revised 04/18/2019
hundred (500) year flood without cumulatively increasing the water
surface elevation more than one foot.
c. Land Subject to Flooding  is defined as areas along streams, watercourses,
and low areas identified as having special flood hazards by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or land lying within
fifteen (15) feet of the top of the bank of the channel (measured
horizontally) along small streams and drainage channels unless the
developer demonstrates to the satisfaction of the planning commission
that the property in question is free from danger of inundation by the
five hundred (500) year flood or that adequate remedial measures
have been taken to allow the watercourse to safely accommodate the
five hundred (500) year flood.
In applying this provision, land below the elevation of the Regional
Flood on Pistol Creek, the 1875 Flood on the Little River upstream
from river mile 7.5, the TVA Structure Profile on the Tennessee River
in the Alcoa Regional Planning Commission reach and the TVA Structure
Profile and extension on the Little River from the mouth upstream
to river mile 7.5, shall be considered subject to flood. The elevation of
the Regional Flood on Pistol Creek shall be determined from the chart,
High Water Profiles, Pistol Creek Mouth to Maryville, Tennessee
(Tennessee Valley Authority, April 1964). The elevation of the TVA
Structure Profile and the 1875 Flood on the Little River shall be determined
from the chart, High Waters Profiles, Little River, Vicinity of
Maryville-Alcoa River Mile 0 to 15 (Tennessee Valley Authority, April
1964). The elevation of the TVA Structure Profile on the Tennessee
River shall be determined from the chart High Water Profiles, Tennessee
River, Vicinity of Maryville-Alcoa, Tennessee, River Mile 625 to
639, (Tennessee Valley Authority, April 1964). These charts are on
file in the Alcoa Municipal Building.
Areas included in the Floodway Districts are as shown on the charts,
Proposed Floodway, Pistol Creek, Mouth to Maryville, Tennessee (Alcoa
Regional Planning Commission, August 1960), Floodway, Little
River Mile 5 to 16, Vicinity of Alcoa, Tennessee,: (Alcoa Regional Planning
Commission, April 1964), Tennessee River Mile 622 to 639, Little
River Mile 0 to 5, Vicinity of Maryville-Alcoa, Tennessee (Alcoa Regional
Planning Commission, April 1964), and Alcoa, Tennessee Flood
Study (Tennessee Valley Authority, June 1989), which charts are
made a part of these regulations.
(1) Along Small Streams and Watercourses
The developer, or other designated public officials, shall determine, on
the basis of the watershed area and the probable runoff for the five
hundred (500) year flood, the waterway area required to safely pass
floodflows, or how close a structure may be located to the stream, and
minimum floor elevations. All structures shall be located at least thirty-
five (35) feet from the top of the bank of the channel (measured
horizontally), unless it is demonstrated to the Alcoa Regional Planning
Alcoa Subdivision Regulations 40
Revised 04/18/2019
Commission that a lesser distance but not less than twenty-five (25)
feet is adequate based on engineering information.
(2) Along all Other Watercourses
All lands lying within thirty-five (35) feet of the top of the bank of the
channel (measured horizontally), unless it is demonstrated to the Alcoa
Regional Planning Commission that a lesser distance but not less
than twenty-five (25) feet is adequate based on engineering information.
3. Methods Formulated for Determination of Unsuitable Land.
The planning commission shall not approve land unsuitable for subdivision
due to flooding, bad drainage, steep slopes, rock formation or other features
likely to be harmful to the health, safety and general welfare of the future
residents unless adequate methods are formulated by the developer for meeting
the problems created by the subdivision of such land. Such land within
any plat shall be set aside for such uses as shall not be endangered by periodic
or occasional inundation or uses which shall not produce unsatisfactory
living conditions.
F. Large Tracts or Parcels
When land is subdivided into larger parcels than ordinary building lots, such parcels
shall be arranged so as to allow for the opening of future streets and logical further
resubdivision.
G. Variances
Variances may be granted under the following conditions:
1. Where the subdivider can show that strict adherence to these regulations
would cause unnecessary hardship (i.e., topographical problems or other such
unusual circumstances that the property cannot be reasonably used without
a variance or a taking would occur), or
2. Where the planning commission decides that there are topographical or other
conditions peculiar to the site and a departure from these regulations will not
destroy their intent.
3. Any variance granted shall be by 2/3 vote of the membership of the planning
commission, and shall be stated in writing in the minutes of the planning
commission.
H. Zoning and Other Regulations
No final plat of land within the force and effect of an existing zoning ordinance will be
approved unless it conforms with the zoning ordinance.
Alcoa Subdivision Regulations 41
Revised 04/18/2019
Whenever there is a discrepancy between minimum standards or dimensions noted
herein and those contained in the zoning regulations, building code, or other official
regulations, the highest standard shall apply.

ARTICLE IV. DEVELOPMENT PREREQUISITE TO FINAL APPROVAL
A perfectly prepared and recorded subdivision or plat means little to a prospective lot buyer
until he can see actual physical transformation of raw acreage into lots suitable for building
purposes and human habitation. Improvements by the subdivider spare the community
from a potential tax liability.
No approval for a preliminary and/or a final plat shall be considered by the planning commission
for an applicant who, prior to approval of the preliminary and/or final plat, is in violation
of any other pertinent sections of the Alcoa Municipal Code, ordinances, or Alcoa Subdivision
Regulations of the City of Alcoa in any development within the City of Alcoa.
The following tangible improvements are required before final plat approval, in order to assure
the physical reality of a subdivision, which approval and recordation will establish legally.
A. Required Improvements
Every subdivision developer shall be required to grade and improve streets and alleys,
to install curbs, gutters, sidewalks, sewers, storm water sewerage and structures
and water mains, and all other appropriate utilities and to provide community
open space, in accordance with specifications established in this and other sections
of these regulations. Where specifications adopted by the City or other local or state
agencies conflict with standards and specifications set forth in these regulations, the
higher set of standards or specifications, as determined by the planning commission,
shall govern.
1. Monuments
a. Iron pins shall be set at all street right-of-way corners, at all points
where the street right-of-way lines intersect the exterior boundaries of
the subdivision, and at angle points and points of curve in each street.
b. All other corners and points shall be marked with iron pipe or solid
steel rod not less than three-fourths (3/4) inches in diameter and
twenty-four (24) inches long and driven so as to be flush with the finished
grade.
2. Grading
All streets and roads shall be graded or filled horizontally to the full width of
their rights-of-way by the subdivider or developer. Due to special topographical
conditions, deviation from the above will be allowed only with special approval
of the planning commission.
a. PreparationBefore grading is started, the entire right-of-way area
shall be cleared of all trees, stumps, roots, brush and other objectionable
materials.
b. CutsAll tree stumps, boulders and other obstructions shall be removed
to a depth of two (2) feet below the subgrade. Rock, when enAlcoa
Subdivision Regulations 43

subgrade.
c. Fill and BackfillAll fill material shall be free of waste or organic matter
and shall not contain any rock exceeding eight (8) inches in maximum
dimension. Material shall be placed in layers of not more than
six (6) inches and compacted to ninety-five percent (95%) of maximum
density using AASHTO Designation T 99 Standard Method. All
unsatisfactory material in the subgrade shall be removed to a depth of
not less than two (2) feet below subgrade and refilled with suitable
material.
d. Subgrade CompactionThe top eight (8) inches of the entire subgrade
(cuts and fills) shall be compacted to the fill requirements.
3. Storm Drainage (See Article III, A, 15)
An adequate drainage system, including storm sewers, necessary open ditches,
pipes, culverts, intersectional drains, drop inlets, bridges, etc., shall be
provided for the proper drainage of all surface water.
a. All pipe shall be either reinforced concrete, corrugated metal, or corrugated
plastic. Other materials may be approved on a case-by-case
basis by the city engineer. All storm sewers beneath public roads shall
be reinforced concrete.
b. All culverts over twenty-four (24) inches shall be carried to the rightof-
way limits and be constructed with suitable headwalls, and culverts
less than twenty-four (24) inches shall be constructed with tapered
ends or endwalls.
c. Specific plans for accommodating storm runoff including, but not limited
to, the following information: the locations, sizes, and profiles of
storm drains and culverts; data and computations used in making the
determinations of the sizes of storm drains and culverts; and other
pertinent information necessary in dealing with storm drainage problems
shall be submitted to the planning commission. Drainage facilities
shall be designed to prevent flooding or ponding on building sites.
Sites for septic tanks and drainfields shall be indicated on the drainage
plans.
For specifications, please refer to the Alcoa Public Works Standards.
4. Roadway Improvements
Shall be as defined by the standards of the Public Works Department of the
City of Alcoa. The subdivider shall provide extruded curbs and gutters as

8. Erosion Control
The planning commission shall require that all new development to be in conformance
with the grading, soil erosion and sedimentation control regulations
as set forth by the City of Alcoa, Tennessee, the State of Tennessee, or other
regulatory agency.
An erosion control bond is required prior to the issuance of a grading permit
by the city engineer. The amount will be determined by the city engineer at
his (her) discretion based on area disturbed, surrounding area, and nearby
waterways.
9. Street and Traffic Signs
Street name signs shall be placed appropriately by the developer or subdivider
in new subdivisions. The subdivider shall provide and install street and
stop signs where indicated by the city, with said signs to conform to city
standards.
10. Sidewalks
a. Sidewalks shall be built on both sides of all new streets of residential
subdivisions of average lot areas ranging from 10,000 to 15,000
square feet and greater. Sidewalks will not be required in the subdivision

five (5) lots (or where there is street construction planned/scheduled.
In such cases, some form of financial assurance will be required to install
said sidewalk at a later date).
b. Sidewalks shall be located no less than one (1) foot from the property
line (in the right-of-way) to prevent interference or an encroachment
by fencing, walks, hedges or other plantings or structures placed on
the property line at a later date. In residential zones there shall be a

is issued.
Alcoa Subdivision Regulations 46
Revised 04/18/2019
11. The applicant shall place with the City of Alcoa some form of financial assurance
which covers roads, drainage, erosion control and sidewalk construction
(the facilities). The purpose of this assurance is to pay for or reimburse the
city for the cost of any maintenance or repair required to be made (in the sole
opinion of the city engineer) to the facilities during the two (2) year period
following the completion of construction of the facilities, which have not been
repaired by or at the expense of the constructing contractor. Such amount
shall be determined on a project by project basis. The city engineer will provide
the planning commission staff and applicant with the appropriate amount
based on the size and complexity of the project. Such financial assurance
shall be for a period of two (2) years. If all deficiencies have not been repaired
by the end of the two (2) year period, the applicant may petition the
planning commission to extend the financial assurance. Typically, the city will
entertain such financial instruments which include but are not limited to the
following financial assurance: surety bond, escrow agreement, letter of credit
or cash. The financial assurance shall be approved by the planning commission
staff prior to the planning commission secretarys signature being affixed
to the final plat, with commencement of the two (2) year maintenance period
beginning upon written notice of acceptance or approval of the city engineer.
12. The applicant may be required to place a public road/drainage financial assurance
instrument with the city prior to the issuance of a grading permit, to ensure
the maintenance and safety of existing improvements. The amount will
be set by the city engineer at his (her) discretion based on adjacent street
condition and/or presence, nature, and conditions of nearby drainage structures,
and other location specific appropriate considerations. The assurance
may be cashed by the city to pay for repairs or maintenance to the existing
streets and/or rights-of-way or drainage structures damaged as a result of
the new construction and/or transportation of materials to a construction site.
Such assurance will only be valid throughout the construction period. End of
construction period shall be evidenced by the last to occur of signatures on final
plat or release of any completion bonds. The city may accept appropriate
financial instruments which include but are not limited to the following: surety
bond, escrow agreement, letter of credit or cash. In the event repairs are
necessary, the city reserves the right to issue a stop work order on activities
related to said construction determined to be causing damage which shall remain
effective until released by the city engineer.

for recordation by the county register of deeds until the required improvements
listed or agreed upon are constructed in a satisfactory manner and approved by the
planning commission.
In lieu of completed improvements, the planning commission on behalf of the City of
Alcoa may accept any of the following methods of bonding cost whereby improvements
may be made and utilities installed without cost to the City of Alcoa in the
event of default by the subdivider or developer. Method of bonding cost will be deAlcoa
Subdivision Regulations 47
Revised 04/18/2019
termined by the developer and the planning staff, approved by the planning commission.
1. A surety bond or performance bond, from the subdivider or developer, to the
City of Alcoa in the full amount of the estimated cost of improvements plus
fifteen percent (15%) administrative and inflationary cost required under the
subdivision regulations.
2. A certified check posted with the City of Alcoa for the full amount of the estimated
cost of installing all required improvements with a fifteen percent
(15%) administrative and inflationary cost added to the total cost.
3. An escrow account opened with the City of Alcoa in the full amount of the estimated
cost of all required improvements with a fifteen percent (15%) administrative
and inflationary cost added to the total cost.
4. A notarized letter of credit from a federally insured lending institution submitted
to the City of Alcoa in the full amount of the estimated cost of required
improvements with a fifteen percent (15%) administrative and inflationary
cost added to the total cost.
The conditions of each bond shall provide for a default thereof if the improvements
covered by such bond have not been approved and accepted by the City of Alcoa
within a period of not to exceed twelve (12) months proved, however, that such period
may be extended by the planning commission with the consent of the parties
thereto if the planning commission finds that the public interest will not be adversely
affected by such extension. If the planning commission shall decide at any time during
the bond that the extent of the building development that has taken place in the
subdivision is not sufficient to warrant all the improvements covered by such bond,
that required improvements have been installed as provided in this section in sufficient
amount to warrant reduction in the face amount of said bond, or that the character
and the extent of such development requires additional improvements, then
the face value of such bond shall thereupon be reduced or increased by the determined
amount so the new face value of the bond will reflect the cost of improvements
or savings to the developer or subdivider.

APENDIX B
GUIDE TO STREET NAMING AND SUFFIXING
Names
Streets within a subdivision or other general area should be named somewhat systematically,
for example:
Subdivision Theme for Street Name
Country Manor Trees native to the region
Sugar Wood Estates Names of States
Confederate Hills Southern Generals
Valley View Mountains of the Smokies
London Town Estates Names of English Towns
Names should be simple, easy to spell and pronounce, and sufficiently dissimilar to others in
the urban area to avoid confusion.
Arteries should be named, if after a town or other area to which they lead, after a place sufficiently
distant that the artery will not have two names within the urban area. Collectors
are appropriately named after the subdivision itself, the general area in which located, or
other name denoting generality. Minor streets are best named with specific examples of the
general name of the collector, which they intersect.
Suffixes  Street suffixes should conform generally with the common understanding of their
meaning and should relate to the classification of the street to which applied and the nature
of the area through which they pass, as follows:
Avenue  A thoroughfare running principally in a north-south direction and usually terminates
at an east-west street.
Boulevard  A street divided by a landscaped center island and generally designated by a
name, not a number used as a name. This thoroughfare must connect at least two sections
and act as a collector.
Circle  A loop street (or cul-de-sac with landscaped center in its turnaround) or other street
on the perimeter of a small circular park.
Court  A cul-de-sac (or P-shaped loop street).
Drive  A (usually scenic) way for leisurely driving; hence, a minor residential street or Ushaped
loop street of significant length.
Highway  An artery usually built and maintained with state or federal participation.
Lane  A narrow street not intended for through traffic; hence, a loop street.
Parkway  A special scenic route or park drive associated with an expressway or freeway.
Pike  An artery, usually with some historical significance because of widespread use of private
toll roads in the past. A turnpike in modern use connotes payment of a toll.
Alcoa Subdivision Regulations 53
Revised 04/18/2019
Place  A cul-de-sac or permanent dead-end road, short in length.
Plaza  A street around the periphery of a square, usually a busy or paved one or a park.
Road  Limited thoroughfares that are frequently used, have heavy traffic volume, and run
in any direction.
Street  Roads that generally run in an east-west direction and usually terminate at a northsouth
avenue.
Terrace  A land service street, especially a loop street, which follows a hillside contour.
Way  Dead-end rights-of-way under one thousand 1,000 feet running at oblique angles to
the four points of the compass. A minor street that changes direction or beings and ends on
the same thoroughfare.
