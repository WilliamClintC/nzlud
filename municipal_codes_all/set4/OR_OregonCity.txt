OREGON CITY, OREGON MUNICIPAL CODE 
____________ 
A Codification of the General Ordinances of 
the City of Oregon City, Oregon 
____________ 
Beginning with Supp. No. 17, 
Supplemented by Municipal Code Corporation 
____________ 

PREFACE 
    The Oregon City Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company in 1991, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Municipal Code Corporation, its successor in interest. 
    During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company under the direction of Edward J. Sullivan, city attorney. 
    The Code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the Title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
    In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the Code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 17, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
    A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers. 
    This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance No. 18-1005, passed May 2, 2018.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
    This Code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this Code. 
Numbering System. 
    The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the Code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
    A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This Code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this Code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
    Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be added between 2.04, City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney. 
Section. 
    Each section of the Code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the Code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
    There are many tables of contents in this Code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the Code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
    At the end of each code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 17 a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross referenced to the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
    The statutory references direct the Code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
    When a code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" code references in the new code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the Code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
    As of Supplement No. 17, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
    To find a specific ordinance in the Code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the Code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the Code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 17 this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 17, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the Code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the Code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
    If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this Code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
    The index will be updated as necessary when the Code text is amended. 
Instruction Sheet 
    Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. The Instruction Sheet will tell the Code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the Code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the Code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
    When originally published, the pages of this Code were consecutively numbered. As of Supplement No. 17, when new pages are inserted with amendments, the pages will follow a "Point Numbering System". (Example: 32, 32.1, 32.2, 32.2.1, 32.2.2., 33). Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) will be left unnumbered but the number will be "reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission. 
    In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version. You can send files to us as an e-mail attachment, by FTP, on a diskette or CD-ROM. Electronic files enable us not only to get you your code more quickly but also ensure that it is error-free.

THE CHARTER OF OREGON CITY 
    To provide for the government of the city of Oregon City, Clackamas County, Oregon; and to repeal all charter provisions of the city enacted prior to the time that this charter takes effect. 
    BE IT ENACTED by the people of the city of Oregon City, Clackamas County, Oregon: 
CHAPTER 1 - NAME AND BOUNDARIES 

Section 1 - Title of Enactment. 
    This enactment may be referred to as the Oregon City Charter of 1982. 
Section 2 - Name of City. 
    The municipality of Oregon City, Clackamas County, Oregon, shall continue to be a municipal corporation with the name "Oregon City." 
Section 3 - Boundaries. 
    Unless mandated by law, the city shall include all territory encompassed by its boundaries as they now exist or hereafter are modified by the voters. The recorder shall keep in his office at City Hall at least two copies of this charter, in each of which he shall maintain an accurate, up-to-date description of the boundaries. The copies and description shall be available for public inspection at any time during regular office hours of the recorder. 
(Amended by voters at the City election held May 18, 1999.) 
CHAPTER II - POWERS 

Section 4 - Powers of the City. 
    The city shall have all powers which the constitutions, statutes, and common law of the United States and of this state expressly or impliedly grant or allow municipalities, as fully as though this charter specifically enumerated each of those powers. 
Section 5 - Construction of Charter. 
    In this charter no mention of a particular power shall be constructed to be exclusive or to restrict the scope of the powers which the city would have if the particular power were not mentioned. The charter shall be liberally construed to the end that the city may have all powers necessary or convenient for the conduct of its municipal affairs, including all powers that cities may assume pursuant to state laws and to the municipal home rule provisions of the state constitution. If the context so requires, the singular pronoun shall be taken to mean and include the plural, the masculine, the feminine and the neuter. 
CHAPTER III - FORM OF GOVERNMENT 

Section 6 - Where Powers Vested. 
    Except as this charter provides otherwise, all powers of the city shall be vested in the commission. 
Section 7 - Commission. 
    In addition to the Mayor, the commission shall be composed of four commissioners elected from the city at large for terms of four years each. The term of office of each member in office at the date of amendments to this charter in May, 1990 shall continue until expiration; provided, however, that the term of city commission position number 5 shall cease as of January 2, 1991. At the 1990 general biennial election, two members shall be elected, and at the 1992 general biennial election, two members shall be elected, and in each case on each fourth year thereafter, a like number shall be elected. The term of office of each commissioner shall commence on the 2nd day of January after the election of that commissioner in the preceding November, unless such date shall fall on a legal holiday, in which case such term shall commence on the following day. No person shall be elected to the office of commissioner for more than two terms of four years in any ten year period. 
(Adopted by voters at the City election held May 15, 1990) 
Section 8 - Commissioners. 
    Each office of commissioner shall be designated by number. The city recorder shall assign a number to each of the four commission positions. The numbers so assigned shall be certified by the city recorder to the commissioner in office holding that position. One copy of the certification shall be sent to the county elections officer. In all proceedings for the nomination and election of candidates for or to the office of commissioner, every petition for nomination, declaration of candidacy, certificate of nomination or election, shall state the position number of the office to which the candidate aspires, and the candidate's name shall appear on the ballot only for the designated position. Each voter shall have the right to vote for only one candidate for each position on the commission, and the candidate for each position receiving the highest number of votes for such position shall be considered elected. No person may file for more than one position at any single election. 
(Adopted by voters at the City election held May 15, 1990) 
Section 9 - Mayor. 
    At the 1990 general biennial election, and at every general election each four years thereafter, a mayor shall be elected from the city at large for a four year term. The mayor in office at the time this charter is amended in May 1990, shall continue in office until January 2, 1991. The mayor shall have been a resident of the city for at least twelve months preceding election to that office and shall remain a resident of the city as a condition of holding such office. No person may file for the position of mayor and city commissioner at any single election. The term of office of the mayor shall commence on the 2nd day of January after the election of that position the preceding November, unless such date shall fall on a legal holiday, in which case such term shall commence the following day. 
    Notwithstanding section 32 of this charter, if at any time after January 2, 1991, the office of Mayor shall become vacant before the normal expiration of that term, a special election shall be held at the next available date to fill that office for the unexpired term; provided, however, if one hundred eighty (180) days or fewer remain in such term vacated, the commission shall appoint a person to fill such vacancy for the remainder of the unexpired term. 
    If a prospective candidate for election to the office of mayor has been elected either to the office of mayor or city commissioner for more than two terms of four years in the previous ten years, that prospective candidate shall not be eligible for election to the office of mayor. 
(Adopted by voters at the City election held May 15, 1990 as amended by voters at the City election held November 7, 2000) 
Section 9A - Commission President. 
    The commission shall meet at 8 o'clock P.M. on the first Wednesday in January after the first general election under this charter and shall be called to order by the mayor. The commission, including the mayor, shall then proceed to elect a commission president by ballot from their number who shall hold office for the term of one year and until a successor shall be elected and qualified. The commission president shall perform the duties of mayor in the absence of that officer. In the absence of the mayor from the city or the inability of the mayor to act, the president of the commission shall have and exercise the power to perform all duties of the mayor. 
(Adopted by voters at the City election held May 15, 1990) 
Section 10 - Nominations. 
    A qualified elector who has resided in the city during the 12 months immediately preceding an election may be nominated for an elective city office to be filled at the election. The nomination shall be by a petition that specifies the office sought and shall be in a form prescribed by the commission. The petition shall be signed by not fewer than 50 electors. No elector shall sign more than one petition for each office to be filled at the election. If he does so, his signature shall be valid only on the first sufficient petition filed for the office. The signatures to a nomination petition need not all be appended to one paper, but to each separate paper of the petition shall be attached an affidavit of the circulator thereof, indicating the number of signers of the paper and stating that each signature appended thereto was made in his presence and is the genuine signature of the person whose name it purports to be. Opposite each signature shall be stated the signer's place of residence, identified by its street and number or other sufficient designation. All nomination papers comprising a petition shall be assembled and filed with the recorder as one instrument not earlier than 120 nor later than 61 days before the election. The recorder shall make a record of the exact time at which each petition is filed and shall take and preserve the name and address of the person by whom it is filed. If the petition is not signed by the required number of qualified electors, the recorder shall notify the candidate and the person who filed the petition within five days after the filing. If the petition is insufficient in any other particular, the recorder shall return it immediately to the person who filed it, certifying in writing wherein the petition is insufficient. The deficient petition may be amended and filed again as a new petition, or a substitute petition for the same candidate may be filed, within the regular time for filing nomination petitions. The recorder shall notify an eligible person of his nomination, and that person shall file with the recorder his written acceptance of nomination, in such form as the commission may require, within five days of notification of nomination. Upon receipt of the acceptance of nomination, the recorder shall cause the nominee's name to be printed on the ballots. The petition of nomination for a successful candidate at an election shall be preserved in the office of the recorder until the term of office for which the candidate is elected expires. In lieu of nomination by petition, an elector may file for office by payment of a $50 filing fee or such greater fee as the commission may fix. 
Section 11 - Manager, Judge, and Other Officers. 
    Additional officers of the city shall be a city manager and municipal judge, each of whom the commission shall appoint, and such other officers as the commission deems necessary. The commission may combine any two or more appointive offices, except the office of city manager and municipal judge. In no such combination shall the municipal judge be subject in his judicial functions to supervision by any other office. 
Section 12 - Salaries. 
    The compensation for the services of each city officer and employee shall be the amount fixed by the commission. A commissioner shall not receive a salary, but may be reimbursed for expenses upon prior authorization of the commission. 
Section 13 - Qualifications of Officers. 
    No person shall be eligible for an elective office of the city unless at the time of his election he is a qualified elector within the meaning of the state constitution and has resided in the city during the twelve months immediately preceding the election. The commission shall be the final judge of the foregoing qualifications and election of its own members. 
CHAPTER IV - COMMISSION 

Section 14 - Meetings. 
    The commission shall hold regular meetings in the city at 8 o'clock P.M. on the first Wednesday of each month and on the second Thursday thereafter unless otherwise designated by the commission. If a meeting date falls on a legal holiday, then it shall be held on the following day. It shall adopt rules for the government of its members and proceedings. The mayor upon his own motion may, or at the request of three members of the commission shall, by giving notice thereof to all members of the commission then in the city, call a special meeting of the commission for a time not earlier than three nor later than 48 hours after the notice is given. Special meetings of the commission may also be held at any time by the common consent of all the members of the commission. 
Section 15 - Quorum. 
    A majority of members of the commission shall constitute a quorum for its business, but a smaller number may meet and compel the attendance of absent members in a manner provided by ordinance. 
Section 16 - Record of Proceedings. 
    The commission shall cause a record of its proceedings to be kept. The ayes and nays upon any question before it shall be taken and entered in the record. 
Section 17 - Proceedings to Be Public. 
    No action by the commission shall have legal effect unless the motion for the action and the vote by which it is disposed of take place at proceedings open to the public. 
Section 18 - Mayor's Functions at Commission Meetings. 
    The mayor shall be chairman of the commission and preside over its deliberations. He shall have a vote on all questions before it. He shall have authority to preserve order, enforce the rules of the commission, and determine the order of business under the rules of the commission. 
Section 19 - Vote Required. 
    Except as this charter otherwise provides, the concurrence of a majority of the members of the commission present at a commission meeting shall be necessary to decide any question before the commission. 
CHAPTER V - POWERS AND DUTIES OF OFFICERS 

Section 20 - Mayor. 
    The mayor shall appoint the committees provided by the rules of the commission. He shall sign all records of proceedings approved by the commission. He shall have no veto power and shall sign all ordinances passed by the commission within three days after their passage. After the commission approves a bond of a city officer or a bond for a license, contract, or proposal, the mayor shall endorse the bond. 
Section 21 - City Manager. 
(a)  Qualifications. The city manager shall be the administrative head of the government of the city. He shall be chosen by the commission without regard to political considerations and solely with reference to his executive and administrative qualifications. He need not be a resident of the city or of the state at the time of his appointment. Before taking office, he shall give a bond in such amount and with such surety as may be approved by the commission. The premiums on such bond shall be paid by the city. 
(b)  Term. The manager shall be appointed for an indefinite term and may be removed at the pleasure of the commission. Upon any vacancy occurring in the office of manager after the first appointment pursuant to this charter, the commission at its next meeting shall adopt a resolution of its intention to appoint another manager. Not later than four months after adopting the resolution, the commission shall appoint a manager to fill the vacancy. 
(c)  Powers and Duties. The powers and duties of the manager shall be as follows: 
(1)  He shall devote his entire time to the dis-charge of his official duties, attend all meetings of the commission unless excused therefrom by the commission or the mayor, keep the commission advised at all times of the affairs and needs of the city, and make reports annually, or more frequently if requested by the commission, of all the affairs and departments of the city. 
(2)  He shall see that all ordinances are enforced and that the provisions of all franchises, leases, contracts, permits, and privileges granted by the city are observed. 
(3)  The manager shall designate a city recorder, shall appoint and may remove appointive city officers and employees except as this charter otherwise provides, and shall have general supervision and control over them and their work with power to transfer an employee from one department to another. He shall supervise the departments to the end of obtaining the utmost efficiency in each of them. He shall have no control, however, over the commission or over the judicial activities of the municipal judge. 
(4)  He shall act as purchasing agent for all de-partments of the city. All purchases shall be made by requisition signed by him or authorized designee.

The commission also has power to abate any condition on any private property constituting a public or private nuisance under the law in the state of Oregon. The commission has power to require the removal of dead grass, brush, trees, and other growth which constitutes a direct fire hazard to public or private buildings; provided, however, the commission may not require the removal of any dead or green vegetation if a sufficient fire break exists between such vegetation and buildings so that the same does not constitute a direct and unreasonable fire hazard to such buildings. The commission may require property owners to remove noxious weeds and plants if the same are a hazard to persons not on the property or a hazard to adjoining property. Nothing herein contained is intended to restrict the commission's right to control the streets. The commission may establish lines for the planting of shade or ornamental trees and generally regulate the use and development of the portion of street rights-of-way between the property line and the travel portion of the street. If any property owner fails to comply within ten days with a lawful notice given pursuant to this section requiring the removal of a hazard or nuisance, the commission may, after hearing, cause the same to be removed and the cost thereof shall be a lien on the property and shall be collected in the same manner as street improvement liens.

2.48.050 - Classification of positions. 
A.  The mission of the city requires providing quality services to its citizens. In an effort to meet these needs, the city employs a staff with varying job duties and responsibilities. A classification is a group of positions sufficiently alike in job duties and responsibilities and requiring the same essential job qualifications. Positions shall be analyzed in terms of essential job qualifications required to perform the duties. A listing of all the positions through written job descriptions shall be maintained to establish qualification standards, performance standards, to assist in the compensation process, and to provide a means of organizational relationships among positions. 
B.  A department director may request a change in classification when the duties and responsibilities of a position have changed substantially in type or level of work performed. The request shall include a proposed job description of duties and responsibilities and essential job qualifications. An employee may also request a reclassification. Such requests should be made to the employee's current department director. The city manager shall determine whether the reclassification is warranted based on the position and its relationship to the organization without regard to the personal characteristics and abilities of the employee holding the position. 
(Ord. 93-1014 §1 (part), 1993) 
2.48.060 - Compensation of employees.

B.  Employees shall be paid at a rate established within the salary range for the position which they are employed. Employees shall generally be hired at the first step of the range, although an employee may be hired at a higher step level, dependent upon the individual's qualifications and approval from the city manager. The rate for an appointment to a promotional or to a higher reclassified position shall be at the nearest higher rate of pay in the new salary range. If, however, this would result in a rate increase of less than five percent, the rate shall then be increased to the next step to provide for a minimum rate increase on promotion or reclassification to provide for a minimum of five percent. A transferred employee shall be paid at the same rate received prior to transfer, absent some change in classification. A transferred employee who has been reclassified to a higher classification shall receive the nearest rate of pay. In all other cases, approval from the city manager is required if a higher step in the range is requested by the department director. If an employee is reclassified into a lower classification, the rate of pay shall be negotiated with the employee and/ or appropriate bargaining unit, considering all factors including length of service with the city. An employee shall progress through the salary range only after spending the required amount of time in the previous step and if job performance is satisfactory. 
(Ord. 93-1014 §1 (part), 1993) 
2.48.070 - Probationary period. 
A.  The purpose of a probationary period is to provide a working test period during which an employee is required to demonstrate ability for a position by actual performance of the duties. Such period also provides the supervisor and/or department director the opportunity to observe the employee's work, train and aid the employee in adjusting to the position, and reject any employee whose work performance fails to meet required work standards. The length of the probationary period for any reclassified or promoted employee shall be six months. The probationary period for any new employee shall be twelve months. A transferred employee shall be required to complete a new six-month probationary period only if there has been a classification change. Promoted employees who do not successfully complete their probationary period shall be reinstated in their previous classification unless they are terminated for wilful serious violation of rules or standards of behavior and/or misconduct. 
B.  Employees new to city service serving their probationary period shall be considered at-will and do not have recall benefits or access to the complaint resolution procedure.

2.48.100 - Layoffs/recall. 
    In the event of changes of work responsibilities, lack of work, lack of funding, or other pertinent reasons, the city manager shall have the authority to lay off employees from city employment. Layoffs shall be evaluated on an individual job classification basis, with the primary criteria being that layoffs shall be accomplished which will least negatively affect the proper functioning of city services and responsibilities. When more than one employee is within a job classification, the layoffs within that classification shall be based on seniority of the employees within the job classification. For a period of one year after an employee is laid off, that employee shall be given first priority for reemployment to fill a vacant position for which the employee is qualified. 
(Ord. 93-1014 §1 (part), 1993) 
2.48.110 - Recruitment and selection. 
    The purpose of the recruitment and selection process is to provide a competitive system of filling positions for the city with the individuals whose skills, abilities and qualifications best match those of the open position. All recruitment and selection practices and procedures shall be conducted in compliance with all applicable state and federal laws governing equal employment opportunity. Veteran preference shall be provided according to Oregon law. 
(Ord. 93-1014 §1 (part), 1993) 
2.48.120 - Promotions and transfers. 
    The city encourages promotions and transfers from within city service and seeks to select the best qualified individual for the position. Promotional appointments shall, therefore, be made exclusively from employees within the city if it is determined by the department director and city manager that there exists a sufficient number of qualified and interested employees to compete through an internal selection process. Employees interested in affected positions may communicate their interests and concerns directly to their department director. 
(Ord. 93-1014 §1 (part), 1993) 
2.48.130 - Authorization to recruit. 
    When a job vacancy or new position exists or is anticipated, the department director shall make a request to the city manager to initiate the recruitment and selection process. The request shall include a current job description listing the essential job duties and responsibilities, the essential job qualifications, established salary range, and the selection criteria. 
(Ord. 93-1014 §1 (part), 1993) 
2.48.140 - Job announcement. 
A.  A vacancy announcement shall be prepared specifying the title of the job, salary range of the position, summary of the essential job duties, responsibilities and qualifications, and the application procedures. The application procedures shall, at a minimum, include the time and location to apply and the selection process to be used, e.g., testing, application, assessment centers, interviews, etc., as well as the closing date. All job announcements shall indicate that the city is an equal opportunity employer. 
B.  Job announcements will be posted for a minimum of five working days. Posting locations include employee bulletin boards and public bulletin boards in city facilities. Vacancy announcements may also be sent to newspapers for inclusion in the "help wanted" ads, the State of Oregon Employment Division, and other agencies or organizations where they may exist qualified, interested applicants. 
(Ord. 93-1014 §1 (part), 1993) 
2.48.150 - Applications. 
    Employment applications shall be available in city hall. The city accepts applications and/or resumes only when a vacancy exists. All individuals applying for a position shall complete an application form and any supplemental materials required by the city for certain positions, as specified. Application materials shall be considered confidential and reviewed only by the personnel authorized by law. The city shall make every reasonable effort to accommodate the needs of applicants with disabilities in the application process. 
(Ord. 93-1014 §1 (part), 1993) 
2.48.160 - Selection. 
A.  Selection criteria shall be designed to measure each applicant's qualifications, experience and ability to perform the duties and responsibilities of the open position. 
B.  Any combination of two or more of the following methods may be used to determine the applicant best suited for the position: 
1.  Information supplied by the applicant, on the application, in resumes, and through supplemental examinations, if required; 
2.  Written, performance (i.e. typing test), physical, medical, psychological examinations, or combinations of these tests; 
3.  Individual or group oral interviews; 
4.  Assessment centers; 
5.  Information and evaluation provided by previous and current employers and references; 
6.  Personal background investigation for some positions; 
7.  Other appropriate job-related screening techniques. 
(Ord. 93-1014 §1 (part), 1993) 
2.48.170 - Appointment. 
    The appointment is made by the city manager after consultation with the department director. All recruitment and selection records shall be maintained by the city manager or designee for a minimum of three years from the time all applicants have been notified of their application status. Appointments may be made subject to the result of a medical entrance exam. 
(Ord. 93-1014 §1 (part), 1993) 
2.48.180 - Multiple use of application and selection methods. 
    When it is deemed appropriate by the department director and city manager, selection materials including application, testing and interview results, reference, and other selection information received for one vacancy may be considered for a subsequent recruitment and selection process in the same job classification, provided that no more than one year has passed since the initial process. A ranked list of qualified candidates for purposes of internal recruitment shall be maintained for a minimum of one year. All applicants shall be notified of their application status. 
(Ord. 93-1014 §1 (part), 1993) 
2.48.190 - Temporary appointments. 
A.  The intent of temporary appointments is not to fill regular, classified positions with temporary employees. Under certain circumstances, a temporary appointment may be needed to fill a position on an immediate, short-term basis. For example, a temporary appointment may be used to fill an unexpected vacancy, to fill in for a current classified employee out on an approved leave of absence such as a disability, or to fill a special project position resulting from the availability of grant money. The department director may fill these vacancies by appointment on a temporary basis with the approval of the city manager without following the recruitment and selection process provided in Section 2.48.110 for a period not to exceed one year. In addition, they may be unique circumstances requiring that a temporary appointment be extended beyond one year. Approval from the city manager for an extension is required. 
B.  Vacated classified positions may be filled with temporary appointments. A classified position which is vacant because an employee is out on approved leave may be filled by temporary appointment as long as there is a reasonable expectation that the employee will return. A new unclassified position funded by grant monies or other outside sources may be filled by temporary appointment for the duration of the funds. If such position becomes classified as a regular full-time position with the city, however, the recruitment and selection process shall be initiated and followed. If a current (as previously in this chapter) and qualified applicant pool or ranked list exists for any vacated classified position, the department director shall first consider making the temporary appointment from this pool or list. 
(Ord. 93-1014 §1 (part), 1993) 
2.48.200 - Discipline and discharge. 
A.  The city has a policy of progressive, corrective discipline which is designed to help employees recognize unacceptable behavior and provide them with a positive plan for improvement. 
B.  Supervisors and/or department directors should discuss improper or unacceptable performance with the employee and shall be responsible for taking corrective action if job standards are not met. The responsibility of meeting job standards, however, rests with the employee. 
C.  There are progressive steps used in the discipline process-counseling, verbal warning, written warning, suspension with or without pay, demotion and termination. The supervisor and/or department director should make efforts, when an employee is disciplined, not to embarrass the employee unduly before other employees. Suspension without pay, demotion and termination require prior approval from the city manager before the action is taken. 
D.  The progressive discipline process may begin at whatever step is deemed appropriate, based upon the seriousness of the conduct, the employee's past record, and the surrounding circumstances. An employee may be terminated immediately without prior disciplinary action in certain cases involving wilful or serious violation of rules, or standards of behavior and/or misconduct. 
(Ord. 93-1014 §1 (part), 1993) 
2.48.210 - Complaint resolution procedure. 
A.  Open and honest communication between employees and supervisors is essential to the performance of each job. The city believes that most issues can be addressed informally if approached promptly and objectively. There may be instances relating to employment conditions and relationships where an affected employee or the supervisor cannot resolve the issue and, in those cases, either party may defer to succeeding steps of the complaint resolution procedure outlined below. This complaint resolution procedure provides readily accessible avenues for communication and review of problems and issues in a timely manner. 
B.  Bargaining unit employees cannot use the outlined complaint resolution procedure on any issue covered by their applicable collective bargaining agreement. 
C.  The complaint resolution procedure is as follows: 
1.  The employee shall present the complaint in writing to the employee's supervisor within ten calendar days of the date of the occurrence or the date the employee first had knowledge of the occurrence. The supervisor shall research and gather relevant information on the matter complained of, and give the employee a written reply within ten calendar days of receiving the written complaint. If the employee's complaint is directed against the employee's supervisor, the employee may bypass this level of the procedure and present the complaint in writing to the department director within the same time frame allowed for presenting a claim to the supervisor in this section; 
2.  If the complaint has not been resolved at the supervisor level, the employee shall present the complaint in writing to the department director within ten calendar days of the date of the employee received the supervisor's response. The department director shall research and gather relevant information on the matter complained of, and shall give the employee a written reply within ten calendar days of receiving the written complaint; 
3.  If the complaint has not been resolved at the department director level, the employee shall present the complaint in writing to the city manager within ten calendar days of the date the employee received the department director's response. The city manager shall research and gather relevant information on the matter of complaint, including reviewing written complaints and responses thus far in the process, and shall give the employee a written reply within ten calendar days of receiving the written complaint; 
4.  If an employee is dissatisfied with the city manager's decision, the employee may appeal to the civil service board within ten calendar days of the date the employee received the city manager's response. The civil service board shall convene within fifteen calendar days to review the written record, take testimony and make a final decision based on and supported by written findings. The decision of the civil service board shall be final and binding.

(Ord 03-1015 §8, 2003; Ord. 00-1028 §8, 2000) 
Chapter 2.54 - CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECKS 

2.54.010 - Purpose. 
A.  The commission finds as follows: In order for the Oregon City government to operate effectively, persons selected for employment or as a public service volunteer with the city must have the highest degree of citizen and public trust and confidence. 
B.  All city employees and public service volunteers represent the city to its citizens. Many city employees and volunteers have responsibilities to regulate and maintain public health and safety. Most city employees and volunteers have access to public funds and property, and possess access to privileged and proprietary information submitted to the city in confidence. Additionally, city employees and volunteers may be required to operate publicly owned vehicles. 
C.  The commission concludes that the aforementioned considerations justify the use of a criminal background check for all perspective city employees, and some volunteer positions where it is in the public interest to do so. Volunteer positions requiring criminal background checks will be determined by the city manager, based on the duties and responsibilities of the position or public safety. 
(Ord. 01-1031 (part), 2001) 
2.54.020 - Criminal record check required. 
    Prospective applicants and volunteers with the city of Oregon City shall be required to authorize the city to conduct a criminal offender information check through the OSP LEDS system. Additionally, applicants shall authorize the city to conduct a check of their driving record and status. The criminal history and driving record/status authorization form shall be maintained by the city personnel department. 
(Ord. 01-1031 (part), 2001) 
2.54.030 - Procedure. 
    City personnel department shall forward the authorization form on prospective employees and volunteers with the request that a records check be conducted to the police department. Under receipt of the authorization form a member of the police department trained and authorized to perform criminal history and driving record/status checks through the LEDS system shall conduct the check on the prospective employee or volunteer. The police department member conducting the records check shall orally report to the city that the applicant's record indicated "no criminal record" or "criminal record." The police department member shall also orally provide driving record and status information to the city. Any "hard copy" of the records check shall then be shredded. The police department will maintain the records check authorization form. If the applicant's record is reported as "criminal record," the city may, under OAR 257-010-0025(1)(c), request a written criminal history report from the OSP Identification Services Section and pay the applicable fee for this service. If a written criminal history record has been obtained the city shall make it available to the official making the selection. 
(Ord. 01-1031 (part), 2001) 
2.54.040 - Retention of criminal record checks. 
    The written criminal history record on persons who are not hired as an employee or a volunteer shall be retained in accordance with the requirements of OAR 166-040-0080 for a period of three years and thereafter shall be destroyed by shredding. The criminal history record of applicants and volunteers with a criminal history that are hired or appointed shall become a part of the confidential personnel file of that employee or volunteer. Access to confidential personnel files is limited to only authorize persons who have an official need to access such files that is sanctioned by law or regulation. 
(Ord. 01-1031 (part), 2001) 
2.54.050 - Use of criminal record checks. 
    Applicants for employment or a volunteer position who have a felony criminal conviction, or a history of conviction of a misdemeanor involving moral turpitude, violence or theft, shall be closely examined by selecting officials to determine if that person possesses the required degree of citizen and public trust and confidence. Each employment or volunteer selection will, however, be made on an individual, case-by-case basis, taking into account the person's qualifications, the requirements of the particular job or volunteer post applied for, and the results of the criminal history check. Factors such as the age of an offender at the time of the offense, the type of offense and subsequent rehabilitation, and the public sensitivity of the position under consideration, must be taken into account in evaluating a criminal history report. 
(Ord. 01-1031 (part), 2001) 
2.54.060 - Section 2.54.050 provisions subject to civil service system. 
    The provisions of Section 2.54.050 of this chapter are subject to the civil service system of the city, as well as city contracts with recognized unions.

    "Hotel operator" means the person who is proprietor of a hotel in any capacity. Where the hotel operator performs his functions through a managing agent of any type or character other than an employee, the managing agent shall also be deemed a hotel operator for the purpose of this chapter and shall have the same duties and liabilities as his principal. Compliance with the provisions of this chapter by either the principal or the managing agent shall be considered to be compliance by both. 
    "Hotel tax collector" means a hotel operator or hotel intermediary. 
    "Occupancy" means the use or possession or the right to the use or possession for lodging or sleeping purposes of any room or rooms in a hotel, or portion thereof.

    "Transient" means any individual who exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy in a hotel for a period of thirty consecutive calendar days or less, counting portions of calendar days as full days. The day a transient checks out of the hotel shall not be included in determining the thirty-day period if the transient is not charged rent for that day by the hotel tax collector. Any such individual so occupying space in a hotel shall be deemed to be a transient until the period of thirty days has expired unless there is an agreement in writing between the hotel tax collector and the occupant providing for a longer period of occupancy, or the tenancy actually extends more than thirty consecutive days. In determining whether a person is a transient, uninterrupted periods of time extending both prior and subsequent to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter may be considered. A person who pays for lodging on a monthly basis, irrespective of the number of days in such month, shall not be deemed a transient.

B.  If the director makes a determination as outlined in subsection A of this section, the director must give notice to the seller of the amount assessed. The notice must be personally served on the seller or deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the seller at the last known place of address.

Chapter 3.20 - REIMBURSEMENT DISTRICTS 

3.20.010 - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this chapter is to provide a method to reimburse a person who finances the construction of a public improvement that has the capacity to serve development other than that for which it is built. The person financing the development must be deemed to pay a whole or disproportionately large part of the improvement. This chapter is intended to mitigate the cost of financing such public improvements by distributing some of its costs to other development that benefits from such public improvements when the benefited development makes use of the improvements. 
    The charge paid by the benefited property should be proportional to the use the benefited property makes of the public improvement. This chapter provides developers with a mechanism that may be used solely to finance capital construction needs of the city. 
(Ord. 00-1004 §1 (part), 2000) 
3.20.020 - Obligation. 
    Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to oblige the city to use the provisions herein to construct improvements or collect reimbursement charges on behalf of persons who use the provisions herein. 
(Ord. 00-1004 §1 (part), 2000) 
3.20.030 - Definitions. 
    "Administrative fee," as used in this chapter, means the amount of money charged by the city for the costs of administering this chapter, including, but not limited to, producing the city engineer's report, public meeting support, other personnel costs, mailing fees, legal fees and the costs to account, track and assess reimbursement charges to future development. 
    "Development" occurs when a structure or other use of land connects to or otherwise makes use of a sewer, water, stormwater or street improvement. As used in this chapter, "makes use of a stormwater improvement," means activities sufficient to trigger the requirements of Chapter 13.12.050. As used in this chapter, "makes use of a street improvement" means the construction or installation of an improvement or a change in the use of a property that increases traffic or congestion on the street improvement for which the reimbursement district is formed. 
    "LGIP" means local government investment pool. 
    "Person" is a natural person, the person's heirs, executors, administrators or assigns; a firm, partnership, corporation, association or legal entity, its successors or assigns; any agent, employee or any representative thereof or any other legal entity, including the city of Oregon City. 
    "Public improvement" means either any or all of the following: a street, stormwater, sewer or water improvement that will be dedicated to and accepted by the city. 
    "Reimbursement charge" is the charge imposed upon development by this chapter for the costs of financing a public street, water, sewer or stormwater improvement that serves a development. A reimbursement charge is not intended to limit or replace, and is in addition to, any other existing fees or charges collected by the city. 
    "Reimbursement district" is the area within which future development will potentially derive a benefit from the construction of public street, water, sewer or stormwater improvements financed, in whole or disproportionately large part, by a person without the formation of a local improvement district. A reimbursement district is limited to an area within the city and will be determined by the city commission. 
    "Reimbursement resolution" is a resolution of the city commission that identifies the potential reimbursement charge for future development within a reimbursement district. 
    "Threshold amount" is the minimum dollar amount an applicant under this chapter must spend on a specific public improvement requested to be eligible to be included in a reimbursement district.

(Ord. 00-1004 §1 (part), 2000) 
3.20.110 - Administration. 
A.  A right to reimbursement shall terminate ten years after the reimbursement district is created unless the person who is eligible for reimbursement renews their eligibility for reimbursement. Eligibility for reimbursement may be renewed for two additional five year periods. In order to renew eligibility for reimbursement, the person who is eligible for reimbursement must file a written declaration of renewal with the city engineer within ninety calendar days of the date the eligibility for reimbursement would otherwise terminate. Failure to file a timely declaration shall result in the termination of any eligibility for reimbursement. In no event may the eligibility for reimbursement exceed twenty years. 
B.  Eligibility for reimbursement does not obligate the city to seek or pay the reimbursement charge. 
C.  The right of reimbursement is assignable and transferable after the person who is eligible for reimbursement delivers written notice to the city, advising the city where to send future payments received by the city on behalf of the person or the person's assignee. 
D.  The city shall establish separate accounts for each reimbursement district. Upon receipt of a reimbursement charge, the city shall cause a record to be made of the payment and remit the charge to the person eligible for reimbursement, or its assignee, after deduction of administrative fees.

5.04.150 - License-Computation of fees. 
A.  Business License Application Fee. All persons, upon submittal of an initial application for a business license, shall pay a non-refundable application fee. 
B.  Annual Business License Fee for Persons Having a Fixed Place of Business Within the City. All persons, upon the initial application for a business license and upon each subsequent year renewal of a business license, who have a fixed place of business within the city and are subject to being licensed under the provisions of this chapter, shall pay an annual business license fee based upon the number of individuals carrying on such business, profession, pursuit, or occupation. 
C.  In arriving at the number of individuals carrying on such business, profession, pursuit or occupation, there shall be considered the proprietors thereof and all individuals regularly employed in such by said proprietors. If such is carried on by a corporation, all officers and employees of the corporation who devote the principal part of their time to such business, profession, pursuit or occupation shall be considered. If any person shall have his principal place of business outside the city, then only such proprietor, officers or employees shall be considered as are actually engaged in such business, profession, pursuit or occupation within the city. 
D.  Annual Business License Fees for Persons Having No Fixed Place of Business Within the City. The city commission finds that certain trades, shops, businesses or callings are carried on in the city by persons from regular places of business and by persons who have no regular place of business within the city, that persons with regular places of business in the city pay city ad valorem property taxes upon real and personal property which is used in and belongs to their business and that the persons who do not have regular places of business in the city escape such ad valorem taxation. Both receive the benefit of police and fire protection, public utilities and sidewalks, street lights, health services and other public facilities and services of the city. Therefore, in order that each shall pay as nearly as may be not a discriminatory share, but a share in proportion to benefits received of the burden of supporting such facilities and services of the city, such businesses not operating from regular places of business in the city shall pay one and one-half times the annual license fee for businesses operating from a fixed place of business within the city. 
E.  Proration of Business License Fee. If an application is received on or before June 30, the full application fee and the full annual license fee is required. An application received on or after July 1 will be charged the full application fee and one-half the annual license fee. 
F.  Additional Fees. Certain businesses generating the need for additional city services should be subject to fees in addition to those imposed for a general business license. These additional fees shall be as follows: 
1.  Circuses, carnivals, theatrical and musical productions, festivals and other operations of like nature are subject to a per event fee. 
2.  For the privilege of engaging in the business of displaying or operating the following machines: 
a.  Amusement, cigarette, music, pool table/dart board, snack/drink machine, video games are subject to a per machine fee. This fee does not apply to any machine owned by the state. 
3.  Manufactured dwelling parks are subject to a per space fee. 
G.  License fees not paid within thirty days of the required date shall be deemed delinquent. An initial collection charge is imposed for delinquent fees. An additional collection charge equal to a percentage of the fee is imposed for each month or portion thereof that the fees remain delinquent. The city manager shall have authority to waive payment of collection fees under circumstances where imposition thereof would create an injustice or unreasonable hardship. 
H.  Amounts for fees included in this chapter shall be established by city commission resolution. Fee amounts may be revised by resolution of the city commission from time to time. 
I.  In the event the applicable classification or fees assessable to a business require clarification or interpretation, any interested person may request a determination by the city manager, whose decision shall be final. The city manager shall have the authority to waive all or a portion of established fees to meet the intent and purpose of this chapter.

3.  A determination that the applicant, or any other person who will be directly engaged in the operation or management of the business, has had a license revoked for such causes as would constitute grounds for denial of a license under this chapter, or that such person has operated a business found to be a nuisance or has been convicted of a crime of moral turpitude which would render such person unfit to manage or operate a business regulated under this chapter; 
4.  A determination that any owner or employee of a business regulated by this chapter has committed a criminal offense under the laws of the state relating to fraud or theft and such offense either occurred either on the premises licensed under this chapter or was so connected to the operation of the licensed business that the person or persons in charge of such business knew or should reasonably have known that such violation did or would occur. 
B.  Notwithstanding the above, a license may be granted despite the existence of one of the grounds of denial if the chief or commission concludes that the basis of such grounds is not likely to reoccur, is remote in time or occurred under circumstances that, in the opinion of the chief or commission, diminish the seriousness of the grounds.

C.  Upon reasonable belief that purchased regulated property is the subject of theft, the chief may provide oral or written notice to any secondhand dealer or pawnbroker to sequester any specifically described regulated property. The dealer shall retain the sequestered property in the same form as purchased and shall not commingle the property so as to preclude identification. The dealer shall not sell, exchange, dismantle or dispose of such sequestered property for a period of time, as determined by the chief, not to exceed ninety days after the date of purchase.

This shall be accomplished by writing "ninety-day hold" next to the item on the secondhand dealers and pawnbrokers report form.

4.  If the person presents new circumstances that would support amending the variance. 
F.  A revocation or amendment of a variance becomes effective at five p.m. of the fifth business day following mailing of notice of the action to the excluded person at the address provided pursuant to 9.28.060B.1. unless the excluded person appeals the determination by following the procedures in 9.28.060A.5.c.

    The purpose of this chapter is to maintain clear vision areas at intersections so that vehicle and pedestrian safety can be maximized. 
(Prior code §10-8-1) 
10.32.020 - Definitions. 
    "Clear vision area" means a triangular area at the intersection of two streets or a street and a railroad, the area of which is to be determined by the city engineer or his designee, using the following criteria: 
1.  Type of intersection; 
2.  Site characteristics; 
3.  Types of vehicle controls; 
4.  Vehicle speed; 
5.  Traffic volume; 
6.  Suggested intersection sight distances prescribed in the Transportation and Traffic Engineering Handbook published by the Institute of Traffic Engineers, 1976 Edition, as follows: 
Corner Sight Distance Table 
Speed Limit: 20 25 30 35 40 45 Sight Distance: 200 250 300 350 400 450  
    Corner sight distance is measured from a point on the center line of the minor road at least fifteen feet from the edge of the major road pavement and measured from a height of eye of three and seventy-five hundredths feet on the minor road to a height of object of four and five-tenths feet on the major road. The clear vision area is in the form of a triangle, two sides of which are lot lines measured from the corner intersection of the street lines. Where the lot lines have rounded corners, the lot lines are extended in a straight line to a point of intersection. The third side of the clear vision area is a line across the corner of the lot joining the nonintersecting ends of the other two sides. 
    "Fence" means a barrier intended to prevent escape or intrusion or to mark a boundary. A fence may consist of wood, metal, masonry, or similar materials, or a hedge or other planting arranged to form a visual or physical barrier. 
    "Street" means the entire width between right-of-way lines of every way for vehicular and pedestrian traffic, and includes the terms "road," "highway," "lane," "place," "avenue," "alley" and other similar designations. 
(Prior code §10-8-2) 
10.32.030 - Sight line requirements. 
    A clear vision area shall contain no vegetation or fences or other artificial obstruction exceeding three feet in height measured from the top of the curb or, where no curb exists, from the established street center line grade, except that trees exceeding this height may be located in this area provided all branches and foliage are removed to a height of eight feet above the grade. 
(Prior code §10-8-3) 
10.32.040 - Compliance. 
A.  It shall be the duty of all persons owning or possessing real property to provide and maintain clear vision areas on their said real property within thirty days of written notice of requirements by the city engineer. 
B.  This chapter shall not be applicable to existing structures other than signs and fences. All construction initiated after June 8, 1978, which encroaches on the clear vision area shall be subject to the provisions hereof, regardless of lesser setback requirements contained in the various zoning districts. 
(Prior code §10-8-4) 
10.32.050 - Variances. 
A.  Variances from the provisions of this chapter may be granted by the traffic safety board. 
B.  Vehicle and pedestrian safety shall be the primary factors in decisions when variances are considered. The type of intersection, site characteristics, types of vehicle controls, vehicle speed, traffic volume and other similar items are factors to be considered. The Transportation and Traffic Engineering Handbook on intersection sight distance (pages 611-613) and any other appropriate standards shall be considered. The design, style, value and age of existing structures and vegetation shall be considered secondary to traffic safety. 
C.  A property owner or the owner's agent may initiate a request for variance by filing an application with the city. A fee of fifteen dollars will accompany all requests for variances with the exception of pre-existing obstructions, fences or other artificial structures. 
D.  Any decision of the traffic safety board may be appealed to the city commission without fee within ten days of the traffic safety board's written decision. 
(Prior code §10-8-5) 
10.32.060 - Traffic hazard. 
    A parked motor vehicle or other movable obstruction, located within the clear vision area, as defined in Section 10.32.020, which interferes with the vision of motor vehicle operators approaching an intersection so as to prevent a clear view of approaching traffic in sufficient time to bring a motor vehicle to a full stop prior to reaching the intersection; or a motor vehicle parked in a direction opposite to that of the adjacent traffic lane; a motor vehicle parked on any public way or public parking area without the reflective devices prescribed by ORS 816.180, shall be deemed a nuisance. 
(Prior code §10-8-6) 
10.32.070 - Violation-Penalty.

For purposes of this subsection, an officer may reasonably conclude that a vehicle is illegally parked when it is parked on or in a street, space, area, facility or lane in such a way or for such a duration that it does not comply with an applicable city-authorized parking restriction sign. A city-authorized parking restriction sign posted and applicable to a particular street, space, area, facility or lane shall be deemed prima facie evidence that the restriction was placed by an appropriate authority and may be enforced through this chapter. 
B.  Subsection A of this section shall not apply and a vehicle shall not be towed and/or impounded under any of the following circumstances: 
1.  The vehicle is parked on private property on which the registered owner or operator of the vehicle legally resides or the property owner does not object to the vehicle being left in the parked location. 
2.  The registered owner and/or a passenger present in the vehicle at the time of the stop have a valid driver's license and are willing and legally able to drive the vehicle at the time. 
3.  The vehicle is legally parked at a time and place where the likelihood of it being subject to theft and/or vandalism is remote and traffic or public safety is not impeded.

Figure 12.04.025: Example Driveway Curb Cut 

C.  The decision maker shall be authorized through a Type II process, unless another procedure applicable to the proposal applies, to minimize the number and size of curb cuts (including driveways) as far as practicable for any of the following purposes: 
1.  To provide adequate space for on-street parking; 
2.  To facilitate street tree planting requirements; 
3.  To assure pedestrian and vehicular safety by limiting vehicular access points; and 
4.  To assure that adequate sight distance requirements are met. 
a.  Where the decision maker determines any of these situations exist or may occur due to the approval of a proposed development for non-residential uses or attached or multi-family housing, a shared driveway shall be required and limited to twenty-four feet in width adjacent to the sidewalk or property line and may extend to a maximum of thirty feet abutting the street pavement to facilitate turning movements. 
b.  Where the decision maker determines any of these situations exist or may occur due to approval of a proposed development for detached housing within the "R-5" Single-Family Dwelling District or "R-3.5" Dwelling District, driveway curb cuts shall be limited to twelve feet in width adjacent to the sidewalk or property line and may extend to a maximum of eighteen feet abutting the street pavement to facilitate turning movements. 
D.  For all driveways, the following standards apply. 
1.  Each new or redeveloped curb cut shall have an approved concrete approach or asphalted street connection where there is no concrete curb and a minimum hard surface for at least ten feet and preferably twenty feet back into the lot as measured from the current edge of street pavement to provide for controlling gravel tracking onto the public street. The hard surface may be concrete, asphalt, or other surface approved by the city engineer. 
2.  Driving vehicles, trailers, boats, or other wheeled objects across a sidewalk or roadside planter strip at a location other than an approved permanent or city-approved temporary driveway approach is prohibited. Damages caused by such action shall be corrected by the adjoining property owner. 
3.  Placing soil, gravel, wood, or other material in the gutter or space next to the curb of a public street with the intention of using it as a permanent or temporary driveway is prohibited. Damages caused by such action shall be corrected by the adjoining property owner. 
4.  Any driveway built within public street or alley right-of-way shall be built and permitted per city requirements as approved by the city engineer. 
E.  Exceptions. The public works director reserves the right to waive this standard, if it is determined through a Type II decision including written findings that it is in the best interest of the public to do so.

12.04.199 - Pedestrian and bicycle accessways. 
Pedestrian/bicycle accessways are intended to provide direct, safe and convenient connections between residential areas, retail and office areas, institutional facilities, industrial parks, transit streets, neighborhood activity centers, rights-of-way, and pedestrian/bicycle accessways which minimize out-of-direction travel, and transit-orientated developments where public street connections for automobiles, bicycles and pedestrians are unavailable. Pedestrian/bicycle accessways are appropriate in areas where public street options are unavailable, impractical or inappropriate. Pedestrian and bicycle accessways are required through private property or as right-of-way connecting development to the right-of-way at intervals not exceeding three hundred thirty feet of frontage; or where the lack of street continuity creates inconvenient or out of direction travel patterns for local pedestrian or bicycle trips. 
A.  Entry points shall align with pedestrian crossing points along adjacent streets and with adjacent street intersections. 
B.  Accessways shall be free of horizontal obstructions and have a nine-foot, six-inch high vertical clearance to accommodate bicyclists. To safely accommodate both pedestrians and bicycles, accessway right-of-way widths shall be as follows: 
1.  Accessways shall have a fifteen-foot-wide right-of-way with a seven-foot wide paved surface between a five-foot planter strip and a three-foot planter strip. 
2.  If an accessway also provides secondary fire access, the right-of-way width shall be at least twenty-three feet wide with a fifteen-foot paved surface a five-foot planter strip and a three-foot planter strip. 
C.  Accessways shall be direct with at least one end point of the accessway always visible from any point along the accessway. On-street parking shall be prohibited within fifteen feet of the intersection of the accessway with public streets to preserve safe sight distance and promote safety. 
D.  To enhance pedestrian and bicycle safety, accessways shall be lighted with pedestrian-scale lighting.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 13-1003, § 1, Exhibit 1, adopted July 17, 2013, repealed § 12.04.200 in its entirety. Former § 12.04.200 pertained to "Street Design-Constrained local streets and/or rights-of-way." See Prior Code Cross-Reference Table and Code Comparative Table and Disposition List for derivation. 
12.04.205 - Mobility standards. 
    Development shall demonstrate compliance with intersection mobility standards. When evaluating the performance of the transportation system, the City of Oregon City requires all intersections, except for the facilities identified in subsection E below, to be maintained at or below the following mobility standards during the two-hour peak operating conditions. The first hour has the highest weekday traffic volumes and the second hour is the next highest hour before or after the first hour. Except as provided otherwise below, this may require the installation of mobility improvements as set forth in the transportation system plan or as otherwise identified by the city transportation engineer. 
A.  For intersections within the regional center, the following mobility standards apply: 
1.  During the first hour, a maximum v/c ratio of 1.10 shall be maintained. For signalized intersections, this standard applies to the intersection as a whole. For unsignalized intersections, this standard applies to movements on the major street. There is no performance standard for the minor street approaches. 
2.  During the second hour, a maximum v/c ratio of 0.99 shall be maintained at signalized intersections. For signalized intersections, this standard applies to the intersection as a whole. For unsignalized intersections, this standard applies to movements on the major street. There is no performance standard for the minor street approaches. 
3.  Intersections located on the Regional Center boundary shall be considered within the Regional Center. 
B.  For intersections outside of the Regional Center but designated on the Arterial and Throughway Network, as defined in the Regional Transportation Plan, the following mobility standards apply: 
1.  During the first hour, a maximum v/c ratio of 0.99 shall be maintained. For signalized intersections, this standard applies to the intersection as a whole. For unsignalized intersections, this standard applies to movements on the major street. There is no performance standard for the minor street approaches. 
2.  During the second hour, a maximum v/c ratio of 0.99 shall be maintained at signalized intersections. For signalized intersections, this standard applies to the intersection as a whole. For unsignalized intersections, this standard applies to movements on the major street. There is no performance standard for the minor street approaches. 
C.  For intersections outside the boundaries of the Regional Center and not designated on the Arterial and Throughway Network, as defined in the Regional Transportation Plan, the following mobility standards apply: 
1.  For signalized intersections: 
a.  During the first hour, LOS "D" or better will be required for the intersection as a whole and no approach operating at worse than LOS "E" and a v/c ratio not higher than 1.0 for the sum of the critical movements. 
b.  During the second hour, LOS "D" or better will be required for the intersection as a whole and no approach operating at worse than LOS "E" and a v/c ratio not higher than 1.0 for the sum of the critical movements. 
2.  For unsignalized intersections outside of the boundaries of the Regional Center: 
a.  For unsignalized intersections, during the peak hour, all movements serving more than twenty vehicles shall be maintained at LOS "E" or better. LOS "F" will be tolerated at movements serving no more than twenty vehicles during the peak hour. 
D.  For the intersection of OR 213 and Beavercreek Road, the following mobility standards apply: 
1.  During the first, second and third hours, a maximum v/c ratio of 1.00 shall be maintained. Calculation of the maximum v/c ratio will be based on an average annual weekday peak hour. 
E.  Until the city adopts new performance measures that identify alternative mobility targets, the city shall exempt proposed development that is permitted, either conditionally, outright, or through detailed development master plan approval, from compliance with the above-referenced mobility standards for the following state-owned facilities: 
1-205/OR 99E Interchange 
State intersections located within or on the Regional Center Boundaries 
1.  In the case of conceptual development approval for a master plan that impacts the above references intersections: 
a.  The form of mitigation will be determined at the time of the detailed development plan review for subsequent phases utilizing the Code in place at the time the detailed development plan is submitted; and 
b.  Only those trips approved by a detailed development plan review are vested. 
2.  Development which does not comply with the mobility standards for the intersections identified in [Section] 12.04.205D. shall provide for the improvements identified in the Transportation System Plan (TSP) in an effort to improve intersection mobility as necessary to offset the impact caused by development. Where required by other provisions of the Code, the applicant shall provide a traffic impact study that includes an assessment of the development's impact on the intersections identified in this exemption and shall construct the intersection improvements listed in the TSP or required by the Code. 
(Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010; Ord. No. 13-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-17-2013; Ord. No. 18-1004, § 1(Exh. 1), 5-2-2018) 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 13-1003, § 1, Exhibit 1, adopted July 17, 2013, retitled § 12.04.205 from "Intersection level of service standards" to "Mobility standards." 
12.04.210 - Street design-Intersection angles. 
    Except where topography requires a lesser angle, streets shall be laid out to intersect at angles as near as possible to right angles. In no case shall the acute angles be less than eighty degrees unless there is a special intersection design. An arterial or collector street intersecting with another street shall have at least one hundred feet of tangent adjacent to the intersection unless topography requires a lesser distance. Other streets, except alleys, shall have at least fifty feet of tangent adjacent to the intersection unless topography requires a lesser distance. All street intersections shall be provided with a minimum curb return radius of twenty-five feet for local streets. Larger radii shall be required for higher street classifications as determined by the city engineer. Additional right-of-way shall be required to accommodate curb returns and sidewalks at intersections. Ordinarily, intersections should not have more than two streets at any one point. 
(Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010) 
12.04.215 - Street design-Off-site street improvements. 
    During consideration of the preliminary plan for a development, the decision maker shall determine whether existing streets impacted by, adjacent to, or abutting the development meet the city's applicable planned minimum design or dimensional requirements. Where such streets fail to meet these requirements, the decision-maker shall require the applicant to make proportional improvements sufficient to achieve conformance with minimum applicable design standards required to serve the proposed development. 
(Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010) 
12.04.220 - Street design-Half street. 
    Half streets, while generally not acceptable, may be approved where essential to the development, when in conformance with all other applicable requirements, and where it will not create a safety hazard. When approving half streets, the decision maker must first determine that it will be practical to require the dedication of the other half of the street when the adjoining property is divided or developed. Where the decision maker approves a half street, the applicant must construct an additional ten feet of pavement width so as to make the half street safe and usable until such time as the other half is constructed. Whenever a half street is adjacent to property capable of being divided or developed, the other half of the street shall be provided and improved when that adjacent property divides or develops. Access control may be required to preserve the objectives of half streets. 
    When the remainder of an existing half-street improvement is made it shall include the following items: dedication of required right-of-way, construction of the remaining portion of the street including pavement, curb and gutter, landscape strip, sidewalk, street trees, lighting and other improvements as required for that particular street. It shall also include at a minimum the pavement replacement to the centerline of the street. Any damage to the existing street shall be repaired in accordance with the city's "Moratorium Pavement Cut Standard" or as approved by the city engineer. 
(Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010; Ord. No. 13-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-17-2013) 
12.04.225 - Street design-Cul-de-sacs and dead-end streets. 
    The city discourages the use of cul-de-sacs and permanent dead-end streets except where construction of a through street is found by the decision maker to be impracticable due to topography or some significant physical constraint such as geologic hazards, wetland, natural or historic resource areas, dedicated open space, existing development patterns, arterial access restrictions or similar situation as determined by the community development director. When permitted, access from new cul-de-sacs and permanent dead-end streets shall be limited to a maximum of twenty-five dwelling units and a maximum street length of two hundred feet, as measured from the right-of-way line of the nearest intersecting street to the back of the cul-de-sac curb face. In addition, cul-de-sacs and dead end roads shall include pedestrian/bicycle accessways as required in this chapter. This section is not intended to preclude the use of curvilinear eyebrow widening of a street where needed. 
    Where approved, cul-de-sacs shall have sufficient radius to provide adequate turn-around for emergency vehicles in accordance with fire district and city adopted street standards. Permanent dead-end streets other than cul-de-sacs shall provide public street right-of-way/easements sufficient to provide turn-around space with appropriate no-parking signs or markings for waste disposal, sweepers, and other long vehicles in the form of a hammerhead or other design to be approved by the decision maker. Driveways shall be encouraged off the turnaround to provide for additional on-street parking space. 
(Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010; Ord. No. 13-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-17-2013) 
12.04.230 - Street design-Street names. 
    Except for extensions of existing streets, no street name shall be used which will duplicate or be confused with the name of an existing street. Street names shall conform to the established standards in the city and shall be subject to the approval of the city. 
(Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010) 
12.04.235 - Street design-Grades and curves. 
    Grades and center line radii shall conform to the standards in the city's street design standards and specifications. 
(Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010) 
12.04.240 - Street design-Development abutting arterial or collector street. 
    Where development abuts or contains an existing or proposed arterial or collector street, the decision maker may require: access control; screen planting or wall contained in an easement or otherwise protected by a restrictive covenant in a form acceptable to the decision maker along the rear or side property line; or such other treatment it deems necessary to adequately protect residential properties or afford separation of through and local traffic. Reverse frontage lots with suitable depth may also be considered an option for residential property that has arterial frontage. Where access for development abuts and connects for vehicular access to another jurisdiction's facility then authorization by that jurisdiction may be required. 
(Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010) 
12.04.245 - Street design-Pedestrian and bicycle safety. 
    Where deemed necessary to ensure public safety, reduce traffic hazards and promote the welfare of pedestrians, bicyclists and residents of the subject area, the decision maker may require that local streets be so designed as to discourage their use by nonlocal automobile traffic. 
    All crosswalks shall include a large vegetative or sidewalk area which extends into the street pavement as far as practicable to provide safer pedestrian crossing opportunities. These curb extensions can increase the visibility of pedestrians and provide a shorter crosswalk distance as well as encourage motorists to drive slower. The decision maker may approve an alternative design that achieves the same standard for constrained sites or where deemed unnecessary by the city engineer. 
(Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010) 
12.04.255 - Street design-Alleys. 
    Public alleys shall be provided in the following districts R-5, R-3.5, R-2, MUC-1, MUC-2 and NC zones unless other permanent provisions for private access to off-street parking and loading facilities are approved by the decision maker. The corners of alley intersections shall have a radius of not less than ten feet. 
(Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010) 
12.04.260 - Street design-Transit. 
    Streets shall be designed and laid out in a manner that promotes pedestrian and bicycle circulation. The applicant shall coordinate with transit agencies where the application impacts transit streets as identified in [Section] 17.04.1310. Pedestrian/bicycle access ways shall be provided as necessary in Chapter 12.04 to minimize the travel distance to transit streets and stops and neighborhood activity centers. The decision maker may require provisions, including easements, for transit facilities along transit streets where a need for bus stops, bus pullouts or other transit facilities within or adjacent to the development has been identified. 
(Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010; Ord. No. 13-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-17-2013) 
12.04.265 - Street design-Planter strips. 
    All development shall include vegetative planter strips that are five feet in width or larger and located adjacent to the curb. This requirement may be waived or modified if the decision maker finds it is not practicable. The decision maker may permit constrained sites to place street trees on the abutting private property within ten feet of the public right-of-way if a covenant is recorded on the title of the property identifying the tree as a city street tree which is maintained by the property owner. Development proposed along a collector, minor arterial, or major arterial street may use tree wells with root barriers located near the curb within a wider sidewalk in lieu of a planter strip, in which case each tree shall have a protected area to ensure proper root growth and reduce potential damage to sidewalks, curbs and gutters. 
    To promote and maintain the community tree canopy adjacent to public streets, trees shall be selected and planted in planter strips in accordance with Chapter 12.08, Street Trees. Individual abutting lot owners shall be legally responsible for maintaining healthy and attractive trees and vegetation in the planter strip. If a homeowners' association is created as part of the development, the association may assume the maintenance obligation through a legally binding mechanism, e.g., deed restrictions, maintenance agreement, etc., which shall be reviewed and approved by the city attorney. Failure to properly maintain trees and vegetation in a planter strip shall be a violation of this code and enforceable as a civil infraction. 
(Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010) 
12.04.270 - Standard construction specifications. 
    The workmanship and materials for any work performed under permits issued per this chapter shall be in accordance with the edition of the "Oregon Standard Specifications for Construction" as prepared by the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) and the Oregon Chapter of American Public Works Association (APWA) and as modified and adopted by the city in accordance with this ordinance, in effect at the time of application. The exception to this requirement is where this chapter and the Public Works Street Design Drawings provide other design details, in which case the requirements of this chapter and the Public Works Street Design Drawings shall be complied with. In the case of work within ODOT or Clackamas County rights-of-way, work shall be in conformance with their respective construction standards. 
(Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010; Ord. No. 12-1006, § 2, 9-19-2012) 
12.04.280 - Violation-Penalty. 
    Any act or omission in violation of this chapter shall be deemed a nuisance. Violation of any provision of this chapter is subject to the code enforcement procedures of Chapters 1.16, 1.20 and 1.24.

Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the exclusion of any person lawfully exercising free speech rights or other rights protected by the state or federal constitutions. However, a person engaged in such protected activity who commits acts that are not protected, but that violate applicable provisions of law, shall be subject to exclusion as provided by this section. 
B.  For purposes of this section, "applicable provision of law" includes any applicable provision of Oregon City Municipal Code, of any city ordinance, or of any rule or regulation promulgated by the city manager under OCMC 12.16.020(B), any applicable criminal or traffic law of the state of Oregon, any law regarding controlled substances or alcoholic beverages and any applicable county ordinance or regulation. For purposes of this section, "applicable" means relating to the person's conduct in the park. 
C.  An exclusion issued under the provisions of this section shall be for thirty days. If the person to be excluded has been excluded from city parks at any time within two years before the date of the present exclusion, the exclusion shall be for ninety days. If the person to be excluded has been excluded from city parks on two or more occasions within two years before the date of the present exclusion, the exclusion shall be for 180 days. 
D.  Before issuing an exclusion under this section, a municipal police officer shall first give the person a warning and a reasonable opportunity to desist from the violation. An exclusion shall not be issued if the person promptly complies with the direction and desists from the violation. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, no warning shall be required if the person is to be excluded for engaging in conduct that: 
1.  Is classified as a felony or as a misdemeanor under the following chapters of the Oregon Revised Statutes, or is an attempt, solicitation or conspiracy to commit any such felony or misdemeanor defined in ORS: 
a.  Chapter 162-Offenses Against the State and Public Justice;

g.  Section 12.160.050-Possession of Alcoholic Beverages. 
5.  Is conduct for which the person previously has been warned or excluded for committing in any park. 
E.  Written notice shall be given to any person excluded from the city's parks under this section. The notice shall specify the date and length of the exclusion, shall identify the provision of law the person has violated and shall contain a brief description of the offending conduct. The notice shall inform the excluded person of the right to appeal, including the time limit and the place of delivering the appeal. It shall be signed by the issuing party. Warnings of consequences for failure to comply shall be prominently displayed on the notice. 
F.  A person receiving such notice of exclusion may appeal to the Oregon City Municipal Court. Any appeal must be filed within ten days of the exclusion being issued. The municipal court shall uphold the exclusion if, upon de novo review, the preponderance of evidence admissible convinces the court that, more likely than not, the person in fact committed the violation, and if the exclusion is otherwise in accordance with law. 
G.  At any time within the period of exclusion, a person receiving such notice of exclusion may apply in writing to the city manager for a waiver of some or all of the effects of the exclusion for good reason. If the city manager grants a waiver under this subsection, the city manager shall promptly notify the police department and the director of community services of such action. In exercising discretion under this subsection, the city manager shall consider the seriousness of the violation for which the person has been excluded, the particular need of the person to be in a city park during some or all of the period of exclusion, such as for work or to attend or participate in a particular event (without regard to the content of any speech associated with that event), and any other criterion the city manager determines to be relevant to the determination of whether or not to grant a waiver. Notwithstanding the granting of a waiver under this subsection, the exclusion will be included for purposes of calculating the appropriate length of exclusions under Section 12.16.070(C). The decision of the city manager to grant or deny, in whole or in part, a waiver under this subsection is committed to the sole discretion of the city manager, and is not subject to appeal or review. 
H.  If an appeal of the exclusion is timely filed under Section 12.16.070(F), the effectiveness of the exclusion shall be stayed, pending the outcome of the appeal. If the exclusion is affirmed, the remaining period of exclusion shall be effective immediately upon the issuance of the municipal court decision, unless the municipal court specifies a later effective date. 
I.  If a person is issued a subsequent exclusion while a previous exclusion is stayed pending appeal (or pending judicial review, should a court stay the exclusion), the stayed exclusion shall be counted in determining the appropriate length of the subsequent exclusion under Section 12.16.070(C). If the predicate exclusion is set aside, the term of the subsequent exclusion shall be reduced, as if the predicate exclusion had not been issued. If multiple exclusions issued to a single person are simultaneously stayed pending appeal, the effective periods of those which are affirmed shall run consecutively. 
J.  No person shall enter or remain in any park at any time during which there is in effect a notice of exclusion issued under this section excluding that person from that park.

B.  Prevent water runoff generated by development from exceeding the capacity of downstream stormwater facilities; 
C.  Reduce stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion and pollution, wherever possible, from developed and developing lands; 
D.  Prevent the uncontrolled or irresponsible discharge of stormwater from new development onto adjoining public or private property; 
E.  Maintain the integrity of stream channels for their biological functions, as well as for drainage and other purposes; 
F.  Have stormwater conveyance facilities of adequate design to manage all volumes of water generated in the contributing drainage area, for both the existing condition and the anticipated future condition; 
G.  Have all stormwater facilities: 
1.  Designed to mimic natural hydrologic conditions, to the maximum extent practicable; 
2.  Designed in a manner to allow economical future maintenance; 
3.  If city owned or maintained, designed for maintenance with city owned equipment; 
4.  Designed using materials that will ensure a minimum practical design life of seventy-five years; and 
5.  Designed to have sufficient structural strength to resist erosion and all external loads (construction, traffic, seismic) which may be imposed; 
H.  Establish maintenance easements with the owners of privately owned/maintained stormwater facilities to ensure an appropriate level of maintenance and to help minimize public safety hazards; 
I.  Have all new stormwater facilities comply with applicable National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) requirements; 
J.  Minimize the deterioration of existing watercourses, culverts, bridges, dams and other structures;

13.12.150 - Penalties and enforcement. 
A.  The city is authorized to make inspections and take such actions as required to enforce the provisions of this chapter. The city has the authority to enter onto land for the purpose of inspecting site development activities or resulting improvements. City staff will make an effort to contact the property owner before entering onto that property. 
B.  If the city engineer determines a site has any unpermitted or illegal facilities placed, constructed or installed on the site, then the city engineer shall notify the owner in writing directing the owner to submit a written plan (with construction drawings completed by a professional engineer, if otherwise required by this chapter) within ten calendar days. This plan (and drawings, if required) shall depict the restoration or stabilization of the site or correct the work that has adversely impacted adjacent or downstream property owners. The city engineer shall review the plan (and drawings, if required) for compliance with city standards and issue comments for correction, if necessary, or issue an approval to the owner. The city shall establish a fee by resolution for such review, with all costs borne by the owner. If the required corrective work constitutes a grading permit, then the city shall collect the appropriate grading permit fee. 
C.  Any person, firm, corporation or entity violating any of the provisions of this chapter, whether they be the property owner, the applicant, the contractor or any other person acting with or without the authorization of the property owner or applicant, shall be subject to the code enforcement procedures of Chapters 1.16, 1.20 and 1.24. 
(Ord. No. 15-1006, § 1(Exh. A), 5-20-2015) 
13.12.160 - Hazardous conditions. 
A.  Determination and Notification. If the city engineer determines that any excavation, embankment, erosion/sedimentation control or drainage facility is a safety hazard; endangers property; or adversely affects the safety, use or stability of a public way, water quality resource areas (pursuant to [Chapter] 17.49) or drainage course, the owner(s) of the subject property and/or the person or agent in control of the property shall be required to repair or eliminate the hazard in conformance with the requirements of this chapter and the Public Works Stormwater and Grading Design Standards. At the time that the city engineer makes the determination that a hazardous condition exists, the property owner and/or person or agent in control of the property will be notified in writing that the hazard exists. 
B.  Order to Correct. The city engineer will order the specific work to be undertaken or will order that an engineering design be submitted for review and approval by the city engineer, and will specify the time periods within which the hazardous conditions be repaired or eliminated. In the event that the owner and/or the person or agent in control of the property fails to comply with this order, that person shall be subject to the code enforcement procedures of Chapters 1.16, 1.20, and 1.24. 
(Ord. No. 15-1006, § 1(Exh. A), 5-20-2015) 
13.12.170 - Permits from other jurisdictions. 
A.  The Oregon State Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) currently issues NPDES 1200-C permits for projects that cover areas of one acre or greater. No permit shall be issued for projects of this size (or any other size as modified by DEQ) without a copy of said DEQ permit being on file with Oregon City. DEQ is responsible for policing its own permits; however, if city personnel observe conditions that are believed to be in violation of any such permit, and cannot get corrections made, the city will bring such conditions to the attention of the appropriate DEQ representatives. 
B.  Projects may require Oregon State Division of State Lands (DSL) and/or United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) permits. If such permits are required, no permission to construct will be granted until such a time as a copy of such permit is on file with the city or notice is received from those agencies that a permit is not required. DSL/USACE is responsible for enforcing its own permits; however, if city personnel observe conditions that are believed to be in violation of any such permit, and cannot get corrections made, the city will bring such conditions to the attention of the appropriate DSL/USACE representatives. 
C.  Projects may require Oregon State Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) permits. When ODFW permits are required, no work will be authorized until the receipt of a copy of the ODFW permit. ODFW is responsible for policing its own permits; however, if city personnel observe conditions that are believed to be in violation of any such permit, and cannot get corrections made, the city will bring such conditions to the attention of the appropriate ODFW representatives.

Chapter 13.16 - STORM DRAINAGE SERVICE CHARGES 

13.16.010 - Intent. 
    Pursuant to the constitution and general laws of the state and powers granted in the charter of the city, the commission does declare its intention to acquire, own, construct, equip, operate and maintain within and without the city limits, open drainageways, underground storm drains, equipment and appurtenances necessary, useful or convenient for the construction of storm drainage improvements including maintenance, extension and reconstruction of the present storm drainage system of the city. 
(Prior code §8-9-1) 
13.16.020 - Definitions. 
    As used in this chapter, except where the context otherwise requires: 
    "Area range number (ARN)" are ranges of gross area square footage used to classify nonsingle family residential properties into groups of similar parcel size. Parcels with gross areas of one to two thousand five hundred square feet are assigned an area range number (ARN) 1. Parcels with gross areas of two thousand five hundred to five thousand square feet have an ARN of 2. Parcels with gross areas of five thousand to seven thousand five hundred square feet would have an ARN of 3 and so on so that each additional range of two thousand five hundred square feet shall be counted as an additional ARN of 1. 
    "Development intensity factor (DIF)" is the runoff coefficient that is indicative of the land use or impervious coverage of each property. The following table represents the DIFs for each of the existing land uses and zoning to the use in the calculations. 
Nonresidential Land Use or Zoning Development Intensity Factor LOC limited office conditional 0.70 LO limited office 0.80 NC neighborhood commercial 0.80 HC historic commercial 0.70 LC limited commercial 0.70 C general commercial 0.90 CBD central business district 0.90 M1 light industrial 0.70 M2 heavy industrial 0.80 Conditional use 
or nonconforming Apply a composite 
runoff factor  
    "Equivalent residential unit (ERU)" means a nonresidential configuration estimated to place approximate equal demand on the city's storm drainage system as a residential dwelling unit. The equivalent residential unit (ERU) of a nonresidential property is computed by multiplying the property's area range number (ARN) by its intensity factor (DIF) as follows: 
    ERN = ARN × DIF 
    "Improved property" means any area which has been altered such that the runoff from the property is greater than that which could have been expected in an undeveloped state. Such condition shall be determined by the city engineer. 
    "Nonresidential unit" means any building, or facility or other improved property used other than as a residential dwelling unit. 
    "Residential dwelling unit" means one or more rooms with bathroom and kitchen facilities designed for occupancy by one family. 
(Prior code §8-9-2) 
13.16.030 - Service charges. 
    There is established and imposed on all persons occupying improved properties utilizing the city's storm drainage system, a just and equitable storm drainage utility service charge to implement the city's drainage master plan and pay for the city's storm drainage system. Charges collected shall be deposited into the storm drainage fund of the city and used only for storm drainage purposes. 
(Ord. 93-1025 §1, 1993: prior code §8-9-3) 
13.16.040 - Determination of service. 
    The city commission determines that the property not used for residential dwelling purposes is furnished service in proportion to the size of the property and its development intensity factor based on the definition of "equivalent residential unit" aforesaid. 
(Prior code §8-9-4) 
13.16.050 - Rates. 
    The following rates are established: 
Residential dwelling unit per month $2.00 Nonresidential unit per month 2.00/ERU  
The service charges, pursuant to this section may be amended by the city commission by resolution so as to continue to recover cost of service. 
(Prior code §8-9-5) 
13.16.060 - Payment required. 
    Such service charges shall be paid by the current occupant or person entitled to possession of the property from which stormwater discharges (directly or indirectly) to the city storm drainage system. 
(Ord. 93-1025 §2, 1993: prior code §8-9-6) 
13.16.070 - Collection. 
    The service charges shall be collected with the monthly water bill for those connected to water or billed alone as a storm drainage charge for those users not connected to or not otherwise charged for water service. 
(Prior code §8-9-7) 
13.16.080 - Recovery of unpaid charges. 
    Any charge due hereunder which shall not be paid when due shall be collectable pursuant to collection efforts or other lawful remedies of the city, but no lien may be placed on the property solely for failure to pay the service charges. The city may curtail or cut off the supply of water or other city services to persons who have failed to pay unpaid charges. In no event shall water supply be withheld from any new occupant of property because of the failure of a prior occupant to pay a storm drainage utility service charge. 
(Ord. 93-1025 §3, 1993: prior code §8-9-8) 
13.16.090 - Right of entry. 
    Subject to Constitutional limitations, the employees of the city shall at all reasonable times have access to any premises served by the city for inspection, repair or the enforcement of the provisions of this chapter. 
(Prior code §8-9-9) 
13.16.100 - Exemptions, reductions and appeal. 
    Vacant and unimproved properties within the city are exempt from the charges in Section 13.16.050. Any other person seeking an exemption or reduction in the storm drainage fee, or appealing therefrom, may do so pursuant to a demonstration to the city manager or the manager's designee that the public storm drain service does not receive stormwater from property used or occupied by that person. Such demonstration shall include evidence of legal disposal of stormwater to a private retention system, private storm drain system, public water body, or other receiving facility.

Chapter 13.20 - SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT CHARGE FOR CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS[2] 

Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 14-1011, § 1, adopted Sept. 17, 2014, amended Ch. 13.20 in its entirety to read as herein set out, repealing entirely § 13.20.090 pertaining to undercharged transportation system development charge repayment program, derived from Ord. No. 13-1004, § 1, adopted Feb. 6, 2013. Prior legislative history has been retained in history notes following sections. 

13.20.010 - Purpose and applicability. 
    The purpose of this chapter is to create a system development charge (SDC) to be assessed on development including a new connection or increased size connection to an already existing structure or use that increases the usage or demand on the city's sewer, water, stormwater drainage, parks and transportation systems. SDCs are intended to pay for the cost of constructing or providing capacity in these city systems sufficient to accommodate new development. SDCs are imposed in addition to any assessments, exactions, dedications, charges, fees and any other conditions of development approval application and shall be due and payable at the time of issuance of a building permit. Building permits include new connection or increased size water and sanitary sewer connection permits for an already existing structure or use. SDCs assessed pursuant to this chapter are not within the limits imposed under the Oregon Constitution, Article XI, Section 11b. 
(Ord. 04-1000 (part), 2004: Ord. 97-1032 § 1 (part), 1997) 
(Ord. No. 14-1011, § 1, 9-17-2014) 
13.20.020 - Definitions. 
    For purposes of this chapter, the following definitions shall control: 
    "Applicant" means the party who applies for a building permit that is subject to a system development charge under this chapter. 
    "Capital improvement" means facilities or assets used for the following systems, but does not include the costs of operation or routine maintenance: 
1.  Water supply, treatment or distribution; 
2.  Waste water collection, transmission, treatment and disposal; 
3.  Drainage and flood control; 
4.  Transportation; or 
5.  Parks and recreation. 
    "Capital improvement plan" and "facility master plan" mean any plan adopted by the city pursuant to ORS 223.309. 
    "Condition of development approval" means any requirement imposed by the planning manager, planning commission, city commission or any other city decision-maker on a development. 
    "Connection" means making a new connection or increased size connection to an existing structure or use for city water, sanitary sewer, or stormwater. 
    "Developer" means the successful applicant for any land use, limited land use, expedited land division, planned unit development or permit approved pursuant to Title 16 or 17 of this code. It also means the successful applicant of any building permit that will result in increased usage of a capital improvement. 
    "Development" means any land use, limited land use, expedited land division, planned unit development or permit approved pursuant to Title 16 or 17 of this code. It also means any building permit resulting in increased usage of capital improvements and any new connection or increased size connection for a capital improvement. For purposes of this section, capital improvements include the city's transportation system, water system, sanitary sewer system, parks system, or stormwater drainage system. 
    "Director" means the director of public works or that person's designee. 
    "Improvement fee" means a fee for costs associated with capital improvements yet to be constructed. 
    "Most recent structure or use" for residential structures means any residential structure documented to exist using the city's record of historic aerial photos for year 1994 and after; for non-residential structures means the most recent legally approved use conducted on the subject property after January 1, 2000. A property upon which there has been no residential development since the 1994 aerial photo or upon which there has been no non-residential development after January 1, 2000 does not have a most recent structure or use. 
    "Permit application" means an application for a building permit. 
    "Qualified public improvement" means a capital improvement that is required by the city as a condition of the development approval, is identified in a capital improvement plan or facility master plan adopted pursuant to ORS 223.309 and either: 
1.  Is not located on or contiguous to the property that is the subject of development approval; or 
2.  Is located in whole or in part on or contiguous to the property that is the subject of development approval and, in the opinion of the director, is required to be built larger or with greater capacity than is necessary for the development. There is a rebuttable presumption that improvements built to the city's minimum adopted standards are required to serve the applicant's development and to mitigate for system impacts attributable to the applicant's development. 
    "Reimbursement fee" means a fee for costs associated with capital improvements already constructed or under construction when the fee is established, for which the city determines that capacity exists. 
    "Standard legal rate" means the rate of interest specified in ORS 82.010(1). 
    "System development charge" or "SDC" means a reimbursement fee, an improvement fee or a combination thereof assessed or collected at the time of issuance of a building permit. System development charge includes that portion of a sewer or water system connection charge that is greater than the amount necessary to reimburse the city for its average cost of inspecting and installing connections with water and sewer facilities. System development charge does not include any fees assessed or collected as part of a local improvement district or a charge in lieu of a local improvement district assessment, or the cost of complying with requirements or conditions imposed upon a land use decision, expedited land division or limited land use decision.

13.20.030 - Charge imposed. 
A.  The city commission may establish and modify SDCs from time to time by resolution. 
B.  When an SDC has been established, unless otherwise exempted by the provisions of this chapter or other applicable law, it shall be imposed upon all development within the city, and upon all development outside the boundary of the city that connects to or otherwise uses the capital improvements of the city. The SDC shall be calculated and assessed at the time the city receives a complete building permit application or, if a building permit is not required, at the time of connection to the city's systems. The SDC shall be due and payable at the time the city issues a building permit or, if a building permit is not required, at the time of actual connection to the city's systems. Building permits shall not be issued nor shall connection to the city systems be allowed until the required SDCs are paid in full or a binding payment plan entered into pursuant to Section 13.20.080. 
C.  Any resolution establishing or modifying a reimbursement fee shall contain a methodology which considers the cost of existing facilities, prior contributions by existing users, the value of unused capacity, rate-making principles employed to relevant by the city commission. The methodology shall promote the objective that future system users shall contribute no more than an equitable share of the costs of existing facilities. The city's adoption or modification of an SDC shall comply with the procedural requirements of ORS 223.304(5), and any such decision shall not be a land use or limited land use decision. 
D.  Any resolution establishing or modifying an improvement fee shall contain a methodology which considers the cost of projected capital improvements needed to increase the capacity of the systems to which the fee is related in order to accommodate new development. The city's adoption or modification of an SDC shall comply with the procedural requirements of ORS 223.304(5), and any such decision shall not be a land use or limited land use decision.

(Ord. No. 14-1011, § 1, 9-17-2014) 
13.20.040 - SDC credit. 
    The city shall grant to an applicant a credit against any improvement fee assessed when the applicant, or the developer from whom the applicant purchased a lot, constructs or dedicates a qualified public improvement as part of a development. The initial determination on all credit requests shall be a decision by the director, and the applicant bears the burden of evidence and persuasion in establishing entitlement to an SDC credit and the amount of SDC credit in accordance with the requirements of this chapter. 
A.  To obtain an SDC credit, the applicant must make the request in writing prior to the city's issuance of the first building permit for the development in question. In the request, the applicant must identify the improvement for which credit is sought, explain how the improvement is a qualified public improvement, and document, with credible evidence, the value of the improvement for which credit is sought. If, in the opinion of the director, the improvement is a qualified public improvement, the city shall allow an SDC credit to the applicant against the SDC to which the improvement is related in an amount equal to the fair market value of the improvement. Fair market value shall be determined by the director based on credible evidence of the following: 
1.  For dedicated lands, value shall be based upon a written appraisal of fair market value by a qualified, professional appraiser based upon comparable sales of similar property between unrelated parties in an arms-length transaction; 
2.  For a qualified public improvement, value shall be approved by director, based upon a detailed cost estimate for anticipated cost of construction including supporting cost documentation. Any such cost estimates shall be based on industry standard and prepared and certified by a professional engineer with supporting cost documentation based on a fixed detailed price bid from a contractor ready and able to construct the improvement(s) for which SDC credit is sought or current prices from at least two contractors' detailed price bid for similar public improvements; 
3.  For a qualified public improvement located on, or contiguous to, the site of the development, only the over-capacity portion as described in the definition of qualified public improvement is eligible for SDC credit. There is a rebuttable presumption that the over-capacity portion of such a qualified public improvement is limited to the portion constructed larger, or of greater capacity, than the city's minimum standard facility capacity or size needed to serve the particular development. 
B.  Form of Credit and Limitation on Use. When given, SDC credits shall be for a particular dollar value as a credit against an SDC assessed on a development. Credits may only be used to defray or pay the SDC for the particular capital improvement system to which the qualified public improvement related, e.g., credit from a qualified public improvement for sewer may only be used to pay or defray a sewer SDC. 
C.  Credit Carry-Forward. Where the amount of an SDC credit approved under this section exceeds the amount of an SDC assessed on a development for a particular capital improvement system, the excess credit may be carried forward pursuant to the following rules: 
1.  An SDC credit carry-forward shall be issued by the director for a particular dollar value to the developer who earned the SDC credit and may be used by the developer to satisfy SDC requirements for any other development applied for by the developer within the city. SDC credit carry-forwards are not negotiable or transferable to any party other than the one to whom they are issued. 
2.  The city shall accept an SDC credit carry-forward presented by a developer as full or partial payment for the SDC due on any of the developer's developments. 
3.  SDC credit carry-forwards are void and of no value if not redeemed with the city for payment of an SDC of the same type of capital improvement system for which the credit was issued within ten years of the date of issuance.

(Ord. No. 14-1011, § 1, 9-17-2014; Ord. No. 17-1013, § 1, 12-20-2017) 
13.20.050 - SDC reduction or reimbursement. 
    In the event an applicant's development involves the redevelopment of property, the applicant may be eligible for a reduced SDC. In that event, the amount of the SDC assessed upon the development shall be calculated by the director as follows: 
A.  The SDC required under the current methodology minus the SDC that would be attributable to the most recent structure or use (if one exists) for all adopted SDC types. 
    If the SDC attributable to the most recent structure or use exceeds the SDC assessed upon the applicant's development, then no SDC shall be owed and no refund or reimbursement shall be granted.

(Ord. No. 14-1011, § 1, 9-17-2014; Ord. No. 17-1013, § 1, 12-20-2017) 
13.20.060 - Authorized expenditures. 
A.  General. SDC proceeds may only be expended on capital improvements included on a list of capital improvements that the city intends to fund, in whole or in part, with SDC revenues, including the cost of compliance with this chapter, development of capital improvement plans or facility master plans, development of methodologies, annual accounting of SDC expenditures, debt repayment, engineering, design and construction and related expenses. 
B.  Reimbursement Fee. Proceeds from reimbursement fees shall be spent only on capital improvements associated with the systems for which the fees are assessed. 
C.  Improvement Fee. Proceeds from improvement fees shall be spent only on capacity increasing capital improvements. An increase in system capacity is presumed to exist if a capital improvement increases the capacity or level of performance or service provided by the existing facilities or provides new facilities to meet increased demand. The portion of the capital improvements funded by improvement fees must be related to the need for increased capacity to provide service for future users. 
D.  Limitations. SDC proceeds shall not be used to pay the costs of, or associated with, the construction of administrative office facilities that are more than an incidental part of other capital improvements nor for operation or routine maintenance of capital improvements.

A.  SDC Assessment, Reduction and Reimbursement Appeals. An applicant may appeal the director's decision as to the amount of an SDC or the amount of an SDC reduction or reimbursement to the city commission by filing with the city recorder a notice of appeal within fourteen days of the date of the director's decision. The notice of appeal shall explain how the applicant is aggrieved and shall set forth with particularity the basis for the appeal. In response to a timely-filed appeal, the city commission shall hold an evidentiary hearing during which the applicant may substantiate with additional evidence its claim for a different SDC assessment, reduction or reimbursement. The city commission shall make a de novo review of the director's decision and issue its own decision in writing, which shall be final when signed by the mayor. The city shall withhold the issuance of building and other permits relating to the property for which an appeal has been filed until all such appeals are conclusively resolved. 
B.  Credit Appeals. An applicant may appeal the director's decision on an SDC credit request to the city commission by filing with the city recorder a notice of appeal within fourteen days of when the director's decision is signed. The notice of appeal shall explain how the applicant is aggrieved and shall set forth with particularity the basis for the appeal. In response to a timely-filed SDC credit appeal, the city commission shall hold an evidentiary hearing during which the applicant may substantiate with additional evidence its claim for the credit request and the amount of that claim. The city commission shall make a de novo review of the director's decision and issue its own decision in writing, which shall be final when signed by the mayor. The city shall withhold the issuance of building and other permits relating to the property for which an appeal has been filed until all such appeals are conclusively resolved. 
C.  Expenditure Appeals. Any aggrieved party may appeal an expenditure of SDC funds by filing with the city recorder a notice of appeal within two years of the date of the challenged expenditure. In response to a timely-filed SDC expenditure appeal, the city commission shall hold an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the challenged expenditure was in accordance with ORS 223.297 to 223.314 and the requirements of this chapter. If the city commission determines there was an improper expenditure of SDC funds, the city commission shall direct that a sum equal to the misspent amount be deposited within one year to the credit of the account of the fund from which it was spent.

13.20.080 - Deferred SDC payment allowed. 
A.  SDCs must either be paid in full upon issuance of building permits or payment may be deferred. 
B.  The city finance director shall provide the applicant with the appropriate forms, which may include a requirement for security acceptable to the city for the unpaid balance and interest, or a valid consent to lien the affected property, a waiver of all rights to contest the validity of the lien, and the classification of the charge as not within the limits imposed under Oregon Constitution, Article XI, Section 11b. 
C.  The city finance director shall provide to the city commission annually an accounting of the total deferred SDCs that are outstanding. 
D.  The city finance director shall docket any lien in the lien docket. From that time, the city shall have a lien upon the described parcel for the amount of the unpaid SDC, together with both interest on the unpaid balance at the standard legal rate and any actual costs incurred as a result of the deferral. The lien shall be enforceable in the manner provided in ORS Chapter 223, and shall have priority over all other liens to the extent allowed by applicable law.

E.  Franchise Agreements. If the public interest warrants, as determined by the city, the city and utility operator may enter into a written franchise agreement that includes terms that clarify, enhance, expand, waive or vary the provisions of this chapter, consistent with applicable state and federal law. The franchise may conflict with the terms of this chapter with the review and approval of [the] city commission. The franchisee shall be subject to the provisions of this chapter to the extent such provisions are not in conflict with any such franchise. 
F.  Rights Granted. 
1.  The license granted hereunder shall authorize and permit the licensee, subject to the provisions of the city code and other applicable provisions of state or federal law, to construct, place, maintain and operate utility facilities in the rights-of-way for the term of the license. 
2.  Any license granted pursuant to this chapter shall not convey equitable or legal title in the rights-of-way, and may not be assigned or transferred except as permitted in subsection K of this section. 
3.  Neither the issuance of the license nor any provisions contained therein shall constitute a waiver or bar to the exercise of any governmental right or power, police power or regulatory power of the city as may exist at the time the license is issued or thereafter obtained. 
G.  Term. Subject to the termination provisions in subsection M of this section, the license granted pursuant to this chapter will remain in effect for a term of five years.

No license granted pursuant to this section shall confer any exclusive right, privilege, license or franchise to occupy or use the rights-of-way for delivery of utility services or any other purpose. The city expressly reserves the right to grant licenses, franchises or other rights to other persons, as well as the city's right to use the rights-of-way, for similar or different purposes. The license is subject to all recorded deeds, easements, dedications, conditions, covenants, restrictions, encumbrances, and claims of title of record that may affect the rights-of-way. Nothing in the license shall be deemed to grant, convey, create, or vest in licensee a real property interest in land, including any fee, leasehold interest or easement. 
I.  Reservation of City Rights. Nothing in the license shall be construed to prevent the city from grading, paving, repairing and/or altering any rights-of-way, constructing, laying down, repairing, relocating or removing city facilities or establishing any other public work, utility or improvement of any kind, including repairs, replacement or removal of any city facilities. If any of licensee's utility facilities interfere with the construction, repair, replacement, alteration or removal of any rights-of-way, public work, city utility, city improvement or city facility, except those providing utility services in competition with a licensee, licensee's facilities shall be removed or relocated as provided in subsections C, D and E of Section 13.34.090, in a manner acceptable to the city and consistent with industry standard engineering and safety codes. 
J.  Multiple Services. 
1.  A utility operator that provides or transmits or allows the provision or transmission of utility services and other services over its facilities is subject to the license and right-of-way usage fee requirements of this chapter for the portion of the facilities and extent of utility services delivered over those facilities. 
2.  A utility operator that provides or transmits more than one utility service over its facilities is not required to obtain a separate license or franchise for each utility service, provided that it gives notice to the city of each utility service provided or transmitted and pays the applicable right-of-way usage fee for each utility service. 
K.  Transfer or Assignment. To the extent permitted by applicable state and federal laws, the licensee shall obtain the written consent of the city prior to the transfer or assignment of the license. The license shall not be transferred or assigned unless the proposed transferee or assignee is authorized under all applicable laws to own or operate the utility system and the transfer or assignment is approved by all agencies or organizations required or authorized under federal and state laws to approve such transfer or assignment. If a license is transferred or assigned, the transferee or assignee shall become responsible for all facilities of the licensee at the time of transfer or assignment. A transfer or assignment of a license does not extend the term of the license. 
L.  Renewal. At least ninety, but no more than one hundred eighty, days prior to the expiration of a license granted pursuant to this section, a licensee seeking renewal of its license shall submit a license application to the city, including all information required in subsection B of this section and the application fee required in subsection C of this section. The city shall review the application as required by subsection D of this section and grant or deny the license within ninety days of submission of the application. If the city determines that the licensee is in violation of the terms of this chapter at the time it submits its application, the city may require that the licensee cure the violation or submit a detailed plan to cure the violation within a reasonable period of time, as determined by the city, before the city will consider the application and/or grant the license.

g.  Failure to obtain or maintain any and all licenses, permits, certifications and other authorizations required by state or federal law for the placement, maintenance and/or operation of the utility facilities. 
2.  Standards for Revocation or Termination. In determining whether termination, revocation or some other sanction is appropriate, the following factors shall be considered: 
a.  The egregiousness of the misconduct; 
b.  The harm that resulted; 
c.  Whether the violation was intentional; 
d.  The utility operator's history of compliance; and/or 
e.  The utility operator's cooperation in discovering, admitting and/or curing the violation. 
3.  Notice and Cure. The city shall give the utility operator written notice of any apparent violations before terminating a license. The notice shall include a short and concise statement of the nature and general facts of the violation or noncompliance and provide a reasonable time (no less than twenty and no more than forty days) for the utility operator to demonstrate that the utility operator has remained in compliance, that the utility operator has cured or is in the process of curing any violation or noncompliance, or that it would be in the public interest to impose a penalty or sanction less than termination or revocation. If the utility operator is in the process of curing a violation or noncompliance, the utility operator must demonstrate that it acted promptly and continues to actively work on compliance. If the utility operator does not respond or if the city manager or designee determines that the utility operator's response is inadequate, the city manager or designee shall refer the matter to the city commission, which shall provide a duly noticed public hearing to determine whether the license shall be terminated or revoked.

A.  Construction Codes. Utility facilities shall be constructed, installed, operated and maintained in accordance with all applicable federal, state and local codes, rules and regulations, including but not limited to the National Electrical Code and the National Electrical Safety Code and the city's pavement cut standards. When a utility operator, or any person acting on its behalf, does any work in or affecting the rights-of-way, the utility operator shall, at its own expense, promptly restore the rights-of-way as directed by the city consistent with applicable city codes, rules and regulations. A utility operator or other person acting on its behalf shall use suitable barricades, flags, flagging attendants, lights, flares and other measures as required for the safety of all members of the general public and to prevent injury or damage to any person, vehicle or property by reason of such work in or affecting the rights-of-way or property. 
B.  Construction Permits. 
1.  No person shall perform any work on utility facilities within the rights-of-way without first obtaining all required permits. The city shall not issue a permit for the construction, installation, maintenance or repair of utility facilities unless the utility operator of the facilities has applied for and received the license required by this chapter, or has a current franchise with the city, and all applicable fees have been paid. No permit is required for service drops to customer premises or routine maintenance or repairs where such drops, repairs or maintenance do not require cutting, digging, or breaking of, or damage to, the right-of-way and do not result in closing or blocking any portion of the travel lane for vehicular traffic, bicycle lanes or sidewalks. 
2.  In the event of an emergency, a utility operator with a license pursuant to this chapter or its contractor may perform work on its utility facilities without first obtaining a permit from the city, provided that, to the extent reasonably feasible, it attempts to notify the city prior to commencing the emergency work and in any event applies for a permit from the city as soon as reasonably practicable, but not more than forty-eight hours after commencing the emergency work. As used in this subsection, "emergency" means a circumstance in which immediate repair to damaged or malfunctioning facilities is necessary to restore lost service or prevent immediate harm to persons or property. 
3.  Applications for permits to construct utility facilities shall be submitted upon forms to be provided by the city and shall be accompanied by drawings, plans and specifications in sufficient detail to demonstrate: 
a.  That the facilities will be constructed in accordance with all applicable codes, rules and regulations. 
b.  The location and route of all utility facilities to be installed aboveground or on existing utility poles. 
c.  The location and route of all utility facilities on or in the rights-of-way to be located under the surface of the ground, including the line and grade proposed for the burial at all points along the route that are within the rights-of-way. Applicant's existing utility facilities shall be differentiated on the plans from new construction. The public works director may require additional information necessary to demonstrate that the proposed location can accommodate the utility facilities. 
d.  The construction methods to be employed for protection of existing structures, fixtures, and facilities within or adjacent to the rights-of-way, and description of any improvements that applicant proposes to temporarily or permanently remove or relocate. 
4.  All permit applications shall be accompanied by the verification of a professional engineer, or other qualified and duly authorized representative of the applicant, that the drawings, plans and specifications submitted with the application comply with applicable technical codes, rules and regulations. 
5.  All permit applications shall be accompanied by a written construction schedule, which shall include a deadline for completion of construction. The construction schedule is subject to approval by public works director. 
6.  Prior to issuance of a construction permit, the applicant shall pay a permit fee in an amount to be determined by resolution of the city commission. 
7.  If satisfied that the applications, plans and documents submitted comply with all requirements of this chapter, the public works director shall issue a permit authorizing construction of the utility facilities, subject to such further conditions, restrictions or regulations affecting the time, place and manner of performing the work as they may deem necessary or appropriate. 
8.  Except in the case of an emergency, the permittee shall notify the public works director not less than two working days in advance of any excavation or construction in the rights-of-way. 
9.  All construction practices and activities shall be in accordance with the permit and approved final plans and specifications for the utility facilities. The public works director and designated representatives shall be provided access to the work site and such further information as they may require to ensure compliance with such requirements. 
10.  All work which does not comply with the permit, the approved or corrected plans and specifications for the work, or the requirements of this chapter, shall be removed at the sole expense of the permittee. The city is authorized to stop work in order to assure compliance with the provision of this chapter. If the permittee fails to remove work as required in this subsection, the city may remove the work at the expense of the permittee, after notice and opportunity to cure. 
11.  The permittee shall promptly complete all construction activities so as to minimize disruption of the city rights-of-way and other public and private property. All construction work within the rights-of-way, including restoration, must be completed within sixty days of the date of issuance of the construction permit unless an extension or an alternate schedule has been approved by the appropriate city official. 
C.  Performance Surety. 
1.  The city may require a performance bond or other form of surety acceptable to the city equal to at least one hundred percent of the estimated cost of the work within the rights-of-way of the city be provided before construction is commenced. 
2.  In the event the performance bond or other form of surety acceptable to the city is required, it shall: 
a.  Remain in force until sixty days after substantial completion of the work, as determined in writing by the city, including restoration of rights-of-way and other property affected by the construction; and 
b.  The performance bond or other form of surety acceptable to the city shall guarantee, to the satisfaction of the city: 
i.  Timely completion of the work; 
ii.  That the work is performed in compliance with applicable plans, permits, technical codes and standards; 
iii.  Proper location of the facilities as specified by the city; 
iv.  Restoration of the rights-of-way and other property affected by the work; and

D.  Injury to Persons or Property. A utility operator shall preserve and protect from injury or damage other utility operators' facilities in the rights-of-way, the public using the rights-of-way and any adjoining property, and take other necessary measures to protect life and property, including but not limited to buildings, walls, fences, trees or facilities that may be subject to damage from the permitted work. A utility operator shall be responsible for all injury to persons or damage to public or private property resulting from its failure to properly protect people and property and to carry out the work. 
E.  Restoration. 
1.  When a utility operator, or any person acting on its behalf, does any work in or affecting any rights-of-way, it shall, at its own expense, promptly restore such ways or property to the same or better condition as existed before the work was undertaken, in accordance with applicable federal, state and local laws, codes, ordinances, rules and regulations, unless otherwise directed by the city and as determined by the public works director. 
2.  If weather or other conditions beyond the utility operator's control do not permit the complete restoration required by the city, the utility operator shall temporarily restore the affected rights-of-way or property. Such temporary restoration shall be at the utility operator's sole expense and the utility operator shall promptly undertake and complete the required permanent restoration when the weather or other conditions no longer prevent such permanent restoration. Any corresponding modification to the construction schedule may be subject to approval by the city. 
3.  If the utility operator fails to restore rights-of-way or property as required in this chapter, the city shall give the utility operator written notice and provide the utility operator a reasonable period of time not less than ten days, unless an emergency or threat to public safety is deemed to exist, and not exceeding thirty days, or such additional time agreed to in writing by the city, to restore the rights-of-way or property. If, after said notice, the utility operator fails to restore the rights-of-way or property as required in this chapter, the city shall cause such restoration to be made at the expense of the utility operator. 
F.  Inspection. Every utility operator's facilities shall be subject to the right of periodic inspection by the city to determine compliance with the provisions of this chapter and all other applicable state and city codes, ordinances, rules and regulations. Every utility operator shall cooperate with the city in permitting the inspection of utility facilities upon request of the city. The utility operator shall perform all testing, or permit the city to perform any testing at the utility operator's expense, required by the city to determine that the installation of the utility operator's facilities and the restoration of the right-of-way comply with the terms of this chapter and applicable state and city codes, ordinances, rules and regulations. 
G.  Coordination of Construction. All utility operators are required to make a good faith effort to both cooperate with and coordinate their construction schedules with those of the city and other users of the rights-of-way. 
1.  Prior to January 1 of each year, utility operators shall provide the city with a schedule of known proposed construction activities for that year in, around or that may affect the rights-of-way. 
2.  Utility operators shall meet with the city annually, or as determined by the city, to schedule and coordinate construction in the rights-of-way. 
3.  All construction locations, activities and schedules within the rights-of-way shall be coordinated as ordered by the public works director, to minimize public inconvenience, disruption, or damages.

A.  Location of Facilities. Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the city: 
1.  Utility facilities shall be installed underground in all areas of the city where there are no existing poles in the right-of-way or no space on existing poles in the right-of-way. This requirement shall not apply to pedestals, cabinets or other above-ground equipment of any utility operator. The city reserves the right to require written approval of the location of any such above-ground equipment in the right-of-way. 
2.  Whenever any existing electric utilities, cable facilities or communications facilities are located underground within a right-of-way of the city, the utility operator with permission to occupy the same right-of-way shall locate its facilities underground at its own expense. This requirement shall not apply to facilities used for transmission of electric energy at nominal voltages in excess of thirty-five thousand volts in areas where there are existing poles in the right-of-way, or to pedestals, cabinets or other above-ground equipment of any utility operator. The city reserves the right to require written approval of the location of any such above-ground equipment in the right-of-way. 
B.  Interference with the Rights-of-Way. No utility operator or other person may locate or maintain its facilities so as to unreasonably interfere with the use of the rights-of-way by the city, by the general public or by other persons authorized to use or be present in or upon the rights-of-way. All use of the rights-of-way shall be consistent with city codes, ordinances, rules and regulations. 
C.  Relocation of Utility Facilities. 
1.  A utility operator shall, at no cost to the city, temporarily or permanently remove, relocate, change or alter the position of any utility facility within a right-of-way, including relocation of aerial facilities underground, when requested to do so in writing by the city. 
2.  Nothing herein shall be deemed to preclude the utility operator from requesting reimbursement or compensation from a third party, pursuant to applicable laws, regulations, tariffs or agreements, provided that the utility operator shall timely comply with the requirements of this section regardless of whether or not it has requested or received such reimbursement or compensation. 
3.  The city shall provide written notice of the time by which the utility operator must remove, relocate, change, alter or underground its facilities. If a utility operator fails to remove, relocate, alter or underground any utility facility as requested by the city and by the date reasonably established by the city, the utility operator shall pay all costs incurred by the city due to such failure, including but not limited to costs related to project delays, and the city may cause the utility facility to be removed, relocated, altered or undergrounded at the utility operator's sole expense. Upon receipt of a detailed invoice from the city, the utility operator shall reimburse the city for the costs the city incurred within thirty days. 
D.  Removal of Unauthorized Facilities. 
1.  Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the public works director, within thirty days following written notice from the city or such other time agreed to in writing by the city, a utility operator and any other person that owns, controls, or maintains any abandoned or unauthorized utility facility within a right-of-way shall, at its own expense, remove the facility and restore the right-of-way. 
2.  A utility system or facility is unauthorized under any of the following circumstances: 
a.  The utility facility is outside the scope of authority granted by the city under the license, franchise or other written agreement. This includes facilities that were never licensed or franchised and facilities that were once licensed or franchised but for which the license or franchise has expired or been terminated. This does not include any facility for which the city has provided written authorization for abandonment in place. 
b.  The facility has been abandoned and the city has not provided written authorization for abandonment in place. A facility is abandoned if it is not in use and is not planned for further use. A facility will be presumed abandoned if it is not used for a period of twelve consecutive months. A utility operator may overcome this presumption by presenting plans for future use of the facility. 
c.  The utility facility is improperly constructed or installed or is in a location not permitted by the construction permit, license, franchise or this chapter. 
d.  The utility operator is in violation of a material provision of this chapter and fails to cure such violation within thirty days of the city sending written notice of such violation, unless the city extends such time period in writing. 
E.  Removal by City. 
1.  The city retains the right and privilege to cut or move the facilities of any utility operator or similar entity located within the rights-of-way of the city, without notice, as the city may determine to be necessary, appropriate or useful in response to a public health or safety emergency. The city will use qualified personnel or contractors consistent with applicable state and federal safety laws and regulations to the extent reasonably practicable without impeding the city's response to the emergency. The city will use best efforts to provide the utility operator with notice prior to cutting or moving facilities. If prior notice is not possible, the city will provide such notice as soon as reasonably practicable after taking such action. 
2.  If the utility operator fails to remove any facility when required to do so under this chapter, the city may, upon at least ten days' prior written notice, remove the facility using qualified personnel or contractors consistent with applicable state and federal safety laws and regulations and industry standards, and the utility operator shall be responsible for paying the full cost of the removal and any administrative costs incurred by the city in removing the facility and obtaining reimbursement. Upon receipt of a detailed invoice from the city, the utility operator shall reimburse the city for the costs the city incurred within thirty days. The obligation to remove shall survive the termination of the license or franchise. 
3.  The city shall not be liable to any utility operator for any damage to utility facilities, or for any consequential losses resulting directly or indirectly therefrom, by the city or its contractor in removing, relocating or altering the facilities pursuant to subsections B, C or D of this section or undergrounding its facilities as required by subsection A of this section, or resulting from the utility operator's failure to remove, relocate, alter or underground its facilities as required by those subsections, unless such damage arises directly from the city's negligence or willful misconduct. 
F.  Engineering Record Drawings. The utility operator shall provide the city with two complete sets of record drawings in a form acceptable to the city upon completion of construction.

Upon receipt of a detailed invoice from the city, the utility operator shall reimburse the city for the costs the city incurred within thirty days. 
(Ord. No. 13-1014, § 1(Exh. A), 11-6-2013)

B.  A utility operator whose only facilities in the right-of-way are facilities mounted on structures within the right-of-way, which structures are owned by another person, and with no facilities strung between such structures or otherwise within, under or above the right-of-way, shall pay the attachment fee set by commission resolution for each attachment, or such other fee set forth in the license granted by the city. Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the city, the fee shall be paid annually, in arrears, for each year during the term of this license within thirty days after the end of each calendar year, and shall be accompanied by information sufficient to illustrate the calculation of the amount payable. The utility shall pay interest at the rate of nine percent per year for any payment made after the due date.

B.  If the city's audit of the books, records and other documents or information of the utility operator or utility service provider demonstrate that the utility operator or provider has underpaid the right-of-way usage fee or franchise fee by three percent or more in any one year, the utility operator shall reimburse the city for the cost of the audit, in addition to any interest owed pursuant to Section 13.34.130 or as specified in a franchise.

B.  The staff presents the building's condition to the historic review board at a noticed public meeting with a report detailing the defects that, in the staff's opinion, qualifies the structure for demolition by neglect. To proceed with the citation process the historic review board must vote by a majority to make a preliminary finding of demolition by neglect. 
C.  If the historic review board makes a preliminary determination, the owner shall be notified by certified mail of the defects in the building. The owner shall be given thirty days in which to respond to the preliminary determination by obtaining a certificate of appropriateness from the community development director for the corrective work. If a certificate of appropriateness is issued at this point, it will detail the specific work that is necessary to correct the demolition by neglect conditions, and a time limit for work to begin and be completed shall be set. 
D.  If the owner of the property receives the letter regarding the preliminary determination, but either fails to respond or wishes to present his/her case in front of the historic review board, the matter shall be referred to the historic review board for a citation hearing. If the owner fails to receive the letter regarding the preliminary determination after two attempts, the building shall be posted with a notice of the violation in accordance with the provisions of the ordinance, and a public hearing on the citation shall be scheduled. 
E.  At the public hearing the historic review board may issue a citation to the owner of the property for failure to correct the demolition by neglect conditions. The citation shall be made by a vote of the majority of the historic review board on a motion recognizing the condition of the building and the owner's failure to correct the defects. The owner shall be invited to the public hearing to address the historic review board's concerns and to show cause why a citation should not be issued. The historic review board may also defer the matter to give the owner more time either to correct the deficiencies, make a proposal for repairs, or perhaps sell the property. 
F.  If the owner is cited for the condition of demolition by neglect of the property, the owner shall be given ten days grace period to respond with a proposal to correct the defects. 
    If the owner fails to respond after the ten-day grace period following the citation, or has proposed a plan that does not fully address the stabilization defects, or does not receive a certificate of appropriateness for the proposed work, the building shall be turned over to the code enforcement division for action in Municipal Court per Oregon City Municipal Code 1.25. In absence of a stabilization plan, the city may hire an inspector or structural/building specialist to estimate the cost to bring the building out of demolition by neglect status. The city may charge the cost of the analysis to the owner to be included in any future liens.

The city recorder shall forward to the owner a notice setting forth the expense incurred, stating that such expense will be assessed against the real property involved and that any objections must be filed in writing with the city recorder within twenty days of the date of mailing. If such objections be filed, the commission shall set a date for hearing and determine the amount of assessment. The expense so incurred or determined upon hearing shall then be assessed by ordinance, entered in the city lien docket, and shall be collected and foreclosed as in the manner for collection of city liens for street and sewer improvements.

Chapter 15.44 - FIRE CODE INSPECTIONS AND FEE SCHEDULE 

15.44.010 - Inspections. 
    The fire chief, at his or her discretion, may require an inspection of property or structures within the city to verify compliance with the Oregon City Fire Code. When such a request is so presented to the occupant of a property or the party responsible for a property, the occupant or responsible party shall allow the inspection within twenty-four hours of the request. In performing such an inspection, the fire department shall make an initial determination as to compliance with the Oregon City Fire Code. If the property or structure is found not to be in compliance with the Fire Code, the occupant or responsible party will receive from the fire department a report describing the violations and the period in which the violations must be remedied. At the expiration of that period the fire department will reinspect the property to determine if the identified deficiencies have been remedied. If the property remains in noncompliance, the same procedure will be repeated until a reinspection reveals that the property is in compliance with the Fire Code. Once the property is determined by the fire department to be in compliance with the Oregon City Fire Code, a certificate of compliance, valid until the next fire inspection, will be issued to the occupant or the party responsible for the property. 
(Ord. 91-1015 §1 (part), 1991: prior code §6-6-1)

    "Closure of a manufactured home park" means to stop or cease leasing spaces in a manufactured home park, to terminate manufactured home space rental agreements for all or a portion of the park spaces, or to otherwise engage in activity to effect termination of rental agreements or leases or to evict tenants. Termination of tenancy under ORS 90.630(9) or actions required by the exercise of eminent domain or by order of state or local agencies shall not constitute closure of a manufactured home park. Sale of a manufactured home park to an organization comprised of tenants of the park is not a closure of the park.

8.  Temporary housing and meals for the tenant and permanent occupants during unit relocation and set up. 
    Notwithstanding the above, relocation costs shall not include, and shall be offset by, relocation assistance received, including, but not limited to financial incentives to move into a new park, from a person or entity other than the owner. 
    "Relocation zone" means the area that is as close as possible to a park that is to be closed, which shall be not more than one hundred miles, and which contains sufficient comparable manufactured home space to allow the relocation of all tenants in the park.

(Ord. 06-1008 §2(part), 2006) 
15.52.050 - Relocation plan. 
    A relocation plan for tenants of the manufactured home park shall be submitted for review and approval as part of the application for a closure permit. The relocation plan shall provide, at a minimum, for the following: 
A.  The relocation plan shall provide for the owner to pay all reasonable relocation costs to a comparable manufactured home park space within the relocation zone to any tenant who relocates from the park after the owner provides notice of termination under ORS 90.630(5). However, in no event shall the owner be required to pay more than fifteen thousand dollars for relocation costs of any manufactured home. When any tenant has given notice of their intent to move prior to the owner's provision of notice of termination under ORS 90.630(5), eligibility to receive moving expenses shall be forfeited. The relocation plan need not require payment by the owner to any tenant who became a tenant after the owner applied for the closure permit, provided the owner gave the tenant a copy of the closure permit application prior to the tenant's agreeing to become a tenant. 
B.  The relocation plan shall identify those manufactured homes that cannot be relocated to a comparable manufactured home park space within the relocation zone. The owner shall be required to offer to purchase any manufactured home that cannot be relocated in conformance with this chapter. 
1.  The offer to purchase the manufactured home will be made at the real market value of the home as reported on the most recent property tax assessment. To the extent the tenant or owner believes the most recent property tax assessment does not accurately reflect the fair market value of a manufactured home, the tenant or owner may submit additional written information to the city manager reflecting the true fair market value. 
2.  If the owner submits additional information, it shall be submitted with the relocation plan. If the tenant submits additional information, it shall be received by the city within fourteen days of the submittal of the relocation plan. 
3.  The city manager shall either evaluate the additional information or appoint a three member valuation board to review the additional information and determine the fair market value of the manufactured home. The decision of the city manager or valuation board shall be the final decision of the city on the value of the manufactured home. 
C.  In order to facilitate a proposed closure, the tenants and owner(s) may agree to mutually satisfactory conditions. To be valid, however, such an agreement shall be in writing, shall include a provision stating that the tenant is aware of the provisions of this chapter, shall include a copy of the ordinance codified in this chapter as an attachment, shall include a provision in at least twelve-point type that clearly informs the tenants that they have the right to seek the advice of an attorney of their choice prior to signing the agreement with regard to their rights under such agreement and shall be drafted in the form and content otherwise required by applicable state law.

Such evidence may include an agreement with or a sale to a tenant association or tenant nonprofit corporation representing two-thirds or more of the tenants. The requirement for a closure permit shall be waived if sufficient agreements under this section have been entered into.

4.  The section does not apply to those sales and transfers described in ORS 90.820(4) or to any offer or listing agreement made before this section was adopted. 
B.  In the event the owner subdivides the manufactured home park to create a manufactured home subdivision, each tenant shall have the right to purchase the lot on which the tenant's home is situated. In the event that the owner and tenant are unable to reach agreement as to price, the tenant shall have the right to match any offer from a third party that is acceptable to the owner.

In making that determination, the commission shall consider the amount and percentage of value loss, the extent of remaining uses, past, present and future, the seriousness of the public problem caused by the owner's acts of closure, the degree to which these provisions mitigate the problem and the feasibility of less oppressive solutions. The commission shall consider other factors as may be relevant or necessary to achieve a lawful application of these provisions. The commission shall make written findings, supported by substantial evidence, of the extent to which application of these provisions are unduly oppressive, and articulate those requirements or payments that the owner need not bear to avoid such oppression. As to these requirements or payments, the owner shall be relieved. As to the remaining owner obligations, the commission shall, considering the record of the proceedings, the unmitigated impacts upon the tenants, and the intent and purpose of this chapter, declare the manner in which such obligations shall appear in the relocation plan or other conditions of the manufactured home park closure permit. 
    Appeal of commission action under this section shall be by writ of review of other appropriate procedure.

Chapter 16.08 - SUBDIVISIONS-PROCESS AND STANDARDS[2] 

Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 08-1014, adopted Jul. 1, 2009, repealed Chapter 16.08 in its entirety and enacted new provisions to read as herein set out. Prior to amendment, Chapter 16.08 pertained to similar subject matter. See Ordinance Disposition List for derivation. 

16.08.010 - Purpose and general provisions. 
A.  Applicability. This chapter controls the process and approval standards applicable to subdivisions including Chapters 16.08, 12.04, 16.12, and 17.50 of the Oregon City Municipal Code as well as any other applicable chapters. A subdivision is defined as a single division of land into four or more lots within a calendar year. 
B.  These applications shall generally follow a Type II process. However, if an applicant opts to process either application as an expedited land division, the city shall follow the decision-making process provided by state law and apply the applicable approval standards set forth in this code and elsewhere. 
C.  Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to provide a speedy review and decision-making process with relatively clear and objective criteria indicating little discretion, with little opportunity to deviate from the city's dimensional standards. If an applicant wishes greater flexibility in lotting pattern or layout, phasing of development, or relief from dimensional or public improvement standards, the appropriate procedure would be a master plan under Chapter 17.65 or an additional application for a variance(s) under Chapter 17.60. 
D.  Process Overview. Subdivision review process requires a two-step process: preliminary and final plats. The preliminary plat, reviewed through a Type II process, provides all of the essential information about the proposal, including layout, number and pattern of lots, location of all existing structures and improvements, significant natural features, development schedule and any other required information. The final plat is a formal reproduction of the approved preliminary plat, including all conditions imposed by the decision-maker, submitted in recordable form. So long as the final plat does not deviate from the product approved in the preliminary plat, the city's review of the final plat shall be conducted through a Type I process. If the final plat deviates significantly from the approved preliminary plat, the final plat review shall be processed in the same manner as was the preliminary plat. 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, 7-1-2009; Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010) 
16.08.015 - Preapplication conference required. 
    Before the city will accept a subdivision application, the applicant must schedule and attend a preapplication conference in accordance with Section 17.50.050. At a minimum, an applicant should bring to the preapplication conference a tax map of the subject tax lot(s) and surrounding tax lots, scale drawings of the proposed subdivision lotting pattern, streets, utilities and important site features and improvements, and a topographic map of the property. 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, 7-1-2009; Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010) 
16.08.020 - Preliminary subdivision plat application. 
    Within six months of the preapplication conference, an applicant may apply for preliminary subdivision plat approval. The applicant's submittal must provide a complete description of existing conditions, the proposed subdivision and an explanation of how the application meets all applicable approval standards. The following sections describe the specific submittal requirements for a preliminary subdivision plat, which include plan drawings, a narrative statement and certain tabular information. Once the application is deemed to be complete, the community development director shall provide notice of the application and an invitation to comment for a minimum of fourteen days to surrounding property owners in accordance with Section 17.50.090(A). At the conclusion of the comment period, the community development director will evaluate the application, taking into consideration all relevant, timely filed comments, and render a written decision in accordance with Chapter 17.50. The community development director's decision may be appealed to the city commission with notification to the planning commission.

16.12.025 - Reserved. 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 13-1003, § 1, Exhibit 1, adopted July 17, 2013, repealed § 16.12.025 in its entirety. Former § 16.12.025 pertained to "Blocks-Length." See Prior Code Cross-Reference Table and Code Comparative Table and Disposition List for derivation. 
16.12.030 - Blocks-Width. 
    The width of blocks shall ordinarily be sufficient to allow for two tiers of lots with depths consistent with the type of land use proposed. 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, 7-1-2009) 
16.12.035 - Reserved. 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 13-1003, § 1, Exhibit 1, adopted July 17, 2013, repealed § 16.12.035 in its entirety. Former § 16.12.035 pertained to "Blocks-Pedestrian and bicycle access." See Prior Code Cross-Reference Table and Code Comparative Table and Disposition List for derivation. 
16.12.040 - Building sites. 
    The size, width, shape and orientation of building sites shall be appropriate for the primary use of the land division, and shall be consistent with the residential lot size provisions of the zoning ordinance with the following exceptions: 
A.  Where property is zoned and planned for commercial or industrial use, the community development director may approve other widths in order to carry out the city's comprehensive plan. Depth and width of properties reserved or laid out for commercial and industrial purposes shall be adequate to provide for the off-street service and parking facilities required by the type of use and development contemplated. 
B.  Minimum lot sizes contained in Title 17 are not affected by those provided herein. 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, 7-1-2009)

    All subdivision layouts shall achieve at least eighty percent of the maximum density of the base zone for the net developable area as defined in Chapter 17.04. 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, 7-1-2009) 
16.12.050 - Lot size reduction. 
    A subdivision in the R-10, R-8, R-6, R-5, or R-3.5 dwelling district may include lots that are twenty percent less than the required minimum lot area of the applicable zoning designation provided the lots within the entire subdivision on average meets the minimum site area requirement of the underlying zone. Any area within a powerline easement on a lot shall not count towards the lot area for that lot. 
    The average lot area is determined by first calculating the total site area devoted to dwelling units, subtracting the powerline easement areas, and dividing that figure by the proposed number of dwelling lots. 
    Accessory dwelling units are not included in this determination nor are tracts created for non-dwelling unit purposes such as open space, stormwater tracts, or access ways. 
    A lot that was created pursuant to this section may not be further divided unless the average lot size requirements are still met for the entire subdivision. 
    When a lot abuts a public alley, an area equal to the length of the alley frontage along the lot times the width of the alley right-of-way measured from the alley centerline may be added to the area of the abutting lot in order to satisfy the lot area requirement for the abutting lot. It may also be used in calculating the average lot area. 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, 7-1-2009; Ord. No. 18-1005, § 1(Exh. A), 5-2-2018) 
16.12.055 - Building site-Through lots. 
    Through lots and parcels shall be avoided except where they are essential to provide separation of residential development from major arterials or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography of existing development patterns. A reserve strip may be required. A planting screen restrictive covenant may be required to separate residential development from major arterial streets, adjacent nonresidential development, or other incompatible use, where practicable. Where practicable, alleys or shared driveways shall be used for access for lots that have frontage on a collector or minor arterial street, eliminating through lots. 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, 7-1-2009) 
16.12.060 - Building site-Lot and parcel side lines. 
    The lines of lots and parcels, as far as is practicable, shall run at right angles to the street upon which they face, except that on curved streets they shall be radial to the curve.

(Ord. No. 08-1014, 7-1-2009) 
16.12.070 - Building site-Setbacks and building location. 
    This standard ensures that lots are configured in a way that development can be oriented toward streets to provide a safe, convenient and aesthetically pleasing environment for pedestrians and bicyclists. The objective is for lots located on a neighborhood collector, collector or minor arterial street locate the front yard setback on and design the most architecturally significant elevation of the primary structure to face the neighborhood collector, collector or minor arterial street. 
A.  The front setback of all lots located on a neighborhood collector, collector or minor arterial shall be orientated toward the neighborhood collector, collector or minor arterial street. 
B.  The most architecturally significant elevation of the house shall face the neighborhood collector, collector or minor arterial street. 
C.  On corner lots located on the corner of two local streets, the main façade of the dwelling may be oriented towards either street. 
D.  All lots proposed with a driveway and lot orientation on a collector or minor arterial shall combine driveways into one joint access per two or more lots unless the city engineer determines that: 
1.  No driveway access may be allowed since the driveway(s) would cause a significant traffic safety hazard; or 
2.  Allowing a single driveway access per lot will not cause a significant traffic safety hazard. 
E.  The community development director may approve an alternative design, consistent with the intent of this section, where the applicant can show that existing development patterns preclude the ability to practically meet this standard. 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, 7-1-2009) 
16.12.075 - Building site-Division of lots. 
    Where a tract of land is to be divided into lots or parcels capable of redivision in accordance with this chapter, the community development director shall require an arrangement of lots, parcels and streets which facilitates future redivision.

16.16.010 - Purpose and general provisions. 
A.  Minor partitions shall be processed as a Type II decision by the community development director in the same manner as set forth in Section 16.04.020A and the applicable provisions in Chapters 16.16, 12.04, 16.12 and 17.50 of the Oregon City Municipal Code as well as any other applicable chapter. A minor partition is defined as a single division of land into two or three lots. Approval shall be granted only upon determination that all applicable requirements of this title and ORS Chapter 92 have been met. 
B.  If a parcel of land to be partitioned will create lots large enough to be divided again, the applicant shall provide a hypothetical non-binding plan or "shadow plat" depicting possible future development of the resulting lots. 
C.  Lot size limitations for partitions in residential zoning designations. A residentially zoned parcel of land or the aggregate of contiguous parcels under the same ownership containing sufficient net buildable area to be subdivided by the minimum lot size requirements of the underlying zone into four or more lots shall be subject to the Subdivision procedures and standards specified in Sections 16.08 and 16.12. The calculation of the net buildable area for the parcel or lot to be divided shall be determined by the community development director. This standard shall not apply to a multi-family zoning designation. 
D.  A parcel of land in existence at the time this ordinance was adopted may be partitioned once if solely for the purpose of segregating one separate smaller parcel for an existing or proposed single-family house. The original parcel shall be exempt from the lot size limitation for partitions found in subsection C. above. The parcel to be created for the single-family house shall not contain sufficient lot area to allow further partitioning under the standards of the applicable existing zone including the use of administrative variances.

Though not required, the use of native species and low water use vegetation is recommended, but in no case may materials identified on the Oregon City Nuisance Plant list be used. 
A.  Tree Requirement. This requirement may be met using one or any combination of the three options below (Tree Preservation, Tree Planting, or Tree Fund). Table 17.20.060(A) identifies the minimum number of inches of tree diameter per lot that shall be preserved, planted or paid into the Tree Fund. Adjustments from this section are prohibited. The applicant shall submit a residential yard landscaping plan for Options (1) and (2) demonstrating compliance with the requirements of this section. 
TABLE 17.20.060(A) - Tree Requirements 
Lot Size (square feet) Tree Diameter Inches Required to be Protected, Planted or Paid into Tree Fund 0-4,999 4" 5,000-7,999 6" 8,000-9,999 8" 10,000-14,999 10" 15,000 + 12"  
1.  Tree preservation. The size of existing trees to be preserved shall be measured as Diameter at Breast Height (DBH). 
a.  This standard shall be met using trees that are located on the lot and trees that are located within public and private right-of-way shall not be used to meet this standard. When this option is used, a tree preservation plan is required. 
b.  Trees to be preserved may be located anywhere on the lot, and shall be a minimum of two inches caliper DBH. 
c.  Large Native or Heritage Tree Incentive. If a tree is preserved that is selected from the list in Table 17.20.060(A)(2)(c), the diameter of the tree may be doubled when demonstrating compliance with the minimum tree requirements indicated in Table 17.20.060(A) above. For example, an Oregon White Oak with a two-inch caliper at DBH may count as a tree diameter of four inches. 
2.  Tree planting. All planted trees shall measure a minimum two-inch caliper at six inches above the root crown. When this option is used, a tree planting plan is required. 
a.  Trees planted pursuant to this section on R-6, R-8 and R-10 zoned lots shall include at least one tree in the front yard setback, unless it is demonstrated that it is not feasible due to site constraints. 
b.  Trees planted pursuant to this section on R-5 and R-3.5 zoned lots may be planted anywhere on the lot as space permits. 
c.  Large Native or Heritage Tree Incentive. If a tree is planted that is selected from the list in Table 17.20.060(A)(2)(c), the diameter of the tree may be doubled when demonstrating compliance with the minimum tree requirements indicated in Table 17.20.060(A) above. For example, an Oregon White Oak with a two-inch caliper at six inches above the root crown may count as a tree diameter of four inches. 
TABLE 17.20.060(A)(2)(c) - Large Native and Heritage Tree List 
Common Name Scientific Name Oregon White Oak Quercus garryana Pacific willow Salix lucida spp. lasiandra Western red cedar Thuja plicata Western hemlock Tsuga heterophylla Northern Red Oak Quercus rubra Bur Oak Quercus macrocarpa Bigleaf Maple Acer macrophyllum Grand Fir Abies grandis Douglas Fir Pseudotsuga menziesii American Elm hybrids (disease resistant) Ulmus spp. Western yew Taxus brevifolia  
3.  Tree Fund. This option may be used where site characteristics or construction preferences do not support the preservation or planting options identified above. The community development director may approve this option in-lieu-of or in addition to requirements 1. and/or 2. above. In this case, the community development director may approve the payment of cash-in-lieu into a dedicated fund for the remainder of trees that cannot be replanted in the manner described above. The large native or heritage tree incentive does not apply when using this option to calculate the number of required inches. 
a.  The cash-in-lieu payment per tree shall utilize the adopted fee schedule when calculating the total tree fund payment. 
b.  The amount to be paid to the tree fund shall be calculated by subtracting the total inches of trees preserved and planted per subsection 2. and 3. above from the minimum tree diameter inches required in Table 17.20.060(A), dividing the sum by two inches and multiplying the remainder by the adopted fee from the Oregon City fee schedule. For example: 
Lot Size a. Tree Requirement per Table 17.20.060(A) (inches) b. Trees Preserved (inches) c. Trees Planted (inches) d. To be mitigated (inches) a.-b.-c. Number of trees owed to tree fund. d./2" minimum caliper tree 10,000-14,999 10" 2" 4" 4" 2  
[B.]  Residential front yard landscaping requirements. The following minimum landscaping standards shall apply to residential uses in residential zones: 
1.  At a minimum, a three-gallon shrub or three-gallon accent plant shall be planted between the front property line and the front building line for every four linear feet of foundation. 
2.  On lots zoned R-5, R-6, R-8 and R-10, fifty percent of the area between the front lot line and the front building line shall be landscaped. 
3.  On lots zoned R-3.5, at least forty percent of the area between the front lot line and the front building line shall be landscaped. 
4.  At a minimum, the required landscaped area shall be planted with ground cover. Up to one-third of the required landscaped area may be for recreational use or for use by pedestrians, such as walkways, play areas or patios. 
5.  A landscaping plan is required.

(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009; Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010) 
Chapter 17.41 - TREE PROTECTION STANDARDS 

17.41.010 - Protection of trees-Intent. 
    The intent of this chapter is to ensure that new development is designed in a manner that preserves trees to the maximum extent practicable. As a requirement of any Type II land use application, the siting of structures, roadways and utility easements, shall provide for the protection of tree resources to the maximum extent practicable. This chapter applies to all subdivision, partition and site plan and design review applications. 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009; Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010) 
17.41.020 - Tree protection-Applicability. 
1.  Applications for development subject to Chapters 16.08 or 16.12 (Subdivision or Minor Partition) or Chapter 17.62 (Site Plan and Design Review) shall demonstrate compliance with these standards as part of the review proceedings for those developments. 
2.  For public capital improvement projects, the city engineer shall demonstrate compliance with these standards pursuant to a Type II process. 
3.  Tree canopy removal greater than twenty-five percent on sites greater than twenty-five percent slope, unless exempted under Section 17.41.040, shall be subject to these standards. 
4.  A heritage tree or grove which has been designated pursuant to the procedures of Chapter 12.08.050 shall be subject to the standards of this section. 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009; Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010) 
17.41.030 - Tree protection-Conflicting code provisions. 
    Except as otherwise specified in this section, where these standards conflict with adopted city development codes or policies, the provision which provides the greater protection for regulated trees or groves, as defined in Section 17.04, shall govern. 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009; Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010) 
17.41.040 - Same-Exemptions. 
    These regulations are not intended to regulate normal cutting, pruning and maintenance of trees on private property except where trees are located on lots that are undergoing development review or are otherwise protected within the Natural Resource Overlay District (NROD) of section 17.49. These standards are not intended to regulate farm and forest practices as those practices are defined under ORS 30.930. Farm or forest resources. An applicant for development may claim exemption from compliance with these standards if the development site containing the regulated grove or trees was a designated farm or forest use, tree farm, Christmas tree plantation, or other approved timber use within one year prior to development application. "Forest practices" and "forestlands" as used in this subsection shall have the meaning as set out in ORS 30.930. The community development director has the authority to modify or waive compliance in this case. 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009; Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010) 
17.41.050 - Same-Compliance options. 
    Applicants for review shall comply with these requirements through one or a combination of the following procedures: 
A.  Option 1-Mitigation. Retention and removal of trees, with subsequent mitigation by replanting pursuant to Sections 17.41.060 or 17.41.070. All replanted and saved trees shall be protected by a permanent restrictive covenant or easement approved in form by the city. 
B.  Option 2-Dedicated Tract. Protection of trees or groves by placement in a tract within a new subdivision or partition plat pursuant to Sections 17.41.080-17.41.100; or 
C.  Option 3-Restrictive Covenant. Protection of trees or groves by recordation of a permanent restrictive covenant pursuant to Sections 17.41.110-17.41.120; or 
D.  Option 4-Cash-in-lieu of planting pursuant to Section 17.41.130. 
    A regulated tree that has been designated for protection pursuant to this section must be retained or permanently protected unless it has been determined by a certified arborist to be diseased or hazardous, pursuant to the following applicable provisions. 
The community development director, pursuant to a Type II procedure, may allow a property owner to cut a specific number of trees within a regulated grove if preserving those trees would: 
1.  Preclude achieving eighty percent of minimum density with reduction of lot size; or 
2.  Preclude meeting minimum connectivity requirements for subdivisions. 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009; Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010) 
17.41.060 - Tree removal and replanting-Mitigation (Option 1). 
A.  Applicants for development who select this option shall ensure that all healthy trees shall be preserved outside the construction area as defined in Chapter 17.04 to the extent practicable. Compliance with these standards shall be demonstrated in a tree mitigation plan report prepared by a certified arborist, horticulturalist or forester or other environmental professional with experience and academic credentials in forestry or arborculture. At the applicant's expense, the city may require the report to be reviewed by a consulting arborist. The number of replacement trees required on a development site shall be calculated separately from, and in addition to, any public or street trees in the public right-of-way required under section 12.08-Community Forest and Street Trees. 
B.  The applicant shall determine the number of trees to be mitigated on the site by counting all of the trees six inch DBH (minimum four and one-half feet from the ground) or larger on the entire site and either: 
1.  Trees that are removed outside of the construction area, shall be replanted with the number of trees specified in Column 1 of Table 17.41.060-1. Trees that are removed within the construction area shall be replanted with the number of replacement trees required in Column 2; or 
2.  Diseased or hazardous trees, when the condition is verified by a certified arborist to be consistent with the definition in Section 17.04.1360, may be removed from the tree replacement calculation. Regulated healthy trees that are removed outside of the construction area, shall be replanted with the number of trees specified in Column 1 of Table 17.41.060-1. Regulated healthy trees that are removed within the construction area shall be replanted with the number of replacement trees required in Column 2. 
Table 17.41.060-1 
Tree Replacement Requirements 
All replacement trees shall be either: 
Two-inch caliper deciduous, or 
Six-foot high conifer

Steps for calculating the number of replacement trees: 
1.  Count all trees measuring six inches DBH (minimum four and one-half feet from the ground) or larger on the entire development site. 
2.  Designate (in certified arborists report) the condition and size (DBH) of all trees pursuant to accepted industry standards. 
3.  Document any trees that are currently diseased or hazardous. 
4.  Subtract the number of diseased or hazardous trees in step 3. from the total number of trees on the development site in step 1. The remaining number is the number of healthy trees on the site. Use this number to determine the number of replacement trees in steps 5. through 8. 
5.  Define the construction area (as defined in Chapter 17.04). 
6.  Determine the number and diameter of trees to be removed within the construction area. Based on the size of each tree, use Column 2 to determine the number of replacement trees required. 
7.  Determine the number and diameter of trees to be removed outside of the construction area. Based on the size of each tree, use Column 1 to determine the number of replacement trees required. 
8.  Determine the total number of replacement trees from steps 6. and 7. 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009; Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010) 
17.41.070 - Planting area priority for mitigation (Option 1). 
    Development applications which opt for removal of trees with subsequent replanting pursuant to section 17.41.050A. shall be required to mitigate for tree cutting by complying with the following priority for replanting standards below: 
A.  First Priority. Replanting on the development site. 
B.  Second Priority. Off-site replacement tree planting locations. If the community development director determines that it is not practicable to plant the total number of replacement trees on-site, a suitable off-site planting location for the remainder of the trees may be approved that will reasonably satisfy the objectives of this section. Such locations may include either publicly owned or private land and must be approved by the community development director. 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009; Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010) 
17.41.075 - Alternative mitigation plan. 
    The community development director may, subject to a Type II procedure, approve an alternative mitigation plan that adequately protects habitat pursuant to the standards for the natural resource overlay district alternative mitigation plan, Section 17.49.190. 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009) 
17.41.080 - Tree preservation within subdivisions and partitions-Dedicated tract (Option 2). 
A.  Applicants for new subdivision and partition plats may delineate and show the regulated trees or groves as either a separate tract or part of a larger tract that meets the requirements of subsection D. of this section. 
B.  The standards for land divisions subject to this section shall apply in addition to the requirements of the city land division ordinance and zoning ordinance, provided that the minimum lot area, minimum average lot width, and minimum average lot depth standards of the base zone may be superseded in order to allow for a reduction of dimensional standards pursuant to Section 17.41100 below. 
C.  Prior to preliminary plat approval, the regulated tree or grove area shall be shown either as a separate tract or part of a larger tract that meets the requirements of subsection D. of this section, which shall not be a part of any parcel used for construction of a structure. The size of the tract shall be the minimum necessary as recommended by a consulting arborist to adequately encompass the dripline of the tree, protect the critical root zone and ensure long term survival of the tree or grove. 
D.  Prior to final plat approval, ownership of the regulated tree or grove tract shall be identified to distinguish it from lots intended for sale. The tract may be identified as any one of the following: 
1.  Private open space held by the owner or a homeowners association; or 
2.  For residential land divisions, private open space subject to an easement conveying stormwater and surface water management rights to the city and preventing the owner of the tract from activities and uses inconsistent with the purpose of this document; or 
3.  At the owners option, public open space where the tract has been dedicated to the city or other governmental unit; or 
4.  Any other ownership proposed by the owner and approved by the community development director. (Ord. 99-1013 §10(part), 1999). 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009; Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010) 
17.41.090 - Density transfers incentive for tree protection tracts (Option 2). 
A.  The purpose of this section is to allow dimensional adjustments within a regulated tree protection tract to be transferred outside said tract to the remainder of the site. This provision applies on-site and density shall not be transferred beyond the boundaries of the development site. 
B.  Development applications for subdivisions and minor partitions that request a density transfer shall: 
1.  Provide a map showing the net buildable area of the tree protection tract; 
2.  Provide calculations justifying the requested dimensional adjustments; 
3.  Demonstrate that the minimum lot size requirements can be met based on an average of all lots created, including the tree protection tract created pursuant to Section 17.41.080; 
4.  Demonstrate that, with the exception of the tree protection tract created pursuant to Section 17.41.080, no parcels have been created which would be unbuildable in terms of minimum yard setbacks; 
5.  Meet all other standards of the base zone except as modified in section 17.41.100. 
C.  The area of land contained in a tree protection tract may be excluded from the calculations for determining compliance with minimum density requirements of the zoning code. 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009; Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010) 
17.41.100 - Permitted modifications to dimensional standards (Option 2 only). 
A.  An applicant proposing to protect trees in a dedicated tract pursuant to section 17.41.080 may request, and the community development director, pursuant to a Type II procedure, may grant a reduction to, the lot size, width, depth, and setbacks of the underlying zone district in approving a subdivision or partition if necessary to retain a regulated tree or grove in a tract, as long as the calculation of average lot size, including tree protection tracts, meet the minimum lot size for the zone. The applicant may choose to make the adjustments over as many lots as required. For example, the lot reduction could be spread across all the remaining lots in the proposed subdivision or partition or could be applied to only those needed to incorporate the area of the tree tract.

No permit for any grading or construction of public or private improvements may be released prior to verification by the community development director that regulated trees designated for protection or conservation have been protected according to the following standards. No trees designated for removal shall be removed without prior written approval from the community development director. 
B.  Tree protection shall be as recommended by a qualified arborist or, as a minimum, to include the following protective measures: 
1.  Except as otherwise determined by the community development director, all required tree protection measures set forth in this section shall be instituted prior to any development activities, including, but not limited to clearing, grading, excavation or demolition work, and such measures shall be removed only after completion of all construction activity, including necessary landscaping and irrigation installation, and any required plat, tract, conservation easement or restrictive covenant has been recorded. 
2.  Approved construction fencing, a minimum of four feet tall with steel posts placed no farther than ten feet apart, shall be installed at the edge of the tree protection zone or dripline, whichever is greater. An alternative may be used with the approval of the community development director. 
3.  Approved signs shall be attached to the fencing stating that inside the fencing is a tree protection zone, not to be disturbed unless prior approval has been obtained from the community development director. 
4.  No construction activity shall occur within the tree protection zone, including, but not limited to; dumping or storage of materials such as building supplies, soil, waste items; nor passage or parking of vehicles or equipment. 
5.  The tree protection zone shall remain free of chemically injurious materials and liquids such as paints, thinners, cleaning solutions, petroleum products, and concrete or dry wall excess, construction debris, or run-off. 
6.  No excavation, trenching, grading, root pruning or other activity shall occur within the tree protection zone unless directed by an arborist present on site and approved by the community development director. 
7.  No machinery repair or cleaning shall be performed within ten feet of the dripline of any trees identified for protection. 
8.  Digging a trench for placement of public or private utilities or other structure within the critical root zone of a tree to be protected is prohibited. Boring under or through the tree protection zone may be permitted if approved by the community development director and pursuant to the approved written recommendations and on-site guidance and supervision of a certified arborist. 
9.  The city may require that a certified arborist be present during any construction or grading activities that may affect the dripline of trees to be protected. 
10.  The community development director may impose conditions to avoid disturbance to tree roots from grading activities and to protect trees and other significant vegetation identified for retention from harm. Such conditions may include, if necessary, the advisory expertise of a qualified consulting arborist or horticulturist both during and after site preparation, and a special maintenance/management program to provide protection to the resource as recommended by the arborist or horticulturist. 
C.  Changes in soil hydrology due to soil compaction and site drainage within tree protection areas shall be avoided. Drainage and grading plans shall include provision to ensure that drainage of the site does not conflict with the standards of this section. Excessive site run-off shall be directed to appropriate storm drainage facilities and away from trees designated for conservation or protection.

Chapter 17.42 - FLOOD MANAGEMENT OVERLAY DISTRICT[20] 

Footnotes: 
--- (20) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 08-1014, adopted July 1, 2009, repealed Chapter 17.42 in its entirety and enacted new provisions to read as herein set out. Prior to amendment, Chapter 17.42 pertained to similar subject matter. See Ordinance Disposition List for derivation. 

17.42.010 - Purpose-Findings. 
A.  There is established in the city a flood management overlay district. The flood management overlay district is an overlay zone classification defining areas subject to periodic flooding or inundation which can result in property harm or loss, disruption of public services, hazards for public health, or added expense for public services. All conditions and restrictions of land use established by this chapter of the city's zoning ordinance shall be in addition to such restrictions and conditions as may be imposed and established in underlying zoning districts. 
B.  It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed: 
1.  To protect human life and health; 
To minimize expenditure of public money and costly flood control projects; 
To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
2.  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
3.  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard; 
4.  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas; 
5.  To ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; 
6.  To ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions; and 
7.  To protect flood management areas, which provide the following functions: 
a.  Protect life and property from dangers associated with flooding; 
b.  Flood storage, reduction of flood velocities, reduction of flood peak; 
c.  Flows and reduction of wind and wave impacts; 
d.  Maintain water quality by reducing and sorting sediment loads; 
e.  Processing chemical and organic wastes and reducing nutrients, recharge, store and discharge groundwater; and 
f.  Provide plant and animal habitat, and support riparian ecosystems. 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009; Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010) 
17.42.020 - Applicability. 
A.  This chapter shall apply to development in the flood management overlay district, which may also be referred to as the "floodplain overlay district" in this code. The flood management overlay district includes all areas of special flood hazards and all flood management areas within the city. The overlay district restricts the uses that are allowed in the base zone by right, with limitations, or as provisional uses. 
B.  The flood management areas which have been mapped include the following locations: 
1.  Land contained within the one hundred-year floodplain, flood area and floodway as shown on the Federal Emergency Management Agency flood insurance maps dated June 17, 2008, including areas of special flood hazard pursuant to Section 17.42.040 and the area of inundation for the February 1996 flood; and 
2.  Lands that have physical or documented evidence of flooding within recorded history based on aerial photographs of the 1996 flooding and/or the water quality and flood management areas maps. 
C.  The standards that apply to the flood management areas apply in addition to state or federal restrictions governing floodplains or flood management areas. 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009; Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010) 
17.42.030 - Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard. 
    The areas or special flood hazard identified by the Federal Insurance Administration in a scientific and engineering report entitled "The Flood Insurance Study for Clackamas County, Oregon and Incorporated Areas," dated June 17, 2008, with accompanying flood insurance maps is adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. The flood insurance study is on file at the office of the city recorder in the City Hall. 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009; Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010) 
17.42.040 - Compliance. 
    No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted or altered without full compliance with the terms of these floodplain regulations and other applicable regulations. Violations of the provisions of this chapter by failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall constitute a civil infraction. Any person who violates this chapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall be subject to the enforcement procedures of this code per OCMC 1.20 Civil Infractions and 1.24 Code Enforcement. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the city from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy.

17.42.050 - Abrogation and interpretation. 
    This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants or deed restrictions. All provisions shall be considered as minimum requirements and liberally construed in favor of the governing body. Where this chapter and another section, easement, covenant or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restriction shall prevail. 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009; Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010) 
17.42.060 - Warning and disclaimer of liability. 
    The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flooding damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the city, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Insurance Administration for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009; Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010) 
17.42.070 - Severability. 
    The provisions of this chapter are severable. If any section, clause or phrase of this chapter is adjudged to be invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the decision of that court shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009; Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010)

A.  Where base flood elevation data is provided through the flood insurance study, FIRM or required as in Section 17.42.100, obtain and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new or substantially improved structures, and whether or not the structure contains a basement. 
B.  For all new or substantially improved floodproofed structures where base flood elevation data is provided through the flood insurance study, FIRM, or as required in Section 17.42.080: 
1.  Verify and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level); and 
2.  Maintain the floodproofing certifications required in Section 17.42.080C.3.; 
3.  Maintain for public inspection all records pertinent to the provisions of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009; Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010) 
17.42.120 - Alteration of watercourses. 
A.  Notify adjacent communities and the department of land conservation and development prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Insurance Administration. 
B.  Require that maintenance is provided within the altered or relocated portion of the watercourse so that the flood-carrying capacity is not diminished. 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009; Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010)

C.  Map corrections shall be processed pursuant to the requirements of Chapter 17.68: 
1.  Within ninety days of receiving information establishing a possible error in the existence or location of the flood management overlay district, the city shall provide notice to interested parties of a public hearing at which the city will review the information. 
2.  The city shall amend the water quality and flood management areas map if the information demonstrates that the boundaries of the flood management overlay district have changed since adoption of the water quality and flood management areas map by Metro (June 18, 1998) provided that, in the case of a boundary established by FEMA, a letter of map amendment (LOMA) or letter of map revision is obtained from FEMA by the applicant prior to any map change. 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009; Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010) 
17.42.140 - Appeals and variance procedure. 
A.  The purpose of this section is to ensure that compliance with this chapter does not cause unreasonable hardship. To avoid such instances, the requirements of this chapter may be varied. Variances are also allowed when strict application of this chapter would deprive an owner of all economically viable use of land. 
B.  This section applies to requests to vary from the standards of this chapter only. Requests to vary from other standards of this title shall be subject to the requirements of Chapter 17.60. 
1.  Variance applications made pursuant to this section shall follow the variance procedures outlined in Chapter 17.50. 
2.  In addition to the public notice requirements outlined in Section 17.50.090, Metro shall be notified within fourteen days of the city receiving an application to vary the requirements of this section and within fourteen days of a decision on the variance. 
3.  The requirements of Section 17.60.020 (Variances-Grounds) do not apply to requests to vary from the standards of Chapter 17.42. 
4.  If an application to vary from the standards of Chapter 17.42 is made in conjunction with an application to vary from other standards of this chapter, the variances may be processed as one application, provided the standards applicable to each variance requested must be met before the requested variance may be granted. 
C.  Hardship Variance. Variances to avoid unreasonable hardship caused by the strict application of this chapter are permitted subject to the criteria set forth in this section. To vary from the requirements of this chapter, the applicant must demonstrate the following: 
1.  The variance is the minimum necessary to allow the proposed use or activity; 
2.  The variance will not increase danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion; 
3.  The impact of the increase in flood hazard which will result from the variance will not prevent the city from meeting the requirements of this chapter. In support of this criteria the applicant shall have a qualified professional engineer document the expected height, velocity and duration of floodwaters, and estimate the rate of increase in sediment transport of the floodwaters expected both downstream and upstream as a result of the variance; 
4.  The variance will not increase the cost of providing and maintaining public services during and after flood conditions so as to unduly burden public agencies and taxpayers; and 
5.  The proposed use complies with the standards of the base zone. 
D.  The planning commission shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision or determination made by the building official in the enforcement or administration of these regulations, or that enforcement of this district would result in exceptional hardship. In passing upon such applications, the planning commission shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this title, and: 
1.  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
2.  The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
3.  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner; 
4.  The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
5.  The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 
6.  The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use, which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage; 
7.  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
8.  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
9.  The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
10.  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and 
11.  The cost of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and bridges. 
E.  Upon consideration of the factors listed in subsection D of this section and the purposes of this district, the planning commission may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to meet the purposes of this district. 
F.  The city recorder shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and the building official shall report any granted variances to the Federal Insurance Administration upon request. 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009; Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010) 
17.42.150 - Conditions for variances. 
    The planning commission, pursuant to Chapter 17.60, may impose such conditions as are deemed necessary to limit any adverse impacts that may result from granting relief. If a variance is granted pursuant to Section 17.42.140, the variance shall be subject to the conditions set out in this section. In addition to other standards listed in Section 17.42.160, the following conditions must be met: 
A.  Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register or identified as a locally designated historic structure and without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this chapter. 
B.  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
C.  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
D.  Variances shall only be issued upon a showing of good and sufficient cause. 
E.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant. 
F.  Variances as interpreted in the national flood insurance program are based on the general zoning law principle that they pertain to a physical piece or property; they are not personal in nature and do not pertain to the structure, its inhabitants, economic or financial circumstances. They primarily address small lots in densely populated residential neighborhoods. As such, variances from the flood elevations should be quite rare. 
G.  Variances may be issued for nonresidential buildings in very limited circumstances to allow a lesser degree of floodproofing than watertight or dry-floodproofing, where it can be determined that such action will have low damage potential, complies with all other variance criteria as set forth in this chapter. 
H.  A variance from the elevation standard may only be issued for new construction, and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size, that are to contiguous and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level. As the lot size increases the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
I.  Variances shall not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expenses, cause nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing laws or ordinances. 
J.  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest flood elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009; Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010) 
17.42.160 - Flood management area standards. 
A.  Uses Permitted Outright: 
1.  Excavation and fill required to plant any new trees or vegetation. 
2.  Restoration or enhancement of floodplains, riparian areas, wetland, upland and streams that meet federal and state standards provided that any restoration project which encroaches on the floodway complies with the requirements of Section 17.42.190 (Floodways). 
B.  Provisional Uses. 
1.  All uses allowed in the base zone or existing flood hazard overlay zone are allowed in the flood management overlay district subject to compliance with the development standards of this section. 
C.  Prohibited Uses. 
1.  Any use prohibited in the base zone; 
2.  Uncontained areas of hazardous materials as defined by the Department of Environmental Quality. 
D.  Site Development Standards. All development in the floodplain shall conform to the following balanced cut and fill standards: 
1.  This subsection does not apply to work necessary to protect, repair, maintain or replace existing structures, utility facilities, roadways, driveways, accessory uses and exterior improvements in response to emergencies provided that, after the emergency has passed, adverse impacts are mitigated in accordance with applicable standards. 
2.  No net fill in any floodplain is allowed. All fill placed in a floodplain shall be balanced with at least an equal amount of soil material removed. For the purpose of calculating net fill, fill shall include any structure below the design flood elevation that has been floodproofed pursuant to subsection (E)(5) of this section. 
3.  Any excavation below bankfull stage shall not count toward compensating for fill. 
4.  Excavation to balance a fill shall be located on the same parcel as the fill unless it is not practicable to do so. In such cases, the excavation shall be located in the same Oregon City floodplain, so long as the proposed excavation and fill will not increase flood impacts for surrounding properties as determined through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis. 
5.  For excavated areas identified by the city to remain dry in the summer, such as parks or mowed areas, the lowest elevation of the excavated area shall be at least six inches above the winter "low water" elevation, and sloped at a minimum of two percent towards the protected water feature pursuant to Chapter 17.49. One percent slopes will be allowed in smaller areas. 
6.  For excavated areas identified by the city to remain wet in the summer, such as a constructed wetland, the grade shall be designed not to drain into the protected water feature pursuant to Chapter 17.49. 
7.  Parking areas in the floodplain shall be accompanied by signs that inform the public that the parking area is located in a flood management area and that care should be taken when the potential for flooding exists. 
8.  Temporary fills permitted during construction shall be removed at the end of construction, thirty days after subdivision acceptance or completion of the final inspection. 
9.  New culverts, stream crossings and transportation projects shall be designed as balanced cut and fill projects or designed not to significantly raise the design flood elevation. Such projects shall be designed to minimize the area of fill in flood management areas and to minimize erosive velocities. Stream crossings shall be as close to perpendicular to the stream as practicable. Bridges shall be used instead of culverts wherever practicable. 
10.  Excavation and fill required for the construction of detention facilities or structures, and other facilities, such as levees, specifically shall be designed to reduce or mitigate flood impacts and improve water quality. Levees shall not be used to create vacant buildable lands. 
E.  Construction Standards. 
1.  Anchoring. 
a.  All new construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure. 
b.  All manufactured homes must likewise be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movements and shall be installed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage. Anchoring methods may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors (reference FEMA's "Manufactured Home Installation in Flood Hazard Areas" guidebooks for additional techniques). 
2.  Construction Materials and Methods. 
a.  All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage. 
b.  All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage. 
c.  Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities shall be designed and/or otherwise elevated or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. 
3.  Utilities. 
a.  All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system. 
b.  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharge from the systems into floodwaters. 
c.  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding. 
4.  Residential Construction. 
a.  New construction and substantial improvements of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to at least one foot above the design flood elevation. 
b.  Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to flooding are prohibited unless they are designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or must meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: 
i.  A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided. 
ii.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. 
iii.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. 
5.  Nonresidential Construction. 
a.  New construction and substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to at least one foot above base flood elevation; or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, shall: 
i.  Be floodproofed so that below the design flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water provided that the requirements of subsection D.2. of this section are met; 
ii.  Have structured components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy; 
iii.  Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting provisions of this subsection based on their development and/or review of the structural design, specifications and plans. Such certifications shall be provided to the official as set forth in Section 17.42.110B.; 
iv.  Nonresidential structures that are elevated, not floodproofed, must meet the same standards for space below the lowest floor as described in subsection E.4.b. of this section; and 
v.  Applicants floodproofing nonresidential buildings shall be notified that flood insurance premiums will be based on rates that are one foot below the floodproofed level (e.g., a building constructed to the design flood level will be rated as one foot below that level). 
vi.  Manufactured Homes. The following standards apply to all manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved on sites within Flood Hazard Areas. 
When manufactured dwellings are installed in flood hazard areas, they shall be elevated and anchored according to the Oregon Residential Specialty Code. 
F.  Recreational Vehicles. Recreational vehicles placed on sites within Zones A1-30, AH and AE as shown on the flood insurance rate map shall: 
1.  Be on site for fewer than one hundred eighty consecutive days, and be fully licensed and ready for highway use, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and have no permanently attached additions; or 
2.  Meet the requirements of subsection E.6. of this section and the elevation and anchoring requirements for manufactured homes. 
G.  Below Grade Crawlspaces. Below grade crawlspaces are allowed subject to the following standards. It should be noted that there are potential increased charges to personal insurance costs for below grade crawlspaces. 
1.  The building shall be designed and adequately anchored to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy. Hydrostatic loads and effects of buoyancy can usually be addressed through the required openings stated in subsection 2. below. Because of hydrodynamic loads, crawlspace construction is not allowed in areas with flood velocities greater than five feet per second unless the design is reviewed by a qualified design professional, such as a registered architect or professional engineer. Other types of foundations are recommended for these areas. 
2.  The crawlspace is an enclosed area below the base flood elevation (BFE) and, as such, must have openings that equalize hydrostatic pressures by allowing the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. The bottom of each flood vent opening can be no more than one foot above the lowest adjacent exterior grade. 
3.  Portions of the building below the BFE must be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage. This includes not only the foundation walls of the crawlspace used to elevate the building, but also any joists, insulation, or other materials that extend below the BFE. The recommended construction practice is to elevate the bottom of joists and all insulation above BFE. 
4.  Any building utility systems within the crawlspace must be elevated above BFE or designed so that floodways cannot enter or accumulate within the system components during flood conditions. Ductwork, in particular, must either be placed above the BFE or sealed from floodwaters. 
5.  The interior grade of a crawlspace below the BFE must not be more than two feet below the lowest adjacent exterior grade. 
6.  The height of the below-grade crawlspace, measured from the interior grade of the crawlspace to the top of the crawlspace foundation wall must not exceed four feet at any point. The height limitations is the maximum allowable unsupported wall height according to the engineering analyses and building code requirements for flood hazard areas. 
7.  There must be an adequate drainage system that removes floodwaters from the interior area of the crawlspace. The enclosed area should be drained within a reasonable time after a flood event. The type of drainage system will vary because of the site gradient and other drainage characteristics, such as soil types. Possible options include natural drainage through porous, well-drained soils and drainage systems such as perforated pipes, drainage tiles or gravel or crushed stone drainage by gravity or mechanical means. 
8.  The velocity of floodwaters at the site should not exceed five feet per second for any crawlspace. For areas with floodwater velocities in excess of five feet per second, below grade crawlspaces are prohibited. 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009; Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010) 
17.42.170 - Review of building permits. 
    Where elevation data is not available either through the flood insurance study, FIRM or from another authoritative source (Section 17.42.110), application for building permits shall be reviewed to assure that proposed construction will be reasonably safe from flooding. The test of reasonableness shall be made by the building official, considering use of historical data, high water marks, photographs of past floodings, etc., where available, and the provisions of this title. Failure to elevate at least two feet above grade in these zones may result in higher insurance rates. 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009; Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010) 
17.42.180 - Subdivision standards. 
A.  Subdivision Proposals. 
1.  All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage. 
2.  All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage. 
3.  All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood damage. 
4.  Where base flood elevation data has not been provided or is not available from another authoritative source, it shall be generated for subdivision proposals and other proposed developments which contain at least fifty lots or five acres (whichever is less). 
5.  All structures and site grading developed or conducted in conjunction with a subdivision proposal shall comply with Section 17.42.160, flood management area standards. 
B.  The purpose of this section is to allow density accruing to portions of a property within the flood management overlay district to be transferred outside the overlay district. 
1.  Density transfers shall be allowed if the applicant demonstrates compliance with the following standards: 
a.  The density transfer is proposed as part of a subdivision. 
b.  Minimum density standards will not increase due to the density transfers. 
c.  The area of land contained in a flood management area may be excluded from the calculations for determining compliance with minimum density requirements of the zoning code. 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009; Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010) 
17.42.190 - Floodways. 
    Located within areas of special flood hazard established in Section 17.42.030 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions apply: 
A.  Encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development shall be prohibited unless certification by a registered professional engineer or architect is provided demonstrating through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
B.  If subsection A of this section is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood management area standards of Sections 17.42.160 through 17.42.190. 
C.  Below-grade crawlspace construction is allowed in the floodplain in accordance with the Oregon Residential Specialty Code and the Oregon State Structural Specialty Code as adopted by local building code. 
D.  In areas where a regulatory floodway has not been designated, no new construction, substantial improvements, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within Zones A1-30 and AE on the community's FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community.

(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009; Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010) 
17.44.060 - Development standards. 
    Notwithstanding any contrary dimensional or density requirements of the underlying zone, the following standards shall apply to the review of any development proposal subject to this chapter. Requirements of this chapter are in addition to other provision of the Oregon City Municipal Code. Where provision of this chapter conflict with other provision of the Oregon City Municipal Code, the provisions that are more restrictive of regulated development activity shall govern. 
A.  All developments shall be designed to avoid unnecessary disturbance of natural topography, vegetation and soils. To the maximum extent practicable as determined by the review authority, tree and ground cover removal and fill and grading for residential development on individual lots shall be confined to building footprints and driveways, to areas required for utility easements and for slope easements for road construction, and to areas of geotechnical remediation. 
B.  All grading, drainage improvements, or other land disturbances shall only occur from May 1 to October 31. Erosion control measures shall be installed and functional prior to any disturbances. The city engineer may allow grading, drainage improvements or other land disturbances to begin before May 1 (but no earlier than March 16) and end after October 31 (but no later than November 30), based upon weather conditions and in consultation with the project geotechnical engineer. The modification of dates shall be the minimum necessary, based upon the evidence provided by the applicant, to accomplish the necessary project goals. Temporary protective fencing shall be established around all trees and vegetation designed for protection prior to the commencement of grading or other soil disturbance. 
C.  Designs shall minimize the number and size of cuts and fills. 
D.  Cut and fill slopes, such as those for a street, driveway accesses, or yard area, greater than seven feet in height (as measured vertically) shall be terraced. Faces on a terraced section shall not exceed five feet. Terrace widths shall be a minimum of three feet and shall be vegetated. Total cut and fill slopes shall not exceed a vertical height of fifteen feet. Except in connection with geotechnical remediation plans approved in accordance with the chapter, cuts shall not remove the toe of any slope that contains a known landslide or is greater than twenty-five percent slope. The top of cut or fill slopes not utilizing structural retaining walls shall be located a minimum of one-half the height of the cut slope from the nearest property line. 
E.  Any structural fill shall be designed by a suitably qualified and experienced civil or geotechnical engineer licensed in Oregon in accordance with standard engineering practice. The applicant's engineer shall certify that the fill has been constructed as designed in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. 
F.  Retaining walls shall be constructed in accordance with the Oregon Structural Specialty Code adopted by the State of Oregon. 
G.  Roads shall be the minimum width necessary to provide safe vehicle and emergency access, minimize cut and fill and provide positive drainage control. The review authority may grant a variance from the city's required road standards upon findings that the variance would provide safe vehicle and emergency access and is necessary to comply with the purpose and policy of this chapter. 
H.  Density shall be determined as follows: 
1.  For those areas with slopes less than twenty-five percent between grade breaks, the allowed density shall be that permitted by the underlying zoning district; 
2.  For those areas with slopes of twenty-five to thirty-five percent between grade breaks, the density shall not exceed two dwelling units per acre except as otherwise provided in subsection I of this section; 
3.  For those areas with slopes over thirty-five percent between grade breaks, development shall be prohibited except as otherwise provided in subsection I.4. of this section. 
I.  For properties with slopes of twenty-five to thirty-five percent between grade breaks: 
1.  For those portions of the property with slopes of twenty-five to thirty-five percent, the maximum residential density shall be limited to two dwelling units per acre; provided, however, that where the entire site is less than one-half acre in size, a single dwelling shall be allowed on a lot or parcel existing as of January 1, 1994 and meeting the minimum lot size requirements of the underlying zone; 
2.  An individual lot or parcel with slopes between twenty-five and thirty-five percent shall have no more than fifty percent or four thousand square feet of the surface area, whichever is smaller, graded or stripped of vegetation or covered with structures or impermeable surfaces. 
3.  No cut into a slope of twenty-five to thirty-five percent for the placement of a housing unit shall exceed a maximum vertical height of fifteen feet for the individual lot or parcel. 
4.  For those portions of the property with slopes over thirty-five percent between grade breaks: 
a.  Notwithstanding any other city land use regulation, development other than roads, utilities, public facilities and geotechnical remediation shall be prohibited; provided, however, that the review authority may allow development upon such portions of land upon demonstration by an applicant that failure to permit development would deprive the property owner of all economically beneficial use of the property. This determination shall be made considering the entire parcel in question and contiguous parcels in common ownership on or after January 1, 1994, not just the portion where development is otherwise prohibited by this chapter. Where this showing can be made on residentially zoned land, development shall be allowed and limited to one single-family residence. Any development approved under this chapter shall be subject to compliance with all other applicable city requirements as well as any applicable state, federal or other requirements; 
b.  To the maximum extent practicable as determined by the review authority, the applicant shall avoid locating roads, utilities, and public facilities on or across slopes exceeding thirty-five percent. 
J.  The geotechnical engineer of record shall review final grading, drainage, and foundation plans and specifications and confirm in writing that they are in conformance with the recommendations provided in their report. 
K.  At the city's discretion, peer review shall be required for the geotechnical evaluation/investigation report submitted for the development and/or lot plans. The peer reviewer shall be selected by the city. The applicant's geotechnical engineer shall respond to written comments provided by the city's peer reviewer prior to issuance of building permit. 
L.  The review authority shall determine whether the proposed methods of rendering a known or potential hazard site safe for construction, including proposed geotechnical remediation methods, are feasible and adequate to prevent landslides or damage to property and safety. The review authority shall consult with the city's geotechnical engineer in making this determination. Costs for such consultation shall be paid by the applicant. The review authority may allow development in a known or potential hazard area as provided in this chapter if specific findings are made that the specific provisions in the design of the proposed development will prevent landslides or damage. The review authority may impose any conditions, including limits on type or intensity of land use, which it determines are necessary to assure that landslides or property damage will not occur.

17.44.070 - Access to property. 
A.  Shared private driveways may be required if the city engineer or principal planner determines that their use will result in safer location of the driveway and lesser amounts of land coverage than would result if separate private driveways are used. 
B.  Innovations in driveway design and road construction shall be permitted in order to keep grading and cuts or fills to a minimum and to achieve the purpose and policy of this chapter. 
C.  Points of access to arterials and collectors shall be minimized. 
D.  The city engineer or principal planner shall verify that adequate emergency services can be provided to the site.

17.44.090 - Stormwater drainage. 
    The applicant shall submit a permanent and complete stormwater control plan. The program shall include, but not be limited to the following items as appropriate: curbs, gutters, inlets, catch basins, detention facilities and stabilized outfalls. Detention facilities shall be designed to city standards as set out in the city's drainage master plan and design standards. The review authority may impose conditions to ensure that waters are drained from the development so as to limit degradation of water quality consistent with Oregon City's Title III section of the Oregon City Municipal Code Chapter 17.49 and the Oregon City Public Works Stormwater Management Design Manual and Standards Plan or other adopted standards subsequently adopted by the city commission. Drainage design shall be approved by the city engineer before construction, including grading or other soil disturbance, has begun. 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009; Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010) 
17.44.100 - Construction standards. 
    During construction on land subject to this chapter, the following standards shall be implemented by the developer: 
A.  All development activity shall minimize vegetation removal and soil disturbance and shall provide positive erosion prevention measures in conformance with OCMC Chapter 17.47-Erosion and Sediment Control. 
B.  No grading, clearing or excavation of any land shall be initiated prior to approval of the grading plan, except that the city engineer shall authorize the site access, brush to be cleared and the location of the test pit digging prior to approval of such plan to the extent needed to complete preliminary and final engineering and surveying. The grading plan shall be approved by the city engineer as part of the city's review under this chapter. The developer shall be responsible for the proper execution of the approved grading plan. 
C.  Measures shall be taken to protect against landslides, mudflows, soil slump and erosion. Such measures shall include sediment fences, straw bales, erosion blankets, temporary sedimentation ponds, interceptor dikes and swales, undisturbed buffers, grooving and stair stepping, check dams, etc. The applicant shall comply with the measures described in the Oregon City Public Works Standards for Erosion and Sedimentation Control (Ordinance 99-1013). 
D.  All disturbed vegetation shall be replanted with suitable vegetation upon completion of the grading of the steep slope area. 
E.  Existing vegetative cover shall be maintained to the maximum extent practicable. No grading, compaction or change in ground elevation, soil hydrology and/or site drainage shall be permitted within the drip line of trees designated for protection, unless approved by the city. 
F.  Existing perennial and intermittent watercourses shall not be disturbed unless specifically authorized by the review authority. This includes physical impacts to the stream course as well as siltation and erosion impacts. 
G.  All soil erosion and sediment control measures shall be maintained during construction and for one year after development is completed, or until soils are stabilized by revegetation or other measures to the satisfaction of the city engineer. Such maintenance shall be the responsibility of the developer. If erosion or sediment control measures are not being properly maintained or are not functioning properly due to faulty installation or neglect, the City may order work to be stopped. (Ord. 03-1014, Att. B3 (part), 2003: Ord. 94-1001 §2(part), 1994) 
H.  All newly created lots, either by subdivision or partition, shall contain building envelopes with a slope of thirty-five percent or less. 
I.  The applicant's geotechnical engineer shall provide special inspection during construction to confirm that the subsurface conditions and assumptions made as part of their geotechnical evaluation/investigation are appropriate. This will allow for timely design changes if site conditions are encountered that are different from those anticipated. 
J.  Prior to issuing an occupancy permit, the geotechnical engineer shall prepare a summary letter stating that the soils- and foundation-related project elements were accomplished in substantial conformance with their recommendations. 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009; Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010) 
17.44.110 - Approval of development. 
    The city engineer shall review the application and verify, based on the applicant's materials and the land use record, whether the proposed development constitutes a hazard to life, property, natural resources or public facilities. If, in the city engineer's opinion, a particular development poses such a hazard, the city engineer shall recommend to the review authority permit conditions designed to reduce or eliminate the hazard. These conditions may include, but are not limited to, prohibitions on construction activities between November 1st and March 31st. 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009; Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010) 
17.44.120 - Liability.

Chapter 17.47 - EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL 
[23]
Footnotes: 

17.47.010 - Purpose. 
A.  The purpose of this chapter is to require erosion prevention measures and sediment control practices for all development during construction to prevent and restrict the discharge of sediments, and to require final permanent erosion prevention measures, which may include landscaping, after development is completed. Erosion prevention techniques shall be designed to protect soil particles from the force of water and wind and other mechanical means so that they will not be transported from the site. Sediment control measures shall be designed to capture soil particles after they have become dislodged by erosion and attempt to retain the soil particles on-site. 
B.  The objective of these measures is to control, at the source, waterborne and airborne erosion and the air and water pollution that results from such erosion mechanisms. This chapter recognizes that all non-point discharges eventually end up in surface water bodies. This chapter is intended to control water quality degradation from construction and development activities and it applies in addition to any other applicable provision of this Code, state or federal law. This chapter is not intended to serve as a guideline for stormwater management control measures for already constructed developments. 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009) 
17.47.030 - Applicability. 
A.  This chapter, which may also be referred to as "erosion control" in this Code, applies to development that may cause visible or measurable erosion on any property within the city limits of Oregon City. 
B.  This chapter does not apply to work necessary to protect, repair, maintain or replace existing structures, utility facilities, roadways, driveways, accessory uses and exterior improvements in response to emergencies, provided that after the emergency has passed, adverse impacts are mitigated in accordance with applicable standards. 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009) 
17.47.040 - Abrogation and greater restrictions. 
    Where the provisions of this chapter are less restrictive or conflict with comparable provisions of the zoning ordinance, regional, state or federal law, the provisions that are more restrictive shall govern. Where this document imposes restrictions that are more stringent than regional, state and federal law, the provisions of this document shall govern. However, nothing in this chapter shall relieve any party from the obligation to comply with any applicable federal, state or local regulations or permit requirements. 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009) 
17.47.050 - Severability. 
    The provisions of this chapter are severable. If any section, clause or phrase of this chapter is adjudged to be invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the decision of that court shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009) 
17.47.060 - Permit required. 
    The applicant must obtain an erosion and sediment control permit prior to, or contemporaneous with, the approval of an application for any building, land use or other city-issued permit that may cause visible or measurable erosion. 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009) 
17.47.070 - Erosion and sediment control plans. 
A.  An application for an erosion and sediment control permit shall include an erosion and sediment control plan, which contains methods and interim measures to be used during and following construction to prevent or control erosion prepared in compliance with City of Oregon City public works standards for erosion and sediment control. These standards are incorporated herein and made a part of this title and are on file in the office of the city recorder. 
B.  Approval Standards. An erosion and sediment control plan shall be approved only upon making the following findings: 
1.  The erosion and sediment control plan meets the requirements of the City of Oregon City public works standards for erosion and sediment control incorporated by reference as part of this chapter; 
2.  The erosion and sediment control plan indicates that erosion and sediment control measures will be managed and maintained during and following development. The erosion and sediment control plan indicates that erosion and sediment control measures will remain in place until disturbed soil areas are permanently stabilized by landscaping, grass, approved mulch or other permanent soil stabilizing measures. 
C.  The erosion and sediment control plan shall be reviewed in conjunction with the requested development approval. If the development does not require additional review, the manager may approve or deny the permit with notice of the decision to the applicant. 
D.  The city may inspect the development site to determine compliance with the erosion and sediment control plan and permit. 
E.  Erosion that occurs on a development site that does not have an erosion and sediment control permit, or that results from a failure to comply with the terms of such a permit, constitutes a violation of this chapter. 
F.  If the manager finds that the facilities and techniques approved in an erosion and sediment control plan and permit are not sufficient to prevent erosion, the manager shall notify the owner or his/her designated representative. Upon receiving notice, the owner or his/her designated representative shall immediately install interim erosion and sediment control measures as specified in the City of Oregon City public works standards for erosion and sediment control. Within three days from the date of notice, the owner or his/her designated representative shall submit a revised erosion and sediment control plan to the city. Upon approval of the revised plan and issuance of an amended permit, the owner or his/her designated representative shall immediately implement the revised plan. 
G.  Approval of an erosion and sediment control plan does not constitute an approval of permanent road or drainage design (e.g., size and location of roads, pipes, restrictors, channels, retention facilities, utilities, etc.). 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009) 
17.47.080 - Plan implementation. 
    An approved erosion control and sediment control plan shall be implemented and maintained as follows: 
A.  Plan approval, where required, shall be obtained prior to clearing or grading. No grading, clearing or excavation of land requiring a plan shall be undertaken prior to approval of the plan. 
B.  The erosion and sediment control facilities shall be constructed prior to any clearing and grading activities, and maintained in such a manner as to ensure that sediment laden water does not enter the drainage system or violate applicable water standards. 
C.  The implementation of an erosion and sediment control plan and the construction, maintenance, replacement, and upgrading of erosion and sediment control facilities is the responsibility of the owner or his/her designated representative until all construction is completed and approved, and vegetation, landscaping or approved finished surfaces is established. 
D.  The erosion and sediment control facilities herein are the minimum requirements for anticipated site conditions. During the construction period, these erosion and sediment control facilities shall be upgraded as needed for unexpected storm events and to ensure that sediment-laden water does not leave the site. 
E.  Any observation of visible or measurable erosion, or an observation of more than a ten-percent increase in downstream channel turbidities, will result in an enforcement action by the city. 
F.  The owner or his/her designated representative shall implement the measures and construct facilities as provided for and according to the implementation schedule in the approved plan. The manager shall be allowed reasonable access to the development site for inspection purposes. 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009) 
17.47.090 - Plan performance guarantee and security. 
    After the plan is approved by the manager and prior to construction or grading, the owner shall provide a financial guarantee. Erosion and sediment control shall be included in the cost estimate for the primary project, such as land division or site plan, and included in that project's performance guarantee. 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009) 
17.47.100 - Correction of ineffective measures and enforcement. 
A.  If the owner or his/her designated representative fails to follow the plan as approved by the manager or fails to submit a plan when one is required, the manager may, after inspecting the property, issue a stop work order halting all work on the development site until the requirements of the plan are met or implemented as applicable. 
Accompanying the stop work order shall be a written statement or list from the manager specifying what is wrong and what steps the owner must take to bring the development into compliance. The stop work order shall not be lifted until mitigation measures are implemented that comply with Oregon City performance standards for erosion and sediment control and are approved by the manager. 
B.  If the facilities and techniques in the approved plans are not effective or sufficient to meet the purposes of this chapter, based on an on-site inspection, the Manager may require a revision to the plan. Such requirement shall be in writing and shall explain the problem and suggested measures to remedy the problem. The notice shall be presented to the owner and any other responsible parties. 
1.  The revised plan shall be provided within three business days of when written notification by the manager is received. Receipt of such notice shall be deemed complete three days after simultaneous regular mail and certified mail is deposited in the mail. 
2.  The owner or his/her designated representative shall implement fully the revised plan within three business days of receipt of the revised plan as provided in the previous subdivision, or within such other time frame as the manager may specify. 
3.  In cases where significant erosion is occurring, the manager may require the owner or his/her designated representative to install immediately interim control measures before submittal of revised plan. 
4.  If there is a confirmed or imminent threat of significant off-site erosion, the manager shall issue a stop work order, upon issuance of which work on the development site shall halt. The stop work order shall not be lifted until mitigation measures are implemented that comply with Oregon City performance standards for erosion and sediment control and are approved by the manager. 
C.  Enforcement. Erosion that migrates off of a development site is considered to be a nuisance that threatens the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of Oregon City and is a violation of this chapter. Any owner who violates, or is responsible for a violation or this chapter or an approved plan, shall be subject to the enforcement procedures of this Code including by the code enforcement officer.

Chapter 17.49 - NATURAL RESOURCE OVERLAY DISTRICT[25] 

Footnotes: 
--- (25) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 08-1014, adopted July 1, 2009, repealed Chapter 17.49 in its entirety and enacted new provisions to read as herein set out. Prior to amendment, Chapter 17.49 pertained to WR Water Quality Resources Area Overlay District. See Ordinance Disposition List for derivation. 

17.49.[0]10 - Purpose. 
    The Natural Resource Overlay District designation provides a framework for protection of Metro Titles 3 and 13 lands, and Statewide Planning Goal 5 resources within Oregon City. The Natural Resource Overlay District (NROD) implements the Oregon City Comprehensive Plan Natural Resource Goals and Policies, as well as Federal Clean Water Act requirements for shading of streams and reduction of water temperatures, and the recommendations of the Metro ESEE Analysis. It is intended to resolve conflicts between development and conservation of habitat, stream corridors, wetlands, and floodplains identified in the city's maps. The NROD contributes to the following functional values: 
A.  Protect and restore streams and riparian areas for their ecologic functions and as an open space amenity for the community. 
B.  Protect floodplains and wetlands, and restore them for improved hydrology, flood protection, aquifer recharge, and habitat functions. 
C.  Protect upland habitats, and enhance connections between upland and riparian habitat. 
D.  Maintain and enhance water quality and control erosion and sedimentation through the revegetation of disturbed sites and by placing limits on construction, impervious surfaces, and pollutant discharges. 
E.  Conserve scenic, recreational, and educational values of significant natural resources. 
The NROD ecological functions listed above are planned for integration with existing neighborhoods and new residential and commercial developments. The long-term goal of the NROD is to restore and enhance stream corridors, wetlands, and forests to more natural vegetated conditions, recognizing that existing homes and other existing uses will continue in the district. This chapter does not regulate the development within the identified water resource. Separate permits from the Division of State Lands and the Army Corp of Engineers may be required for work within a stream or wetland. 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009; Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010) 
General 
17.49.020 - NROD identifying documents. 
A.  The NROD protects as one connected system the habitats and associated functions of the streams, riparian corridors, wetlands and the regulated upland habitats found in Oregon City. These habitats and functions are described in the following documents upon which the NROD is based: 
1.  The 1999 Oregon City Local Wetland Inventory. 
2.  The Oregon City Water Quality Resource Area Map (Ord. 99-1013). 
3.  2004 Oregon City slope data and mapping (LIDAR). 
4.  Metro Regionally Significant Habitat Map (Aerial Photos taken 2002). 
5.  National Wetland Inventory (published 1992). 
6.  Beavercreek Road Concept Plan (adopted September 2008). 
7.  Park Place Concept Plan (adopted April 2008). 
The NROD provisions apply only to properties within the NROD as shown on the NROD Map, as amended. 
The intent of these regulations is to provide applicants the ability to choose a clear and objective review process or a discretionary review process. The NROD provisions do not affect existing uses and development, or the normal maintenance of existing structures, driveways/parking areas, public facilities, farmland and landscaped areas. New public facilities such as recreation trails, planned road and utility line crossings and stormwater facilities, are allowed within the overlay district under prescribed conditions as described in Section 17.49.090. In addition, provisions to allow a limited portion of the NROD to be developed on existing lots of record that are entirely or mostly covered by the NROD ("highly constrained") are described in Section 17.49.120. 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009; Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010) 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), adopted July 7, 2010, renamed section 17.49.020 from "How the NROD works" to "NROD identifying documents." 
17.49.[0]30 - Map as reference. 
    This chapter applies to all development within the Natural Resources Overlay District as shown on the NROD Map, which is a regulatory boundary mapped ten feet beyond the required vegetated corridor width specified in section 17.49.110. The mapped NROD boundary is based on a GIS-supported application of the adopted documents, plans and maps listed in Sections 17.49.020A.1.-17.19.020A.8., however the adopted map may not indicate the true location of protected features. Notwithstanding changing field conditions or updated mapping approved by the city (and processed as a Type I Verification per OCMC 17.49.255), the applicant may choose to either accept the adopted NROD boundary or provide a verifiable delineation of the true location of the natural resource feature pursuant to the Type I or Type II procedure in accordance with this chapter. The NROD boundary shall be shown on all development permit applications and its location shall be verified in the field before development activity (including grading) commences. The official NROD map can only be amended by the city commission. Verification of the map shall be processed pursuant to Section 17.49.250. 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009; Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010) 
17.49.[0]35 - Addition of wetlands to map following adoption. 
    The NROD boundary shall be expanded to include a wetland identified during the course of a development permit review if it is within or partially within the mapped NROD boundary and meets the State of Oregon's definition of a "Locally Significant Wetland". In such cases the entire wetland and its required vegetated corridor as defined in Table 17.49.110 shall be regulated pursuant to the standards of this chapter. The NROD boundary shall be added to the NROD map by the community development director after the development permit becomes final. 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009; Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010) 
17.49.[0]40 - NROD permit. 
    An NROD permit is required for those uses regulated under Section 17.49.90, Uses Allowed under Prescribed Conditions. An NROD permit shall be processed under the Type II development permit procedure, unless an adjustment of standards pursuant to Section 17.49.200 is requested or the application is being processed in conjunction with a concurrent application or action requiring a Type III or Type IV development permit. Applications for development on properties affected by the NROD shall delineate or verify the exact location of the NROD as part of a Type I or II development review process unless exempted pursuant to section 17.40.080. 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009; Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010) 
17.49.[0]50 - Emergencies. 
    The provisions of this ordinance do not apply to work necessary to protect, repair, maintain, or replace existing structures, utility facilities, roadways, driveways, accessory uses and exterior improvements in response to emergencies. After the emergency has passed, any disturbed native vegetation areas shall be replanted with similar vegetation found in the Oregon City Native Plant List pursuant to the mitigation standards of Section 17.49.180. For purposes of this section emergency shall mean any man-made or natural event or circumstance causing or threatening loss of life, injury to person or property, and includes, but is not limited to fire, explosion, flood, severe weather, drought, earthquake, volcanic activity, spills or releases of oil or hazardous material, contamination, utility or transportation disruptions, and disease.

17.49.[0]60 - Consistency and relationship to other regulations. 
A.  Where the provisions of the NROD are less restrictive or conflict with comparable provisions of the Oregon City Municipal Code, other City requirements, regional, state or federal law, the provisions that provides the greater protection of the resource shall govern. 
B.  Compliance with Federal and State Requirements. 
a.  If the proposed development requires the approval of any other governmental agency, such as the Division of State Lands or the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the applicant shall make application for such approval prior to or simultaneously with the submittal of its development application to the City. The planning division shall coordinate City approvals with those of other agencies to the extent necessary and feasible. Any permit issued by the City pursuant to this chapter shall not become valid until other agency approvals have been obtained or those agencies indicate that such approvals are not required. 
b.  The requirements of this chapter apply only to areas within the NROD and to locally significant wetlands that may be added to the boundary during the course of development review pursuant to Section 17.49.035. If, in the course of a development review, evidence suggests that a property outside the NROD may contain a wetland or other protected water resource, the provisions of this chapter shall not be applied to that development review. However, the omission shall not excuse the applicant from satisfying any state and federal wetland requirements which are otherwise applicable. Those requirements apply in addition to, and apart from the requirements of the City's comprehensive plan and this code.

(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009; Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010) 
17.49.110 - Width of vegetated corridor. 
A.  Calculation of Vegetated Corridor Width within City Limits. The NROD consists of a vegetated corridor measured from the top of bank or edge of a protected habitat or water feature. The minimum required width is the amount of buffer required on each side of a stream, or on all sides of a feature if non-linear. The width of the vegetated corridor necessary to adequately protect the habitat or water feature is specified in Table 17.49.110. 
Table 17.49.110 
Protected Water Feature Type (see definitions) Slope Adjacent to Protected Water Feature Starting Point for Measurements from Water Feature Width of Vegetated Corridor (see Note 1) Anadromous fish-bearing streams Any slope  Edge of bankfull flow 200 feet Intermittent streams with slopes less than 25 percent and which drain less than 100 acres < 25 percent  Edge of bankfull flow 15 feet All other protected water features < 25 percent Edge of bankfull flow 
 Delineated edge of Title 3 wetland 50 feet =25 percent for 150 feet or more (see Note 2) 200 feet =25 percent for less than 150 feet (see Note 2) Distance from starting point of measurement to top of ravine (break in =25 percent slope) (See Note 3) plus 50 feet.  
Notes: 
1.  Required width (measured horizontally) of vegetated corridor unless reduced pursuant to the provisions of Section 17.49.050(I). 
2.  Vegetated corridors in excess of fifty feet apply on steep slopes only in the uphill direction from the protected water feature. 
3.  Where the protected water feature is confined by a ravine or gully, the top of the ravine is the break in the =25 percent slope. 
B.  Habitat Areas within City Parks. For habitat and water features identified by Metro as regionally significant which are located within city parks, the NROD Boundary shall correspond to the Metro Regionally Significant Habitat Map. 
C.  Habitat Areas outside city limit/within UGB. For habitat and water features identified by Metro as regionally significant which are located outside of the city limits as of the date of adoption of this ordinance, the minimum corridor width from any non-anadramous fish bearing stream or wetland shall be fifty feet. 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009; Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010) 
17.49.120 - Maximum disturbance allowance for highly constrained lots of record. 
    In addition to the General Development Standards of Section 17.49.100, the following standards apply to a vacant lot of record that is highly constrained by the NROD, per subsections 17.49.90(B) and 17.49.90(F): 
A.  Standard for Residential Development. In the NROD where the underlying zone district is zoned Residential (R-10, R-8, R-6, R-5, R-3.5): the maximum disturbance area allowed for new residential development within the NROD area of the lot is three thousand square feet. 
B.  Standard for all developments not located in R-10, R-8, R-6, R-5, and R-3.5. For all other underlying zone districts, including R-2 multifamily, the maximum disturbance area allowed for a vacant, constrained lot of record development within the NROD is that square footage which when added to the square footage of the lot lying outside the NROD portion equals twenty-five percent of the total lot area. 
[1]  Lots that are entirely covered by the NROD will be allowed to develop twenty-five percent of their area. 
[1]  Note: This can be determined by (1) Multiplying the total square footage of the lot by .25; (2) Subtracting from that amount the square footage of the lot that is located outside the NROD; (3) The result is the maximum square footage of disturbance to be allowed in the NROD portion of the lot. If the result is < or = to 0, no disturbance is permitted and the building shall be located outside of the boundary. 
C.  In all areas of Oregon City, the disturbance area of a vacant, highly constrained lot of record within the NROD shall be set back at least fifty feet from the top of bank on Abernethy Creek, Newell Creek, or Livesay Creek or twenty-five feet from the top of bank of any tributary of the aforementioned Creeks, other water body, or from the delineated edge of a wetland located within the NROD area. 
D.  If the highly constrained lot of record cannot comply with the above standards, a maximum one thousand five hundred square foot disturbance within the NROD area may be allowed.

Replacement trees shall be at least one-half inch in caliper on average, measured at six inches above the ground level for field grown trees or above the soil line for container grown trees. Oak, madrone, ash or alder may be one gallon size. Conifers shall be a minimum of six feet in height. Shrubs must be in at least one-gallon container size or the equivalent in ball and burlap, and shall be at least twelve inches in height at the time of planting. All other species shall be a minimum of four-inch pots; 
c.  Option 1 - Plant Spacing. Except for the outer edges of mitigation areas, trees and shrubs shall be planted in a non-linear fashion. Plant spacing for new species shall be measured from the driplines of existing trees when present. Trees shall be planted on average between eight and twelve feet on center, and shrubs shall be planted on average between four and five feet on center, or clustered in single species groups of no more than four plants, with each cluster planted on average between eight and ten feet on center. 
d.  Option 1 - Mulching and Irrigation. Mulch new plantings a minimum of three inches in depth and eighteen inches in diameters. Water new plantings one inch per week from June 30th to September 15th, for the three years following planting. 
e.  Option 1 - Plant Diversity. Shrubs shall consist of at least two different species. If ten trees or more are planted, no more than one-half of the trees may be of the same genus. 
2.  Mitigation Planting Option 2. 
a.  Option 2 - Planting Quantity. In this option, the mitigation requirement is calculated based on the size of the disturbance area within the NROD. Native trees and shrubs are required to be planted at a rate of five trees and twenty-five shrubs per every five hundred square feet of disturbance area (calculated by dividing the number of square feet of disturbance area by five hundred, and then multiplying that result times five trees and twenty-five shrubs, and rounding all fractions to the nearest whole number of trees and shrubs; for example, if there will be three hundred thirty square feet of disturbance area, then three hundred thirty divided by five hundred equals .66, and .66 times five equals 3.3, so three trees must be planted, and .66 times twenty-five equals 16.5, so seventeen shrubs must be planted). Bare ground must be planted or seeded with native grasses or herbs. Non-native sterile wheat grass may also be planted or seeded, in equal or lesser proportion to the native grasses or herbs. 
b.  Option 2 - Plant Size. Plantings may vary in size dependent on whether they are live cuttings, bare root stock or container stock, however, no initial plantings may be shorter than twelve inches in height. 
c.  Option 2 - Plant Spacing. Trees shall be planted at average intervals of seven feet on center. Shrubs may be planted in single-species groups of no more than four plants, with clusters planted on average between eight and ten feet on center. 
d.  Option 2 - Mulching and Irrigation shall be applied in the amounts necessary to ensure eighty percent survival at the end of the required five-year monitoring period. 
e.  Option 2 - Plant Diversity. Shrubs shall consist of at least three different species. If twenty trees or more are planted, no more than one-third of the trees may be of the same genus. 
An alternative planting plan using native plants may be approved in order to create a new wetland area, if it is part of a wetlands mitigation plan that has been approved by the DSL or the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) in conjunction with a wetland joint removal/fill permit application. 
F.  Monitoring and Maintenance. The mitigation plan shall provide for a five-year monitoring and maintenance plan with annual reports in a form approved by the director of community development. Monitoring of the mitigation site is the on-going responsibility of the property owner, assign, or designee, who shall submit said annual report to the city's planning division, documenting plant survival rates of shrubs and trees on the mitigation site. Photographs shall accompany the report that indicate the progress of the mitigation. A minimum of eighty percent survival of trees and shrubs of those species planted is required at the end of the five-year maintenance and monitoring period. Any invasive species shall be removed and plants that die shall be replaced in kind. Bare spots and areas of invasive vegetation larger than ten square feet that remain at the end the five-year monitoring period shall be replanted or reseeded with native grasses and ground cover species. 
G.  Covenant or Conservation Easement. Applicant shall record a restrictive covenant or conservation easement, in a form provided by the city, requiring the owners and assigns of properties subject to this section to comply with the applicable mitigation requirements of this section. Said covenant shall run with the land, and permit the city to complete mitigation work in the event of default by the responsible party. Costs borne by the city for such mitigation shall be borne by the owner. 
H.  Financial Guarantee. A financial guarantee for establishment of the mitigation area, in a form approved by the city, shall be submitted before development within the NROD disturbance area commences. The city will release the guarantee at the end of the five-year monitoring period, or before, upon it's determination that the mitigation plan has been satisfactorily implemented pursuant to this section.

17.49.190 - Alternative mitigation standards. 
    In lieu of the above mitigation standards of Section 17.49.180, the following standards may be used. Compliance with these standards shall be demonstrated in a mitigation plan report prepared by an environmental professional with experience and academic credentials in one or more natural resource areas such as ecology, wildlife biology, botany, hydrology or forestry. At the applicant's expense, the city may require the report to be reviewed by an environmental consultant. 
[A.]  The report shall document the existing condition of the vegetated corridor as one of the following categories: 
Good Existing Corridor: Combination of trees, shrubs and groundcover are eighty percent present, and there is more than fifty percent tree canopy coverage in the vegetated corridor. Marginal Existing Vegetated Corridor: Combination of trees, shrubs and groundcover are eighty percent present, and twenty-five to fifty percent canopy coverage in the vegetated corridor. Degraded Existing Vegetated Corridor: Less vegetation and canopy coverage than marginal vegetated corridors, and/or greater than ten percent surface coverage of any non-native species.  
B.  The proposed mitigation shall occur at a minimum two-to-one ratio of mitigation area to proposed disturbance area; 
C.  The proposed mitigation shall result in a significant improvement to Good Existing Condition as determined by a qualified environmental professional; 
D.  There shall be no detrimental impact on resources and functional values in the area designated to be left undisturbed; 
E.  Where the proposed mitigation includes alteration or replacement of development in a stream channel, wetland, or other water body, there shall be no detrimental impact related to the migration, rearing, feeding or spawning of fish; 
F.  Mitigation shall occur on the site of the disturbance to the extent practicable. If the proposed mitigation cannot practically occur on the site of the disturbance, then the applicant shall possess a legal instrument, such as an easement, sufficient to carryout and ensure the success of the mitigation. 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009; Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010) 
17.49.200 - Adjustment from standards. 
    If a regulated NROD use cannot meet one or more of the applicable NROD standards then an adjustment may be issued if all of the following criteria are met. Compliance with these criteria shall be demonstrated by the applicant in a written report prepared by an environmental professional with experience and academic credentials in one or more natural resource areas such as ecology, wildlife biology, botany, hydrology or forestry. At the applicant's expense, the City may require the report to be reviewed by an environmental consultant. Such requests shall be processed under the Type III development permit procedure.

Miscellaneous 
17.49.240 - Density transfer. 
    The NROD allocates urban densities to the Non-NROD portions of properties located partially within the NROD, generally resulting in a substantial increase in net development potential. 
    For lots of record that are located within the NROD, additional density transfer credits are allowed, subject to the following provisions: 
A.  Density may be transferred from the NROD to non-NROD portions of the same property or of contiguous properties within the same development site; 
B.  The residential transfer credit shall be as follows: for new residential partitions and subdivisions, one-third of the area of the NROD tract or conservation easement area may be added to the net developable area outside of the tract or conservation easement area within the boundary of the development site in order to calculate the allowable number of lots. 
C.  Permitted Modifications to Residential Dimensional Standards. In order to allow for a transfer of density pursuant to subsection B. above, the dimensional standards of the base zone may be modified in order minimize disturbance to the NROD. The permissible reductions are specified in Tables 17.49.240C.-17.49.240D. 
D.  The applicant shall demonstrate that the minimum lot size of the underlying zone has been met. The area of the NROD in subsection B. above that is used to transfer density may be included in the calculation of the average minimum lot size. 
E.  The applicant may choose to make the adjustments over as many lots as required. For example, the lot reduction could be spread across all the remaining lots in the proposed subdivision or partition or could be applied to only those needed to incorporate the areas of the NROD Tract.

17.49.250 - Verification of NROD boundary. 
    The NROD boundary may have to be verified occasionally to determine the true location of a resource and its functional values on a site. This may through a site specific environmental survey or, in those cases where existing information demonstrates that the NROD significance rating does not apply to a site-specific area. Applications for development on a site located in the NROD area may request a determination that the subject site is not in an NROD area and therefore is not subject to the standards of Section 17.49.100. Verifications shall be processed as either a Type I or Type II process. 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009; Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010) 
17.49.255 - Type I verification. 
A.  Applicants for a determination under this section shall submit a site plan meeting the requirements of Section 17.49.220, as applicable. 
B.  Alternatively, an applicant may request a Type I Verification determination by the community development director by making an application therefore and paying to the city a fee as set by resolution of the city commission. Such requests may be approved provided that there is evidence substantiating that all the requirements of this chapter relative to the proposed use are satisfied and demonstrates that the property also satisfies the following criteria, as applicable: 
1.  No soil, vegetation, hydrologic features have been disturbed; 
2.  No hydrologic features have been changed; 
3.  There are no man-made drainage features, water marks, swash lines, drift lines present on trees or shrubs, sediment deposits on plants, or any other evidence of sustained inundation. 
4.  The property does not contain a wetland as identified by the city's local wetland inventory or water quality and flood management areas map. 
5.  There is no evidence of a perennial or intermittent stream system or other protected water feature. This does not include established irrigation ditches currently under active farm use, canals or manmade storm or surface water runoff structures or artificial water collection devices. 
6.  Evidence of prior land use approvals that conform to the City's existing Water Quality Resource Area Overlay District. 
There is an existing physical barrier between the site and a protected water feature, including: 
a.  Streets, driveways, alleys, parking lots or other approved impervious areas wider than fifteen feet and which includes drainage improvements that are connected to the city storm sewer system, as approved by the city. 
b.  Walls, buildings, drainages, culverts or other structures and which form a physical barrier between the site and the protected water features, as approved by the city. 
C.  If a the city is not able to clearly determine, through the Type I verification process that the applicable criteria subsection B.1.-B.6. above are met the verification application shall be denied. An applicant may then opt to apply for an verification through the Type II process defined below. 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009; Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010) 
17.49.260. - Type II verification. 
    Verifications of the NROD which cannot be determined pursuant to the standards of Section 17.49.255 may be processed under the Type II permit procedure. 
A.  Applicants for a determination under this section shall submit a site plan meeting the requirements of Section 17.49.220 as applicable. 
B.  Such requests may be approved provided that there is evidence that demonstrates in an environmental report prepared by one or more qualified professionals with experience and credentials in natural resource areas, including wildlife biology, ecology, hydrology and forestry, that a resource function(s) and/or land feature(s) does not apply to a site-specific area. 
C.  Verification to remove a recently developed area from the NROD shall show that all of the following have been met: 
1.  All approved development in the NROD has been completed; 
2.  All mitigation required for the approved development, located within the NROD, has been successful; and 
3.  The previously identified resources and functional values on the developed site no longer exist or have been subject to a significant detrimental impact. 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009; Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010) 
17.49.265 - Corrections to violations. 
    For correcting violations, the violator shall submit a remediation plan that meets all of the applicable standards of the NROD. The remediation plan shall be prepared by one or more qualified professionals with experience and credentials in natural resource areas, including wildlife biology, ecology, hydrology and forestry. If one or more of these standards cannot be met then the applicant's remediation plan shall demonstrate that there will be: 
A.  No permanent loss of any type of resource or functional value listed in Section 17.49.10, as determined by a qualified environmental professional; 
B.  A significant improvement of at least one functional value listed in section 17.49.10, as determined by a qualified environmental professional; and 
C.  There will be minimal loss of resources and functional values during the remediation action until it is fully established.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 08-1014, adopted July 1, 2009, repealed Chapter 17.50 in its entirety and enacted new provisions to read as herein set out. Prior to amendment, Chapter 17.50 pertained to similar subject matter. See Ordinance Disposition List for derivation. 

17.50.010 - Purpose. 
    This chapter provides the procedures by which Oregon City reviews and decides upon applications for all permits relating to the use of land authorized by ORS Chapters 92, 197 and 227. These permits include all form of land divisions, land use, limited land use and expedited land division and legislative enactments and amendments to the Oregon City comprehensive plan and Titles 16 and 17 of this code. Pursuant to ORS 227.175, any applicant may elect to consolidate applications for two or more related permits needed for a single development project. Any grading activity associated with development shall be subject to preliminary review as part of the review process for the underlying development. It is the express policy of the city that development review not be segmented into discrete parts in a manner that precludes a comprehensive review of the entire development and its cumulative impacts. 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009; Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010) 
17.50.030 - Summary of the city's decision-making processes.

____________ 
1   If any provision or element of the master plan requires a deferred Type III procedure, the detailed development plan shall be processed through a Type III procedure. 
2   A major modification to a prior approval shall be considered using the same process as would be applicable to the initial approval. 
A.  Type I decisions do not require interpretation or the exercise of policy or legal judgment in evaluating approval criteria. Because no discretion is involved, Type I decisions do not qualify as a land use, or limited land use, decision. The decision-making process requires no notice to any party other than the applicant. The community development director's decision is final and not appealable by any party through the normal city land use process. 
B.  Type II decisions involve the exercise of limited interpretation and discretion in evaluating approval criteria, similar to the limited land use decision-making process under state law. Applications evaluated through this process are assumed to be allowable in the underlying zone, and the inquiry typically focuses on what form the use will take or how it will look. Notice of application and an invitation to comment is mailed to the applicant, recognized active neighborhood association(s) and property owners within three hundred feet. The community development director accepts comments for a minimum of fourteen days and renders a decision. The community development director's decision is appealable to the city commission, by any party who submitted comments in writing before the expiration of the comment period. Review by the city commission shall be on the record pursuant to Section 17.50.190 under ORS 227.175.10(a)(C). The city commission decision is the city's final decision and is subject to review by the land use board of appeals (LUBA) within twenty-one days of when it becomes final. 
C.  Type III decisions involve the greatest amount of discretion and evaluation of subjective approval standards, yet are not heard by the city commission, except upon appeal. In the event that any decision is not classified, it shall be treated as a Type III decision. The process for these land use decisions is controlled by ORS 197.763. Notice of the application and the planning commission or the historic review board hearing is published and mailed to the applicant, recognized neighborhood association(s) and property owners within three hundred feet. Notice must be issued at least twenty days pre-hearing, and the staff report must be available at least seven days pre-hearing. At the evidentiary hearing held before the planning commission or the historic review board, all issues are addressed. The decision of the planning commission or historic review board is appealable to the city commission, on the record pursuant to Section 17.50.190. The city commission decision on appeal is the city's final decision and is subject to review by LUBA within twenty-one days of when it becomes final, unless otherwise provided by state law. 
D.  Type IV decisions include only quasi-judicial plan amendments and zone changes. These applications involve the greatest amount of discretion and evaluation of subjective approval standards and must be heard by the city commission for final action. The process for these land use decisions is controlled by ORS 197.763. Notice of the application and planning commission hearing is published and mailed to the applicant, recognized neighborhood association(s) and property owners within three hundred feet. Notice must be issued at least twenty days pre-hearing, and the staff report must be available at least seven days pre-hearing. At the evidentiary hearing held before the planning commission, all issues are addressed. If the planning commission denies the application, any party with standing (i.e., anyone who appeared before the planning commission either in person or in writing within the comment period) may appeal the planning commission denial to the city commission. If the planning commission denies the application and no appeal has been received within fourteen days of the issuance of the final decision then the action of the planning commission becomes the final decision of the city. If the planning commission votes to approve the application, that decision is forwarded as a recommendation to the city commission for final consideration. In either case, any review by the city commission is on the record and only issues raised before the planning commission may be raised before the city commission. The city commission decision is the city's final decision and is subject to review by the land use board of appeals (LUBA) within twenty-one days of when it becomes final. 
E.  The expedited land division (ELD) process is set forth in ORS 197.360 to 197.380. To qualify for this type of process, the development must meet the basic criteria in ORS 197.360(1)(a) or (b). While the decision-making process is controlled by state law, the approval criteria are found in this code. The community development director has twenty-one days within which to determine whether an application is complete. Once deemed complete, the community development director has sixty-three days within which to issue a decision. Notice of application and opportunity to comment is mailed to the applicant, recognized neighborhood association and property owners within one hundred feet of the subject site. The community development director will accept written comments on the application for fourteen days and then issues a decision. State law prohibits a hearing. Any party who submitted comments may call for an appeal of the community development director's decision before a hearings referee. The referee need not hold a hearing; the only requirement is that the determination be based on the evidentiary record established by the community development director and that the process be "fair." The referee applies the city's approval standards, and has forty-two days within which to issue a decision on the appeal. The referee is charged with the general objective to identify means by which the application can satisfy the applicable requirements without reducing density. The referee's decision is appealable only to the court of appeals pursuant to ORS 197.375(8) and 36.355(1). 
F.  Decisions, completeness reviews, appeals, and notices in this chapter shall be calculated according to OCMC Chapter 1.04.070 and shall be based on calendar days, not business days.

17.50.050 - Preapplication conference. 
A.  Preapplication Conference. Prior to submitting an application for any form of permit, the applicant shall schedule and attend a preapplication conference with City staff to discuss the proposal. To schedule a preapplication conference, the applicant shall contact the Planning Division, submit the required materials, and pay the appropriate conference fee. At a minimum, an applicant should submit a short narrative describing the proposal and a proposed site plan, drawn to a scale acceptable to the City, which identifies the proposed land uses, traffic circulation, and public rights-of-way and all other required plans. The purpose of the preapplication conference is to provide an opportunity for staff to provide the applicant with information on the likely impacts, limitations, requirements, approval standards, fees and other information that may affect the proposal. The Planning Division shall provide the applicant(s) with the identity and contact persons for all affected neighborhood associations as well as a written summary of the preapplication conference. Notwithstanding any representations by City staff at a preapplication conference, staff is not authorized to waive any requirements of this code, and any omission or failure by staff to recite to an applicant all relevant applicable land use requirements shall not constitute a waiver by the City of any standard or requirement. 
B.  A preapplication conference shall be valid for a period of six months from the date it is held. If no application is filed within six months of the conference or meeting, the applicant must schedule and attend another conference before the city will accept a permit application. The community development director may waive the preapplication requirement if, in the Director's opinion, the development does not warrant this step. In no case shall a preapplication conference be valid for more than one year.

17.50.070 - Completeness review and one hundred twenty-day rule. 
A.  Upon submission, the community development director shall date stamp the application form and verify that the appropriate application fee has been submitted. The community development director will then review the application and all information submitted with it and evaluate whether the application is complete enough to process. Within thirty days of receipt of the application, the community development director shall complete this initial review and issue to the applicant a written statement indicating whether the application is complete enough to process, and if not, what information must be submitted to make the application complete. 
B.  The applicant has one hundred eighty days from the date the application was made to submit the missing information or, on the one hundred eighty-first-day, the application shall be rejected and all materials (except one copy of the application) and the unused portion of the application fee returned to the applicant. If the applicant submits the requested information within the one hundred eighty-day period, the community development director shall again verify whether the application, as augmented, is complete. Each such review and verification shall follow the procedure in subsection A. of this section. 
The application will be deemed complete for the purpose of this section upon receipt by the community development director of: 
1.  All the missing information; 
2.  Some of the missing information and written notice from the applicant that no other information will be provided; or 
3.  Written notice from the applicant that none of the missing information will be provided. 
C.  Once the community development director determines the application is complete enough to process, or the applicant refuses to submit any more information, the city shall declare the application complete. Pursuant to ORS 227.178, the city will reach a final decision on an application within one hundred twenty calendar days from the date that the application is determined to be or deemed complete unless the applicant agrees to suspend the one hundred twenty calendar day time line or unless State law provides otherwise. The one hundred twenty-day period, however, does not apply in the following situations: 
1.  Any hearing continuance or other process delay requested by the applicant shall be deemed an extension or waiver, as appropriate, of the one hundred twenty-day period. 
2.  Any delay in the decision-making process necessitated because the applicant provided an incomplete set of mailing labels for the record property owners within three hundred feet of the subject property shall extend the one hundred twenty-day period for the amount of time required to correct the notice defect. 
3.  The one hundred twenty-day period does not apply to any application for a permit that is not wholly within the city's authority and control. 
4.  The one hundred twenty-day period does not apply to any application for an amendment to the city's comprehensive plan or land use regulations nor to any application for a permit, the approval of which depends upon a plan amendment. 
D.  The one hundred twenty-day period specified in Section 17.50.070C. may be extended for a specified period of time at the written request of the applicant. The total of all extensions may not exceed two hundred forty-five calendar days. 
E.  The approval standards that control the city's review and decision on a complete application are those which were in effect on the date the application was first submitted. 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009; Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010)

New notice of a continued hearing need not be given so long as a time-certain and location is established for the continued hearing. Similarly, hearing may be closed but the record kept open for the submission of additional written material or other documents and exhibits. The chairperson may limit the factual and legal issues that may be addressed in any continued hearing or open record period.

(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009; Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010) 
17.50.140 - Performance guarantees. 
    When conditions of permit approval require a permitee to construct certain improvements, the city may, in its discretion, allow the permitee to submit a performance guarantee in lieu of actual construction of the improvement. Performance guarantees shall be governed by this section. 
A.  Form of Guarantee. Performance guarantees shall be in a form approved by the city attorney approvable methods of performance guarantee include irrevocable standby letters of credit to the benefit of the city issued by a recognized lending institution, certified checks, dedicated bank accounts or allocations of construction loans held in reserve by the lending institution for the benefit of the city. The form of guarantee shall be specified by the city engineer and, prior to execution and acceptance by the city shall be reviewed and approved by the city attorney. The guarantee shall be filed with the city engineer. 
B.  Timing of Gurantee. A permittee shall be required to provide a performance guarantee as follows. 
1.  After Final Approved Design By The City: A permitee may request the option of submitting a performance guarantee when prepared for temporary/final occupancy. The guarantee shall be one hundred twenty percent of the estimated cost of constructing the remaining public improvements as submitted by the permittee's engineer. The engineer's estimated costs shall be supported by a verified engineering estimate and approved by the city engineer. 
2.  Before Complete Design Approval And Established Engineered Cost Estimate: A permitee may request the option of submitting a performance guarantee before public improvements are designed and completed. The guarantee shall be one hundred fifty percent of the estimated cost of constructing the public improvements as submitted by the permittee's engineer and approved by the city engineer. The engineer's estimated costs shall be supported by a verified engineering estimate and approved by the city engineer. This scenario applies for a fee-in-lieu situation to ensure adequate funds for the future work involved in design, bid, contracting, and construction management and contract closeout. In this case, the fee-in-lieu must be submitted as cash, certified check, or other negotiable instrument as approved to form by the city attorney. 
C.  Duration of the Guarantee. The guarantee shall remain in effect until the improvement is actually constructed and accepted by the city. Once the city has inspected and accepted the improvement, the city shall release the guarantee to the permittee. If the improvement is not completed to the city's satisfaction within the time limits specified in the permit approval, the city engineer may, at their discretion, draw upon the guarantee and use the proceeds to construct or complete construction of the improvement and for any related administrative and legal costs incurred by the city in completing the construction, including any costs incurred in attempting to have the permittee complete the improvement. Once constructed and approved by the city, any remaining funds shall be refunded to the permittee. The city shall not allow a permittee to defer construction of improvements by using a performance guarantee, unless the permittee agrees to construct those improvements upon written notification by the city, or at some other mutually agreed-to time. If the permittee fails to commence construction of the required improvements within six months of being instructed to do so, the city may, without further notice, undertake the construction of the improvements and draw upon the permittee's performance guarantee to pay those costs. 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009; Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010) 
17.50.150 - Covenant with the city. 
A.  The city may impose as a condition of final approval of a quasi-judicial permit, the requirement that the applicant execute a covenant with the city agreeing to comply with all conditions of approval. Any such covenant shall include the following elements: 
1.  An agreement that the applicant will comply with all applicable code requirements, conditions of approval and any representations made to the city by the applicant or the applicant's agents during the application review process, in writing. This commitment shall be binding on the applicant and all of the applicant's successors, heirs and assigns; 
2.  If the owner fails to perform under the covenant, the city may immediately institute revocation of the approval or any other enforcement action available under state law or this code. The covenant may also provide for payment of attorney fees and other costs associated with any such enforcement action; and 
3.  Where the development rights of one site are dependent on the performance of conditions by the owner of another property (such as joint access), the covenants are judicially enforceable by the owner of one site against the owner of another. 
B.  Adopting the covenant: The form of all covenants shall be approved by the city attorney. The covenant shall run with the land and shall be placed in the county deed records prior to the issuance of any permits or development activity pursuant to the approval. Proof of recording shall be made prior to the issuance of any permits and filed with the planning division. Recording shall be at the applicant's expense. Any covenant required under this section shall be properly signed and executed within thirty days after permit approval with conditions; provided, however, that the community development director may grant reasonable extensions, not to exceed an additional thirty days, in cases of practical difficulty. Failure to sign and record the covenant within the prescribed period shall require a new application for any use of the subject property. 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009; Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010) 
17.50.160 - Ex parte contact, conflict of interest and bias. 
    The following rules shall govern any challenges to a decision-maker's participation in a quasi-judicial or legislative action: 
A.  Ex parte Contacts. Any factual information obtained by a decision-maker outside the context of a quasi-judicial hearing shall be deemed an ex parte contact. Prior to the close of the record in any particular matter, any decision-maker that has obtained any materially factual information through an ex parte contact shall declare the content of that contact and allow any interested party to rebut the substance of that contact. This rule does not apply to legislative proceedings. 
B.  Conflict of Interest. Whenever a decision-maker, or any member of a decision-maker's immediate family or household, has a financial interest in the outcome of a particular quasi-judicial or legislative matter, that decision-maker shall not participate in the deliberation or decision on that matter. 
C.  Bias. All decisions in quasi-judicial matters shall be fair, impartial and based on the applicable approval standards and the evidence in the record. Any decision-maker who is unable to render a decision on this basis in any particular matter shall refrain from participating in the deliberation or decision on that matter. This rule does not apply to legislative proceedings. 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009; Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010) 
17.50.170 - Legislative hearing process. 
A.  Purpose. Legislative actions involve the adoption or amendment of the city's land use regulations, comprehensive plan, maps, inventories and other policy documents that affect the entire city or large portions of it. Legislative actions which affect land use must begin with a public hearing before the planning commission. 
B.  Planning Commission Review. 
1.  Hearing Required. The planning commission shall hold at least one public hearing before recommending action on a legislative proposal. Any interested person may appear and provide written or oral testimony on the proposal at or prior to the hearing. The community development director shall notify the Oregon Department of Land Conservation and Development (DLCD) as required by the post-acknowledgment procedures of ORS 197.610 to 197.625, as applicable. 
2.  The community development director's Report. Once the planning commission hearing has been scheduled and noticed in accordance with Section 17.50.090(C) and any other applicable laws, the community development director shall prepare and make available a report on the legislative proposal at least seven days prior to the hearing. 
3.  Planning Commission Recommendation. At the conclusion of the hearing, the planning commission shall adopt a recommendation on the proposal to the city commission. The planning commission shall make a report and recommendation to the city commission on all legislative proposals. If the planning commission recommends adoption of some form of the proposal, the planning commission shall prepare and forward to the city commission a report and recommendation to that effect. 
C.  City Commission Review. 
1.  City Commission Action. Upon a recommendation from the planning commission on a legislative action, the city commission shall hold at least one public hearing on the proposal. Any interested person may provide written or oral testimony on the proposal at or prior to the hearing. At the conclusion of the hearing, the city commission may adopt, modify or reject the legislative proposal, or it may remand the matter to the planning commission for further consideration. If the decision is to adopt at least some form of the proposal, and thereby amend the city's land use regulations, comprehensive plan, official zoning maps or some component of any of these documents, the city commission decision shall be enacted as an ordinance. 
2.  Notice of Final Decision. Not later than five days following the city commission final decision, the community development director shall mail notice of the decision to DLCD in accordance with ORS 197.615(2). 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009; Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010) 
17.50.180 - Objections to procedure. 
    Any party who objects to the procedure followed in any particular matter, including bias, conflict of interest and undisclosed ex parte contacts, must make a procedural objection prior to the city rendering a final decision. Procedural objections may be raised at any time prior to a final decision, after which they are deemed waived. In making a procedural objection, the objecting party must identify the procedural requirement that was not properly followed and identify how the alleged procedural error harmed that person's substantial rights. 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009; Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010) 
17.50.190 - Appeals. 
    Appeals of any non-final decisions by the city must comply with the requirements of this section. 
A.  Type I decisions by the planning manager are not appealable to any other decision-maker within the city. 
B.  A notice of appeal of any Type II, III or IV decision must be received in writing by the planning division within fourteen calendar days from the date notice of the challenged decision is provided to those entitled to notice. Late filing of any appeal shall be deemed a jurisdictional defect and will result in the automatic rejection of any appeal so filed. 
C.  The following must be included as part of the notice of appeal: 
1.  The city planning file number and date the decision to be appealed was rendered; 
2.  The name, mailing address and daytime telephone number for each appellant; 
3.  A statement of how each appellant has an interest in the matter and standing to appeal; 
4.  A statement of the specific grounds for the appeal; 
5.  The appropriate appeal fee. Failure to include the appeal fee within appeal period is deemed to be a jurisdictional defect and will result in the automatic rejection of any appeal so filed. If a city-recognized neighborhood association with standing to appeal has voted to request a fee waiver pursuant to Section 17.50.290C., no appeal fee shall be required for an appeal filed by that association. In lieu of the appeal fee, the neighborhood association shall provide a duly adopted resolution of the general membership or board approving the request for fee waiver. 
D.  Standing to Appeal. The following rules prescribe who has standing to appeal: 
1.  For Type II decisions, only those persons or recognized neighborhood associations who submitted comments in writing before the expiration of the comment period have standing to appeal a planning manager decision. Review by the city commission shall be on the record, limited to the issues raised in the comments and no new evidence shall be considered. 
2.  For Type III and IV decisions, only those persons or recognized neighborhood associations who have participated either orally or in writing have standing to appeal the decision of the planning commission or historic review board, as applicable. Grounds for appeal are limited to those issues raised either orally or in writing before the close of the public record. No new evidence shall be allowed. 
E.  Notice of the Appeal Hearing.

17.50.200 - Expiration of an approval. 
A.  When approvals become void: All Type I-IV approvals, except for zone changes, comprehensive plan map amendments, conditional uses and master plans automatically become void if any of the following events occur: 
1.  If, within two years of the date of the final decision, a building permit has not been issued. 
2.  If, within two years of the date of the final decision for all land divisions, the activity approved in the permit has not commenced or, in situations involving only the creation of lots, the public improvements and conditions of approval have not been completed or financial guarantee (surety) provided. 
3.  Annexations become void if a vote of the citizens rejects the application. 
B.  New application required: Expiration of an approval shall require a new application for any use on the subject property that is not otherwise allowed outright. 
C.  Deferral of the expiration period due to appeals: If a permit decision is appealed beyond the jurisdiction of the city, the expiration period shall not begin until review before the land use board of appeals and the appellate courts has been completed, including any remand proceedings before the city. The expiration period provided for in this section will begin to run on the date of final disposition of the case (the date when an appeal may no longer be filed). 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009; Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010) 
17.50.210 - Extension of an approval. 
A.  The community development director may extend, prior to its expiration, any approved permit for a period of one year- provided- that the applicant has provided evidence of implementation of the permit. Any request for an extension shall be reviewed and decided upon by the community development director as a Type I- decision. 
B.  Substantial implementation of a permit shall require at a minimum, demonstrable evidence in a written application showing: 
1.  The permit holder has applied for the permits required as a condition of the land use or limited land use permit; 
2.  The request for an extension is not sought for purposes of avoiding any responsibility imposed by this code or the permit or any condition thereunder; and 
3.  There have been no changes in circumstances or the law likely to necessitate significant modifications of the development approval or conditions of approval. 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009; Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010) 
17.50.220 - Reapplication limited. 
    If the application is denied or withdrawn following the close of the public hearing, no reapplication for the same or substantially similar proposal may be made for one year following the date of final decision denying the permit. 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009; Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010) 
17.50.230 - Interpretation. 
    Where a provision of Title 16 or Title 17 conflicts with another city ordinance or requirement, the provision or requirement that is more restrictive or specific shall control. 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009; Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010) 
17.50.240 - Conformity of permits. 
    The city shall not accept any application for a permit, certificate or other approval, including building permit applications, for any property that is not in full compliance with all applicable provisions of Title 16 and Title 17 and any permit approvals previously issued by the city. 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009; Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010) 
17.50.260 - Reconsideration of a final decision. 
    Under this section, parties with standing may seek reconsideration of a final decision rendered pursuant to a Type II, Type III, or Type IV process. Reconsideration is warranted where the city's decision indicates the decision-maker failed to understand or consider certain relevant facts in the record or misinterpreted the application in some material way. Any request for reconsideration must be received by the planning division within ten days of when the decision in question was rendered and must specifically describe the alleged misunderstanding or misinterpretation. A request for reconsideration shall not stay the effectiveness of the city's final decision, nor shall it affect any applicable appeal deadlines to the land use board of appeals. If the request is granted, the community development director shall notify all affected parties that the decision will be reconsidered. Any request for reconsideration by the applicant shall be deemed a waiver of the one hundred-twenty-day deadline under Section 17.50.070. 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009; Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010) 
17.50.270 - Revocation of a previously approved permit. 
    In the event an applicant, or the applicant's successor in interest, fails to fully comply with all conditions of permit approval or otherwise does not comply fully with the city's approval, the city may institute a revocation or modification proceeding under this section. 
A.  Situations when Permit Approvals May Be Revoked or Modified. All quasi-judicial permits may be revoked or modified if the planning commission determines a substantial likelihood that any of the following situations exists: 
1.  One or more conditions of the approval have not been implemented or have been violated; 
2.  The activities of the use, or the use itself, are substantially different from what was approved; or 
3.  The use is subject to the nonconforming use regulations, the applicant has not obtained approval, and has substantially changed its activities or substantially increased the intensity of its operations since the use became nonconforming. 
B.  Process for Revocation and Modification. Revocation or modification shall be processed as a Type IV decision. The planning division or any private complaining party shall have the burden of proving, based on substantial evidence in the whole record, that the applicant or the applicant's successor has in some way violated the city's approval. 
C.  Possible Actions at the Revocation Hearing. Depending on the situation, the planning commission may take any of the actions described below. The planning commission may not approve the new use or a use that is more intense than originally approved unless the possibility of this change has been stated in the public notice. Uses or development which are alleged to have not fulfilled conditions, violate conditions or the use is not consistent with the city's approval may be subject to the following actions: 
1.  The planning commission may find that the use or development is complying with the conditions of the approval. In this case, the use or development shall be allowed to continue. 
2.  The planning commission may modify the approval if it finds that the use or development does not meet the standards for revocation and that the use can comply with the original approval criteria if certain conditions are met. In this case, the planning commission may modify the existing conditions, add new conditions to ensure compliance with the approval criteria, or refer the case to the code compliance officer for enforcement of the existing conditions. 
3.  The planning commission may revoke the approval if it finds there are substantial violations of conditions or failure to implement conditions of prior land use decisions, such that the original approval criteria for the use or development are not being met. 
D.  Effect of Revocation. In the event permit approval is revoked, the use or development becomes illegal. The use or development shall be terminated within thirty days of the date the revocation final order is approved by the planning commission, unless the decision provides otherwise. In the event the decision-maker's decision on a revocation request is appealed, the revocation action shall be stayed pending a final, unappealed decision. 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009; Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010) 
17.50.280 - Transfer of approval rights. 
    Unless otherwise stated in the city's permit decision, any approval granted under Title 16 or Title 17 of this code runs with the land and is transferred with ownership of the land. Any conditions, time limits or other restrictions imposed with a permit approval shall bind all subsequent owners of the property for which the permit was granted. 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009; Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010) 
17.50.290 - Fees. 
    The city may adopt by resolution, and revise from time to time, a schedule of fees for applications and appeals. Fees shall be based upon the city's actual or average cost of processing the application or conducting the appeal process. The only exception shall be the appeal fee for a Type II decision, which shall be limited by ORS 227.175.10.b. The requirements of this section shall govern the payment, refund and reimbursement of fees. 
A.  Payment. All fees shall be due and payable at the time the application or appeal is submitted. No application or appeal shall be accepted without the proper fee being paid. 
B.  Refunds. Fees will only be refunded as provided in this subsection: 
1.  When a fee is paid for an application which is later found to not be required, the city shall refund the fee. 
2.  Errors. When an error is made in calculating a fee, overpayment will be refunded. 
3.  Refund upon Withdrawal of an Application. In the event an applicant withdraws an application, the planning department shall refund the unused portion of the fee. In this case, the planning department will deduct from the fee the city's actual costs incurred in processing the application prior to withdrawal. 
C.  Fee Waivers. The planning division may waive all or any portion of an application fee if, in the opinion of the director, a particular application must be resubmitted because of an error made by the city. Appeal fees may be waived, wholly or in part, by the city commission, if the city commission finds that, considering fairness to the applicant and to opposing parties, a full or partial waiver of the appeal fee is warranted. Appeal fees shall not be charged for an appeal filed by a city-recognized neighborhood association, so long as the appeal has been officially approved by the general membership or board of the neighborhood association at a duly announced meeting. 
D.  Major Projects. The fees for a major project shall be the city's actual costs, which shall include, but not be limited to, the actual costs for staff time, as well as any consultants, including contract planners, attorneys and engineers. The costs of major projects will not be included in any average used to establish other fees under this section. For purposes of this subsection only, a "major project" is defined to include any combined plan and zone change and any project with an estimated construction cost over one million dollars.

17.52.010 - Applicability. 
    The construction of a new structure or parking lot, or alterations to the size or use of an existing structure, parking lot or property use shall require site plan review approval and compliance with this chapter. This chapter does not apply to single- and two-family residential dwellings. 
(Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010) 
17.52.015 - Planning commission adjustment of parking standards. 
A.  Purpose: The purpose of permitting a planning commission adjustment to parking standards is to provide for flexibility in modifying parking standards in all zoning districts, without permitting an adjustment that would adversely impact the surrounding or planned neighborhood. The purpose of an adjustment is to provide flexibility to those uses which may be extraordinary, unique or to provide greater flexibility for areas that can accommodate a denser development pattern based on existing infrastructure and ability to access the site by means of walking, biking or transit. An adjustment to a minimum or maximum parking standard may be approved based on a determination by the planning commission that the adjustment is consistent with the purpose of this Code, and the approval criteria can be met. 
B.  Procedure: A request for a planning commission parking adjustment shall be initiated by a property owner or authorized agent by filing a land use application. The application shall be accompanied by a site plan, drawn to scale, showing the dimensions and arrangement of the proposed development and parking plan, the extent of the adjustment requested along with findings for each applicable approval criteria. A request for a parking adjustment shall be processed as a Type III application as set forth in Chapter 17.50. 
C.  Approval criteria for the adjustment are as follows: 
1.  Documentation: The applicant shall document that the individual project will require an amount of parking that is different from that required after all applicable reductions have been taken. 
2.  Parking analysis for surrounding uses and on-street parking availability: The applicant must show that there is a continued fifteen percent parking vacancy in the area adjacent to the use during peak parking periods and that the applicant has permission to occupy this area to serve the use pursuant to the procedures set forth by the community development director. 
a.  For the purposes of demonstrating the availability of on street parking as defined in [Section] 17.52.020.B.3., the applicant shall undertake a parking study during time periods specified by the community development director. The time periods shall include those during which the highest parking demand is anticipated by the proposed use. Multiple observations during multiple days shall be required. Distances are to be calculated as traversed by a pedestrian that utilizes sidewalks and legal crosswalks or an alternative manner as accepted by the community development director. 
b.  The onsite parking requirements may be reduced based on the parking vacancy identified in the parking study. The amount of the reduction in onsite parking shall be calculated as follows: 
i.  Vacant on-street parking spaces within three hundred feet of the site will reduce onsite parking requirements by 0.5 parking spaces; and 
ii.  Vacant on-street parking spaces between three hundred and six hundred feet of the [site] will reduce onsite parking requirements by 0.2 parking spaces. 
3.  Function and Use of Site: The applicant shall demonstrate that modifying the amount of required parking spaces will not significantly impact the use or function of the site and/or adjacent sites. 
4.  Compatibility: The proposal is compatible with the character, scale and existing or planned uses of the surrounding neighborhood. 
5.  Safety: The proposal does not significantly impact the safety of adjacent properties and rights-of-way. 
6.  Services: The proposal will not create a significant impact to public services, including fire and emergency services. 
(Ord. No. 13-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-17-2013) 
17.52.020 - Number of automobile spaces required. 
A.  The number of parking spaces shall comply with the minimum and maximum standards listed in Table 17.52.020. The parking requirements are based on spaces per one thousand square feet net leasable area unless otherwise stated. 
Table 17.52.020 LAND USE PARKING REQUIREMENTS MINIMUM MAXIMUM MINIMUM MAXIMUM Multi-Family: Studio 1.00 per unit 1.5 per unit Multi-Family: 1 bedroom 1.25 per unit 2.00 per unit Multi-Family: 2 bedroom 1.5 per unit 2.00 per unit Multi-Family: 3 bedroom 1.75 per unit 2.50 per unit Hotel, Motel 1.0 per guest room 1.25 per guest room Correctional Institution 1 per 7 beds 1 per 5 beds Senior housing, including congregate care, residential care and assisted living facilities; nursing homes and other types of group homes 1 per 7 beds 1 per 5 beds Hospital 2.00 4.00 Preschool Nursery/Kindergarten 2.00 3.00 Elementary/Middle School 1 per classroom 1 per classroom + 1 per administrative employee + 0.25 per seat in auditorium/assembly room/stadium High School, College, Commercial School for Adults 0.20 per # staff and students 0.30 per # staff and students Auditorium, Meeting Room, Stadium, Religious Assembly Building, movie theater, .25 per seat 0.5 per seat Retail Store, Shopping Center, Restaurants 4.10 5.00 Office 2.70 3.33 Medical or Dental Clinic 2.70 3.33 Sports Club, Recreation Facilities Case Specific 5.40 Storage Warehouse, Freight Terminal 0.30 0.40 Manufacturing, Wholesale Establishment 1.60 1.67 Light Industrial, Industrial Park 1.3 1.60  
1.  Multiple Uses. In the event several uses occupy a single structure or parcel of land, the total requirements for off-street parking shall be the sum of the requirements of the several uses computed separately. 
2.  Requirements for types of buildings and uses not specifically listed herein shall be determined by the community development director, based upon the requirements of comparable uses listed. 
3.  Where calculation in accordance with the above list results in a fractional space, any fraction less than one-half shall be disregarded and any fraction of one-half or more shall require one space. 
4.  The minimum required parking spaces shall be available for the parking of operable passenger automobiles of residents, customers, patrons and employees only, and shall not be used for storage of vehicles or materials or for the parking of vehicles used in conducting the business or use. 
5.  A change in use within an existing habitable building located in the MUD Design District or the Willamette Falls Downtown District is exempt from additional parking requirements. Additions to an existing building and new construction are required to meet the minimum parking requirements for the areas as specified in Table 17.52.020 for the increased square footage. 
B.  Parking requirements can be met either onsite, or offsite by meeting the following conditions: 
1.  Mixed Uses. If more than one type of land use occupies a single structure or parcel of land, the total requirements for off-street automobile parking shall be the sum of the requirements for all uses, unless it can be shown that the peak parking demands are actually less (e.g. the uses operate on different days or at different times of the day). In that case, the total requirements shall be reduced accordingly, up to a maximum reduction of fifty percent, as determined by the community development director. 
2.  Shared Parking. Required parking facilities for two or more uses, structures, or parcels of land may be satisfied by the same parking facilities used jointly, to the extent that the owners or operators show that the need for parking facilities does not materially overlay (e.g., uses primarily of a daytime versus nighttime nature), that the shared parking facility is within one thousand feet of the potential uses, and provided that the right of joint use is evidenced by a recorded deed, lease, contract, or similar written instrument authorizing the joint use. 
3.  On-Street Parking. On-street parking may be counted toward the minimum standards when it is on the street face abutting the subject land use. An on-street parking space must not obstruct a required clear vision area and it shall not violate any law or street standard. On-street parking for commercial uses shall conform to the following standards: 
a.  Dimensions. The following constitutes one on-street parking space: 
1.  Parallel parking, each [twenty-two] feet of uninterrupted and available curb; 
2.  [Forty-five/sixty] degree diagonal, each with [fifteen] feet of curb; 
3.  Ninety degree (perpendicular) parking, each with [twelve] feet of curb. 
4.  Public Use Required for Credit. On-street parking spaces counted toward meeting the parking requirements of a specific use may not be used exclusively by that use, but shall be available for general public use at all times. Signs or other actions that limit general public use of on-street spaces are prohibited. 
C.  Reduction of the Number of Automobile Spaces Required. The required number of parking stalls may be reduced in the Downtown Parking Overlay District: Fifty percent reduction in the minimum number of spaces required is allowed prior to seeking further reductions in [sub]sections 2. and 3. below: 
1.  Transit Oriented Development. For projects not located within the Downtown Parking Overlay District, the community development director may reduce the required number of parking stalls up to twenty-five percent when it is determined that a project in a commercial center (sixty thousand square feet or greater of retail or office use measured cumulatively within a five hundred-foot radius) or multi-family development with over eighty units, is adjacent to or within one thousand three hundred twenty feet of an existing or planned public transit street and is within one thousand three hundred twenty feet of the opposite use (commercial center or multi-family development with over eighty units). 
2.  Reduction in Parking for Tree Preservation. The community development director may grant an adjustment to any standard of this requirement provided that the adjustment preserves a regulated tree or grove so that the reduction in the amount of required pavement can help preserve existing healthy trees in an undisturbed, natural condition. The amount of reduction must take into consideration any unique site conditions and the impact of the reduction on parking needs for the use, and must be approved by the community development director. This reduction is discretionary. 
3.  Transportation Demand Management. The community development director may reduce the required number of parking stalls up to twenty-five percent when a parking-traffic study prepared by a traffic engineer demonstrates: 
a.  Alternative modes of transportation, including transit, bicycles, and walking, and/or special characteristics of the customer, client, employee or resident population will reduce expected vehicle use and parking space demand for this development, as compared to standard Institute of Transportation Engineers vehicle trip generation rates and further that the transportation demand management program promotes or achieves parking utilization lower than minimum city parking requirements. 
b.  Transportation demand management (TDM) program has been developed for approval by, and is approved by the city engineer. The plan will contain strategies for reducing vehicle use and parking demand generated by the development and will be measured annually. If, at the annual assessment, the city determines the plan is not successful, the plan may be revised. If the city determines that no good-faith effort has been made to implement the plan, the city may take enforcement actions. 
4.  The minimum required number of stalls may be reduced by up to ten percent when the subject property is adjacent to an existing or planned fixed public transit route or within one thousand feet of an existing or planned transit stop.

17.52.030 - Standards for automobile parking. 
A.  Access. Ingress and egress locations on public thoroughfares shall be located in the interests of public traffic safety. Groups of more than four parking spaces shall be so located and served by driveways so that their use will require no backing movements or other maneuvering within a street right-of-way other than an alley. No driveway with a slope of greater than fifteen percent shall be permitted without approval of the city engineer. 
B.  Surfacing. Required off-street parking spaces and access aisles shall have paved surfaces adequately maintained. The use of pervious asphalt/concrete and alternative designs that reduce storm water runoff and improve water quality pursuant to the city's stormwater and low impact development design standards are encouraged. 
C.  Drainage. Drainage shall be designed in accordance with the requirements of Chapter 13.12 and the city public works stormwater and grading design standards. 
D.  Dimensional Standards. 
1.  Requirements for parking developed at varying angles are according to the table included in this section. A parking space shall not be less than seven feet in height when within a building or structure, and shall have access by an all-weather surface to a street or alley. Parking stalls in compliance with the American with Disabilities Act may vary in size in order to comply with the building division requirements. Up to thirty-five percent of the minimum required parking may be compact, while the remaining required parking stalls are designed to standard dimensions. The community development director may approve alternative dimensions for parking stalls in excess of the minimum requirement which comply with the intent of this chapter. 
2.  Alternative parking/plan. Any applicant may propose an alternative parking plan. Such plans are often proposed to address physically constrained or smaller sites, however innovative designs for larger sites may also be considered. In such situations, the community development director may approve an alternative parking lot plan with variations to parking dimensions of this section. The alternative shall be consistent with the intent of this chapter and shall create a safe space for automobiles and pedestrians while providing landscaping to the quantity and quality found within parking lot landscaping requirements.

17.54.090 - Accessory dwelling units. 
    An accessory dwelling unit (ADU) is defined as a self-contained residential dwelling unit located on the same lot as a single-family dwelling, but is not a recreational vehicle. The habitable living unit provides basic living requirements including permanent cooking, and toilet facilities. It may be located either within the same building as the single-family dwelling unit or in a detached building. 
A.  The purpose of allowing an ADU is to: 
1.  Provide homeowners with a means of obtaining, through tenants in the ADU or the principal dwelling unit, rental income, companionship, security, and services. 
2.  Add affordable housing units to the existing housing inventory. 
3.  Make housing units available to moderate-income people who might otherwise have difficulty finding homes within the city. 
4.  Develop housing units in single-family neighborhoods that are appropriate for people at a variety of stages in the life cycle. 
5.  Protect neighborhood stability, property values, and the single-family residential appearance of the neighborhood by ensuring that ADUs are installed under the conditions of this Section. 
B.  Standards and Criteria. 
An ADU shall meet the following standards and criteria: 
1.  The design and size of the ADU shall conform to all applicable standards in the building, plumbing, electrical, mechanical, fire, health, and any other applicable codes. 
2.  Any additions to the existing dwelling unit shall not encroach into the existing setbacks in the underlying zone. However, access structures (e.g. stairs or ramps) may be allowed within the setback if no access can be provided to the unit without encroaching into the setback area. 
3.  The ADU may be attached to, or detached from, the principal dwelling unit. 
4.  Only one ADU may be created per lot or parcel. 
5.  The installation of an ADU shall be allowed in single-family zones subject to the specific development, design, and owner-occupancy standards in this section. ADUs are not permitted on the same lot as a nonconforming use. 
6.  The ADU shall not exceed the height of the principal dwelling unit. 
7.  The property owner, which shall include title holders and contract purchasers, must occupy either the principal dwelling unit or the ADU as their permanent residence, for at least seven months out of the year, and at no time receive rent for the owner-occupied unit. 
8.  In no case shall an ADU: 
a.  Be more than forty percent of the principal dwelling unit's total floor area; nor 
b.  Be more than eight hundred square feet; nor 
c.  Be less than three hundred square feet; nor 
d.  Have more than two sleeping areas. 
9.  Detached ADUs: 
a.  Shall comply with the requirements OCMC Chapter 17.54.010 - Accessory Buildings and Uses including building footprint, height, placement, exterior building materials, etc. 
b.  In the historic overlay district pursuant to OCMC Chapter 17.40, shall be subject to the Design Guidelines for New Construction in Historic Districts. 
10.  The ADU shall be compatible with the principal dwelling unit, specifically in: 
a.  Exterior finish materials. 
1.  The exterior finish material must be the same as the principal dwelling unit; or 
2.  Visually match in type, size and placement the exterior finish material of the principal dwelling unit. 
b.  Trim must be the same in type, size, and location as the trim used on the principal dwelling unit. 
c.  Windows must match those in the principal dwelling unit in proportion (relationship of width to height) and orientation (horizontal or vertical). 
d.  Eaves must project from the building walls at the same proportion as the eaves on the principal dwelling unit. 
11.  Parking.

(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009; Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010; Ord. No. 13-1017, § 1(Exh. 1), 4-16-2014) 
17.54.105 - Live/work units. 
    Live/work units provide important flexibility by combining residential and commercial uses and allowing for commercial uses on the ground floor when the market is ready to support them. These standards apply to all new live/work units. Live/work units that conform to the standards will be approved as a Type II decision and a live/work permit will be granted for the property. For all zones where live/work units are permitted, the following standards shall apply. Conditions of approval may be implemented to ensure compliance with the standards through a Type II process. 
A.  The ground floor business shall provide visibility, signage and access from the primary street. The building in which the live/work dwelling is located shall architecturally differentiate the ground floor commercial/office space from the rest of the building by meeting the following requirements: 
1.  The main front elevation shall provide at least fifty percent transparency at the pedestrian level through the use of a storefront window system. The transparency is measured in lineal fashion (for example, a twenty-five-foot long building elevation shall have at least twelve and one-half feet (fifty percent of twenty-five feet) of transparency in length). 
2.  Windows shall begin thirteen to thirty inches above the sidewalk rather than continue down to street level. Large single paned windows over ten feet in width shall be divided into multiple panes to add human scale by dividing the vertical plane into smaller parts.

The business portion of the dwelling shall be limited to the ground floor and may not exceed fifty percent of the square footage of the entire dwelling, excluding the garage, or one thousand square feet, whichever is the smaller number. 
C.  The primary entrance to the business must be located on the primary street frontage. Alley access is required to provide refuse and recycling service and residential parking. If alley access cannot be provided, an alternative parking and refuse and recycling service plan may be approved by the community development director if it meets the intent of the standards. 
D.  The applicant must show that there is adequate on street or off-street parking for the proposed use. One parking space is required for every five hundred square feet of commercial, personal service, or office use or a portion thereof. For example, seven hundred square feet of commercial use requires two parking spaces. Adequate parking can be shown by meeting one of the following: 
1.  Shared Parking. Required parking may be satisfied by the same parking facilities used jointly, to the extent that the owners or operators show that the need for parking facilities does not materially overlap (e.g., uses primarily of a daytime versus nighttime nature) or the live/work use is utilizing a parking space that is above the minimum parking requirement of the shared use, and that the shared parking facility is within one thousand feet of the potential uses, and provided that the right of joint use is evidenced by a recorded deed, lease, contract, or similar written instrument establishing the joint use. 
2.  On-Street Parking. On-street parking dimensions for live/work units shall conform to the standards set forth in OCMC Section 17.52.010.C. 
3.  Onsite Parking. Parking spaces are provided onsite and meet the requirements of OCMC Chapter 17.52-Offstreet Parking and Loading.

Chapter 17.58 - LAWFUL NONCONFORMING USES, STRUCTURES AND LOTS[30] 

Footnotes: 
--- (30) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 08-1014, adopted July 1, 2009, repealed Chapter 17.58 in its entirety and enacted new provisions to read as herein set out. Prior to amendment, Chapter 17.58 pertained to Nonconforming Uses, Structures and Lots. See Ordinance Disposition List for derivation. 

17.58.010 - Purpose. 
    Nonconforming situations are created when the application of zoning district to a site changes or the zoning regulations change. As part of the change, existing uses, density, or development might no longer be allowed or are further restricted. Nonconforming uses, structures and lots are those uses, structures and lots that were lawfully established but do not conform to the provisions of this title or the provisions of the zoning district in which the use, structure or lot is located. The intent of these provisions is not to force all nonconforming situations immediately to be brought into conformance. Instead, the intent is to guide nonconforming situations in a new direction consistent with city policy, and, eventually, bring them into conformance. 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009) 
17.58.015 - Applicability. 
    The regulations of this chapter apply only to those nonconforming situations that were lawfully established or that were approved through a land use decision. All nonconforming structures, uses or lots shall have been maintained over time. These situations have lawful nonconforming status. Nonconforming situations that were not allowed when established or have not been maintained over time have no lawful right to continue. 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009) 
17.58.020 - Lawful nonconforming lots of record. 
    Lots or parcels lawfully created but which do not now conform to the legal lot standards in this land use code may be occupied by uses otherwise permitted if those uses comply with all other provisions of this land use code. 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009) 
17.58.030 - Lawful nonconforming use. 
    A use that was lawfully established on a particular development site but that no longer complies with the allowed uses or the standards for those uses in this title may be considered a lawful nonconforming use. Change of ownership, tenancy, or management of a lawfully established nonconforming use shall not affect its lawful nonconforming status. The continuation of a lawful nonconforming use is subject to the following: 
A.  Discontinuance. If a lawful nonconforming use is discontinued for a period of one year, it shall lose its lawful nonconforming status and the use of the property thereafter shall conform with the existing provisions of this title. If a nonconforming use ceases operations, even if the structure or materials related to the use remain, the use shall be deemed to have been discontinued. 
B.  Conformance. If a lawful nonconforming use is converted to a conforming use, no nonconforming use may be resumed. 
C.  Destruction of a Non-residential Use. When a structure containing a lawful nonconforming non-residential use is damaged by fire or other causes, the re-establishment of the nonconforming use shall be prohibited if the repair cost of the structure is more then sixty percent of its assessed value. 
D.  Destruction of a Residential Use. When a structure containing a lawful nonconforming residential use is damaged by fire or other causes, the re-establishment of the nonconforming use shall be permitted. 
E.  Intentional Destruction. When a structure containing a nonconforming use is removed or intentionally damaged by fire or other causes within the control of the owner, the re-establishment of the nonconforming use shall be prohibited. 
F.  Expansion. No lawful nonconforming use may be replaced by a different type of nonconforming use, nor may any legal nonconforming use be expanded or intensified. 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009) 
17.58.040 - Lawful nonconforming structure or site. 
    A structure or site that was lawfully established but no longer conforms to all development standards of this land use code (such as setbacks) shall be considered lawfully nonconforming. Notwithstanding development standard requirements in this code, minor repairs and routine maintenance of a lawful nonconforming structure are permitted. The continuation of a lawful nonconforming structure or site is subject to the following: 
A.  Accidental Destruction. When a nonconforming structure is damaged by fire or other causes, the structure may be rebuilt using the same structure footprint. 
B.  Intentional Destruction. When a nonconforming structure is removed or intentionally damaged by fire or other causes within the control of the owner, the replacement structure shall comply with the development standards of this title. 
C.  Expansion. An expansion of a lawful nonconforming structure or site may be approved, conditionally approved or denied in accordance with the standards and procedures of this section. 
1.  In making a determination on such applications, the decision maker shall weigh the proposal's positive and negative features and the public convenience or necessity to be served against any adverse conditions that would result from authorizing the particular development at the location proposed, and, to approve such expansion, it must be found that the criteria identified in Section 17.58.060 have either been met, can be met by observance of conditions, or are not applicable. 
2.  Increases in the square footage of a building and/or site improvements which include installation of any additional off-street parking stalls that exceed the threshold of subparagraph C.2.a. below shall comply with the development standards listed in subparagraph C.2.b. The value of the alterations and improvements is based on the entire project and not individual building permits. 
a.  Thresholds Triggering Compliance. The standards of subparagraph C.2.b. below shall be met when the value of the increase in square footage of a building and/or increase in off-street parking stalls, as determined by the community development director, is more than seventy-five thousand dollars. The following alterations and improvements shall not be included in the threshold calculation: 
1.  Proposed alterations to meet approved fire and life safety agreements; 
2.  Alterations related to the removal of existing architectural barriers, as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act, or as specified in Section 1113 of the Oregon Structural Specialty Code; 
3.  Alterations required to meet Seismic Design Requirements; and 
4.  Improvements to on-site stormwater management facilities in conformance with Oregon City Stormwater Design Standards. 
b.  Standards that shall be met. Developments not complying with the development standards listed below shall be brought into conformance. 
1.  Pedestrian circulation systems, as set out in the pedestrian standards that apply to the sites; 
2.  Minimum perimeter parking lot landscaping; 
3.  Minimum interior parking lot landscaping; 
4.  Minimum site landscaping requirements; 
5.  Bicycle parking by upgrading existing racks and providing additional spaces in order to comply with Chapter 17.52-Off-Street Parking and Loading; 
6.  Screening; and 
7.  Paving of surface parking and exterior storage and display areas. 
c.  Area of required improvements. 
1.  Generally. Except as provided in C.2.c.2. below, required improvements shall be made for the entire site. 
2.  Exception for sites with ground leases. Required improvements may be limited to a smaller area if there is a ground lease for the portion of the site where the alterations are proposed. If all of the following are met, the area of the ground lease will be considered as a separate site for purposes of required improvements. The applicant shall meet the following: 
i.  The signed ground lease - or excerpts from the lease document satisfactory to the city attorney - shall be submitted to the community development director. The portions of the lease shall include the following: 
The term of the lease. In all cases, there must be at least one year remaining on the ground lease; and 
A legal description of the boundaries of the lease. 
ii.  The boundaries of the ground lease shall be shown on the site plan submitted with the application. The area of the lease shall include all existing and any proposed development that is required for, or is used exclusively by, those uses within the area of the lease; and 
iii.  Screening shall not be required along the boundaries of ground leases that are interior to the site. 
d.  Timing and cost of required improvements. The applicant may choose one of the two following options for making the required improvements: 
1.  Option 1. Required improvements may be made as part of the alteration that triggers the required improvements. The cost of the standards that shall be met, identified in subparagraph C.2.b. above, is limited to ten percent of the value of the proposed alterations. It is the responsibility of the applicant to document to the community development director the value of the required improvements. Additional costs may be required to comply with other applicable requirements associated with the proposal. When all required improvements are not being made, the priority for the improvements shall be as listed in subparagraph C.2.b. above. 
2.  Option 2. Required improvements may be made over several years, based on the compliance period identified in Table 17.58-1 below. However, by the end of the compliance period, the site shall be brought fully into compliance with the standards listed in subparagraph C.2.b. Where this option is chosen, the following must be met: 
i.  Before a building permit is issued, the applicant shall submit the following to the community development director: 
A Nonconforming Development Assessment, which identifies in writing and on a site plan, all development that does not meet the standards listed in Subparagraph C.2.b. 
A covenant, in a form approved by the city attorney, executed by the property owner that meets the requirements of 17.50.150. The covenant shall identify development on the site that does not meet the standards listed in subparagraph C.2.b., and require the owner to bring that development fully into compliance with this title. The covenant shall also specify the date by which the owner will be in conformance. The date must be within the compliance periods set out in Table 17.58-1. 
ii.  The nonconforming development identified in the nonconforming development assessment shall be brought into full compliance with the requirements of this title within the following compliance periods. The compliance period begins when a building permit is issued for alterations to the site of more than seventy-five thousand dollars. The compliance periods are based on the size of the site (see Table 17.58-1 below). 
iii.  By the end of the compliance period, the applicant or owner shall request that the site by certified by the community development director as in compliance. If the request is not received within that time, or if the site is not fully in conformance, no additional building permits will be issued. 
iv.  If the regulations referred to by subparagraph C.2.b. are amended after the Nonconforming Development Assessment is received by the community development director, and those amendments result in development on the site that was not addressed by the Assessment becoming nonconforming, the applicant shall address the new nonconforming development using Option 1 or 2. If the applicant chooses Option 2, a separate Nonconforming Development Assessment, covenant and compliance period will be required for the new nonconforming development.

Chapter 17.62 - SITE PLAN AND DESIGN REVIEW 
[32]
Footnotes: 

17.62.010 - Purpose. 
    The purposes of site plan and design review are to: encourage site planning in advance of construction; protect lives and property from potential adverse impacts of development; consider natural or man-made hazards which may impose limitations on development; conserve the city's natural beauty and visual character and minimize adverse impacts of development on the natural environment as much as is reasonably practicable; assure that development is supported with necessary public facilities and services; ensure that structures and other improvements are properly related to their sites and to surrounding sites and structure; and implement the city's comprehensive plan and land use regulations with respect to development standards and policies. 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009; Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010) 
17.62.015 - Modifications that will better meet design review requirements. 
    The review body may consider modification of site-related development standards. These modifications are done as part of design review and are not required to go through the Variance process pursuant to section 17.60.020. Adjustments to use-related development standards (such as floor area ratios, intensity of use, size of the use, number of units, or concentration of uses) are required to go through the Variance process pursuant to section 17.60.020. Modifications that are denied through design review may be requested as Variance through the Variance process pursuant to section 17.60.020. The review body may approve requested modifications if it finds that the applicant has shown that the following approval criteria are met: 
A.  The modification will result in a development that better meets design guidelines; and 
B.  The modification meets the intent of the standard. On balance, the proposal will be consistent with the purpose of the standard for which a modification is requested. 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009; Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010) 
17.62.020 - Preapplication conference. 
    Prior to filing for site plan and design review approval, the applicant shall confer with the community development director pursuant to Section 17.50.030. The community development director shall identify and explain the relevant review procedures and standards. 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009) 
17.62.030 - When required. 
    Site plan and design review shall be required for all development of real property in all zones except the R-10, R-8, R-6, R-5 and R-3.5 zoning districts, unless otherwise provided for by this title or as a condition of approval of a permit. Site plan and design review shall also apply to all conditional uses, cottage housing development, multi-family and non-residential uses in all zones. No building permit or other permit authorization for development shall be issued prior to site plan and design review approval. Parking lots and parking areas accessory to uses regulated by this chapter also shall require site plan and design review approval. Site plan and design review shall not alter the type and category of uses permitted in zoning districts.

1.  Landscaping, A minimum of fifteen percent of the lot shall be landscaped. Existing native vegetation shall be retained to the maximum extent practicable. All plants listed on the Oregon City Nuisance Plant List shall be removed from the site prior to issuance of a final occupancy permit for the building. 
a.  Except as allowed elsewhere in the zoning and land division chapters of this Code, all areas to be credited towards landscaping must be installed with growing plant materials. A reduction of up to twenty-five percent of the overall required landscaping may be approved by the community development director if the same or greater amount of pervious material is incorporated in the non-parking lot portion of the site plan (pervious material within parking lots are regulated in OCMC 17.52.070). 
b.  Pursuant to Chapter 17.49, landscaping requirements within the Natural Resource Overlay District, other than landscaping required for parking lots, may be met by preserving, restoring and permanently protecting native vegetation and habitat on development sites. 
c.  A landscaping plan shall be prepared by a registered landscape architect for new or revised landscaped areas. Landscape architect approval is not required for tree removal and/or installation if the species are chosen from an approved street tree list. A certified landscape designer, arborist, or nurseryman shall be acceptable in lieu of a landscape architect for projects with less than five hundred square feet of landscaping. All landscape plans shall include a mix of vertical (trees and shrubs) and horizontal elements (grass, groundcover, etc.) that within three years will cover one hundred percent of the landscape area. No mulch, bark chips, or similar materials shall be allowed at the time of landscape installation except under the canopy of shrubs and within two feet of the base of trees. The community development department shall maintain a list of trees, shrubs and vegetation acceptable for landscaping. 
d.  For properties within the Downtown Design District landscaping shall be required to the extent practicable up to the ten percent requirement. 
e.  Landscaping shall be visible from public thoroughfares to the extent practicable. 
f.  Interior parking lot landscaping shall not be counted toward the fifteen percent minimum, unless otherwise permitted by the dimensional standards of the underlying zone district. 
2.  Vehicular Access and Connectivity. 
a.  Parking areas shall be located behind buildings, below buildings, or on one or both sides of buildings. 
b.  Ingress and egress locations on thoroughfares shall be located in the interest of public safety. Access for emergency services (fire and police) shall be provided. 
c.  Alleys or vehicular access easements shall be provided in the following Districts: R-2, MUC-1, MUC-2, MUD and NC zones unless other permanent provisions for access to off-street parking and loading facilities are approved by the decision-maker. The corners of alley intersections shall have a radius of not less than ten feet. 
d.  Sites abutting an alley shall be required to gain vehicular access from the alley unless deemed impracticable by the community development director. 
e.  Where no alley access is available, the development shall be configured to allow only one driveway per frontage. On corner lots, the driveway(s) shall be located off of the side street (unless the side street is an arterial) and away from the street intersection. Shared driveways shall be required as needed to accomplish the requirements of this section. The location and design of pedestrian access from the sidewalk shall be emphasized so as to be clearly visible and distinguishable from the vehicular access to the site. Special landscaping, paving, lighting, and architectural treatments may be required to accomplish this requirement. 
f.  Driveways that are at least twenty-four feet wide shall align with existing or planned streets on adjacent sites.

17.62.055 - Institutional and commercial building standards. 
A.  Purpose. The primary objective of the regulations contained in this section is to provide a range of design choices that promote creative, functional, and cohesive development that is compatible with surrounding areas. Buildings approved through this process are intended to serve multiple tenants over the life of the building, and are not intended for a one-time occupant. The standards encourage people to spend time in the area, which also provides safety though informal surveillance. Finally, this section is intended to promote the design of an urban environment that is built to human scale by creating buildings and streets that are attractive to pedestrians, create a sense of enclosure, provide activity and interest at the intersection of the public and private spaces, while also accommodating vehicular movement. 
B.  Applicability. In addition to Section 17.62.050 requirements, institutional and commercial buildings shall comply with design standards contained in this section. 
C.  Relationship between zoning district design standards and requirements of this section. 
1.  Building design shall contribute to the uniqueness of the underlying zoning district by applying appropriate materials, elements, features, color range and activity areas tailored specifically to the site and its context. 
2.  A standardized prototype or franchise design shall be modified if necessary to meet the provisions of this section. 
3.  In the case of a multiple building development, each individual building shall include predominant characteristics, architectural vocabulary and massing shared by all buildings in the development so that the development forms a cohesive place within the underlying zoning district or community. 
4.  With the exception of standards for building orientation and building front setbacks, in the event of a conflict between a design standard in this section and a standard or requirement contained in the underlying zoning district, the standard in the zoning district shall prevail. 
5.  On sites with one hundred feet or more of frontage at least sixty percent of the site frontage width shall be occupied by buildings placed within five feet of the property line, unless a greater setback is accepted under the provisions of Section 17.62.055D. For sites with less than one hundred feet of street frontage, at least fifty percent of the site frontage width shall be occupied by buildings placed within five feet of the property line unless a greater setback is accepted under the provisions of Section 17.62.055D. 
D.  Relationship of Buildings to Streets and Parking.

Facades on corner lots shall provide at least sixty percent windows or transparency on all corner-side facades. All other side elevations shall provide at least thirty percent transparency. The transparency is measured in lineal fashion. For example, a one hundred-foot long building elevation shall have at least sixty feet (sixty percent of one hundred feet) of transparency in length. Reflective, glazed, mirrored or tinted glass is limited to ten percent of the lineal footage of windows on the street facing facade. Highly reflective or glare-producing glass with a reflective factor of one-quarter or greater is prohibited on all building facades. Any glazing materials shall have a maximum fifteen percent outside visual light reflectivity value. No exception shall be made for reflective glass styles that appear transparent when internally illuminated. 
2.  Side or rear walls that face walkways may include false windows and door openings only when actual doors and windows are not feasible because of the nature of the use of the interior use of the building. False windows located within twenty feet of a right-of-way shall be utilized as display windows with a minimum display depth of thirty-six inches.

A deeper front yard setback may be approved through site plan and design review if the setback area incorporates enhanced pedestrian spaces and amenities, including but not limited to, street furniture, public art or other such deliberately shaped area and/or a feature or amenity that, in the judgment of the community development director, integrates well with adjoining areas. Setbacks may also be increased in order to protect wildlife habitat and water resources pursuant to Section 17.49.100F., and trees and tree groves pursuant to and Section 17.41.120A. 
D.  Entrances. Every building abutting a street shall have a street facing front facade. The facade shall be oriented to the street and include windows, doorways, and a structured transition from public to private areas using built elements such as porch features, arbors, low walls, trellis work and/or similar elements integrated with planting. 
E.  Percentage of Frontage. On sites with one hundred feet or more of street frontage at least fifty percent of the site frontage width shall be occupied by buildings placed within twenty feet from the property line, unless a greater setback is accepted under the provisions of Section 17.62.057C. For sites with less than one hundred feet of street frontage, at least forty percent of the site frontage width shall be occupied by buildings placed within twenty feet of the property line, unless a greater setback is accepted under the provisions of Section 17.62.056D. 
F.  Pedestrian Circulation. 
1.  Pathways between dwelling units entrances and the street are required. Such pathways between the street and buildings fronting on the street shall be in a straight line. Exceptions may be allowed by the director where steep slopes prevent a direct connection or where an indirect route would enhance the design and/or use of a common open space. 
2.  The pedestrian circulation system shall connect all main entrances on the site. For townhouses or other residential units fronting on the street, the sidewalk may be used to meet this standard. For multiple-family developments, pedestrian connections to other areas of the site, such as parking areas, recreational areas, common outdoor areas, and any pedestrian amenities shall be required. 
3.  Elevated external stairways or walkways, which provide pedestrian access to dwelling units located above the ground floor are prohibited . The community development director may allow exceptions for external stairways or walkways located in, or facing interior courtyard areas provided they do not compromise visual access from dwelling units into the courtyard. 
G.  Architectural and Material Standards. Building articulation and modulation - multifamily residential buildings and residential portions of mixed-use buildings. An alternative to the standards in subsection G. below may be approved by the community development director if the design is consistent with the intent of the standards and a specific architectural or building use exists that prohibits the full implementation of the standard. 
1.  Articulation and modulation of buildings is essential in providing the ability for new buildings to be compatible with the surrounding commercial and residential development. All residential buildings and residential portions of mixed-use buildings shall include at least three of the following modulation and/or articulation features at intervals of no more than thirty feet along all facades facing a street, common open space, and common parking areas: 
a.  Repeating distinctive window patterns at intervals less than the required interval. Vertical building modulation . Minimum depth and width of modulation is thirty-six inches and four feet (respectively) if tied to a change in color or building material and/or roofline modulation . Otherwise, minimum depth of modulation is ten feet and minimum width for each modulation is fifteen feet. Balconies may not be used to meet modulation option unless they are recessed or projected from the facade and integrated with the building's architecture as determined by the community development director, balconies that appear to be "tacked on" to the facade will not qualify for this option. 
b.  Horizontal modulation (upper level step-backs). The minimum horizontal modulation for buildings higher than two stories shall be five feet. A dormer- set five feet back from the front facade-is an example of an acceptable horizontal modulation. 
c.  Articulation of the building's top, middle, and bottom. This typically includes a distinctive ground floor or lower floor design, consistent articulation of middle floors, and a distinctive roofline. 


2.  Maximum facades width. Buildings visible from the street must use design techniques to break up long continuous building walls, reduce the architectural scale of the building, and add visual interest. Buildings exceeding one hundred twenty feet in width along the street front shall be divided by a thirty-foot wide modulation of the exterior wall, so that the maximum length of a particular facade is one hundred twenty feet. Such modulation must be at least twenty feet or deeper and extend through all floors. Decks and roof overhangs may encroach up to three feet (per side) into the modulation . The director will consider other design methods that are effective at reducing the perceived width of the building. Examples could include a combination of vertical and/or horizontal building modulation with a change in building materials or finishes, a clear change in building articulation and/or fenestration technique. 

3.  Roofline standards. 
a.  Single purpose residential buildings in residential districts must provide a pitched roof with minimum 6:12 roof pitch. The maximum width of any continuous roofline shall be thirty-five feet for single purpose residential buildings. Alternative roof designs will be considered provided design elements are included to help the building and its roofline fit into the site's context. 
b.  Mixed use buildings and stand-alone residential in commercial districts shall incorporate a roofline modulation. Specifically: For flat roofs or facades with a horizontal eave, fascia, or parapet, the minimum vertical dimension of roofline modulation is the greater of two feet or 0.1 multiplied by the wall height (finish grade to top of wall). The maximum length of any continuous roofline shall be seventy-five feet. 
c.  Other roof forms consistent with the design standards herein may satisfy this standard if the individual segments of the roof with no change in slope or discontinuity are less than forty feet in width (measured horizontally). 
H.  Diversity of building types. Multi-building developments of four or more buildings shall be required to provide different architectural designs to provide interest and variety. This is particularly important where multiple buildings front on the same street. Simple changes in building colors or reversal of basic facade designs are not sufficient to comply with this standard. Consider changes in vertical and/or horizontal articulation, fenestration, building materials, architectural style, and/or roof design. 
I.  Diversity of unit types. Multifamily buildings with more than twenty-five units are required to provide a diversity of housing types to allow for a range of households and age groups. Unit types are defined as the following: 
Studio, one-bedroom, two-bedroom and three-bedroom units or an ADA accessible master bedroom and bathroom (ground floor or elevator access). 
1.  Developments of twenty-five to fifty units must provide two unit types representing a minimum of ten percent of the total units per unit type. 
2.  Developments of fifty-one to seventy-five units must provide three unit types representing a minimum of ten percent of the total units per unit type. 
3.  Developments of seventy-six units and above must provide four unit types representing a minimum of ten percent of the total units per unit type. 
J.  Raised Ground Floor. 
This is particularly important when dwelling units are within fifteen feet of a sidewalk or common parking area or for buildings in established neighborhoods that have an established pattern with raised dwelling units. 
Where ground floor residential uses are permitted on the ground floor in commercial districts, developments shall incorporate a thirteen-foot tall ground floor height to allow future conversion to commercial uses where desirable. Such projects can utilize a false floor thirty-six inches above the ground for residential uses to increase residents' privacy. 

K.  Building Materials. 
All multifamily buildings shall be enhanced with appropriate details. Each of the types of details listed below are worth one point. Multifamily buildings must achieve the equivalent of five points worth of architectural details. 
1.  Decorative porch design with distinct design and use of materials. 
2.  Decorative treatment of windows and doors, such as decorative molding/framing details around all ground floor windows and doors, bay windows, decorative glazing, or door designs, and/or unique window designs. 
3.  Landscaped trellises or other decorative element that incorporates landscaping near the building entry or entries. 
4.  Decorative light fixtures with a diffuse visible light source, such as a globe or "acorn" that is non-glaring or a decorative shade or mounting for each building entry on the facade. 
5.  Brick or stonework covering more than fifteen percent of the facade. 
6.  Decorative building materials that add visual interest, including: 
a.  Individualized patterns or continuous wood details. 
b.  Decorative moldings, brackets, wave trim or lattice work. 
c.  Other materials with decorative or textural qualities as approved by the director. The applicant must submit architectural drawings and material samples for approval. 
7.  Decorative roofline design, including multiple gables and/or dormers, decorative parapet or other design that adds distinct visual interest. 
8.  Decorative railings, grill work, or terraced landscape beds integrated along the facade of the building. 
9.  Other details that meet the intent of the guidelines as approved by the director. 
L.  Window Design. 
1.  Transparent windows or doors facing the street are required. To meet this requirement, at least fifteen percent of the facade must be transparent. Transparency is measured at the first floor only. 
2.  All windows on all elevations shall recess or project individual windows at least two inches from the facade and incorporate window trim at least four inches in width that features color that contrasts with the base building color. Exceptions will be considered by the community development director where buildings employ other distinctive window or facade treatment that adds visual interest to the building. 
M.  Common Open Space Requirements. 
1.  Intent. Creating areas of common open space that are easily accessed by residents provides focal points for community recreation and interaction and adds to the overall quality of life for residents. Given the environmental and recreational benefits of common open space, it should be integrated purposefully into the overall design of a development and not merely be residual areas left over after buildings and parking lots are sited. 
2.  Common Open Space Required. All new multi-family developments in all zones except for the Mixed Use Corridor, Neighborhood Commercial or Mixed Use Downtown Districts, shall set aside a percentage of the net site acreage as common open space for the use and enjoyment of the development's residents. The common open space shall be aggregated into meaningful, quality open spaces. Clustering of buildings is encouraged to minimize small, narrow, unassigned strips in front of and between buildings. Open space areas shall be clearly identified on the development plan. Such designated common open space can be in a natural, undisturbed state, or may be landscaped for more formal courtyards or plazas, or may be developed for active or passive recreation. Phasing shall not be used to circumvent common open space standards. 
3.  Minimum Amount Required. The minimum amount of common open space (as a percentage of net land area) shall be: Fifteen percent 
4.  Areas Not Allowed as Part of Common Open Space. The following shall not count toward common open space set-aside requirements: 
a.  Private lots, yards, balconies and patios dedicated for use by a specific unit; 
b.  Public right-of-way or private streets and drives; 
c.  Open parking areas and driveways for dwellings; 
d.  Land covered by structures except for ancillary structures associated with the use of the open space such as gazebos and picnic shelters or recreation building. 
e.  Designated outdoor storage areas; 
f.  Land areas between buildings and parking lots or driveways of less than twenty feet; 
g.  Required perimeter setbacks; and 
h.  Detention/retention facilities, including drainage swales, except that detention or retention areas and stormwater management structures or facilities may be used to meet up to one hundred percent of the required common open space amount provided such areas or facilities are accessible and useable, as determined by the city, as year-round community amenities by the residents of the development (e.g., picnic areas, passive recreation areas, playgrounds, ponds for fishing and/or boating, etc.) 
[5.]  Required Greenway Linkages. Where a greenway linkage, natural or water resource area or other public park is dedicated to or acquired by the city, the area may be credited toward one-half the minimum amount of common open space required. The dedicated lands are not to be calculated in the net land area. 
[6.]  Design Criteria for Open Space. All common open space lands shall meet the following design criteria, as relevant: 
[a.]  Connectivity required. To the maximum extent practicable, common open space shall be organized to create integrated systems of open space that connect with the following types of lands located within or adjacent to the development: 
1.  Dedicated public park, greenway, or habitat lands; 
2.  Dedicated school sites; 
3.  Other dedicated open spaces; 
4.  Common open space located adjacent to the development; 
5.  Portions of the regional trail and open space system; 
[7.]  Compact and Contiguous. To the maximum extent practicable, common open space land shall be compact and contiguous unless the land is used as a continuation of an existing greenway, trail, or other linear park, or unless specific topographic features require a different configuration. An example of such topographic features would be the provision of open space along a scenic creek. 
[8.]  Accessible to Residents. Common open space shall be reasonably accessible to all of the residents of the development. The city may require access to be restricted if it would degrade, destroy, or adversely interfere with sensitive environmental or natural areas or with significant historic or cultural resources. 
[9.]  Recreational Facilities. If an applicant constructs recreational facilities in the common open space as a community amenity, such recreational facilities shall be constructed in accordance with applicable city standards regarding, but not limited to, size, siting, use, materials, and similar matters. The recreational facilities shall be built with long-lasting and sturdy materials. A long-term maintenance schedule may be required to ensure that there is sufficient funding and management set in place for the amenity to be maintained and replaced if needed. 
[10.]  Design Criteria. Common open spaces, other than those preserved as natural features or areas, should include gardens, courtyards, recreation, or play areas. Required common open space areas over ten thousand square feet of non-natural area shall provide a minimum of five amenities from the list below. Open space of ten thousand feet or less of non-natural area shall provide three amenities. 
[a.]  Seasonal planting/community gardening areas. 
[b.]  Large trees. 
[c.]  Seating. 
[d.]  Pedestrian-scaled lighting. 
[e.]  Gazebos or other decorative shelters. 
[f.]  Play structures for children. 
[g.]  On-site community recreation amenities. 
[h.]  Roof gardens or shared patio decks. 
[i.]  An alternative amenity as approved by the community development director. 
[11.]  Exceptions to the common open space standard may be granted for the following: 
a.  For multi-unit developments of up to twenty-five units (or for the first twenty-five units of a larger project) no common open space shall be required when such developments are within one-quarter mile (measured walking distance) to a public park of three acres or more; and there is a direct, improved, permanent, public, Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) - accessible, lighted, maintained pedestrian trail or sidewalk between the sites. An exception shall be granted only when the nearby park provides an active and fully improved recreation area. 
b.  For multi-unit developments with required common open space in excess of fifteen thousand square feet, the required open space may be reduced by one-half if access to the public is provided. The qualifying open space area shall be for active use, be maintained by the home owners association and not be within the boundaries of a Water Resource Buffer area. 
N.  Private Open Space. 
1.  Private Open Space Required. All new multi-family developments in all zones except for the Mixed Use Corridor, Neighborhood Commercial or Mixed Use Downtown Districts, shall set aside a private open space for the use and enjoyment of the development's residents. Private open space is a semi-enclosed area, which is intended for use strictly by the occupants of one dwelling unit. Private open space may include porches, balconies, terraces, roof top gardens, verandas, and decks. Dwellings located at finished grade, or within five feet of finished grade, shall provide a minimum of ninety-six square feet of private open space per dwelling unit, with no dimension less than six feet. Dwellings located more than five feet above finished grade shall provide a minimum of forty-eight square feet with no dimension less then six feet. Ground level private open space shall be visually and physically separated from common open space through the use of perimeter landscaping or fencing. 
2.  Common And Private Open Space Requirements For Multifamily Dwelling Units In The Mixed Use Corridor, Neighborhood Commercial Or Mixed Use Downtown Districts. All residential development in the Mixed Use Corridor, Neighborhood Commercial or Mixed Use Downtown Districts must provide a portion of the project area for private open space or common open space. Fifty square feet of private or common open space is required for each dwelling unit. The open space may be allocated exclusively for private or common use or may be a combination of the two uses. 
a.  Common Open Space: Common open space may be provided in the form of decks, shared patios, roof gardens, recreation rooms, lobbies or other gathering spaces created strictly for the tenants and not associated with storage or circulation. Landscape buffer areas may not be used as common open space unless active and passive uses are integrated into the space and its use will not adversely affect abutting properties. 
b.  Private Open Space: Private open space may be provided in the forms of decks, screened patios, roof gardens or an alternate private space as approved by the community development director. 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009; Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010) 
17.62.059 - Cottage housing. 
A.  Applicability. 
These guidelines apply to all cottage developments in any applicable zone within the city. Cottages are considered multi-family development and are subject to all the applicable sections of OCMC 17.62. Site Plan and Design Review and OCMC 17.52 Off Street Parking and Loading. However, this section replaces OCMC 17.62.057-Multifamily. The proposed development shall be processed under the Type II Land Use process and shall remain one lot. Where there is a conflict between these standards and the standards in other chapters, the Cottage Housing standards shall apply. 
B.  Intent. 
1.  To provide a housing type that responds to changing household sizes and ages (e.g., retirees, small families, single person households). 
2.  To encourage creation of more usable open space for residents of the development through flexibility in density and lot standards. 
3.  To ensure that the overall size, including bulk and mass of cottage structures and cottage housing developments, remain smaller and incur less visual impact than standard sized single-family dwellings, particularly given the allowed intensity of cottage dwellings. 
4.  To provide centrally located and functional common open space that fosters a sense of community and a sense of openness in cottage housing developments. 
5.  To provide private area around the individual dwellings to enable diversity in landscape design and foster a sense of ownership. 
6.  To ensure minimal visual impact from vehicular use and storage areas for residents of the cottage housing development as well as adjacent properties, and to maintain a single-family character along public streets. 

C.  Density Bonus. For developments in, R6, R8 and R-10 Zoning Districts: The city shall allow up to two cottage units for each regular dwelling unit allowed under existing standards in applicable zoning districts. For developments in the R 3.5 and R-5 zoning district: The city shall allow up to 1.5 cottage units for each regular dwelling unit allowed under existing standards in the applicable zoning district. At no time shall the proposed project fall below the minimum required density of the underlying district.

(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009; Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010) 
17.62.065 - Outdoor lighting. 
A.  Purpose. The general purpose of this section is to require outdoor lighting that is adequate for safety and convenience; in scale with the activity to be illuminated and its surroundings; directed to the surface or activity to be illuminated; and designed to clearly render people and objects and contribute to a pleasant nighttime environment. Additional specific purposes are to: 
1.  Provide safety and personal security as well as convenience and utility in areas of public use or traverse, for uses where there is outdoor public activity during hours of darkness; 
2.  Control glare and excessive brightness to improve visual performance, allow better visibility with relatively less light, and protect residents from nuisance and discomfort; 
3.  Control trespass light onto neighboring properties to protect inhabitants from the consequences of stray light shining in inhabitants' eyes or onto neighboring properties; 
4.  Result in cost and energy savings to establishments by carefully directing light at the surface area or activity to be illuminated, using only the amount of light necessary; and 
5.  Control light pollution to minimize the negative effects of misdirected light and recapture views to the night sky. 
B.  Applicability. 
1.  General. 
a.  All exterior lighting for any type of commercial, mixed-use, industrial or multi-family development shall comply with the standards of this section, unless excepted in subsection B.3. 
b.  The city engineer/public works director shall have the authority to enforce these regulations on private property if any outdoor illumination is determined to present an immediate threat to the public health, safety and welfare.

Chapter 17.65 - MASTER PLANS 

17.65.010 - Purpose and intent. 
    It is the intent of this chapter to foster the growth of major institutions and other large-scale development, while identifying and mitigating the impacts of such growth on surrounding properties and public infrastructure. The city recognizes the valuable services and employment opportunities that these developments bring to Oregon City residents. The master plan process is intended to facilitate an efficient and flexible review process for major developments and to provide them with the assurance they need over the long term so that they can plan for and execute their developments in a phased manner. To facilitate this, the master plan process is structured to allow an applicant to address the larger development issues, such as adequacy of infrastructure and transportation capacity, and reserve capacity of the infrastructure and transportation system before expenditure of final design costs. 
(Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010) 
17.65.020 - What is included in a master plan. 
A.  A master plan is a two-step process that includes a general development plan and a detailed development plan. 
A general development plan incorporates the entire area where development is planned in the next five to twenty years, including the identification of one or more development phases. The general development plan may encompass land that is not currently under the applicant's control, but which eventually may be controlled by the applicant during the duration of the master plan. The plan shall have no effect for lands not currently controlled by the applicant. "Controlled" shall be defined as leased or owned by the applicant. 
A detailed development plan is the phase or phases of the general development plan that are proposed for development within two-years. 
B.  A master plan identifies the current and proposed use of the development, as defined by the general development plan boundary. If approved, the general development plan may be used to allow existing legal non-conforming uses. If conditions of approval from a previous land use decision have not been completed, they must be modified through the general development plan or completed with new development. 
C.  A master plan identifies future development impacts, thresholds for mitigation and mitigation improvements and implementation schedules. 
A threshold for mitigation is the point that determines when or where a mitigation improvement will be required. Examples of "thresholds" include vehicle trips, square feet of impervious surface area, water usage measured in gallons per minute, construction of a building within a general development plan and construction of a building within a certain distance of a residential lot. 
Mitigation improvements are improvements that will be made or constructed by an institution when a threshold for mitigation is reached. Examples include road dedication, intersection improvement, road widening, construction of a stormwater or water quality facility, installation of vegetative buffering and wetland restoration or enhancement. 
(Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010) 
17.65.030 - Applicability of the Master Plan Regulations. 
A.  Submission. A master plan shall be submitted for any institutional development on a site over ten acres in size. If the boundaries of an institutional development exceed ten acres in size, the proposed development shall be master planned using the regulations of this chapter. No permit under this title shall by issued for any institutional development in excess of ten acres in total acreage unless it is accompanied by or preceded by a master plan approval under this chapter. 
The provisions of this chapter do not apply to modifications to existing institutional developments unless the modification results in a cumulative square footage increase of over ten thousand total building square feet in an existing institutional development over ten acres. 
B.  When Required as Part of Previous Land Use Review. The master plan regulations may be used to fulfill a condition of approval from a previous land use decision-requiring master planning for a development. 
C.  When identified in the Oregon City Comprehensive Plan. The master plan regulations are required for all properties identified for master planning in the Land Use section of the Oregon City Comprehensive Plan. 
D.  Voluntarily. An applicant may voluntarily submit a master plan as part of a land use review. (Ord. 03-1014, Att. B3 (part), 2003) 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009; Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010) 
17.65.040 - Procedure. 
A.  Preapplication Review. Prior to filing for either general development plan or detailed development plan approval, the applicant shall file a pre-application conference pursuant to Section 17.50.030. 
B.  General Development Plan. An application for a General Development Plan describing the long-term buildout of the site shall be reviewed through a Type III procedure. An applicant must have an approved General Development Plan before any detailed development plan may be approved, unless both are approved or amended concurrently. Amendments to an approved General Development Plan shall be reviewed under a Type III procedure pursuant to Section 17.65.080. 
C.  Detailed Development Plan. An application for a detailed development plan, is processed through a Type II procedure, as long as it is in conformance with the approved general development plan. Amendments to an approved detailed development plan shall be processed pursuant to Section 17.65.080. Once a development has an approved detailed development plan, Chapter 17.62 Site Plan and Design Review is not be required. 
D.  Concurrent Review. An applicant may concurrently apply for a general development plan and a detailed development plan, or any phase of a detailed development plan. Such a concurrent application is reviewed through a Type III procedure. (Ord. 03-1014, Att. B3 (part), 2003)

A new application will need to be submitted, reviewed, and approved through an additional site plan and design review or conditional use review process. No building permit application shall be submitted without documentation demonstrating Federal Aviation Administration review and approval and Oregon Aeronautics Division review. 
4.  A visual study containing, at a minimum, a graphic simulation showing the appearance of the proposed tower, antennas, and auxiliary support equipment from at least five points within a one-mile radius. Such points shall be chosen by the provider with a review and approval by the community development director to ensure that various potential views are represented. 
5.  Documentation that one or more wireless communications service providers will be using the support tower within sixty days of construction completion. 
6.  A site plan, drawn to scale, that includes: 
a.  Existing and proposed improvements; 
b.  Adjacent roads; 
c.  Parking, circulation, and access; 
d.  Connections to utilities, right-of-way cuts required, and easements required; 
e.  A landscape plan describing the maintenance plan and showing areas of existing and proposed vegetation to be added, retained, replaced, or removed; and 
f.  Setbacks from property lines or support structure edges of all existing and proposed structures. Plans that have been reduced, but have not had their scale adjusted, will not be accepted as satisfying this requirement. 
7.  An alternatives analysis for new support towers demonstrating compliance with the Support Tower Location Requirements of Chapter 17.80.100. 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009; Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010; Ord. No. 18-1005, § 1(Exh. A), 5-2-2018) 
17.80.100 - Support tower location requirements. 
    No new support tower shall be permitted under the provisions of Chapter 17.80.070 unless the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the community development director, and the results are verified by a State of Oregon certified professional engineer, that no existing collocation or modification possibility can accommodate the service needs of the applicant's proposed support tower. All proposals for new support towers must be accompanied by a statement and documentation from a qualified engineer, as determined by the community development director, that the necessary service cannot be provided by collocation on, or modification to, an existing support tower or structure for one or more of the following reasons: 
A.  No existing support towers or support structures are located within the geographic area required to meet the applicant's engineering requirements; 
B.  Existing support towers or support structures are not of sufficient height to meet the applicant's engineering requirements; 
C.  Existing support towers or support structures do not have sufficient structural strength to support the applicant's proposed antenna(s) and related equipment. 
D.  The applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic interference with the antenna(s) on the existing support tower or support structure, or the existing antenna would cause interference with the applicant's proposed antenna(s); 
E.  The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that render existing support towers and support structures unsuitable; or 
F.  That fees, costs, or contractual provisions required by the owner in order to share or adapt to an existing support tower or support structure for collocation are unreasonable. 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009; Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010) 
17.80.110 - Design standards. 
    Installation, collocation, construction, or modification of all support towers, structures, and antennas shall comply with the following standards, unless it qualifies as an "eligible modification" under Section 17.80.035 or an adjustment is obtained pursuant to the provisions of Section 17.80.120: 
A.  Support Tower. The support tower shall be self-supporting. 
B.  Height Limitation. Support tower and antenna heights shall not exceed the maximum heights provided below. 
1.  If the property is zoned GI, CI or I; and no adjacent parcel is zoned residential the maximum height of a support tower, including antennas, is one hundred twenty feet. 
2.  If the property is zoned: a. GI, CI or I, and an adjacent parcel is zoned residential; or b. C, MUC-2 or MUE; the maximum height of a support tower, including antennas, is one hundred feet. 
3.  If the property is zoned MUC-1, MUD or NC; the maximum height of a support tower, including antennas, is seventy-five feet. 
4.  For all cases other than those identified in Section 17.80.110B.1-3 above, the maximum height of a support tower, including antennas, is seventy-five feet. 
C.  Collocation. New support towers shall be designed to accommodate collocation of additional providers. 
1.  New support towers of a height greater than seventy-five feet shall be designed to accommodate collocation of a minimum of two additional providers either outright or through future modification of the tower. 
2.  New support towers of a height between sixty feet and seventy-five feet shall be designed to accommodate collocation of a minimum of one additional provider either outright or through future modification of the tower. 
D.  Setbacks. The following setbacks shall be required from property lines, not the lease area, for support towers, auxiliary support equipment, and perimeter fencing. 
1.  Support towers not designed to collapse within themselves shall be setback from all property lines a distance equal to the proposed height of the support tower. 
2.  Support towers designed to collapse within themselves shall be setback from the property line a distance equal to the following: 
a.  If the property is zoned GI, CI, I, C, MUC-2 or MUE; and no adjacent parcel is zoned for a residential use the underlying zone setback shall apply; 
b.  If the property is zoned: 
i.  GI, CI, I, C, MUC-2 or MUE and an adjacent parcel is zoned residential; or 
ii.  MUC-1, MUD or NC; the setback shall be a minimum of twenty-five feet from all adjacent residentially zoned property lines and the underlying zoning setback for all other adjacent property lines; or 
c.  For all cases other than those identified in Section 17.80.110D.2.a. and b. above, the setback shall be a minimum of twenty-five feet from all adjacent property lines. 
E.  Auxiliary Support Equipment. The following standards shall be required. 
1.  If the property is zoned: 
a.  For GI, CI, I, MUC-1, MUC-2, C, MUD, MUE or NC, the auxiliary support equipment footprint shall not exceed an area of three hundred forty square feet and fifteen feet in height at the peak;

b.  For all cases other than those identified in Section 17.80.110F.1.a. above, landscaping shall be placed completely around the perimeter of the wireless communication facility, except as required to gain access. The minimum planting height shall be a minimum of six feet at the time of planting, densely placed so as to screen the facility. The landscaping shall be compatible with vegetation in the surrounding area, and shall be kept healthy and well maintained as long as the facility is in operation. Failure to maintain the site will be grounds to revoke the ability to operate the facility. 
c.  The community development director may approve an alternative landscaping plan that visually screens the facility and is consistent with the intent of this standard. 
G.  Noise Reduction. Noise generating equipment shall be baffled to reduce sound level measured at the property line to the following levels except during short durations for testing and operation of generators in emergency situations: 
1.  For any property where no adjacent parcel is zoned residential, the sound level at the property line shall not be greater than fifty dB; 
2.  For all other cases, the sound level shall not be greater than forty dB when measured at the nearest residential parcel's property line.

If adequate intersection sight distance is unavailable at the existing access intersection with a city street, an analysis of alternate access sites shall be required. 
2.  Site shall be serviced by an access adequate to ensure fire protection of the site. 
3.  New access drives shall be paved a minimum of twenty feet deep from the edge of the right-of-way (though the use of pervious paving materials such as F-mix asphalt, pavers, or geotech webbing is encouraged) and designed with material to be as pervious as practicable to minimize stormwater runoff. 
4.  New access drives shall be reviewed for adequate intersection sight distances. 
L.  Informing the city. All service providers with facilities within the city of Oregon City shall be required to report in writing to the community development director any changes in the status of their operation. 
1.  An annual written statement shall be filed with the Planning Manager verifying continued use of each of their facilities in the city's jurisdiction as well as continued compliance with all state and federal agency regulations. 
2.  The report shall include any of the following changes: 
a.  Changes in or loss of Federal Communication Commission license from the Federal Communication Commission to operate;

(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009; Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010; Ord. No. 18-1005, § 1(Exh. A), 5-2-2018) 
17.80.120 - Adjustments. 
    Adjustments to the standards of this chapter may be approved by the planning commission at a duly noticed public hearing. The planning commission may grant an adjustment under either of the following circumstances: 
1.  The planning commission may grant an adjustment when a gap in the applicant's service exists and the gap can only be alleviated through the adjustment of one of more of the standards in this section. If an adjustment is to be approved, the applicant must demonstrate each of the following: 
a.  A gap in coverage or capacity exists in the wireless communication provider's service network that results in network users being regularly unable to connect with the provider's network, or maintain connection; 
b.  The proposed facility will fill the existing service gap. The gap would be filled if the proposed facility would substantially reduce the frequency with which users of the network are unable to connect, or maintain connection, with the provider's network; and 
c.  The gap cannot be filled through collocation on existing facilities, or establishment of facilities that are consistent with the standards of this section on properties other than the proposed site or on the proposed site in a manner which does not require an adjustment under this subsection. 
2.  The planning commission may grant an adjustment to a standard when the proposed adjustment would utilize existing site characteristics to minimize demonstrated or potential impacts on the use of surrounding properties. For the purposes of this subsection, site characteristics shall include, but need not be limited to, the suitability of the proposed use considering size, shape, location, topography, existence of improvements, and natural features. Applicants for an adjustment under this provision must demonstrate that the adjustment will result in a lower level of impact on surrounding properties than would be generated if the standard were not adjusted. In considering the requested adjustment, the planning commission may consider the following: 
a.  Visual impacts; 
b.  Impacts on views; 
c.  Impacts on property values; and 
d.  Other impacts that the planning commission finds can be mitigated by an adjustment so that the proposed use will have greater compliance in not altering the character of the surrounding area in a manner which substantially limits, impairs, or precludes the use of surrounding properties for the primary use listed in the underlying district. 
3.  Requests for adjustments under this subsection shall only be considered concurrently with the applicable Site Review Process as required by Section 17.80.080. If the Site Review Process required by Section 17.80.080 is a Compatibility Review or a Site Plan and Design Review, the inclusion of an adjustment will require that the application be subject to a Conditional Use Review under Section 17.80.090.C. 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009; Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010) 
17.80.130 - Temporary facilities. 
    In order to facilitate continuity of services during maintenance or repair of existing installations, or prior to completion of construction of a new wireless communication facility, temporary wireless communication facilities shall be allowed subject to a Type I administrative review. Temporary wireless communication facilities shall not be in use in excess of six-month period. Temporary wireless communication facilities shall not have a permanent foundation, and shall be removed within thirty days of suspension of service they provide. 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009; Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010) 
17.80.140 - Removal for discontinuance of service. 
    Any wireless communication facility that has not provided service for six months shall be deemed a nuisance and subject to removal as provided in Oregon City Municipal Code Chapter 8.08. The planning manager may grant a six-month extension where a written request has been filed, within the initial six months period, to reuse the support tower or antenna(s). 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009; Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010) 
17.80.150 - Fees. 
    Notwithstanding any other provisions of this code, the community development director may require, as part of the application fees for land use permits, an amount sufficient to recover all of the city's costs in retaining consultants to verify statements made in conjunction with the permit application, to the extent that verification requires telecommunication experts. 
(Ord. No. 08-1014, §§ 1-3(Exhs. 1-3), 7-1-2009; Ord. No. 10-1003, § 1(Exh. 1), 7-7-2010)
