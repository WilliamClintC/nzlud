FOREWORD
History
This comprises the codification of the ordinances of the Borough of Philipsburg. The
Borough was originally settled in 1797 and was incorporated in 1864 as a Borough from
parts of Rush Township.
The Code of Ordinances of the Borough was prepared by General Code, LLC.
Organization
The Code contains four parts which are (1) the valid current ordinances of the Borough
contained in Chapters 1 through 27, (2) the Appendix, which lists by abstracted title all
ordinances of a temporary or "one time" nature, (3) the Key to the disposition of each
ordinance ever enacted by the Borough, and (4) the Index, which is an alphabetical arrangement
of subjects.
In the Code each Chapter is separated by a divider tab, and specific ordinances can be
located by subject on the contents page at the beginning of each Chapter. The Index
may also be used to search for a subject when one is looking for general information on a
particular subject, or if it is not known in which Chapter the subject might be found.
The Appendix consists of several general categories containing a chronological listing of
short subject descriptions along with a reference to the original ordinance and its date of
enactment, if known.
The Key to disposition indicates what action has been taken by the Borough Council
with regard to every ordinance ever enacted. An ordinance has either been (1) specifically
repealed, (2) superseded by another ordinance, (3) is located in a Chapter of the
Codebook, or (4) is located in the Appendix. Annual tax rate and budget ordinances are
located only in the Key. The Key is a cross reference to the original ordinance books of
the Borough and to the location within the Code of each ordinance by number.

LAND USE AND ZONING PERMITS
§5-201. Findings and Purpose.
The Borough Council of the Borough of Philipsburg finds that, in order to properly assess
all improvements to real property for ad valorum tax purposes, it is necessary and
appropriate to require persons to obtain a permit for the construction of all buildings
not requiring a permit under the Pennsylvania Construction Code Act, Act 44 of 1999,

of the Uniform Construction Code. Under the Act, certain buildings and
renovations, including by way of illustration, but not limitation, nonhabitable utility or
miscellaneous use structures, under 1,000 square feet, limited to one story; agricultural
buildings; recreational buildings and renovations which would require the property to
be reassessed are not required to obtain a permit from the municipal code official prior
to construction. Therefore, these structures can be built under the Act without notice to
the Borough, which means they may not be assessed for tax purposes. The purpose of
this Part is to require a permit prior to construction or renovation of such buildings to
promote uniform taxation of all taxable improvements in the Borough.

§18-204. Surcharge for Certain Industrial Wastes.
1. Any person discharging industrial wastes to the sewage collection system having
a B.O.D. in excess of 300 ppm shall pay a strength-of-waste surcharge in an
amount equal to the product of the actual volume of wastes in thousand gallons
per monthly billing period, discharged to the sewage collection system and the
"B.O.D. surcharge rate." The "B.O.D. surcharge rate" shall be determined by this
Borough pursuant to the following formula:
Rc = 0.00834 P (C300)
Rc = the B.O.D. surcharge rate in center per 1,000 gallons of waste discharged.
P = the average annual fixed operation and maintenance cost of secondary treatment
processes per pound of B.O.D. received at the treatment plant of the Authority,
such secondary processes shall include chlorination as well as activated sludge
processes (prior to completion of the first year of operation of the Authority's
treatment plant, the value of "P" shall be assumed to be 0.05 dollars).
C = the average B.O.D. of abnormal industrial wastes expressed in ppm as determined
in accordance with subsection (5) hereof.
The figure "300" appearing on the above formula corresponds to the maximum
B.O.D. permissible without surcharge. The figure "0.00834" is the factor to convert
ppm to pounds per 1,000 gallons. No discount will be permitted for any industrial
wastes having a B.O.D. less than 300 ppm.
2. Any person discharging industrial wastes to the sewage collection system having
a suspended solids concentration in excess of 350 ppm shall pay a strength-ofwaste
surcharge in an amount equal to the product of the actual volume of wastes
in thousand gallons per billing period, discharged to the sewage collection system
and the "suspended solids surcharge rate." The "suspended solids surcharge rate"
shall be determined by this Borough pursuant to the following formula:
SEWERS AND SEWAGE DISPOSAL
18-18 4/9/2007
Rs = 0.00834 B (S-350).
Rs = the suspended solids surcharge rate per 1,000 gallons of water discharged.
B = the average annual fixed operation and maintenance cost of sludge digestion,
sludge drying and sludge disposal operations per pound of suspended solids received
at the treatment plant of the Authority (prior to completion of the first year
of operation of the Authority's treatment plant the value of "B" shall be assumed
to be 0.05 dollars).
S = the average suspended solids concentration of abnormal industrial wastes expressed
in ppm as determined in accordance with subsection (5) hereof.
The figure "350" appearing on the above formula corresponds to the maximum
suspended solids concentration permissible without surcharge. The figure
"0.00834" is the factor to convert ppm to pounds per 1,000 gallons. No discount
will be permitted for any industrial wastes having a suspended solids concentration
of less than 350 ppm.
In the case of industrial wastes containing heavy metals, either in suspension or
solution or when in the opinion of this Authority the suspended solids do not represent
the true characteristics of the solids loading, this Borough reserves the
right to use total solids instead of suspended solids in the formula provided above
for surcharge purposes under this subsection.
3. In the case of industrial wastes containing substances or materials which can be
treated by the Authority only with extra care and costs and where neither surcharge
state above shall apply, this Borough reserves the right to accept such industrial
wastes only after a study of the same has been made and a formula for
discharge and regulations applicable to such discharge have been made.
4. All surcharges provided for in this Section will be in addition to the rentals and
charges provided for in §18-203.
5. The strength of any industrial wastes shall be determined monthly or more frequently,
by samples taken at the manhole provided for in §18-205(3) or at any
other sampling point agreed to by the Authority, this Borough and the person discharging
the industrial wastes. The frequency and duration of the sampling period
shall be such as, in the opinion of the Authority, will permit a reasonably reliable
determination of the average composition of the said wastes. Samples shall
be collected by a representative of the Authority in proportion to the flow of waste
composited for analysis in accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods
for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, as published by the American
Public Heath Association. Except as herein provided, the strength of the waste as
found by analysis shall be used for establishing any applicable surcharge or surcharges
herein provided for. however, the Authority may, if it so elects, accept the
results of routine sampling and analysis by the person discharging said wastes in
lieu of making its own samplings and analysis.

§18-206. Measuring of Volume of Industrial Wastes and Sanitary Sewage.
Whenever volume of industrial wastes and/or sanitary sewage is required under this
Part to compute sewer rentals and other charges imposed hereunder or required in connection
with any other provision contained herein, the provisions of this Section shall be
applicable.
A. Methods of Measuring Volume.
(1) Whenever the entire water supply of an improved property or, if applicable,
a billing unit or billing units located therein, constituting a
commercial, institutional or industrial establishment, which shall be
discharging sanitary sewage and/or industrial wastes into the sewage
collection system, is supplied by the water company, the volume of
water furnished, as determined from meter readings of the water
company, shall be used as the measure of discharge of sanitary sewage
and/or industrial wastes in computing sewer rentals and charges,
subject to adjacent, if appropriate, as provided in this Part.
(2) Whenever an improved property or, if applicable, a billing unit or billing
units located therein, constituting a commercial, institutional or
industrial establishment, which shall be discharging sanitary sewage
and/or industrial wastes into the sewage collection system, shall have
a source or sources of water supply in addition to or other than that
supplied by the water company, the owner of such improved property
shall provide a meter or meters on such additional or other source or
sources of water supply. The total volume of water consumed, as determined
from the meter readings of the water company and the meter
readings of the meter or meters on such additional or other source
or sources of water supply or the meter readings of the meter or meters
on such other source or sources of water supply, as appropriate,
shall be used as the measure of discharge of sanitary sewage and/or
industrial wastes in computing the sewer rentals and charges, subject
to adjustment, if appropriate, as provided in this Part.
(3) Whenever an improved property or, if applicable, a billing unit or billing
units located therein, constituting a commercial, institutional or
industrial establishment shall use water supplied by the water company
and/or water from a source or sources of supply in addition to or
other than that supplied by the water company for cooling or unpolluted
commercial or industrial process purposes and all or part of the
water so used shall not be discharged into the sewage collection system,
the volume used as the measure of discharge of sanitary sewage
and/or industrial waste in computing sewer rentals and charges may
be adjusted by one of the following methods:
(a) By installing a meter or other measuring device on the connection
to the sewage collection system. The readings from such
(18, PART 2)
4/9/2007 18-23
meter or measuring device shall be used as the measure of discharge
or sanitary sewage and/or industrial wastes in computing
sewage treatment rates and charges.
(b) By installing a meter or other measuring device to measure the
volume not being discharged into the sewage collection system.
The readings from such meter or measuring device shall be deducted
from the total water meter readings and the remainder
shall be used as the measure of discharge of sanitary sewage
and/or industrial wastes in computing sewer rentals and
charges.
(c) It if it not practical, in the opinion of this Borough, to install a
meter or other measuring device to determine continuously the
volume not discharged into the sewage collection system, this
Borough shall determine in such manner and by such method as
it may prescribe, the percentage of metered water which is being
discharged into the sewage collection system. The quantity of
water used as the measure of discharge of sanitary sewage
and/or industrial wastes in computing sewer rentals and
charges shall be the percentage so determined of the quantity
measured by the water meter or meters. Any dispute as to such
estimated percentage shall be submitted to this Borough, after
notice of such estimate. The decision of this Borough with respect
to the matter shall be final for the then current calendar
year.
(4) Whenever an industrial establishment shall discharge only industrial
wastes into the sewage collection system, the volume of water used,
measured as herein provided, shall be used as a measure of the quantity
of industrial wastes so discharged.
(5) Whenever an industrial establishment shall discharge combined sanitary
sewage and industrial wastes into the sewage collection system
the volume of water used, measured as herein provided, chargeable as
industrial wastes shall be the total volume of water used, less the volume
of water determined to be sanitary sewage.
B. Measuring Devices. Meters or other measuring devices which shall not be
available in connection with the water company, but which shall be required
or permitted under provisions of this Part, shall be furnished and installed
in accordance with specifications of this Borough and the Authority by the
owner of the improved property at his expense, shall be under the control of
this Borough and may be tested, inspected or repaired by this Borough
whenever necessary. The owner of the improved property upon which such
meter or other measuring device shall be installed shall be responsible for
its maintenance and safekeeping and all repairs thereto shall be made at
SEWERS AND SEWAGE DISPOSAL
18-24 4/9/2007
the expense of the owner, whether such repairs shall be made necessary by
ordinary wear and tear or other causes.
C. Meter Readings. This Borough, except to the extent that meter readings are
made by any other person in connection with the water company and are
made available for this Borough for purposes of this Part, shall be responsible
for the reading of all meters or other measuring devices and the same
shall be available to this Borough and the Authority at all reasonable times.

PART 1
GENERAL PROVISIONS
§27-101. Enactment.
The Borough Council of the Borough of Philipsburg hereby adopts and enacts the regulations,
zoning districts, administrative structures and administrative procedures that
constitute this Chapter. From and after the approval of this Chapter, the districts specified
herein shall be established and the following regulations shall be in full force and
effect.
(Ord. 984, 6/14/1999, Art. I, §100)
§27-102. Short Title.
This Chapter shall be known as the "Borough of Philipsburg Zoning Ordinance."
(Ord. 984, 6/14/1999, Art. I, §103)
§27-103. A Reader's Guide to the Organization and Applicability of this Chapter.
1. This Chapter regulates all land uses, lots and structures within the Borough of
Philipsburg, except those that are the property of the Borough itself. Every regulated
land use, lot or structure must either conform to the rules of this Chapter or
be a nonconforming use, nonconforming lot or nonconforming structure. A nonconformity
is defined as a use, lot or structure that was legally established before the
effective date of this Chapter's enactment (see, §27-106, "Effective Date of This
Chapter") and does not conform to the substantive requirements of this Chapter.
Because nonconformities were legally established and because their owners could
not have known what the regulations of this Chapter were going to be in advance,
the owners have a legal and ethical right to continue their nonconformities. However,
all nonconformities, except nonconforming signs, are subject to the regulations
of §27-116, "Nonconformities." Special regulations for nonconforming signs
are given in Part 6, "Signs." All regulated land uses, lots and structures that are
neither in conformance with the controls of this Chapter nor nonconformities are
illegal and subject to the enforcement procedures specified in §27-118, "Enforcement."
2. Zoning ordinances are always complex due to the complex nature of modern communities.
However, this Chapter is organized to be as simple as possible and to
minimize the amount of reading required to determine how a property or project
is restricted.
ZONING
27-6 4/9/2007
3. All of the provisions in this Chapter that affect Philipsburg's property owners on a
daily basis and apply to all properties within the Borough are included in this
Part. The Sections in the remainder of this Part explain what the general purposes
of this Chapter are, what its basic rules are, when zoning or occupancy permits
are needed, how to get these permits, what extra regulations apply to nonconforming
uses, what a variance is, how to get a variance, how the Chapter will
be enforced, how property owners may contest the Zoning Officer's determinations
and how property owners may dispute the validity of this Chapter. Anybody who
has a question concerning how this Chapter regulates a property should read this
Part..
4. However, many of the regulations in this Chapter should not be applied to all areas
of the Borough due to the differing statuses and goals of these areas. So Part
2, Zoning District Provisions, divides the Borough into 8 "zoning districts", each of
which is composed of areas with similar present-day statuses and goals and faces
a set of regulations that is different than the set faced by every other zoning district.
Part 2 then provides this set of regulations for each district, addressing such
subjects as permitted land uses, off-street parking and loading facilities, setbacks,
building heights, lot designs and more. Although §27-201, "Purposes, Organization
and Applicability of This Part" explains how this Part should be read in more
detail, a general rule of thumb is that readers who have a question concerning
how this Chapter regulates a property need to read only the parts of Part 2 that
concern the zoning district of that property.
5. Part 3, "Special Exceptions and Conditional Uses," explains what a special exception
use is, reveals what a conditional use is, illustrates the procedures for obtaining
permits for these uses, lists the standards that the Zoning Hearing Board is to
utilize in determining whether or not to grant a special exception use, and lists
the standards that the Borough Council is to employ in determining whether or
not to grant a conditional use. Part 4, "Temporary Uses," explains what a temporary
use is, illustrates the procedures for obtaining permits for one and lists the
standards that the Borough Council is to utilize in determining whether or not to
grant it. Part 5, Supplemental Regulations, contains regulations that apply to
only some kinds of land uses and structures. Part 6, "Signs," contains all of the
Chapter's sign regulations. Part 7 contains the Chapter's administrative provisions
that are relevant to Borough officials on a daily basis1, but not usually to
property owners (administrative provisions that are more relevant to property
owners are included in Part 1). Part 8, Definitions," provides a glossary of some of
the terms used in this Chapter.
6. The Sections in Part 1 apply to every regulated land use, lot and structure in the
Borough. Because they address each one of Philipsburg's 8 zoning districts, the
Sections in Part 2 also apply to every regulated land use, lot and structure in the
Borough. However, the Sections of Parts 3-7 apply only when a provision of either
Part 1 or Part 2 explicitly says so. Borough officials should be familiar with this
1 Note: Such provisions include explanations of the zoning related functions of the Borough's
Zoning Officer, Zoning Hearing Board and Council.
(27, PART 1)
4/9/2007 27-7
entire Chapter, as well as the 1998 Philipsburg Comprehensive Plan. However,
anyone who has a question concerning how this Chapter regulates a property only
needs to read the following:
A. Part. 1.
B. The Sections of Part 2 that concern the zoning district of the involved property.
C. The Sections of Part 3-7 that:
(1) Are explicitly referenced by either Part 1 or the Sections of Part 2 that
concern the property's zoning district.
(2) Are relevant to the reader's specific concern.
7. This Chapter is organized in this manner so that property owners can determine
how the use of their property is restricted without reading the entire document.
(Ord. 984, 6/14/1999, Art. I, §106)
§27-104. General Purposes of This Chapter.

Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, Act of 1968, P.L. 805, No. 247 as reenacted
and amended. Adopting the set of community development goals and objectives
from this plan as the primary purposes of this Chapter satisfies the requirements
of §606 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code. The 1998,
Philipsburg Comprehensive Plan also develops a land use plan on pages II-B1 to
II-B2 that provides a significant amount of guidance for this Chapter.
2. The following goals were used in an auxiliary role to develop this Chapter. Thus,
they serve as secondary general purposes of this Chapter:
A. To protect and promote the health, safety and welfare of both the residents
of the Borough of Philipsburg and the general public

§27-108. Conflict With Other Regulations.
Where a provision of this Chapter conflicts with a provision of another ordinance, State
law or Federal law, the stricter of the two shall apply. Where the applicable provision of
this Chapter is the less strict of the two, it shall not apply. However, the remainder of

provisions of any such ordinance or law contradict the provisions of this Chapter, the
stricter of the two shall apply. In both instances, the parts of this Chapter that are not
relevant to the provisions of the other law or ordinance shall remain in effect.

This Chapter shall not annul any easements, covenants or private agreements. However,
the existence of any such easement, covenant or private agreement shall not affect
the enforceability of this Chapter.

The Philipsburg Borough Council may temporarily waive some of the regulations of this
Chapter during a local emergency.

§27-112. General Rules for Land Uses and Lots.
All land uses shall be allowed on lots as a permitted principal use, permitted accessory
use, special exception use, conditional use and/or temporary use. The actual uses allowed
on a lot are a determined by the zoning district of that lot (see §27-212, :Land
Uses, Off-Street Parking and Off-Street Loading".). However, the following rules shall
apply to the establishment of land uses on lots in all districts:
A. No permitted accessory use shall be constructed more than 180 days before
the use to which it is accessory.
B. No structure shall be located closer than 5 feet from another structure
unless that structure is a fence, is attached to the other structure or forms
an integral part of the other structure.

(Ord. 984, 6/14/1999, Art. I, §139)
§27-113. Parking Facilities and Temporary Events.
1. Parking Facilities and Zoning District Regulations. All parking facilities are subject
to the regulations of the zoning district in which they are located unless this
Chapter specifically states otherwise. Furthermore, all parking garages are sub(

ject to the regulations on structures imposed by the zoning district in which they
are located.

of this Chapter may be waived by Borough Council for emergency or non-profit
temporary events.
(Ord. 984, 6/14/1999, Art. I, §142)
§27-114. Classification of Businesses That Consist of Several Uses.
For the purposes of this Chapter, businesses that consist of several land uses shall be
classified as the constituent land use that this Chapter regulates the most strictly. If a
land use is not a permitted use in a district, then any business which is partly composed
of that land use is not a permitted use in that district.
(Ord. 984, 6/14/1999, Art. I, §145)
§27-115. Zoning Permits.
1. When a Zoning Permit is Needed. Before a property owner may have a nonsign
structure erected, reconstructed or moved on his or her lot (unless this Chapter
specifically states otherwise) have a nonconforming, nonsign structure reconstructed
or moved on his or her lot (unless this Chapter specifically states otherwise),
or conduct an activity that the Zoning Officer determines as a result of an
application for a building permit or otherwise requires a zoning permit, he or she
must obtain a zoning permit. Part 6, "Signs," explains when zoning permits are
required for signs. No land improvements or other development activities shall be
commenced before the involved property owner has a zoning permit for these activities.
2. Procedure for Obtaining a Zoning Permit. Anyone who wishes to obtain a zoning
permit shall follow the procedure below:
A. Applications. Applications for a zoning permit shall be submitted in writing
on a form prescribed by the Zoning Officer along with payment of the required
fees set by Borough Council. Applications shall be submitted with
plans prepared in accordance with the Zoning Officer's requirements and
shall contain all of the information that is necessary to determine compliance
with this Chapter and all other pertinent ordinances and laws. An application
shall become a public record when it is officially filed.
B. Issuance or Denial of a Permit. An application shall not be officially filed
until all required information has been submitted. Within 30 days of this official
filing, the Zoning Officer shall either issue or deny the zoning permit.
The Zoning Officer shall not issue a permit unless it is determined that the
ZONING
27-14 4/9/2007
proposed development complies with the provisions of this Chapter and all
other pertinent ordinances and all other required approvals and permits
have been obtained from the applicable Borough, County, State and Federal
agencies. If these determinations are made, then the Zoning Officer shall issue
a zoning permit. If the Zoning Officer does not act on the application
within the required time period, then the permit shall be deemed to be issued.
3. Vested Rights. Nothing in this Chapter shall require any change in the development
or use of a lot or structure for which a zoning permit was lawfully issued
prior to the effective date of this Chapter's enactment (or the effective date of an
amendment to this Chapter); provided, that development (other than excavations)
has begun or contracts have been let pursuant to the permit. However, any zoning
permit which was issued after the first public hearing on this Chapter (or an
amendment to this Chapter) but prior to the effective date of this Chapter's enactment
(or the amendment's enactment) shall be declared void if the involved development
does not conform to the provisions of this Chapter, development (other
than excavations) has not begun and contracts have not been let pursuant to the
permit.
4. Development Changes. If a zoning permit is issued, the involved development
shall not deviate from the plans and other information submitted to the Zoning
Officer without the written approval of the Zoning Officer or the Borough Council
in the case of a conditional or temporary use and the Zoning Hearing Board in the
case of a special exception. Requests for all such approvals shall be submitted in
writing to the Zoning Officer.
5. Duration of Zoning Permits. A zoning permit shall expire within 1 calendar year
of the date of issuance if the involved development activities have not been commenced.
All development activities must be completed no later than 2 calendar
years from the date of issuance.
6. Inspections. In order to determine if the information submitted on or with an application
is true and is being adhered to, the Zoning Officer shall have the authority
to enter any building, structure, premises, property or development in the Borough
at any reasonable hour upon presentation of proper credentials.
7. Revocation of Permits. If the Zoning Officer discovers that the development does
not comply with the approved application or any applicable laws or ordinances, or
if the Zoning Officer determines that an applicant has made any false statements
or misrepresentations regarding the development, the Zoning Officer shall revoke
the zoning permit and proceed with whatever legal action is necessary to correct
the violation (see §27-160, "Enforcement").
8. Permits Issued in Error. Any zoning permits issued in error shall be null and void.
9. Appealing the Zoning Officer's Determination. The applicant may appeal the denial
of a zoning permit and aggrieved persons or neighbors may appeal the issu(

a Municipal Officer."
(Ord. 984, 6/14/1999, Art. I, §148)
§27-116. Occupancy Permits.
1. When an Occupancy Permit is Needed. Before any property owner may use or occupy
his or her new and/or vacant lot; use or occupy his or her new, reconstructed,
moved, and/or vacant nonsign structure or change the use of his or her nonsign
structure or lot, an occupancy permit must be obtained (unless this Chapter specifically
states otherwise). Part 6 explains when occupancy permits are needed for
signs.
2. Procedure for Obtaining an Occupancy Permit. After the completion of all development
activities, but before the involved structure and/or lot is used or occupied,
the applicant shall notify the Zoning Officer and pay the required fees set by Borough
Council.2 The Zoning Officer shall examine the involved structure and/or lot
within 10 days of this notification and payment. If the structure, lot and the involved
use comply with the provisions of this Chapter, other applicable ordinances
and laws and any plans approved for a zoning permit, then the Zoning Officer
shall issue an occupancy permit. Otherwise, he or she shall not. If the Zoning Officer
does not act within the required time period, then the permit shall be deemed
to be issued.
3. Temporary Occupancy Permits. The Zoning Officer may issue a temporary occupancy
permit which allows the use, partial use or occupancy of the involved structure
or lot during development activities. Such a permit shall be valid for no
longer than 3 months.
4. Inspections. In order to make the determinations required by subsection (2) of this
Section, the Zoning Officer shall have the authority to enter any building, structure,
premises, property or development in the Borough at any reasonable hour
upon presentation of proper credentials.
5. Revocation of Permits. If the Zoning Officer discovers that the applicant has made
any false statements or misrepresentations regarding the development, the Zoning
Officer shall revoke the occupancy permit and proceed with whatever legal action
is necessary to correct the violation (see §27-119, Enforcement).
6. Permits Issued in Error. Any occupancy permits issued in error shall be null and
void.
7. Appealing the Zoning Officer's Determination. The applicant may appeal the denial
of an occupancy permit and aggrieved persons or neighbors may appeal the

ZONING
27-16 4/9/2007
issuance of an occupancy permit, as specified in §27-169, Appealing the Determination
of a Borough Officer.
8. Duration of Occupancy Permits. Non-temporary occupancy permits shall be valid
for the life span of the involved development, except if that development is either
a temporary sign on private property (in which case the permit shall only be valid
for 30 days) or a temporary sign on a public right-of-way (in which case the permit
shall only be valid for 60 days).
(Ord. 984, 6/14/1999, Art. I, §151)
§27-117. Nonconformities.
1. Purpose, Organization and Applicability of this Section. A nonconformity is defined
for the purposes of this Chapter as a land use, lot or structure that was legally
established before the effective date of this Chapter's enactment (see §27-
106, "Effective Date of This Chapter") and does not conform to the substantive
regulations of this Chapter. Because nonconformities were legally established and
because their owners could not have known what the regulations of this Chapter
were going to be in advance, the owners have a legal and ethical right to continue
their nonconformities. However, this Chapter would be unable to fulfill most of its
purposes from §27-104 do much to protect the people, homes and businesses of
Philipsburg from facilities that do not follow this Chapter or have much of an effect
on the Borough over the next half-century if it could not eliminate nonconformities.
Thus, a compromise must be provided that allows the owners of nonconforming
uses, structures or lots to use and maintain these investments while this
Chapter gradually eliminates them. The purpose of this Section is to provide such
a compromise. Note that this Section does not regulate nonconforming signs, Part
6 does. With this sole exception, subsection (2) provides some rules concerning
nonconforming structures, land uses and lots. Subsection(3) only addresses nonconforming
structures and subsection (4) only addresses nonconforming land uses.
2. General Rules Concerning Nonconformities. The following rules apply to or concern
all nonconforming structures, land uses and lots:
A. The Zoning Officer shall keep and maintain a list of all nonconformities that
exist in the Borough on the effective date of this Chapter's enactment (see
§27-106, "Effective Date of This Chapter") and on the effective dates of any
amendments to either this Chapter or its map.
B. The owner of a nonconformity may obtain a "certificate of nonconformity"
from the Borough's Zoning Officer. This certificate shall state that the
owner's right to continue his or her nonconformity is guaranteed.
C. Aggrieved parties and the involved landowner may both appeal the Zoning
Officer's determination of whether or not a property is nonconforming ac(
27, PART 1)
4/9/2007 27-17
cording to the rules of §27-122, "Appealing the Determination of a Borough
Officer."
D. Any structure, land use, or lot that was illegally established under a previous
zoning ordinance or land use regulation shall remain illegal under this
Chapter, even if it conforms to the regulations of this Chapter. No illegal
structure, land use or lot shall become a nonconformity under this Chapter.
E. Any structure, land use, or lot that becomes a nonconformity due to an
amendment made after the effective date of this Chapter's enactment shall
be subject to the regulations of this Section.
3. Nonconforming Structures or Buildings. The following rules apply to all nonconforming
structures:
A. A nonconforming structure or building may be altered, enlarged, repaired or
reconstructed provided that:
(1) Its nonconformity or nonconformities are not increased.
(2) It will comply with the other applicable requirements of this Chapter.
(3) All necessary zoning and occupancy permits are obtained (see §§27-
115 and 27-116).
(4) It follows any applicable building codes.
(5) It has not been abandoned, which shall be defined as having its windows
or doors boarded up, having its maintenance discontinued and/or
being unused for a total of 12 months within an 18 month period
B. A nonconforming structure or building may be reconstructed after it is partially
destroyed by a natural or artificial disaster and any nonconforming
use within it may be continued; provided, that:
(1) The regulations under subsection (3)(A) above are followed.
(2) A zoning permit has been acquired for its reconstruction within 1 year
of the involved disaster.
(3) The damage to it does not exceed 99% of its fair market value.
C. A conforming use in a nonconforming structure may expand within that
structure.
4. Nonconforming Uses. The following rules apply to all nonconforming uses:
ZONING
27-18 4/9/2007
A. To allow for natural economic growth, a nonconforming use may expand in
terms of gross floor area or lot coverage; provided, that the use's owner can
prove to the Borough's Zoning Hearing Board, by way of the procedure outlined
in §27-702," Zoning Hearing Board"3, that:
(1) No aspect of the structure or structures that contain or will contain
the use shall become either nonconforming or more nonconforming
than it was before.
(2) The use does not expand on to property that was acquired after the
use became nonconforming.
(3) The expansion does not eliminate off-street parking spaces or loading
berths required by this Chapter.
(4) Such an expansion is necessary to accommodate a normal increase in
business.4
B. If a nonconforming use is changed to a conforming use, it shall not be subsequently
changed back to a nonconforming use.
C. A nonconforming use may be changed to another nonconforming use if the
use's owner can prove to the Borough's Zoning Hearing Board by way of the
procedure outlined in §27-702, "Zoning Hearing Board"5, that the proposed
use is the same type of use as the original use or is a use that conforms more
closely to the purpose and regulations6 of the involved zoning district than
the original use. In making a judgment on similar uses, the Zoning Hearing
Board shall be guided by the use classification system in the Standard Industrial
Classification Manual, Federal Office of Management and Budget,
current edition.
D. A nonconforming use that has been abandoned shall not be returned to a
nonconforming use of any kind. A nonconforming use shall be abandoned
when one or more of the following conditions have been met:
(1) The owner's intent to discontinue the use is apparent through such
actions as the boarding up of windows, the boarding up of entrances or
the discontinuation of maintenance.
3 Note: The Zoning Hearing Board's decision on this matter may be appealed to the Court of
Common Pleas of the judicial district in which the involved property is located.
4 Note: See Heyman v. Zoning Hearing Board of Abington Township, 601.1 2d 414 (Ps. Commonwealth
1991).
5 Note: The Zoning Hearing Boards decision on this matter may be appealed to the Court of
Common Pleas of the judicial district in which the involved property is located.
6 Note: Setbacks, height regulations, lot requirements and off-street parking and loading requirements
shall be considered here, along with any of this Chapter's other regulations that the
Zoning Hearing Board decides are relevant.
(27, PART 1)
4/9/2007 27-19
(2) The use has been discontinued for a total of 12 months within an 18
month period.
(3) The use has been replaced by a conforming use.
(4) The use has been changed to another nonconforming use as required
by subsection (C) above.
E. A special exception or conditional use shall not be considered a nonconforming
use, but rather a lawful conforming use.
F. Any use that exists at the effective date of this Chapter's enactment (see
§27-106, "Effective Date of This Chapter"), is allowed in its zoning district
only as a special exception or conditional use and has not been recognized as
a special exception or conditional use as required by Part 3, "Special Exceptions
and Conditional Uses," shall be a nonconforming use.
(Ord. 984, 6/14/1999, Art. I, §154)
§27-118. Variances.
1. Purpose of Variances. The regulations of this Chapter apply to and are designed
to address the conditions of either the entire Borough or an entire zoning district.
Thus, they are not precisely geared to any one property. The regulations were designed
in this manner to avoid unequal, unfair or arbitrary treatment of different
property owners. Because these generalized regulations were not designed with
any one property in mind; however, it is possible, in a few situations, that they
could prevent any use of a property. The function of a variance is to provide relief
from such a situation. A variance gives a property owner or tenant permission to
do something that violates a provision of this Chapter in order to keep him or her
from suffering an "unnecessary hardship" due to that provision. However, variances
should not be given freely. If every property owner or tenant who suffered
any kind of a hardship due to the regulations of this Chapter was granted a variance,
then this Chapter would be completely unable to fulfill its purposes and
would be nothing but a waste of time and money. Thus, subsection (4) below specifies
conditions that the Zoning Hearing Board is to use to distinguish genuine unnecessary
hardships from common inconveniences.
2. Who May Apply for a Variance. Any landowner or tenant who has the permission
his or her landowner may apply for a variance.
3. Procedure for Obtaining a Variance. A party listed in subsection (2) above who
wishes to obtain a variance must submit a written application to the Zoning Officer
on a form supplied by the Borough. This application shall specifically cite the
provisions of this Chapter from which the applicant is seeking relief. After determining
that the application is complete, the Zoning Officer shall forward the application
to the members of the Zoning Hearing Board. At the involved hearing,
ZONING
27-20 4/9/2007
the Zoning Hearing Board shall follow the procedure specified in §27-702, "Zoning
Hearing Board." If the Zoning Hearing Board decides to grant a variance, it may
attach any reasonable conditions that it feels are necessary to forward the purposes
of this Chapter. Appeals to the Board's decision may be made to the Centre
County Court of Common Pleas.
4. Conditions that the Zoning Hearing Board is to Use. The Zoning Hearing Board
may only grant a variance when it makes all of the following five findings:
A. There are unique and peculiar physical conditions present on the involved
property, such as the size, shape or topography of the involved lot, that were
not created by the provisions of this Chapter.
B. Because of these conditions, there is no possibility that the involved property
can be developed in strict conformity with the provisions of this Chapter
that if these provisions were rigidly implemented, the property would be
virtually unusable and without any economic value.
C. This unnecessary hardship was not created by the applicant property
owner/tenant or any of his or her predecessors.
D. The variance requested, if granted will not alter the essential character of
the involved neighborhood or zoning district, it will not substantially or
permanently impair the appropriate use or development of any adjacent
properties and will not be detrimental to the public welfare.
E. The variance, if granted, will be the smallest possible modification of the
involved regulation that will provide relief from this regulation.
(Ord. 984, 6/14/1999, Art. I, §157)
§27-119. Enforcement.
1. Purpose, Organization, and Applicability of this Section. The purpose of this Section
is to prescribe procedures that will effectively enforce the provisions of this
Chapter while protecting the legal rights of property owners and adhering to the
rules for zoning ordinance enforcement that are established in the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code (Act of 1968, P.L. 805, No. 247, as reenacted and
amended). These procedures apply to situations in which a person, partnership or
corporation erects, reconstructs, alters, maintains, establishes or uses a structure,
sign, building, lot or land use in a manner that violates one or more of the provisions
of this Chapter. In other words, these procedures apply to situations involving
an illegal structure, sign, lot or use. They do not apply to situations involving
a structure, sign, lot, or use that is a nonconformity (as defined in §27-117, "Nonconformities")
or that has a variance (as defined in §27-118, "Variances"). In
Pennsylvania, zoning ordinances are enforced through legal proceedings. These
proceedings may be instituted by the following groups of people.
(27, PART 1)
4/9/2007 27-21
A. The Borough Council.
B. An officer of the Borough (e.g., the Zoning Officer) with the approval of Borough
Council
C. An aggrieved party who would be substantially affected by the alleged violation
The procedure that is to be used by the first two of these groups is discussed under
subsection (2) below. The procedure that is to be used by aggrieved parties is
discussed under letter subsection (3) below.
2. Borough Enforcement Procedure. If it appears to the Borough that a violation of
this Chapter has occurred, then enforcement proceedings shall be instituted as
described below:
A. Before any other enforcement actions begin, the Zoning Officer shall send an
enforcement notice to the following parties:
(1) The owner of record of the parcel on which the violation has occurred.
(2) Any person who has filed a written request to receive enforcement notices
regarding the involved parcel.
(3) Any person that the owner requested, in writing, to receive a copy.
B. Each enforcement notice required by this Section shall contain:
(1) The name of the involved landowner and any other persons against
whom the Borough intends to take action.
(2) The location of the property in violation.
(3) A description of the specific violation involved.
(4) Citations and descriptions of the specific provisions of this Chapter
which have been violated.
(5) The date before which the steps for compliance must be commenced,
as well as the date before which these steps must be completed.
(6) A statement noting that the recipient has the right to appeal the enforcement
notice to the Zoning Hearing Board within 30 days and that
failure to comply with the notice within this time period, unless it is
extended by appeals, constitutes a violation of this Chapter, with possible
sanctions clearly described.
ZONING
27-22 4/9/2007
C. In a Zoning Hearing Board hearing where an enforcement notice is appealed,
the Borough shall present its evidence against the appellant first.
D. Any filing fees paid by a party to appeal an enforcement notice to the Zoning
Hearing Board shall be returned to that party by the Borough if the Board
or any court in a subsequent appeal rules in the appellant's favor.
E. After all necessary enforcement notices are sent as required above, the Borough
Council and officers of the Borough acting with Council's approval may
institute civil proceedings with the appropriate district justice to enforce the
provisions of this Chapter and to prevent, restrain, correct or abate an illegal
structure, sign, lot or land use. Any person, partnership or corporation
who has violated or permitted the violation of this Chapter shall, upon being
found liable in a civil enforcement proceeding, pay a judgment of not more
than $500 plus all court costs, including all reasonable attorney fees incurred
by the Borough. No penalties shall be imposed on the liable party until
the date of the determination of a violation by the involved district justice.
If the liable party neither pays nor appeals the judgment in a timely
manner, the Borough shall enforce the judgment pursuant to the applicable
rules of civil procedure.
F. Each day that a violation continues shall constitute a separate violation,
unless the district justice finds that there was a good faith basis for the liable
party to have believed that there was no such violation. In this situation,
there shall be only one violation until the fifth day following the date of
the determination of a violation by the district justice, after which each day
that the violation continues shall constitute a separate violation.
G. The court of common pleas, upon petition, may grant an order of stay, upon
cause shown, tolling the per diem fine pending a final adjudication of the
violation and judgment.
3. Aggrieved Party Enforcement Procedure. Aggrieved parties may file an equity action
in court (i.e., not with the district justice) to enforce the provisions of this
Chapter and prevent, restrain, correct or abate an illegal structure, sign, lot or
land use. Such parties may file such an action only after serving notice to the Borough
of Philipsburg at least 30 days in advance. This notice is to allow the Borough
time to investigate the situation and to issue a enforcement notice, if warranted.
(Ord. 984, 6/14/1999, Art. I, §160)
§27-120. Procedural Challenges.
1. Purpose and Applicability of this Section. The Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning
Code (Act of 1968, P.L. 805, No. 247, as reenacted and amended) specifies
procedures that are to be used to adopt and amend this Chapter. These proce(
27, PART 1)
4/9/2007 27-23
dures are designed to offer ample opportunities for public participation and to
make the Chapter as fair as possible. It is feasible; however, that this Chapter or
any one of its amendments was not adopted according to these procedures and
thus, is procedurally flawed. The purpose of this Section is to give landowners and
other parties aggrieved by such a flaw, as well as officers and agencies of the Borough
itself, a process through which they may challenge the procedural validity of
the Chapter or amendment. This process may be used to guarantee adequate public
participation and fairness in the adoption process and to overturn any unfair
ordinances or amendments.
2. Where Procedural Challenges may be Heard. The parties named in subsection (1)
above may file a procedural challenge with either the Centre County Court of
Common Pleas or the Zoning Hearing Board. However, challenges made to the
initial zoning ordinance before the Zoning Hearing Board is established may only
be taken to court. Procedural challenges taken to the Zoning Hearing Board may
have to follow the rules established by §27-123, "Time Limitations" and the Board
shall hear all such challenges according to the procedure given in §27-702, "Zoning
Hearing Board."7
3. Time Limitations. All such challenges shall be raised by an appeal taken within
30 days of the effective date of enactment for the involved ordinance or amendment.
(Ord. 984, 6/14/1999, Art. I, §163)
§27-121. Substantive Challenges.
1. Purpose and Applicability of this Section. The Constitution of the United States,
the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and various Federal and
State laws significantly limit what this Chapter may regulate, so that the rights
and property of Philipsburg's citizens and neighbors are protected. It is feasible;
however, that one or more of this Chapter's provisions violate these laws and are
thus, substantively flawed. The purpose of this Section is to give landowners and
other parties aggrieved by such a flaw, as well as officers and agencies of the Borough
itself, a process through which they may challenge the substantive validity
of the involved provision. This process may be used to ensure that this Chapter
respects the laws of the United States and the Commonwealth, as well as to overturn
any illegal or unconstitutional provisions.
2. Landowner Curative Amendments and Substantive Validity Challenges. A party
named under subsection (1) above who wishes to challenge the substantive validity
of this Chapter has the following two choices:
A. Applying to the Borough Council for a "landowner curative amendment."
7 Note: The Zoning Hearing Board's decision may be appealed to the relevant Court of Common
Pleas.
ZONING
27-24 4/9/2007
B. Requesting that the Zoning Hearing Board hear a substantive validity challenge.
A person or party who wishes to challenge the substantive validity of this Chapter
because he or she is aggrieved by a use or development permitted on another person's
land must first select the second choice. However, all of the other named
parties are free to choose from these options.
Landowner curative amendments and substantive validity challenges are essentially
the same type of appeal, with some minor procedural differences. A validity
challenge must be in writing and contain reasons for the challenge, but unlike the
curative amendment, does not have to contain materials describing the proposed
development or amendments.
When a landowner curative amendment proposal is approved by Borough Council,
a substantive validity challenge is sustained by the Zoning Hearing Board or the
relevant court sustains either of these actions in a final appeal, the involved developer
may file a subdivision application within 2 years and apply for a zoning
permit within 1 year without losing the rights granted to him in the relevant validity
challenge to a subsequent change or amendment in any land use ordinance.
3. Landowner Curative Amendments. Applications for a landowner curative
amendment shall be governed by the rules below:
A. All such applications shall be made to the Zoning Officer, who shall forward
them to the Borough Council. These applications may be subject to the time
limitations of §27-123 172, "Time Limitations."
B. All such applications shall be made in writing and shall contain the following:
(1) The reasons why the Chapter should be amended as proposed.
(2) Plans and explanatory materials describing the use or development
proposed by the landowner in lieu of the use or development allowed
by this Chapter (these plans must be of sufficient quality and detail to
allow an evaluation of this Chapter in light of the proposed use or development).
(3) The amendment or amendments that the landowner proposes to cure
the alleged defects in this Chapter.
C. The Borough Council shall hear and decide on applications for landowner
curative amendments as required in §27-703, "Borough Council."
D. Appeals to the Borough Council's decision shall be taken to the Centre
County Court of Common Pleas.

3. Substantive Validity Challenges Before the Zoning Hearing Board. Requests for a
hearing before the Zoning Hearing Board on a substantive validity challenge to
this Chapter shall be governed by the rules below:
A. All such requests shall be made to the Zoning Officer, who shall forward
them to the Zoning Hearing Board. These applications may be subject to the
time limitations of §27-123, "Time Limitations."
B. All such requests shall be made in writing and shall contain the reasons for
the involved challenge.
C. The Zoning Hearing Board shall decide whether or not to hear such a request
and whether or not to grant such a request according to the requirements
of §27-702, "Zoning Hearing Board."
D. Appeals to the Zoning Hearing Board's decision shall be taken to the Centre
County Court of Common Pleas.
(Ord. 984, 6/14/1999, Art. I, §166)
§27-122. Appealing the Determination of a Borough Officer.
1. Any landowner or party who is affected by a zoning-related determination of a
Borough officer (e.g., the Zoning Officer) may appeal this determination to the
Zoning Hearing Board. Such appeals may concern (but are not limited to):
A. The granting or denial of any permit, including a failure to act on the application
B. The issuance of any enforcement notice by way of §27-119, "Enforcement."
C. The registration or refusal to register any nonconforming use, structure or
lot.
2. Time limitations may be placed on such appeals by §27-123, "Time Limitations."
The Zoning Hearing Board shall hear all such appeals according to the provisions
of §27-702, "Zoning Hearing Board."
3. Any landowner or party who is affected by a zoning-related determination of a
Borough officer may also appeal this determination to the Centre County Court of
Common Pleas.

§27-123. Time Limitations.
1. The Purpose, Organization, and Applicability of this Section. If the period of time
in which a landowner could file an appeal concerning a decision that was adverse
to his or her proposed use or development was unlimited, then the difficulty and
costs of enforcing this Chapter could become prohibitively high. Likewise, if the
period of time in which a party who opposed this proposed use or development
could file an appeal concerning a decision that approved the use or development
was unlimited, then the costs of development could become prohibitively high. The
purpose of this Section is to avoid both of these situations by limiting the amount
of time that both landowners and aggrieved parties have to file for a hearing before
the Zoning Hearing Board or (where applicable) the Borough Council when a
proposed use or development is involved. The rules of this Section, which are
listed under subsection (2) below, only apply to:
A. A landowner who wishes to appeal a decision by the Zoning Officer not to
grant a zoning permit for his or her proposed construction, reconstruction,
alteration or other physical development (see §27-115, "Zoning Permits").
B. An aggrieved party who wishes to appeal a decision by the Zoning Officer to
grant a zoning permit to another party's proposed construction, reconstruction,
alteration or other physical development (see §27-115, "Zoning Permits").
C. A landowner who wishes to appeal a decision by the Zoning Officer not to
grant an occupancy permit for his or her proposed land use (see §27-116,
"Occupancy Permits").
D. An aggrieved party who wishes to appeal a decision by the Zoning Officer to
grant an occupancy permit to another party's proposed land use (see §27-
116, "Occupancy Permits").
E. A landowner or an aggrieved party who wishes to appeal a decision by the
Zoning Officer concerning the nonconforming status of a structure, land use
or lot (see §27-117, "Nonconformities").
F. A landowner who wishes to contest the Zoning Officer's issuance of an enforcement
notice for his property (see §27-119, "Enforcement").
G. A landowner who wishes to reverse or limit a decision that was made by the
Zoning Officer according to the provisions of this Chapter and opposes the
landowner's proposed use or development,8 by challenging the procedural or
substantive validity of this Chapter before either the Zoning Hearing Board
or (where applicable) Borough Council (see §27-120," Procedural Challenges"
or §27-121, "Substantive Challenges").
8 Note: Such a decision might involve the refusal of a zoning permit, an occupancy permit or
grant of nonconformity status.
(27, PART 1)
4/9/2007 27-27
H. An aggrieved party who wishes to reverse or limit a decision that was made
by the Zoning Officer according to the provisions of this Chapter and approves
a proposed use or development on another party's land,9 by challenging
the procedural or substantive validity of this Chapter before either the
Zoning Hearing Board or (where applicable) Borough Council (see §27-120,
"Procedural Challenges" or §27-121, "Substantive Challenges").
2. Time Limitation Rules.
A. If the reason behind a hearing before either the Zoning Hearing Board or
Borough Council is to reverse or limit the Zoning Officer's approval8 of a
third party's proposed use or development in any manner,10 then the request
for that hearing must be filed no later than 30 days after the involved approval
was given. If the person filing such a request has succeeded to his or
her interest after the involved approval was given, then he or she shall be
bound by the knowledge of his predecessor in interest.
B. All appeals from decisions11 that are adverse to the involved landowner
shall be filed with the involved body within 30 days of the notice of this decision.
(Ord. 984, 6/14/1999, Art. I, §172)
§27-124. Preliminary Opinions.
1. Purpose of Preliminary Opinions. According to §27-123, "Time Limitations" any
aggrieved party who wishes to stop or limit a proposed construction, reconstruction,
alteration or other physical development by challenging either the procedural
or substantive validity of this Chapter (see §27-120, "Procedural Challenges"
and §27-121, "Substantive Challenges") may only do so within 30 days of
the development's receiving a zoning permit (see §27-115, "Zoning Permits").
Likewise, any aggrieved party who wishes to stop or limit a proposed land use by
challenging either the procedural or substantive validity of this Chapter may only
do so within 30 days of the use's receiving an occupancy permit (see §27-116, "Occupancy
Permits"). "Preliminary opinions" are a tool that the landowner who is
proposing the involved development or use may employ to shorten this 30 day period.
9 Note: An "approval" might be the issuance of a zoning permit, the issuance of an occupancy
permit or the grant of nonconformity status.
10 Note: This includes procedural or substantive validity challenges. In these cases, the 30 day
period shall begin when the proposed construction, reconstruction, alteration or other physical
development receives its zoning permit or when the proposed use receives its occupancy permit.
11 Note: Such a "decision" might be the issuance of an enforcement notice or the denial of a zoning
permit, occupancy permit or nonconformity status.

2. Procedure for Obtaining a Preliminary Opinion. Preliminary opinions may be obtained
by following this procedure:
A. The involved landowner shall submit plans and other materials describing
his or her proposed use or development to the Zoning Officer for a preliminary
opinion on their compliance with the Chapters and maps that are applicable
at the time. These plans and materials must be of sufficient detail
and quality to allow the Zoning Officer to make a determination as to
whether or not the proposed use or development is in compliance.
B. If the Zoning Officer's preliminary opinion is that the proposed use or development
complies with all applicable ordinances and maps, then notice of
this shall be published once a week for 2 consecutive weeks in a newspaper
of general circulation within Philipsburg. This notice shall include a general
description of the proposed use or development, its location and the places
and times where the plans and other materials may be examined by the
general public.
C. The Zoning Officer's decision regarding a preliminary opinion may be appealed
to the Zoning Hearing Board (see §27-702, "Zoning Hearing Board")
or the Centre County Court of Common Pleas.
3. How an Approved Preliminary Opinion Affects the Time Limits of §27-123. If the
Zoning Officer approves the proposed use or development as specified under subsection
(2) above, then the 30 day period during which an aggrieved party may
stop or limit the proposed use or development by challenging the procedural or
substantive validity of this Chapter (see §27-120, "Procedural Challenges" and
§27-121, "Substantive Challenges") begins on the date that the second notice is
published instead of the date on which the proposed use or development receives
the applicable permit.
(Ord. 984, 6/14/1999, Art. I, §175)
§27-125. Appeals to Court.
The final adjudication of any Borough officer or body is appealable to the Centre County
Court of Common Pleas. Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to deny an appellant
the right to bypass either the Zoning Hearing Board or Borough Council and proceed
directly to court where appropriate. Furthermore, nothing in this Chapter shall be
construed to deny the right to bypass the procedures for challenging the procedural or
substantive validity of this Chapter that are given in this Part.

§27-126. Amending This Chapter.
This Chapter may be amended through a landowner curative amendment, a municipal
curative amendment or a common amendment. The purposes behind and procedures for
landowner curative amendments are given in §27-121, "Substantive Challenges." Municipal
curative amendments are only used by Borough Council, are used to cure substantial
validity problems within this Chapter, and are addressed in §27-703, "Borough
Council." Common amendments are also addressed in §27-703, "Borough Council."

PART 2
ZONING DISTRICT PROVISIONS
§27-201. Purposes, Organization and Applicability of This Part.
1. Purposes and Organization. The purposes served by this Chapter's regulations are
given in Part 1, §27-104, "General Purposes of This Chapter" and are taken from
the "Comprehensive Goals and Objectives" Section of the 1998 Philipsburg Comprehensive
Plan. In order to fulfill these purposes to the fullest extent possible,
recognize the differing present-day statuses and goals of Philipsburg's various
neighborhoods and eliminate unnecessary constraints on the Borough's property
owners, most of this Chapter's regulations should not be applied uniformly across
the Borough. Instead, they should be applied only to the areas of the Borough
where they are appropriate and will clearly fulfill the purposes of this Chapter. To
this end, §27-202 of this Part divides the Borough into 8 "zoning districts," each of
which is composed of neighborhoods with similar present-day status and goals
and faces a set of regulations that is different than the set faced by every other
zoning district. Section 27-203 establishes the "Official Zoning Map of the Borough
of Philipsburg," which shows the physical location of these districts. Each Section
of this Part from §§27-204 to 27-211 addresses one of these 8 zoning districts: providing
regulations that apply to that district, a reference to §27-212 (which lists
the land uses allowed, off-street parking spaces required and off-street loading
berths required in each zoning district) and a reference to §27-213 (which lists the
setbacks, height regulations and lot requirements of each district). In dealing with
some subjects, §§27-212 and 27-213 also reference various parts of the rest of this
Chapter.
2. Applicability: Sections 27-202 and 27-203 of this Part establish Philipsburg's 8
zoning districts and thus, apply to every property in the Borough. However, §§27-
204 through 27-211 each address only one zoning district. Thus, the only one of
these sections that applies to a given property is the section that addresses that
property's zoning district. Because §§27-212 and 27-213 are referred to by each
section from §§27-204 to 27-211, they apply to all zoning districts and thus to all
properties within the Borough. However, §§27-212 and 27-213 are arranged in a
table form, so that only one column within each table applies to any given zoning
district and the properties therein. Thus, the reader should read §§27-202, §27-
203 the Section between §§27-204 and 27-211 that applies to the zoning district of
the property in which he or she is interested, §27-212, §27-213 and any parts of
the rest of this Chapter that are referenced in this Part and relevant to the
reader's concerns.

§27-202. Establishment of Zoning Districts.
To properly carry out the purposes of this Chapter as listed in Part 1, §27-104, "General
Purposes of This Chapter," the Borough of Philipsburg is hereby divided into 8 zoning
districts. These districts shall be designated as follows:
The Zoning Districts Full Name
The Zoning District's
Abbreviated Name
Single Household Suburban Residential District R1A
Single Household Urban Residential District R1B
Multi-Household Residential District R2
Special Residential District R3
Downtown Commercial District C1
Highway Commercial District C2
Industrial District I
Recreation/Conservation District RC
(Ord. 984, 6/14/1999, Art. II, §205)
§27-203. Establishment of the Official Zoning Map.
1. Official Zoning Map of the Borough of Philipsburg. The locations and boundaries
of the districts listed in §27-202 shall be displayed on the "Official Zoning Map of
the Borough of Philipsburg." This map shall be certified as the true zoning district
map adopted by the Borough of Philipsburg by the signature of the Council President
attested to by the Borough Secretary the Seal of the Borough underneath the
words "This is to certify that this is the Official Zoning Map referred to in the
Philipsburg Borough Zoning Ordinance." The Official Zoning Map shall be kept on
display at the Borough Building, shall be maintained by the Borough's Zoning Officer
and shall serve as the ultimate authority on the location of zoning district
boundaries overruling all copies made of it. The "Official Zoning Map of the Borough
of Philipsburg" and all information shown thereon are hereby made a part of
this Part and this Chapter.
2. Zoning Map in the Appendix. For informational purposes only, a copy of the Official
Zoning Map has been attached to this Chapter as an Appendix. However, the
Official Zoning Map shall prevail in any dispute between a copy or an alleged copy
of the Official Map and the Official Map itself.
3. Amending the Official Zoning Map. Amendments to the Official Zoning Map of the
Borough of Philipsburg may be pursued as either a simple amendment to this
Chapter, a landowner curative amendment or a municipal curative amendment
(see Part 7, §27-703, "Borough Council," for the proper procedures for each of
(27, PART 2)
4/9/2007 27-33
these). Any changes made to the Official Zoning Map by any other means whatsoever
shall be considered a violation of this Chapter punishable as provided under
Part 1, §27-119, "Enforcement." If an amendment is made to the zoning districts,
the Official Zoning Map shall be changed accordingly in a prompt manner. With
these changes, an entry shall be made on the map which states "On (the appropriate
date), by official action of the Borough Council, the following changes were
made to the Official Zoning Map." Brief descriptions of these changes shall be
made beneath this statement and the entire entry shall be signed by the Council
President and attested to by the Borough Secretary.12
4. Rules for Interpreting the Official Zoning Map. The zoning district boundaries established
on the Official Zoning Map of the Borough of Philipsburg shall be interpreted
according to the following rules.
A. Boundaries indicated as approximately following natural features or the
centerlines of streets, highways or alleys shall be construed to follow such
center lines.
B. Boundaries indicated as approximately following the boundary line of a recorded
lot or separate parcel of land shall be construed as following said line
of recorded lot or parcel of land.
C. Boundaries indicated as approximately following Borough boundaries shall
be construed to follow said Borough boundaries.
D. Boundaries indicated by measured distances on the zoning map shall be determined
by such dimensions. Distances not specifically indicated on the
zoning map shall be determined by the scale of the map.
(Ord. 984, 6/14/1999, Art. II, §210)
§27-204. R1A Single Household Suburban Residential District.
1. District Purposes. The R1A District was drawn to include already developed lowdensity
residential areas that are predominantly composed of single household detached
homes and open areas where similar development should occur. This district's
regulations are designed to protect the district's established single household
homes, promote similar development in the vacant parts of the district, retain
the district's low density, require proper design standards for future development
and enhance the unique character of this district, its structures and its
quality of life.
2. R1A District Regulations. Each land use, lot, and structure in this district shall
follow the regulations below.

ZONING
27-34 4/9/2007
A. Within this district, a lot may be used or occupied for the permitted principal
uses, permitted accessory uses, temporary uses, special exception uses
and conditional uses that are given for this district in §27-212, "Land Uses,
Off-Street Parking and Off-Street Loading."
B. Each land use in this district shall provide off-street parking spaces as required
by §27-212, "Land Uses, Off-Street Parking and Off-Street Loading."
C. Each land use in this district shall provide off-street loading berths as required
by §27-121, "Land Uses, Off-Street Parking and Off-Street Loading."
D. Unless this Chapter specifically states otherwise, all buildings and lots in
this district shall meet the setback requirements, height limitations and lot
restrictions that are specified for this district in §27-213, "Setbacks, Height
Regulations and Lot Requirements."
E. Within this district, no accessory structure shall contain a dwelling.
F. Supplies, parts and/or equipment shall not be stored overnight outside of a
building in this district.
G. Vehicles which meet one or more of the following descriptions shall not be
parked, placed, stored, restored, or repaired in any yard or driveway or on
any public street or right-of-way in this district.
(1) A vehicle from which the wheels and/or engine have been removed.
(2) A vehicle which does not have a current motor vehicle license and inspection
sticker.
H. The following vehicle types shall not be parked overnight on a public rightof-
way in this district.
(1) Any truck or van that either exceeds 11,000 pounds of gross weight or
is designated as a Class 5 Vehicle or above by the Pennsylvania Motor
Vehicle Code.
(2) Construction vehicles.
(3) Recreational vehicles.
(4) Trailers of any kind, including boat trailers or camper trailers.
(5) Agricultural equipment or farm implements.
I. Within this district, all residences shall be secured or tied down to a foundation
that is adequate to prevent the home from overturning under all but
the most severe circumstances. Where the residence is supported by a non(
27, PART 2)
4/9/2007 27-35
continuous foundation (e.g., posts, wheels, pillars), an enclosure of material
and design compatible to the residence shall be installed to conceal the open
space above grade. Such enclosure shall provide sufficient ventilation to inhibit
decay and deterioration of the residence's foundation, but shall not
contain open areas large enough to permit the entry of a ball with a diameter
of 2 inches.
J. Within this district, a building that contains a dwelling shall be the only
principal permitted use on the involved lot.
(Ord. 984, 6/14/1994, Art. II, §215)
§27-205. R1B Single Household Urban Residential District.
1. District Purposes. The R1B District was drawn to include two medium-density,
pedestrian-friendly neighborhoods that are largely composed of single-household
detached homes and small, scattered commercial establishments. Although these
neighborhoods contain a variety of activities, they are predominantly singlehousehold
residential and should stay that way. Hence, only single-household
homes and family oriented amenities are allowed in this district as permitted
principal uses. Small commercial and professional uses, as well as multihousehold
residential buildings, are allowed only as special exceptions subject to
conditions specified in Part 3 that are to ensure their compatibility by limiting
their size and character. The remainder of the R1B District's regulations are designed
to retain the district's predominantly residential composition and flavor, to
guarantee that the district's small commercial establishments are largely compatible
with this residential flavor, to limit the district's density at its current levels,
to ensure that future development is built to standards that are appropriate
for this district and to enhance the unique character of this district, its structures
and its quality of life.
2. R1B District Regulations. Each land use, lot, and structure in this district shall
follow the regulations below:
A. Within this district, a lot may be used or occupied for the permitted principal
uses, permitted accessory uses, temporary uses, special exception uses,
and conditional uses that are given for this district in §27-212, "Land Uses,
Off-Street Parking and Off-Street Loading."
B. Each land use in this district shall provide off-street parking spaces as required
by §27-212, "Land Uses, Off-Street Parking and Off-Street Loading."
C. Each land use in this district shall provide off-street loading berths as required
by §27-212, "Land Uses, Off-Street Parking and Off-Street Loading."
D. Unless this Chapter specifically states otherwise, all buildings and lots in
this district shall meet the setback requirements, height limitations and lot
ZONING
27-36 4/9/2007
restrictions that are specified for this district in §27-213, "Setbacks, Height
Regulations and Lot Requirements."
E. Within this district, no accessory structure shall contain a dwelling.
F. The following vehicle types shall not be parked overnight on a public rightof-
way in this district.
(1) Any truck or van that either exceeds 11,000 pounds of gross weight or
is designated as a Class 5 vehicle or above by the Pennsylvania Motor
Vehicle Code.
(2) Construction vehicles.
(3) Recreational vehicles.
(4) Trailers of any kind, including boat trailers or camper trailers.
(5) Agricultural equipment or farm implements.
G. Within this district, all residences shall be secured or tied down to a foundation
that is adequate to prevent the home from overturning under all but
the most severe circumstances. Where the residence is supported by a noncontinuous
foundation (e.g., posts, wheels, pillars), an enclosure of material
and design compatible to the residence shall be installed to conceal the open
space above grade. Such enclosure shall provide sufficient ventilation to inhibit
decay and deterioration of the residence's foundation, but shall not
contain open areas large enough to permit the entry of a ball with a diameter
of 2 inches.
(Ord. 984, 6/14/1999, Art. II, §220)
§27-206. R2 Multi-Household Residential District.
1. District Purposes. The R2 District was drawn to include a neighborhood of medium
density residential buildings, many of which are large, older homes. Because
many of the large, older homes are too large to be financially supported by a single
household and multi-household buildings are an attractive housing option for
many of the Borough's present and future residents, this district's regulations allow
residential buildings to contain more than one dwelling as a special exception.
The other provisions of this district are designed to protect the established homes
in the district, to require proper design standards for future development and to
enhance the unique character of this district, its structures and its quality of life.
2. R2 District Regulations. Each land use, lot and structure in this district shall follow
the regulations below.
(27, PART 2)
4/9/2007 27-37
A. Within this district, a lot may be used or occupied for the permitted principal
uses, permitted accessory uses, temporary uses, special exception uses,
and conditional uses that are given for this district in §27-212, "Land Uses,
Off-Street Parking and Off-Street Loading."
B. Each land use in this district shall provide off-street parking spaces as required
by §27-212, "Land Uses, Off-Street Parking and Off-Street Loading."
C. Each land use in this district shall provide off-street loading berths as required
by §27-212, "Land Uses, Off-Street Parking and Off-Street Loading."
D. Unless this Chapter specifically states otherwise, all buildings and lots in
this district shall meet the setback requirements, height limitations and lot
restrictions that are specified for this district in §27-213, "Setbacks, Height
Regulations and Lot Requirements."
E. Supplies, parts, and/or equipment shall not be stored overnight outside of a
building in this district.
F. Vehicles which meet one or more of the following descriptions shall not be
parked, placed, stored, restored or repaired in any yard or driveway or on
any public street or right-of-way in this district.
(1) A vehicle from which the wheels and/or engine have been removed.
(2) A vehicle which does not have a current motor vehicle license and inspection
sticker.
G. The following vehicle types shall not be parked overnight on a public rightof-
way in this district.
(1) Any truck or van that either exceeds 11,000 pounds of gross weight or
is designated as a Class 5 vehicle or above by the Pennsylvania Motor
Vehicle Code.
(2) Construction vehicles.
(3) Recreational vehicles.
(4) Trailers of any kind, including boat trailers or camper trailers.
(5) Agricultural equipment or farm implements.
H. Within this district, all residences shall be secured or tied down to a foundation
that is adequate to prevent the home from overturning under all but
the most severe circumstances. Where the residence is supported by a noncontinuous
foundation (e.g., posts, wheels, pillars), an enclosure of material
and design compatible to the residence shall be installed to conceal the open
ZONING
27-38 4/9/2007
space above grade. Such enclosure shall provide sufficient ventilation to inhibit
decay and deterioration of the residence's foundation, but shall not
contain open areas large enough to permit the entry of a ball with a diameter
of 2 inches.

§27-207. R3 Special Residential District.
1. District Purposes. The R3 District was drawn to include both already developed
mobile home neighborhoods and open areas where similar development should occur.
Mobile homes can be a relatively affordable and attractive housing option for
many of the Borough's present and future residents. Thus, the provisions of this
district are designed to promote mobile home parks as a supply of affordable housing,
to allow compatible residential amenities to locate within this district, to protect
these neighborhoods from development that is improperly designed or dangerous
and to foster a family-oriented environment.
2. R3 District Regulations. Each land use, lot, and structure in this district shall follow
the regulations below:
A. Within this district, a lot may be used or occupied for the permitted principal
uses, permitted accessory uses, temporary uses, special exception uses
and conditional uses that are given for this district in §27-212, "Land Uses,
Off-Street Parking and Off-Street Loading."
B. Each land use in this district shall provide off-street parking spaces as required
by §27-212, "Land Uses, Off-Street Parking and Off-Street Loading."

the most severe circumstances. Where the residence is supported by a noncontinuous
foundation (e.g., posts, wheels, pillars), an enclosure of material
and design compatible to the residence shall be installed to conceal the open
space above grade. Such enclosure shall provide sufficient ventilation to inhibit
decay and deterioration of the residence's foundation, but shall not
contain open areas large enough to permit the entry of a ball with a diameter
of 2 inches.

§27-208. C1 Downtown Commercial District.
1. District Purposes. The C1 District was drawn around Philipsburg's current central
business district (CBD). This district's provisions are designed to protect vital
aspects of the commercial mix that is currently found in downtown Philipsburg; to
permit and promote compatible commercial development, to allow upper-story
dwellings in commercial buildings, to allow multi-family residential buildings subject
to the approval of the Zoning Hearing Board, to permit future development to
reach high densities, subject to constraints that will ensure that it is built to appropriate
standards and to enhance the unique character of this district, its structures
and its quality of life.

§27-211. RC Recreation/Conservation District.
1. District Purposes. The RC District was drawn to include Borough properties, larger
Philipsburg-Osceola Area School District properties and several large tracts of
open, public and/or recreational space. These properties are either especially sensitive

§27-212. Land Uses, Off-Street Parking and Off-Street Loading.
1. Purposes, Organization and Applicability of this Section. The main function of
this Section is to show five different sets of information which land uses are allowed
in each of Philipsburg's zoning districts, how each use is allowed in each
district, which sections of the remainder of this Chapter (i.e., Parts 3 through 8)
apply to each use, how many off-street parking spaces each use must provide and
how many off-street loading berths each use must provide. The organization and
applicability of this Section's parts that deal with the first three of these sets are
discussed under number subsection (A) below. The organization and applicability
of this Section's parts that deal with the last two of these sets are discussed under
subsection (B) below. These five sets of information are all shown in this Section
because they are all organized by land uses and can therefore be displayed on a
single multi-page table saving space and making the Chapter easier to read. This
multi-page table is located under subsection (4) of this Section.
A. Organization and Applicability of the Land Use. The main body of regulations
in this Section is contained in the multi-page table of subsection (4).
The first 9 columns of this table contain the land use regulations of this
Chapter. Subsection (2) below explains how to read the information presented
in these columns. Because these land use regulations apply to every
zoning district within the Borough, they apply to every land use within the
Borough as well.
B. Organization and Applicability of the Off-Street Parking and Loading Regulations.
As was noted above, the main body of regulations in this Section is
contained in the multi-page table of subsection (4). The tenth column of this
table (the second from the right) contains this Chapter's minimum off-street
parking space requirements for each land use. The eleventh column (the farthest
right) contains this Chapter's minimum off-street loading berth requirements
for each land use. subsection (3) below explains how to read the
information presented in each of these columns and provides some important
interpretative rules. These regulations apply to every land use allowed
(27, PART 2)
4/9/2007 27-45
in the Borough. However, the required number of parking spaces and loading
berths for many land uses (e.g., signs) is zero.
2. Land Uses. How to Read the First Nine Columns of the Table in Subsection (4).
The first nine columns of the table in subsection (4) of this Section show which
land uses are allowed in each of Philipsburg's 8 zoning districts, how each use is
allowed in each district and which Sections of the remainder of this Chapter (i.e.,
Parts 3 through 8) apply to each use. The information in these columns shall be
interpreted as shown in this subsection:
A. The first (i.e., farthest left) column of the table in subsection (4) lists the
land uses allowed in the Borough of Philipsburg. Each row of the table addresses
the land use given in its cell under the first column.
B. Each of the second through ninth columns of the table in subsection (4) addresses
one of the Borough's 8 zoning districts, whose abbreviated name is
given in its heading. The characters found in these 8 columns shall be interpreted
as shown in the table below.13
C. For land uses not listed in the table under subsection (4) the Zoning Hearing
Board shall determine which zoning districts they shall be allowed in, how
they shall be allowed in those districts (i.e., as permitted principal uses,
permitted accessory uses, conditional uses, etc.) and which Sections of the
remainder of the Chapter apply to them. The Board may ask the Planning
Commission for a recommendation on these matters.
3. Off-Street Parking Spaces and Loading Berths. How to Read the Last Two Columns
of the Table in Subsection (4). The tenth (second from the right) column of
the table in subsection (4) specifies a minimum number of off-street parking
spaces that are to be provided by each land use in the Borough (this number may
be zero). The last (farthest right) column of the table specifies a minimum number
of off-street loading berths that are to be provided by each land use in the Borough
(this number may also be zero). Because the number of off-street parking spaces
and/or loading berths needed by a land use varies with the type of land use involved
and the size of this land use, the table gives these requirements as usespecific
formulas that employ size as a variable to tailor the requirements to the
particular home, business or institution at hand. Unless the table notes otherwise,
each requirement applies only to the land use given in the first cell of its row. The
information in both of these columns shall be interpreted as shown in this subsection:
A. Rules for Determining the Required Number of Off-Street Parking Spaces
from the 10th Column of the Table.

and its key can be found at the end of this chapter.
ZONING
27-46 4/9/2007
(1) The table's off-street parking requirements address only the quantity
of the spaces that are to be provided. The location, size, design and
maintenance of these spaces is controlled by §27-506, "Off-Street
Parking Space and Loading Berth Design." Each parking space in the
Borough shall follow the requirements of §27-506.
(2) Unless the table explicitly states otherwise, a lot or a business that
contains more than one use shall provide 100% of the required offstreet
parking spaces for each of these uses. The off-street parking requirement
for convenience stores is an example of an instance in
which the table does specifically state otherwise ("1 space per each
200 square feet. of enclosed gross floor area + 80% of the additional
parking spaces required by this Table for other land uses on the same
premises (e.g., gasoline station).
(3) When calculations for a use's required number of parking spaces result
in a fraction of a space, this fraction shall be rounded up to the
next whole number.
(4) Where the required number of parking spaces for a use is wholly or
partially determined by the number of employees that use has or will
have, this shall be interpreted as the number of employees that use
has or will have on its largest shift.
(5) On a residential lot containing two dwellings or less, a driveway may
count as the number of 8 feet wide by 18 feet long parking spaces that
would fit on it.
(6) Each land use shall provide at least all of the required off-street parking
spaces on its own lot unless that use shares parking spaces with
other uses who need parking at differing times, employs parking
spaces on other lots that are nearby, draws a significant number of
clients who walk or ride bicycles and/or cannot meet these requirements
due to existing site constraints. If a use fits one or more of
these descriptions, it may be excused from the minimum off-street
parking requirements of this Section by way of the procedures and
conditions specified by §27-507, "Off-Street Parking and Loading
Plans."
(7) When an existing land use or structure is expanded, additional parking
spaces shall be provided as required by the table. However, no expansion,
alteration, subdivision or combination of any lot, structure or
land use shall reduce or eliminate any pre-existing off-street parking
requirements from this Chapter.
(8) The off-street parking space requirements of land uses that are not
listed in the table or lots or buildings whose use is not yet known to
the level of detail required by the Table shall be determined by Bor(
27, PART 2)
4/9/2007 27-47
ough Council who may ask for a recommendation on the matter from
the Planning Commission.
B. Rules for Determining the Required Number of Off-Street Loading Berths
from the Last Column of the Table.
(1) Uses which have a gross floor area of less than 2,500 square feet are
exempt from all off-street loading berth requirements of this Chapter.
(2) The table's off-street loading requirements address only the quantity
of the berths that are to be provided. The location, size, design and
maintenance of these berths is controlled by §27-506, "Off-Street
Parking Space and Loading Berth Design." Each loading berth in the
Borough shall follow the requirements of §27-506.
(3) Unless the table explicitly states otherwise, a lot or structure that
contains more than one use shall provide 100% of the required loading
berths for each of these uses.
(4) When calculations for a use's required number of loading berths result
in a fraction of a berth, this fraction shall be rounded up to the next
whole number.
(5) Each land use shall provide at least all of the required off-street loading
berths on its own lot unless that use cannot meet this requirement
due to existing site constraints. In such a situation, the use may be
excused from the minimum off-street loading requirements of this section
via the procedures and conditions specified by §27-507, "Off-
Street Parking and Loading Plans."
(6) When an existing land use or structure is expanded, additional loading
berths shall be provided as required by the table. However, no expansion,
alteration, subdivision, or combination of any lot, structure,
or land use shall reduce or eliminate any pre-existing off-street loading
requirements from this Chapter.
(7) The loading berth requirements of land uses that are not listed in the
table below and lots or buildings whose use is not yet known to the
level of detail required by the Table below shall be determined by Borough
Council, who may ask for a recommendation on the matter from
the Planning Commission.
4. Land Use, Off-Street Parking and Off-Street Loading Requirements Table. All
lots, structures and land uses in the Borough of Philipsburg shall follow the requirements

§27-213. Setbacks, Height Regulations and Lot Requirements.
1. Purposes, Organization and Applicability of this Section. The function of this Section
is to provide district-specific minimum setback restrictions for structures,
maximum setback restrictions for structures, maximum height regulations for
structures, minimum area requirements for lots, minimum frontage requirements
for lots and maximum lot coverage requirements for structures. The main body of
this Section's regulations can be found in the Table under subsection (3). The
various regulations discussed above form this Table's rows and Philipsburg's 8
zoning districts form the Table's columns. Exceptions to the regulations shown in
this Table are listed under subsection (2). Note that the exact definitions of the
terms and regulations used in this Section can be found in Part 8, Terminology.
Because the regulations of this Section apply to each of Philipsburg's 8 zoning districts.
they apply to every building, structure and lot in the Borough except those
noted under subsection (2) below.
2. Exceptions to the Regulations of this Section.
A. Building and structure projections may exceed the height limits of their district
if they are one of the following items.
(1) A chimney or smokestack.
(2) A public or commercial communications tower that contains public or
commercial communications equipment and is mounted on the
ground. However, commercial communications equipment that rises
from the roof of a building shall not be exempted from the height requirements
of its district.
(3) An integral part of a commercial or industrial process whose height is
necessary in order for the process to work (e.g., a grain elevator).
(4) A steeple, cupola, spire, belvedere, turret, or other similar architectural
element that rises from the roof of a building, but does not include
a dwelling.
B. Fences, walls and other screens may ignore this section's setback requirements,
but must follow the requirements of §503, "Fences, Walls and Other
Screens." Likewise, radio and television antennas may ignore this Section's
setback requirements, but must follow the requirements of §504, "Radio

PART 3
SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS AND CONDITIONAL USES
§27-301. Purposes, Organization and Applicability of This Part.
1. Both a "special exception" and a "conditional use" are permissions granted to an
applicant to use land in a zoning district for a purpose or land use that is not permitted
outright (i.e., that is not a permitted principal or accessory use) in that district.
Special exceptions and conditional uses are utilized by this Chapter because
merely allowing and not allowing land uses is too narrow for sound planning in
some zoning districts. Some land uses fall in between what is consistent and what
is not consistent with a district's planned way of life. Furthermore, some uses
should be located in a district, but should be very carefully sited or controlled in
order to protect the district's overall quality of life. Establishing a special exception/
conditional use system for Philipsburg that allows such land uses in appropriate
zoning districts, subject to location and operation standards that are to protect
the quality of life in those districts, is the general purpose of this Part.
2. The major difference between special exceptions and conditional uses is that the
former are granted or denied by the Zoning Hearing Board, while the latter are
granted or denied by the Borough Council. Land uses that are allowed as special
exceptions generally affect only their particular neighborhoods, while land uses
that are allowed as conditional uses may affect the entire Borough and thus,
should be under the jurisdiction of the Borough's primary elected officials (i.e., the
Council). The multi-page table under §27-212(4), "Land Uses, Off-Street Parking
and Off-Street Loading" and other parts of this Chapter state which land uses are
allowed in which zoning districts as special exceptions, and which land uses are

elementary or secondary school, public library; child care
facility; child-oriented business, nursery school or affected public park.
For the purposes of subsection (2) below, measurements shall be made
in a straight line without regard to intervening structures or objects
from the closest exterior wall of the structure in which each sexually
oriented business is located.
(3) A sexually oriented business that is legally operating on the effective
date of this Chapter's enactment (see §27-106, "Effective Date of This
Chapter's Enactment" and in violation of subsections (1) or (2) below
shall be deemed a nonconforming use (see §27-117, "Nonconformities").
However, no sexually oriented business shall be deemed a nonconforming
use due to the subsequent location of a church; public or
private pre-elementary, elementary or secondary school; public library;
child care facility; child-oriented business, nursery school or
public park within 150 feet of that business. Sexually oriented businesses
may be permitted as special exceptions only if:

PART 4
TEMPORARY USES
§27-401. Purposes, Organization and Applicability of This Part.
1. Section 27-212, "Land Uses, Off-Street Parking and Off-Street Loading," specifies
that some land uses may be established in certain zoning districts as "temporary
uses." This means that these uses may be operated in these districts only for a
limited period of time and only if they are approved by Borough Council. These
uses are typically a worthwhile or even vital part of modern community life. However,
the drastic effects that they can sometimes have on their neighborhoods necessitates
their having a limited lifespan and being under the jurisdiction of
Council. Establishing such a temporary use system for Philipsburg is the general
purpose of this Part.
2. It is important to note that temporary uses like special exceptions and conditional
uses are not deviations from this Chapter or its purposes listed in §27-104, "General
Purposes of This Chapter." These uses are both envisioned by this Chapter
and if the provisions of this article are followed permitted by this Chapter.
3. The procedure that an applicant is to use to obtain a temporary use is spelled out
in §27-402, "Procedure for Obtaining a Temporary Use." The standards that the
Borough Council is to use in determining whether or not a temporary use should
be granted to an applicant and how long the temporary use should be allowed to
exist are provided in §27-403, "Standards that are to be Used to Grant a Temporary
Use." This Part only applies to land uses that are proposed to be established
in a zoning district where they are allowed as temporary uses by §27-212, "Land
Uses, Off-Street Parking and Off-Street Loading."
(Ord. 984, 6/14/1999, Art. IV, §400)
§27-402. Procedure for Obtaining a Temporary Use.
All applications for temporary uses shall be made according to the following rules:
A. Who May Apply. Any landowner or tenant with the written permission of
his or her landowner may apply for a temporary use.
B. Land Uses that may be Permitted through a Temporary Use. The only land
uses that may be permitted through a temporary use are those that are expressly
permitted as temporary uses in the involved zoning district by §27-
212, "Land Uses, Off-Street Parking and Off-Street Loading."
C. Applying to the Zoning Officer. Any one of the aforementioned parties who
wishes to establish a temporary use shall file an application with the Zoning
ZONING
27-70 4/9/2007
Officer on a form supplied by the Borough. This application shall state the
period of time during which the applicant wishes to operate the proposed
use, and shall not be considered complete unless enough information is included
on the form to enable Borough Council to determine if the proposed
use meets the standards of §27-403. Upon receiving a complete application,
the Zoning Officer shall forward it to Borough Council.
D. The Procedure that Borough Council is to Use in Deciding on a Temporary
Use Application. The procedure that Borough Council is to use in deciding
whether or not to grant a temporary use is given in §27-703(2), "Borough
Council."
E. Burdens of Proof. In temporary use hearings, the burden of proof shall be on
the applicant to prove that his or her proposed use meets the standards prescribed
for it by S§27-403, "Standards that are to be Used to Grant a Temporary
Use."
F. Appealing the Decision of the Borough Council. The decision of the Borough
Council regarding a temporary use application may be appealed to the Centre
County Court of Common Pleas.
G. Occupancy Permits. An applicant who successfully applies for a temporary
use must also obtain an occupancy permit for that use after all development
activities on the involved site are completed. §27-116, "Occupancy Permits"
explains how to obtain such a permit.
H. Violations. If a party that receives a temporary use subsequently violates
the standards under which that use was granted, those standards shall be
enforced according to the provisions of §27-119, "Enforcement."
(Ord. 984, 6/14/1999, Art. IV, §405)
§27-403. Standards That are to be Used to Grant a Temporary Use.
1. Purpose and Organization of this Section. The purpose of this Section is to provide
standards that the Borough Council is to use in deciding whether or not to grant a
temporary use and determining how long an approved temporary use should be
allowed to exist. The former set of standards are listed under subsection (2) below,
while the latter set are listed under subsection (3). Each land use or activity that
is permitted as a temporary use in one or more zoning districts by §27-212, "Land
Uses, Off-Street Parking and Off-Street Loading" is listed in alphabetical order
below:
Temporary Uses
Zoning Districts In Which
They Are Permitted

that is not in the above category
C1, C2, and I
2. Standards that the Borough Council is to Use in Determining Whether or Not to
Grant a Temporary Use. Borough Council may only grant a temporary use to an
applicant if the applicant:
A. Provides proof that the proposed use will have adequate off-street parking.
B. Provides proof that the proposed use will have adequate pedestrian and
traffic access.
C. Has obtained all licenses and permits on the proposed use's behalf that governmental
agencies may require for the selling or handling of food or other
products.
D. Has notified the Borough's Chief of Police and Fire Chief of the proposed
use.
E. Provides Council with a letter from the owner of the land on which the proposed
use will occur that approves the use (if the applicant does not own the
land himself).
F. Provides Council with a letter stating that he or she will assume responsibility
for any on-site activities that are directly related to the proposed temporary
use.
3. Standards that the Borough Council is to Use in Determining How Long a Temporary
Use Should be Allowed to Exist. If an application for a temporary use is approved,
Council shall determine the dates between which the use will be permitted
to operate. In making this determination, Council shall weigh the temporary
use's benefit to the community against any burdens that it may cause its
neighbors. However, the Council shall not allow a single land use to have temporary
sales events for more than 30 days in any calendar year.

PART 5
SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS
§27-501. General Purpose and Applicability of This Part.
There are sets of regulations in this Chapter that apply to land uses, lots and/or structures
that can be located in several of Philipsburg's zoning districts. Some of these regulations
are given just once in this Part. This is a simpler and shorter way of providing
these regulations than repeating them once in each applicable zoning district's provisions
(zoning district provisions constitute Part 2). Thus, each Section of this Part is applicable
to a particular land use, lot or structure in a particular zoning district only if
Part 2 says so.
(Ord. 984, 6/14/1999, Art. V, §500)
§27-502. Home Occupations.
1. Purposes, Organization and Applicability of this Section. A home occupation is
defined as a business that is conducted entirely within a dwelling unit, entirely by
the members of the household residing in that unit and in a manner that is clearly
incidental, accessory and subordinate to the unit's primary residential use. Most
modern zoning ordinances regulate home occupations because of the deleterious
effects that these businesses can have on their neighborhoods. A home occupation
can congest its neighborhood's parking spaces and streets, generate intrusive
amounts of noise, vibration, glare, electrical interference, odors and radio/
television signal disruption, draw large trucks for delivery purposes, erect a
disturbing number of signs, utilize unsightly outdoor storage areas and generally
change the character of its neighborhood from residential to commercial. Many
zoning ordinances attempt to minimize such damaging effects by designating all
home occupations as special exceptions and requiring each to procure the approval
of the Zoning Hearing Board which is to reject any such business that will adversely
affect its neighborhood.
A. However, more and more home occupations are being created that have little
or no deleterious effects on their neighborhoods. Many professionals now
"telecommute" from home, draw no extra parking or traffic activity, generate
no noise or other interference and have no signs. While home occupations
that could have a significant effect on their neighborhoods clearly
should still lie under the Zoning Hearing Board's jurisdiction, those that
have little or no such effects should be excused from the paperwork, time
and expense involved in a special exception application.
B. This Chapter attempts to establish such a system by dividing home occupations
into two categories: minor impact home occupations (which will have
little or no effect on their neighborhoods) and major impact home occupaZONING
27-74 4/9/2007
tions (which may have some effects on their neighborhoods). The Zoning Officer
shall determine which of these categories a particular home occupation
falls into according to the standards of subsection (2) below. If a particular
home occupation is determined to be a minor impact home occupation according
to these standards, then it may be established without any further
approvals. However, if it is determined to be a major impact home occupation,
then subsection (3) below requires that it must be approved by the Zoning
Hearing Board as a special exception according to the rules of Part 3,
"Special Exceptions and Conditional Uses." This Section applies to all home
occupations within the Borough of Philipsburg, regardless of the zoning district
in which they are located.
2. Distinguishing Minor Impact Home Occupations from Major Impact Home Occupations.
A. Any person who wishes to establish a home occupation within the Borough
shall file an application for a home occupation with the Zoning Officer on a
form supplied by the Borough. This application shall not be considered complete
unless enough information is included on the form to enable the Zoning
Officer to determine whether the proposed home occupation is a minor
impact home occupation or a major impact home occupation according to the
standards below.
B. After a complete application has been filed, the Zoning Officer shall have 15
days to determine the status of the proposed home occupation. When the
Zoning Officer fails to make this determination within 15 days, then the
proposed home occupation shall automatically be classified as a minor impact
home occupation.
C. The Zoning Officer shall determine that a proposed home occupation would
be a major impact home occupation unless it meets the standards below in
which case it shall be classified as a minor impact home occupation and may
be established without any further approvals.
(1) A minor impact home occupation shall receive and ship any goods,
chattels, materials, supplies, or items of any kind exclusively in either
a passenger vehicle that is owned by the resident and that makes no
more than one such delivery trip per day or a parcel courier vehicle
that stops at the dwelling unit no more than once per day.
(2) It shall use no equipment or appliances other than those that are customarily
used in common residences or offices.
(3) If it is a tutoring or teaching service, then no more than four students
shall be tutored or taught at the involved dwelling at any one moment.
(27, PART 5)
4/9/2007 27-75
(4) A minor impact home occupation shall place no sign or other evidence
of that occupation on the exterior of its building.
(5) A minor impact home occupation shall conduct no retail sales directly
to customers on the premises unless it is over the mail, telephone or
Internet.
(6) A minor impact home occupation shall use no more than 25% of the
ground floor area of the involved dwelling unit (excluding garages).
(7) A minor impact home occupation shall have no exterior displays of
goods and no interior displays of goods which can be seen from public
right-of-ways.
(8) A minor impact home occupation shall store no materials or products
outside the dwelling unit except in an enclosed structure which complies
with the requirements of this Chapter.
(9) A minor impact home occupation shall create a volume of traffic and a
demand for parking spaces that is no greater than would normally be
expected in its neighborhood of Philipsburg.
(10) A minor impact home occupation shall use no pieces of equipment or
processes that create noise, vibration, glare, fumes, odors, visual or
audio television or radio signal interference or electrical interference
which is detectable to normal senses in other residential units.
(11) Nursery schools, dancing schools, exercise or health centers, funeral
homes, mortuaries, eating or drinking establishments, animal kennels,
animal hospitals, veterinarian offices, boarding houses, medical
or dental clinics or offices, transportation vehicle repair or rental facilities,
theaters and any other business that does not meet the definition
of home occupations given under subsection (1) above shall not be
classified as minor impact home occupations.
D. The Zoning Officer's determination on the matter, along with any materials
that support this determination, shall be mailed to the applicant personally
no later than the day after the determination is made.
E. The Zoning Officer's determination on this matter may be appealed to either
the Zoning Hearing Board or the Centre County Court of Common Pleas.
F. There shall be no off-street parking space or loading berth requirements for
minor impact home occupations beyond what is required for the involved
dwelling unit.
3. Major Impact Home Occupations. If a proposed home occupation is determined to
be a major impact home occupation by the Zoning Officer, then its proprietor must
ZONING
27-76 4/9/2007
apply for a special exception use before the Zoning Hearing Board according to the
provisions of Part 3, "Special Exceptions and Conditional Uses." Note that any offstreet
parking space or loading berth requirements for these occupations (beyond
the requirements of the involved dwelling unit) shall be set by the Zoning Hearing
Board at the involved hearing.
(Ord. 984, 6/14/1999, Art. V, §505)
§27-503. Fences, Walls and Other Screens.
1. Purpose. Fences, walls and other screens can provide many benefits both to the
owner of the property on which they are situated and to the public at large. However,
certain aspects of these structures must be limited in order to protect a
community's appearance and public safety. This Section's purpose is to provide
such limits.
2. Fence, Wall, and Other Screen Limitations. Fences, walls, and other screens may
be erected in any yard subject to their zoning district's requirements, the limitations
in the following table, and the controls of subsection (3) below. Note that
heights should be measured from the existing ground elevation:
Regulation Requirement Exceptions
Maximum Height Fences, walls, and other screens up to 10
feet in height may be approved as a special
exception under the conditions of
Article 3, "Special Exceptions and Conditional
Uses."
In front yards 4 feet
In all other yards 6 feet
Minimum Setbacks For Non-Corner Lots None
Front setback 3 feet
All other setbacks 1.5 feet
Minimum Setbacks For Corner Lots None
Front setback 3 feet
Side street setback 3 feet
All other setbacks 1.5 feet
Note: If both property owners agree, the fence can be put on property line. [A.O]
3. Other Fence, Wall, and Screen Regulations.
A. A fence, wall, or screen shall not be erected in a public or dedicated right-ofway.
(27, PART 5)
4/9/2007 27-77
B. No fences, walls or screen except for a two-strand wire fence shall be constructed
in the Borough's floodplain, as defined by the relevant Borough ordinances.
C. A fence, wall or screen shall not block the clear sight distance at street sections
or driveways.
D. A fence, wall or screen shall not include barbs, thorns, other harmful projections
or electric wires designed to shock unless it is approved by the Zoning
Hearing Board as a special exception under the standards of Part 3, "Special
Exceptions and Conditional Uses."
E. The finished side of fences, walls or screens shall always face any abutting
streets or properties.
F. Fences, walls and screens shall be appropriate to the character and architectural
concepts of their surroundings.
G. Fences, walls and screens shall not hinder the appropriate development, use
or value of buildings on adjacent lots.
4. Zoning Permits. A fence, wall, or screen shall require a zoning permit, as described
in §27-115, "Zoning Permits."
5. Required Fencing around Private Swimming Pools. In order to minimize the
chances of small children and other persons drowning, all private swimming pools
shall be enclosed by a fence, wall or screen 4 feet in height as measured from the
existing ground elevation. This enclosure shall be able to be locked to prevent accidental
or unauthorized entry and shall contain open areas no larger than would
be necessary to permit the entry through the enclosure of a ball with a diameter of
4 inches. The height requirement for fences enclosing above-ground pools may be
met via a fence attached to the pool wall, in which the lowest ground elevation at
any point for pool and fence combined is 4 feet.
(Ord. 984, 6/14/1999, Art. V, §510; as amended by A.O.
§27-504. Radio and/or Television Antennas.
1. Purpose and Applicability of this Section. Radio and television antennas are a
valuable and necessary component of the modern American community. However,
the size and location of these items must be limited in the interests of the community's
appearance, light, open space and public safety. The purpose of this Section
is to limit radio and television antennas while still allowing them to perform their
functions. This Section applies to all radio and/or television antennas that are not
part of a cellular site (i.e., cell site or radio link), cellular switching office, commercial
radio station or commercial television station.
ZONING
27-78 4/9/2007
2. Radio and/or Television Antennas as Special Exceptions. If a radio and/or television
antenna meets the size, and location requirements given under subsection (3)
below, then it is a permitted use in all zoning districts. Otherwise, it may be permitted
in any district only as a special exception, subject to the requirements of
Part 3, "Special Exceptions and Conditional Uses."
3. Limitations on the Size and Locations of Radio and/or Television Antennas.
Unless a radio and/or television antenna is approved by the Zoning Hearing Board
as a special exception under the requirements of Part 3 ("Special Exceptions and
Conditional Uses"), it shall follow the size and location restrictions in the Table
below:
Regulation Requirement
Minimum Setbacks From Lot Lines
For front yards on all lots 15 feet
For side street yards on corner lots 15 feet
For all other yards 6 feet
Distance That Equipment Which Is Mounted
On A Roof Must Be From The Edge Of That
Roof
For all roof sides 6 feet
Maximum Heights Equipment must obey the maximum
building height of the district
in which it is located. If it is
mounted on a roof, it may rise
only 10 feet from this roof.
Maximum Diameters For Satellite Dishes 4 feet
(Ord. 984, 6/14/1999, Art. V, §515)
§27-505. Required Buffers.
1. Purpose. Throughout this Chapter, some land uses are required to be "buffered"
against other lots. This is required so that the unpleasant qualities of the one use
shall not damage the character or value of the other. This Section provides the
specific details of this required buffering.
2. Zoning Officer's Role. At the time that a developer who intends to construct a use
that this Chapter requires to be buffered applies for a zoning permit, the Zoning
Officer of the Borough of Philipsburg shall determine if the developer intends to
install a living fence or a non-living fence (options 1 and 2 of subsection (3) below)
and if the "maximum height" limitations of §27-503(2)("Fences, Walls and Other
Screens") are too strict to allow for proper buffering. If the Zoning Officer finds
(27, PART 5)
4/9/2007 27-79
that the answer to both of these questions is "yes," then he or she shall have the
authority to increase the "maximum height" limitations of §27-503(2) by no more
than 100% for the involved property. At the same time, the Zoning Officer shall
determine if the developer intends to install a natural landscape buffer (option 3
of subsection (3) below) and if the developer's proposed buffer is not long enough
or not wide enough to protect the value of the adjacent properties. If the Zoning
Officer determines that the answer to both of these questions is "yes," then he or
she shall have the authority to require an increase in the size of the natural landscape
buffer area.
3. Buffer/Screen Options. Required buffers shall be in one of the following three
forms:
A. A living fence that adheres to the requirements of subsection (4)of this Section.
B. A non-living fence, wall, or screen that adheres to the requirements of subsection
(5) of this Section.
C. A natural landscape that is sufficiently wide or hilly enough to hide the
principal use of the lot that is required to be screened, and that adheres to
the requirements of subsection (6) of this Section.
4. Provisions for Required Living Fences.
A. Required living fences shall provide a year-round screen. In order to insure
that this requirement will be met, living fences shall be composed of a mix
of plants that is at least 75% evergreen.
B. Required living fences shall be in accordance with all of the provisions of
§27-503 of this Part("Fences, Walls and Other Screens"), except that they
may be subject to the provisions of subsection (2) of this Section.
C. Required living fences shall be either no less than 4 feet wide or no less than
the width necessary to be opaque, whichever is more.
D. Required living fences shall be maintained so that they follow the requirements
of this section and continue to provide the required level of screening.
E. All plantings should be situated so that their root systems shall not encroach
on underground utilities.
F. The owner of the property whose principal use is required to be screened
shall be responsible for the installation and upkeep of his or her living fence.
This includes the replacement of dead plant material and the removal of all
debris and tall grass.
5. Provisions for Required Non-Living Fences.
ZONING
27-80 4/9/2007
A. Required non-living fences shall be maintained so that they follow these requirements,
and provide a year-round, attractive screen. The owner of the
property whose principal use is required to be buffered shall be responsible
for the installation and upkeep of his or her fence.
B. Required non-living fences shall be in accordance with the provisions of §27-
503 of this Chapter ("Fences, Walls and Other Screens"), except that they
shall ignore the required "maximum solid to open portion ratio" and they
may be subject to the provisions of subsection (2) of this Section.
C. Required non-living fences shall be opaque.
6. Provisions for Natural Landscape Buffers.
A. Required natural landscape buffers shall be wide and long enough to hide
the use that is required to buffer itself.
B. Required natural landscape buffers shall be delineated and protected from
future development by an easement, deed restriction, covenant or similar
restriction.
C. No structure, parking area, loading area, storage area or vehicular circulation
area shall be located in this buffer area.
D. All portions of a landscape buffer shall be attractive and maintained in good
condition.
(Ord. 984, 6/14/1999, Art. V, §520)
§27-506. Off-Street Parking Space and Loading Berth Design.
1. Purpose, Organization and Applicability of this Section. Section 212, "Land Uses,
Off-Street Parking and Off-Street Loading", stipulates how many off-street parking
spaces and loading berths must be provided by each land use within Philipsburg.
However, simply requiring a number of parking spaces or loading berths is
not enough to guarantee adequate access to the Borough's homes, businesses, and
institutions. These spaces and berths need to be properly designed. The purpose of
this Section is to meet this concern by mandating that each required off-street
parking space and loading berth meet certain safety and aesthetics criteria. Subsection
(2) of this Section provides the design criteria for off-street parking
spaces, while subsection (3) provides the same for off-street loading berths. The
requirements of this Section apply to each off-street parking space and loading
berth within the Borough that is used to satisfy the requirements of §27-212,
"Land Uses, Off-Street Parking and Off-Street Loading."
(27, PART 5)
4/9/2007 27-81
2. Requirements for Off-Street Parking Space. Each required off-street parking
space shall meet the following standards.
A. Location. Required off-street parking spaces shall be located on the same lot
as the structure or use that they serve unless a parking plan to the contrary
is approved by the Zoning Hearing Board in accordance with §27-507, "Off-
Street Parking and Loading Plans."
B. Size. Perpendicular parking spaces shall be no smaller than 9 feet in width
by 18 feet in length. Parallel parking spaces shall be no smaller than 8 feet

(Ord. 984, 6/14/1999, Art. V, §530)
§27-507. Off-Street Parking and Loading Plans.
1. Purpose, Organization and Applicability of this Section. Section 27-212, "Land
Uses, Off-Street Parking, and Off-Street Loading," stipulates how many off-street
parking spaces and loading berths each land use within the Borough of Philipsburg
must provide. However, simply requiring a number of parking spaces or
loading berths ignores many important considerations. Parking and loading requirements
should be flexible and responsive to situations involving shared parking,
adequate off-lot parking, different transportation modes and site constraints.
Some land uses should not be held to the requirements of §27-212 because they
share parking spaces with other businesses who need parking at differing times,
they use parking spaces on other lots that are nearby, a significant number of
their clients walk or ride bicycles to these uses or existing site constraints prohibit
following these requirements. The purpose of this Section is to meet this concern
by allowing for reductions in these requirements if they are necessary and justified.
Subsection (2) of this Section stipulates the conditions under which one or
more land uses may obtain an approved parking plan that reduces the off-street
parking requirements of §27-212(3) stipulates the conditions under which one or
more land uses may obtain an approved loading plan that reduces the off-street
loading requirements of §27-212. Applications for a parking or loading plan shall
be made to the Zoning Hearing Board as a special exception by way of the requirements
of Part 3, "Special Exceptions and Conditional Uses." This Section ap(
27, PART 5)
4/9/2007 27-83
plies to all land uses regulated by §27-212 who wish to apply for one of these two
types of plans.
2. Off-Street Parking Plans. The Zoning Hearing Board may grant a special exception
(by way of) the requirements of Part 3, "Special Exceptions and Conditional
Uses") to an off-street parking plan that reduces the number of off-street parking
spaces required for a land use by the table in §27-212, "Land Uses, Off-Street
Parking and Off-Street Loading," so long as that plan takes one of the following
four forms:
A. Two or more uses may share a common parking area that provides enough
parking spaces to meet the requirements of each use individually if the applicants
prove that each involved use will require the common parking area
largely when the other involved uses will not require it, that each involved
use is located within 350 feet of the common parking area, that each involved
use is connected to the common parking area by safe pedestrian
means of access, and that an adequate guarantee exists that the common
parking area will remain available to all of the involved uses over their lifetimes.
This form of a parking agreement shall not be available to shopping
centers or residential buildings with more than one dwelling. However, it is
especially recommended for places of worship (which usually require parking
on weekends and after 5 p.m. on weekdays) and non-retail office buildings
(which usually require parking between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. on weekdays).
Any changes made to the sharing of the common parking area shall
require a new review by the Zoning Hearing Board, and may result in an
addition of required parking spaces.
B. The Zoning Hearing Board may approve a plan for providing some or all of a
land use's required off-street parking spaces on a different lot than that
which the use is situated on if an adequate guarantee exists that the parking
will remain available to the involved use over its lifetime and the off-site
parking spaces are located within 350 feet of the associated use and are
connected by a safe pedestrian walkway.
C. If a land use can prove that over 25% of the traffic that it generates will be
pedestrian, the Zoning Hearing Board may approve a plan that proportionately
reduces the number of off-street parking spaces required by §27-212.
Furthermore, if a land use can prove that over 25% of the traffic that it generates
will use a bicycle to get there, the Zoning Hearing Board may approve
a plan that proportionately reduces the number of off-street parking
spaces required by §27-212 and provides enough bike rack space to handle
the anticipated number of cyclists.
D. The Zoning Hearing Board may approve an off-street parking plan that reduces
the number of off-street parking spaces required for a land use by §27-
212 if the applicant can prove that existing site constraints bar any reasonable
attempt to follow this requirement and the traffic that will be forced to
ZONING
27-84 4/9/2007
find another place to park will not deny another land use the use of its
needed parking spaces.
3. Off-Street Loading Plans. The Zoning Hearing Board may grant a special exception
(by way of) the requirements of Part 3, "Special Exceptions and Conditional
Uses") to a loading plan that reduces the number of off-street loading berths required
for a land use by the table in §27-212 if the applicant can prove that existing
site constraints bar any reasonable attempt to follow this requirement.
(Ord. 984, 6/14/1999, Art. V. §535)
§27-508. No-Impact Home-Based Business.
A business or commercial activity administered or conducted as an accessory use which
is clearly secondary to the use as a residential dwelling and which involves no customer.
client or patient traffic, whether vehicular or pedestrian, pickup, delivery or removal
functions to or from the premises, in excess of those normally associated with residential
use. The business or commercial activity must satisfy the following requirements:
A. The business activity shall be compatible with the residential use of the
property and surrounding residential uses.
B. The business shall employ no employees other than family members residing
in the dwelling.
C. There shall be no display or sale of retail goods and no stockpiling or inventory
of a substantial nature.
D. There shall be no outside appearance of a business use including, but not
limited to, parking, signs or lights.
E. The business activity may not use any equipment or process which creates
noise, vibration, glare, fumes, odors or electrical or electronic interference,
including interference with radio or television reception, which is detectable
in the neighborhood.
F. The business activity may not generate any solid waste or sewage discharge,
in volume or type, which is not normally associated with residential use in
the neighborhood.
G. The business activity shall be conducted only within the dwelling and may
not occupy more than 25% of the habitable floor area.
H. The business may not involve any illegal activity.

PART 6
SIGNS
§27-601. Purposes, Organization and Applicability of this Part.
1. The purposes of this Part are the following: to encourage the effective use of signs
as a means of communication in the Borough of Philipsburg, to maintain and enhance
the Borough's aesthetic environment and its ability to attract sources of
economic development and growth, to improve pedestrian and traffic safety, to
minimize the possible adverse effect of signs on nearby public and private property
and to enable the fair and consistent enforcement of this Part's provisions.
2. Section 27-602, "Computations," explains how to calculate sign areas, sign heights
and maximum total permitted sign areas for zone lots. These items are used
throughout this Part and thus, §27-602 applies to all regulated signs. Section 27-
603, "Signs Allowed on Private Property With and Without Permits," addresses
and exclusively applies to regulated signs on private property: stating what kinds
of signs are allowed in each zoning district, when zoning and occupancy permits
are needed for a sign, how much total permitted sign area each zone lot may have,
how many individual signs each zone lot may have, what dimensions each sign
may be, where each sign may be located on its lot and what characteristics each
sign may have.
3. Section 27-604, "Design, Construction and Maintenance", sets design, construction
and maintenance requirements for all regulated signs. Section 27-605, "Signs in
the Public Right-of-Way," addresses and exclusively applies to regulated signs in
public right-of-ways: stating what kinds of signs are allowed there, when signs
may be forfeited to the Borough and when occupancy permits are required for
signs in this location. Section 27-606, "Signs that are Exempt from the Requirements
of this Part," lists which signs are not regulated by this article. Section 27-
607, Prohibited Signs, explains what kind of signs are prohibited from the Borough.
Section 27-608, "Occupancy Permits for Temporary Sings on Private Property,"
provides some rules for temporary signs on private property that §27-603
requires to have occupancy permits. Section 27-609, "Abandoned Signs," explains
when abandoned signs must be removed.
4. A nonconforming sign is defined as a sign that was legally established before the
effective date of this Chapter's enactment (see §27-106, "Effective Date of This
Chapter's Enactment") and does not conform the requirements of §27-602 ("Computations"),
§27-603 ("Signs Allowed on Private Property With and Without Permits"),
§27-605 ("Signs in the Public Right-of-Way") or §27-607("Prohibited
Signs"). Section 27-610, "Nonconforming Signs" addresses and exclusively applies
to nonconforming signs: explaining how they are to receive nonconforming status,
how they are to be maintained, how they are to be brought into conformance and
when they must be removed.

5. This Part applies to all signs located in the Borough of Philipsburg.
(Ord. 984, 6/14/1999, Art. VI, §600)
§27-602. Computations.
1. How to Compute the Sign Area of Individual Signs. The area of a sign face (which
is also the sign area of a wall sign or other sign with only one face) shall be computed
by means of the smallest square, circle, rectangle, triangle or combination
thereof that will encompass the extreme limits of the writing, representation, emblem
or other display, together with any material or color forming an integral part
of the background of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop
or structure against which it is placed, but not including any supporting
framework, bracing or decorative fence or wall when such fence or wall otherwise
meets the provisions of this Chapter and is clearly incidental to the display itself.
2. How to Compute the Sign Area of Multi-faced Signs. The sign area for a sign with
more than one face shall be computed by adding together the area of all sign faces
visible from any one point. When two identical sign faces area placed back to back,
so that both faces cannot be viewed from any point at the same time and when
such sign faces are part of the same sign structure and are not more than 42
inches apart, the sign area shall be computed by the measurement of one of the
faces.
3. How to Compute Sign Height. The height of a sign shall be computed as the distance
from the base of the sign (and its supporting structure) at normal grade to
the top of the highest attached component of the sign. Normal grade shall be construed
to be the lower of existing grade prior to construction or the newly established
grade after construction, exclusive of any filling, berming, mounding or excavating
solely for the purpose of locating the sign. In cases in which the normal
grade cannot reasonably be determined, sign height shall be computed on the assumption
that the elevation of the normal grade at the base of the sign is equal to
the elevation of the nearest point of the crown of a public street or the grade of the
land at the principal entrance to the principal structure on the zone lot, whichever
is lower.
4. How to Compute the Maximum Total Permitted Sign Area for a Zone Lot. The
permitted sum of the area of all individual signs on a zone lot shall be computed
by applying the formula contained in Table "B" of §27-603 ("Signs Allowed on Private
Property With and Without Permits") to the lot frontage, building frontage,
or wall area, as appropriate, for the zoning district in which the lot is located Lots
fronting on two or more streets are allowed the permitted sign area for each street
frontage. However, the total sign area that is oriented toward a particular street
may not exceed the portion of the lot's total sign area allocation that is derived
from the lot, building, or wall area frontage on that street.
(Ord. 984, 6/14/1999, Art. VI, §605)
(27, PART 6)

§27-603. Signs Allowed on Private Property With and Without Permits.
Signs are allowed on private property in the Borough of Philipsburg in accordance with,
and only in accordance with, Table "A" below. If the letter "P" appears for a sign type in
a column of this table, such a sign is allowed on private property in the zoning district
represented by that column without any of the permits mentioned in the paragraph below.
If the letter "S" appears for a sign type in a column of this table, such a sign is allowed
on private property in the zoning district represented by that column only after
the permits required in the paragraph below have been obtained for the sign. If the letter
"N" appears for a sign type in a column of this table, such a sign is not allowed on
private property in the zoning district represented by that column. If Table "A" requires
a sign of the "temporary" sign type to have permits in a particular zoning district, an
occupancy permit must be obtained for that sign before it may be erected. If Table "A"
requires a sign of any other sign type to have permits in a particular district, a zoning
permit must be obtained for that sign before it may be erected, and an occupancy permit
must be obtained for that sign immediately after it is erected. Section 27-115 (Zoning
Permits) explains how to obtain a zoning permit, while §27-116 (Occupancy Permits)
explains how to get an occupancy permit.

§27-605. Signs in the Public Right-of-Way.
1. Sign Types Allowed in Public Right-of-Ways.
A. The following kinds of permanent signs are allowed in public right-of-ways:
public signs erected by or on behalf of a governmental body to post legal notices,
identify public property, convey public information, and/or direct or
regulate pedestrian or vehicular traffic; bus stop signs erected by a public
transit company; informational signs of a public utility regarding its poles,
lines, pipes, or other facilities and awning, projecting and suspended signs
projecting over a public right-of-way in conformity with the requirements of
Table "A."
B. Temporary signs for which an occupancy permit has been issued according
to the requirements of subsection (3) below are allowed in public right-ofways
only if they contain no commercial messages and are no more than two
square feet in area.
C. Emergency warning signs are allowed in public right-of-ways if they are
erected by a governmental agency, a public utility company or a contractor
doing authorized or permitted work within the public right-of-way.
2. Forfeiture of Signs Located in Public Right-of-Ways. Any sign installed or placed
on public property, except in conformance with the requirements of this Part,
shall be forfeited to the Borough and subject to confiscation. The Borough shall
have the right to recover from the owner or person placing such a sign the full
costs of removal and disposal of the sign.
3. Occupancy Permits for Temporary Signs in the Public Right-of-Way. All temporary
signs that are to be located in the public right-of-way must obtain an occupancy
permit by way of the requirements of §27-116, "Occupancy Permits." These
permits shall be issued for such signs in accordance with the provisions below.
A. An occupancy permit issued for a temporary sign in a public right-of-way
shall be valid for 60 days, after which the sign must be removed. No more
than three permits for temporary signs shall be issued to an applicant in
(27, PART 6)
4/9/2007 27-93
any calendar year. For any sign containing the name of a political candidate,
the candidate shall be deemed to be the applicant.
B. Up to 20 identical temporary signs may be erected in a public right-of-way

within 75 days of the issuance of the involved occupancy permit shall
be forfeited to the Borough, and shall be used to recover the costs of removing
and disposing of the sign.

§27-609. Abandoned Signs.
If a conforming use has been discontinued for a total of 12 months within an 18 month
period, then all signs that are related to that use, as well as any structures that support
these signs shall be known as "abandoned signs." Likewise, if a nonconforming use has
been abandoned as described in §27-117(4)(D), then all signs that are related to that use
as well as any structures that support these signs shall be known as "abandoned signs."
All abandoned signs shall be removed at the expense of their owners. If such a sign is
not removed, the Zoning Officer shall enforce the requirements of this section by way of
the procedure given in §27-119, "Enforcement."
(Ord. 984, 6/14/1999, Art. VI, §640)
§27-610. Nonconforming Signs.
1. Applicability. The requirements of this section only apply to nonconforming signs.
A nonconforming sign is defined as a sign that was legally established before the
effective date of this Chapter's enactment (see §27-106, "Effective Date of This
Chapter's Enactment") and does not conform the requirements of §27-602 ("Computations"),
§27-603 ("Signs Allowed on Private Property With and Without Permits"),
§27-605 ("Signs in the Public Right-of-Way") or §27-607("Prohibited
(27, PART 6)
4/9/2007 27-95
Signs"). Because nonconforming signs are not illegal, they have a right to temporarily
remain in place and to be maintained. However, they must adhere to the
requirements of this Section.
2. Phasing Out Nonconforming Signs. So long as it does not threaten the public
health or welfare, a nonconforming sign may temporarily maintain its nonconforming
characteristic or characteristics. However, all nonconforming signs that
are not temporary shall be brought into conformance with the requirements of
§§27-602, 27-603, 27-605 27-607 within 10 years of the effective date of this Chapter's
enactment (see §27-106, "Effective Date of This Chapter's Enactment"). All
nonconforming temporary signs shall be brought into conformance with the requirements
of §§27-602, 27-603, 27-605 and 27-607 within 60 days of the effective
date of this Chapter's enactment (see §27-106, "Effective Date of This Chapter's
Enactment").
3. Nonconforming Status. The following rules apply to or concern all nonconforming
sign:.
A. The Zoning Officer shall keep and maintain a list of all nonconforming signs
that exist in the Borough on the effective date of this Chapter's enactment
(see §27-106, "Effective Date of This Chapter's Enactment") and on the effective
dates of any relevant amendments to either this Chapter or its map.
B. The owner of a nonconforming sign may obtain a "certificate of nonconformity"
from the Borough's Zoning Officer. This certificate shall state that the
sign may continue to be used until a date that is 60 days from the effective
date of this Chapter's enactment (see §27-106) in the case of temporary
signs or a date that is 10 years from the effective date of this Chapter's enactment
in the case of non-temporary signs.
C. Aggrieved parties and the involved landowner may both appeal the Zoning
Officer's determination of whether or not a sign is nonconforming according
to the rules of §27-122, "Appealing the Determination of a Municipal Officer."
D. Any sign that was illegally erected or painted under a previous zoning ordinance
or land use regulation shall remain illegal under this Chapter, even if
it conforms to this Chapter's regulations.
E. Any sign that becomes a nonconforming sign due to an amendment made
after the effective date of this Chapter's enactment shall be subject to the
regulations of this Section.
4. Maintaining Nonconforming Signs. The following rules apply to all nonconforming
signs.
A. If any nonconforming sign deteriorates to an unsightly or hazardous condition,
the owner of that sign shall repair, repaint, remove, or replace it. If the
ZONING
27-96 4/9/2007
Borough Zoning Officer finds that a such a sign has not been repaired, repainted,
removed or replaced, he or she shall enforce this requirement by
way of the procedures given in §27-119, "Enforcement."
B. A nonconforming sign may be repaired, repainted or removed for repair and
then re-mounted without obtaining any zoning or occupancy permits.
5. Replacing Nonconforming Signs.
A. Within the periods established under subsection (2) above, a nonconforming
sign may be replaced with an identical nonconforming sign if the use that
the sign relates to has not changed since the original sign was constructed
or painted and has not been discontinued for a total of 12 months within an
18 month period or abandoned as described in §27-117(4)(D). Otherwise, the
nonconforming sign may only be replaced with a new, conforming sign.
B. Replacing a temporary nonconforming sign with an identical temporary
nonconforming sign does not require any permits. However, replacing a nontemporary,
nonconforming sign with an identical nontemporary, nonconforming
sign requires both a zoning permit and an occupancy permit. §27-
115 ("Zoning Permits") explains how to obtain a zoning permit, while §27-
116 ("Occupancy Permits") explains how to get an occupancy permit. Note
that this Chapter considers replacing a nonconforming sign with a nonidentical
sign to be the same as erecting a new sign. Thus, such a replacement
may or may not require a zoning and/or an occupancy permit, depending
on the type and location of the involved sign.
6. Enlarging, Relocating or Altering Nonconforming Signs.
A. A nonconforming sign shall not be enlarged or relocated within the Borough.
B. A nonconforming sign shall not be altered in any aspect except to make
safety improvements, to keep the sign maintained in accordance with the
requirements of this Section or other Borough ordinances or to bring the
sign into conformance with the requirements of this Chapter.
7. Bringing a Nonconforming Sign into Conformance. If a nonconforming sign is altered
so that it becomes a conforming sign, it shall not be subsequently altered
back to a nonconforming state. Likewise, if a nonconforming sign is replaced with
a conforming sign, that conforming sign shall not be subsequently replaced with
another nonconforming sign.
8. Abandoned Nonconforming Signs. If a conforming use has been discontinued for a
total of 12 months within an 18 month period, then all nonconforming signs that
are related to that use as well as any structures that support these signs shall be
known as "abandoned nonconforming signs." Likewise, if a nonconforming use has
been abandoned as described in §27-117(4)(D) then all nonconforming signs that
are related to that use as well as any structures that support these signs shall be
(27, PART 6)
4/9/2007 27-97
known as "abandoned nonconforming signs." All abandoned nonconforming signs
shall be removed at the expense of their owners. If such a sign is not removed, the
Zoning Officer shall enforce this requirement by way of the procedures given in
§27-119, "Enforcement."
(Ord. 984, 6/14/1999, Art. VI, §645)
§27-611. Permits for Signs Over Streets or Sidewalks.
1. Compliance Required. Hereafter it shall be unlawful to erect, construct or maintain
over, across or upon any sidewalk or driveway or any highway of the Borough
of Philipsburg any sign or other device for advertising or other purposes without
first complying with the terms of this Section. This does not apply to temporary
signs.
2. Application for Permit; Issuance. Before any sign or other device for advertising or
other purposes shall be erected within the Borough of Philipsburg, application
shall be made to the Zoning and Code Enforcement Officer and UCC, who may
grant or refuse the permission requested as deemed consistent with the public interest,
welfare and safety. If granted, a permit may be issued by the Zoning and
Code Enforcement Officer, the erection to take place subject to such conditions as
to fastening and securing the sign and safeguarding the public as may be requested
by such Officer
3. Public Liability Insurance. All property owners or tenants hereafter erecting or
maintaining any such sign or other device shall carry, for the protection of the
Borough, a general public liability insurance policy with some company of recognized
financial standing and shall exhibit the same to the Zoning Officer and file
with him a copy of same, annually or as often as may be demanded. In event of
failure to so insure and maintain a policy in force, any permit outstanding may be
forthwith revoked and the permittee forthwith directed to remove the sign or
other device.
4. Annual Inspection; Removal or Remedy of Unsafe Signs. Council may, by motion,
annually direct the inspection of all signs by such employee of the Borough as they
may direct. Any sign or other device found not to be in a safe condition may be directed
to be either properly secured and fastened or removed within a period of 30
days.
5. Penalty for Violation. Any person, firm or corporation who shall violate any provision
of this Section shall, upon conviction thereof, be sentenced to pay a fine of not
more than $1,000 plus costs and, in default of payment of said fine and costs, to a
term of imprisonment not to exceed 30 days. Each day that a violation of this Section
shall continue shall constitute a separate offense.
6. Borough May Remove Certain Signs at Expense of Property Owner or Tenant.
Where a property owner or tenant fails to remove any sign or other device when so
ZONING
27-98 4/9/2007
directed or where there has been an erection without first asking for and obtaining
a permit, Council or the Zoning Officer may direct the removal of such sign or
other device and cause the cost thereof to be assessed, by municipal lien, against
the property.

§27-702. Zoning Hearing Board.
1. Purposes, Organization and Applicability of This Section. The Zoning Hearing
Board of the Borough of Philipsburg is a quasi-judicial body within the municipal
ZONING
27-102 4/9/2007
government. It has no legislative power, has no enforcement power and cannot
make or modify zoning policy. It is instead a judicial-like body that helps to assure
fair and equitable application and administration of this Chapter. The purposes of
this Section are to establish the Board, outline its duties and prescribe procedures
that it is to use in fulfilling its duties.
A. Subsection (2) of this Section explains how the Board is to be established,
while subsection (3) details how its members may be removed. Subsection
(4) explains how the Board is to be organized and provides some guidance
concerning how it is to operate. Subsection (5) discusses how the Board may
spend money. Subsection (6) lists the duties of the Board and provides some
rules on how these duties are to be carried out. Subsection (7) notes that the
Board's decisions may be appealed to the relevant Court of Common Pleas.
B. The Zoning Hearing Board must use the same procedure in each of its hearings
regardless of which one of its duties from subsection (6) that hearing
falls under. Throughout this Chapter, provisions that concern the Zoning
Hearing Board have remarked that it is to hear the involved case by way of
the procedure outlined in this Section. This procedure is provided in a multipage
table under subsection (8).
C. The provisions of §27-702 only apply to the Zoning Hearing Board and the
parties with which it comes into contact. Like the other sections of this Part,
these provisions do not apply to the property owners regulated by this
Chapter unless a section of Part 1 or Part 2 says so.
2. Formation of the Zoning Hearing Board. The Zoning Hearing Board of the Borough
of Philipsburg shall consist of three residents of the Borough, appointed by
Borough Council by way of a resolution. Each member's term of office shall be 3
years and shall be fixed so that the term of one member shall expire each year.
Members of the Zoning Hearing Board shall hold no other office in the Borough.
The Borough Council may also appoint by resolution from one to three residents of
the Borough to serve as alternate members of the Board. The term of office of an
alternative member shall also be 3 years. When an alternative is seated on the
Board (see subsection (4) below), he or she shall be entitled to participate in all
proceedings to the same extent as any other member of the Board. However, alternates
shall not be entitled to vote as a member of the Board or be compensated
unless they have been designated as a voting alternate member as required by
subsection (4) below. Alternates shall also hold no other office in the Borough.
3. Removal of Zoning Hearing Board Members. Any board member may be removed
for malfeasance, misfeasance, or nonfeasance in office or for other just cause by a
majority vote of the Borough Council. However, the member must receive notice of
the intent to take such a vote at least 15 days before the actual vote is taken and
he or she may request that a public hearing be held in connection with the vote.
(27, PART 7)
4/9/2007 27-103
4. Organization of the Board. The Zoning Hearing Board shall elect officers from its
own membership. Such officers shall serve annual terms and may succeed themselves.
A. For the conduct of any hearing and the taking of any action or votes, a quorum
shall be no less than a majority of all of the members of the Board.
However, the Board may appoint a hearing officer from its own membership
to conduct any hearing on its behalf. As noted under subsection (8) below,
the applicant/appellant and the Borough may agree to accept the decision or
findings of the Hearing Officer as final and to relieve the Board of voting on
any final decisions.
B. If, for reasons of absence or disqualification, a quorum is not reached, the
chairman of the Board shall designate enough alternates as voting alternative
members to reach the quorum. Any alternate so designated shall continue
to serve on the Board in all proceedings involving the matter or case
for which he or she was designated until the Board has made a final determination
on that matter or case. Such designations shall be made on a rotating
basis among all alternates on the order of declining seniority.
C. Tie votes shall be interpreted as maintaining the status quo in the matter at
hand. For instance, special exceptions are denied when the Board is tied.
D. The Board may make, alter and rescind rules and forms for its procedure,
consistent with the requirements of this Chapter and the laws of the Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania. The Board shall keep full public records of its
business17 and shall submit a report of its activities to Borough Council if
requested.
5. Expenditures for Services. Within the limits of funds available, the Board may
employ or contract for secretaries, clerks, legal counsel, consultants and other
technical and clerical services. Members of the Board may receive compensation
for the performance of their duties, as fixed by the Borough Council, but this compensation
may not exceed the Borough Council's own compensation. Alternates
may also be paid compensation, as fixed by the Borough Council, when they are
designated as voting alternative members of the Board. However, their compensation
may also not exceed the compensation paid to members of Borough Council.
6. Duties of the Zoning Hearing Board. The Board's duties shall be as follows. All
hearings conducted in pursuit of these duties shall be held according to the rules
of subsection (8) below.
A. The Board shall hear substantive challenges to the validity of this Chapter
and its amendments in accordance with §27-121, "Substantive Challenges."
17 Note: Such records shall be the property of the Borough.

(c) The suitability of the site for the intensity of use proposed, considering
the site's soils, slopes, woodlands, wetlands, floodplains,
aquifers, natural resources and other natural features.
(d) The impact of the proposed use on the site's soils, slopes, woodlands,
wetlands, floodplains, natural resources and natural features,
the degree to which these are protected or destroyed, the
tolerance of the resources to development and any adverse environmental
impacts.
(e) The impact of the proposal on the preservation of agriculture
and other land uses which are essential to public health and
welfare.
(3) The challenge shall be deemed to be denied if the Board votes against
the challenge, fails to commence the hearing within 60 days or fails to
act on the application within 45 days of the close of the last involved
hearing. In the latter two of these cases, the involved time limit may
be extended by mutual consent of the applicant and the municipality.
If no such consent is reached, the challenge shall be denied on the day
after the last day that the Board could have taken the involved action.
B. The Board shall hear procedural challenges to the validity of this Chapter or
one of its amendments in accordance with §27-120, "Procedural Challenges."

change one nonconforming land use to another in accordance with §27-117,
"Nonconformities."
I. For land uses not listed in the table under §27-212(4) ("Land Uses, Off-
Street Parking and Off-Street Loading"), the Zoning Hearing Board shall
determine which zoning districts they shall be allowed in, how they shall be
allowed in those districts (i.e., as permitted principal uses, permitted accessory
uses, conditional uses, etc.) and which Sections of the remainder of the
Chapter apply to them. The Board may ask the Planning Commission for a
recommendation on these matters.
J. The Board shall hear all other applications and appeals that are assigned to
it by this Chapter or the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

this decision within the required period, or where
the Board fails to hold the hearing within the required
period, the decision shall be deemed to
have been rendered in favor of the applicant or
appellant (as the case may be) unless either the
applicant/appellant has agreed in writing or on
the record to an extension of time, or the hearing
concerns a challenge to the substantive validity of
the Chapter18 (see §27-121, Substantive Challenges).
When a deemed decision is rendered, the
Board shall give notice of this within 10 days of
the last day that it could have met to render a decision
to the parties and at the locations listed under
"Required Public Notice" below. If the Board
fails to provide such notice, the applicant/
appellant may do so. Note that protesting or
aggrieved parties cannot obtain a deemed decision.
Required Public Notice A notice containing the information listed under
"Contents of Required Public Notice" below shall

and the second shall not be less than 7 days
before the date of the hearing.
18 Note: Where the Zoning Hearing Board fails to commence a hearing on the substantive validity
of the ordinance within 60 days of the involved request, or where the Board fails to act on
such a hearing within 45 days of its closure, the challenge shall be deemed to be denied.

Stays of Proceedings An appeal to the Zoning Hearing Board automatically
stops all affected land development. However,
if the Zoning Officer certifies that such a halt
would cause an imminent danger to life or property,
then the development may be stopped only
with a restraining order granted by the Zoning
Hearing Board or by any court with competent
jurisdiction following notice to the Zoning Officer.
An applicant or appellant may petition a court of
competent jurisdiction to force those contesting an
authorized permit or approval to either post bond
or drop their appeal. The burden of proof shall be
on the applicant/appellant to prove that the appeal
is frivolous. If the party contesting an authorized
permit or approval refuses to post bond as
ordered by the involved court, appeals to an appellate
court, and loses, then that party is liable for
all reasonable costs, expenses, and attorney fees
incurred by the applicant/appellant.
Parties in the Hearing The parties to the hearing shall be the Borough,
any person affected by the application or appeal
who has made timely appearance of record before
the Board and any other person, including civic or
community organizations — permitted to appear
by the Board. The Board may require that everyone
who wishes to be considered a party to a hearing
fill out a form that asks the person's name and
address, who he or she is representing, and
whether or not he or she desires a copy of any final
decision in the case.
Fees The Borough Council may prescribe reasonable
fees for a Zoning Hearing Board hearing which
may include compensation for the secretary and
members of the Board, public notice and advertising
costs, necessary administrative overhead connected
with the hearing and one-half of the stenographer's
fee (the other half must be paid by the
Board).
The cost of the original transcript shall be paid by
the Board if the original is ordered by the Board or
the Hearing Officer and shall be paid by the applicant/
appellant if he or she orders it. Additional
copies shall be paid for by the parties requesting
them.
Fees may not compensate for the legal expenses of
the Board. Furthermore, fees may not be used to
compensate engineering, architectural, planning
or other technical consultants or expert witnesses.

Subject Rules
The Zoning Hearing Board's Solicitor
The Zoning Hearing Board may hire its own solicitor.
The Zoning Hearing Board's solicitor shall be a
different person and shall be from a different law
firm, than the Borough's Solicitor.
Conducting the Hearing Either the Zoning Hearing Board or a Hearing
Officer (see subsection (4) above) shall conduct all
hearings.
A stenographic record that conforms with civil
trial transcripts must be taken in all hearings.
Furthermore, written minutes shall be taken of all
Board meetings. The substance of all official actions,
the names of people who appear officially
and the subject of their testimony must be recorded.
Each party has the right to be represented by
council, to present and respond to evidence, and to
cross-examine adverse witnesses on all relevant
issues.
The chairman of the Zoning Hearing Board (if a
Hearing Officer has not been appointed) or the
Hearing Officer (if one has been appointed, see
subsection (4) above) has the power to administer
oaths and issue subpoenas to compel both the attendance
of relevant witnesses and the production
of relevant papers. All testimony should be sworn,
as unsworn statements do not constitute legal evidence
to make a record.
Formal rules of evidence do not apply to hearings.
However, the Zoning Hearing Board may exclude
any irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious
evidence. Hearsay evidence, if not objected to, may
be given its natural probative value. Yet, the
Board has the power to reject even uncontradicted
testimony if it finds this testimony to be lacking in
credibility.

27-110 4/9/2007
Subject Rules
In the time following the beginning of a hearing
and prior to a rendering of the decision or findings,
the Board shall not communicate with any
party or party representatives unless all parties
are given an opportunity to participate. No communication,
reports, staff memoranda, or other
materials — except advice from the Board's own
solicitor may be accepted or noticed by the Board
unless all parties are given an opportunity to contest
that information. The Board should not inspect
the involved site or its surroundings during
the hearings unless all parties are given an opportunity
to be present. Any reports by the Zoning
Officer shall be filed with all involved parties.
A case should not be postponed to a later date
without substantial or compelling reasons, especially
if the issue is of great concern and has attracted
an audience. However, where a new issue
is raised for the first time at a hearing and the
applicant/appellant had no notice of this issue, the
hearing should be continued at a later date to give
the applicant/appellant an opportunity to react
properly. When a case is continued at a second
hearing, a notice shall be prominently posted at
the hearing site, and all involved parties must be
notified.
Mediation Mediation is "a voluntary negotiating process in
which parties in a dispute mutually select a neutral
mediator to assist them in jointly exploring
and settling their differences, culminating in a
written agreement which the parties themselves
create and consider acceptable" (from The Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code). Mediation
is intended to supplement, but not replace,
the procedures for Zoning Hearing Board hearings
specified here. It can provide a potentially less
costly mechanism for resolving land use disputes,
as well as a less polarized process.
In no case may the Zoning Hearing Board initiate
mediation or participate as a mediating party.
(27, PART 7)
4/9/2007 27-111
Subject Rules
Participation in mediation must be voluntary, and
the involved parties must agree to funding, the
selection of a mediator, the completion of mediation
(including the time limits for such a completion),
the suspension of the time limits authorized
by this ordinance and the Pennsylvania Municipalities
Planning Code (Act of 1968, P.L. 805, No.
247, as reenacted and amended)19 the identification
of all parties, the determination of whether
some or all sessions shall be open or closed and
the issuance of mediation solutions in writing,
subject to review and approval by the decision
making body.
No offers or statements made in the mediation
sessions, excluding the final written mediated
agreement, can be admissible as evidence in any
subsequent judicial or administrative proceedings.
Making a Decision The decision or, where no decision is called for, the
findings shall be made by the Zoning Hearing
Board. However, the applicant/appellant and the
Borough may agree before this decision to waive
this and instead accept the decision or findings of
the Hearing Officer as final (if a Hearing Officer
has been appointed).
In voting on a final decision, the vote cast by each
member of the Board (or the Hearing Officer,
where appropriate) shall be made publicly.
Where an application or appeal is contested or
denied, the resulting decision must be accompanied
by a finding of fact, the conclusions based on
these facts, and the reason that such conclusions
were drawn. This will show that the decision was
reasoned, and not arbitrary. References to any
provisions of any ordinance, rule or regulation relied
on for any conclusion must be made, along
with the reason that the conclusion is appropriate
for the particular case at hand.
Even where an application or appeal is not contested,
the resulting decision should be accompanied
by a statement of findings or an opinion that
is detailed enough to substantiate the Zoning
Hearing Board's decision.
19 Note: The suspension of these time limits must be agreed to in writing by the involved parties,
and by both the applicant/appellant and the municipality (not the Zoning Hearing Board) —
even if neither one of these two is a party to the mediation.

(Ord. 984, 6/14/1999, Art. VII, §705)
§27-703. Borough Council.
1. Purposes, Organization and Applicability of this Section. The Borough Council of
Philipsburg is the chief governing body of the Borough, and is the only body that
can set the Borough's zoning policy. The Council, of course, has many duties. The
purpose of this section is to address only Council's zoning-related duties outlining
these duties and prescribing the procedures that Council is to use in fulfilling
them.
A. Subsection (2) of this Section lists Council's major duties under this Chapter
and specifies some rules that apply to each. Subsection (2)(A) addresses the
appointment of the Zoning Officer, subsection (2)(B) discusses the granting
of temporary uses (see Part 4, "Temporary Uses") and number subsection
(2)(C) deals with the granting of conditional uses (see Part 3, Special Exceptions
and Conditional Uses). Subsection (2)(D) specifies the process by which
Council may amend this Chapter, while subsection (2)(E) explains how
Council is to hear and decide on landowner curative amendments to this
Chapter (see §27-121, "Substantive Challenges"). Subsection (2)(F) discusses
the setting of off-street parking space and loading berth requirements.
B. Subsection (2)(G) explains the procedure for municipal curative amendments.
A municipal curative amendment can be used to fix a portion of this
Chapter that is substantially invalid. It has a major advantage over fixing
invalid provisions via a plain amendment (i.e., the procedure described in
subsection (2)(D)) in that the Borough need not entertain any substantive
challenges to these provisions (see §27-121, "Substantive Challenges") during
the municipal curative amendment process which can save the Borough
a significant amount of time and money.
C. The provisions of this Section only apply to the Borough Council and the
parties with which it comes into contact on zoning-related issues. Like the
other Sections of this Part, these provisions do not apply to the property
owners regulated by this ordinance unless a section of Parts 1 or 2 says so.
(27, PART 7)
4/9/2007 27-113
2. Zoning-Related Duties of the Borough Council. The Borough Council's major duties
under this ordinance as well as some rules that apply to these duties are provided
below:
A. The Borough Council shall appoint the Borough's Zoning Officer according
to the requirements of §27-701, "Zoning Officer."
B. The Borough Council shall hear all applications for temporary uses according
to both the following rules and the express requirements of Part 4,
"Temporary Uses."
(1) The Borough Council shall commence a hearing on an application for
a temporary use within 60 days of that application's being filed in a
complete state with the Zoning Officer.
(2) The Zoning Officer shall provide public notice of this hearing in the
same manner as the public notice of a special exception hearing before
the Zoning Hearing Board would be provided (see §27-702(8)).
(3) Council shall render a written decision on the temporary use application
within 45 days of the last involved hearing before Council.
(4) Where Council fails to commence the hearing within the first period
stipulated above, or where Council fails to render the decision within
the second period stipulated above, the decision shall be deemed to
have been rendered in favor of the applicant unless the applicant has
agreed in writing or on the record to an extension of time. When a decision
has been deemed in this manner, Council shall give public notice
of the decision within 10 days of the last day that it could have
met to render a decision.
(5) Where the application is contested or denied, it shall be accompanied
by findings of facts, the conclusions based on these facts and the reason
that such conclusions were drawn. This will show that the decision
was reasoned, and not arbitrary. References to any provisions of
any ordinance, rule or regulation relied on for any conclusion must be
made, along with the reason that the conclusion is appropriate for the
particular case at hand.
(6) A copy of the final decision shall be delivered to the applicant personally
or mailed to him no later than the day following its date.
(7) The Council's decision concerning an application for a temporary use
may be appealed to the Centre County Court of Common Pleas.
ZONING
27-114 4/9/2007
C. The Borough Council shall hear all applications for conditional uses according
to both the following rules and the express provisions of Part 3, "Special
Exceptions and Conditional Uses."
(1) The Borough Council shall commence a hearing on an application for
a conditional use within 60 days of that application's being filed in a
complete state with the Zoning Officer.
(2) The Zoning Officer shall provide public notice of this hearing in the
same manner as the public notice of a special exception hearing before
the Zoning Hearing Board would be provided (see §27-702(8)).
(3) The Borough Council shall render a written decision within 45 days of
the last involved hearing before Council.
(4) Where Council fails to commence the hearing within the first period
stipulated above, or where Council fails to render the decision within
the second period stipulated above, the decision shall be deemed to
have been rendered in favor of the applicant unless the applicant has
agreed in writing or on the record to an extension of time. When a decision
has been deemed in this manner, Council shall give public notice
of the decision within 10 days of the last day that it could have
met to render a decision.
(5) In granting a conditional use, Borough Council may attach reasonable
conditions and safeguards, in addition to those expressed in Part 3
("Special Exceptions and Conditional Uses"), as it may deem necessary
to implement the purposes of this Chapter
(6) Where the application is contested or denied, it shall be accompanied
by findings of facts, the conclusions based on these facts and the reason
that such conclusions were drawn. This will show that the decision
was reasoned and not arbitrary. References to any provisions of
any ordinance, rule or regulation relied on for any conclusion must be
made, along with the reason that the conclusion is appropriate for the
particular case at hand.
(7) A copy of the final decision shall be delivered to the applicant personally
or mailed to him no later than the day following its date.
(8) Applications for conditional uses may be appealed to the Centre
County Court of Common Pleas.
D. The Borough Council shall enact all amendments to this Chapter that are
not landowner curative amendments according to the rules below.
(1) Before voting on the enactment of such an amendment, the Borough
Council shall hold a public hearing.
(27, PART 7)
4/9/2007 27-115

this hearing and require an auxiliary aid, service, or other disability
accommodation to participate in the proceedings can be
accommodated by contacting the Borough Manager's Office."
(b) If a summary of the proposed amendment is included in the
public notice instead of its full text, then the notice shall include
a place within the municipality where copies of the full text may
be examined without charge or copied at cost, a copy of the full
text shall be supplied to a newspaper of general circulation in
the Borough at the time the public notice is published in that
paper and an attested copy of the full text shall be filed in the
Centre County law library or another County office designated

or 30 days before the hearing. The second of these shall not
be less than 7 days before either the hearing or passage.
(d) If substantial changes are made in the proposed amendment
before passage but after the involved public hearing, then a notice
shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation
within Philipsburg at least 10 days prior to enactment that sets
forth the provisions in reasonable detail together with a summary
of the changes made. If these changes involve land that
was previously not affected by the proposed amendment, then
the above requirement shall be dropped and the public hearing
process shall start over again.
(e) If the amendment at hand involves a zoning map change, then
notice of the hearing shall be posted by the Borough at points
deemed sufficient along involved tracts to notify potentially interested

(5) The Borough may offer a mediation option as an aid in completing this
Section's proceedings. Mediation is described in the table20 in §27-

(6) The hearing itself shall be conducted according to the rules below:
Subject Rules
Conducting the
Hearing
A stenographic record that conforms with civil trial transcripts must be taken in all
hearings. The substance of all official actions, the names of people who appear officially
and the subject of their testimony must be recorded.
Each party has the right to be represented by legal council, to present and respond to
evidence and to cross-examine adverse witnesses on all relevant issues.
The Borough Solicitor shall represent Borough Council, if requested. However, Council
may retain an independent attorney to present the defense of the challenged ordinance.
The Council has the power to administer oaths and issue subpoenas to compel both the
attendance of relevant witnesses and the production of relevant papers. All testimony
should be sworn, as unsworn statements do not constitute legal evidence to make a record.
Formal rules of evidence do not apply to these hearings. However, the Council may exclude
any irrelevant, immaterial or unduly repetitious evidence. Hearsay evidence, if not
objected to, may be given its natural probative value. Yet, the Council has the power to
reject even uncontradicted testimony if it finds this testimony to be lacking in credibility.
In the time following the beginning of a hearing and prior to a rendering of the decision
or findings, the Council shall not communicate with any party or party representatives
unless all parties are given an opportunity to participate. No communication, reports,
staff memoranda, or other materials may be accepted or noticed by the Council unless all
parties are given an opportunity to contest that information. The Council should not inspect
the involved site or its surroundings during the hearings unless all parties are
given an opportunity to be present. Any reports by the Zoning Officer shall be filed with
all involved parties.
A case should not be postponed to a later date without substantial or compelling reasons,
especially if the issue is of great concern and has attracted an audience. However, where
a new issue is raised for the first time at a hearing and the applicant had no notice of
this issue, the hearing should be continued at a later date to give the applicant an opportunity
to react properly. When a case is continued at a second hearing, a notice shall be
prominently posted at the hearing site, and all involved parties must be notified.
Making a Decision In voting on a final decision, the vote cast by each Council member shall be made publicly.
In making its decision, Council shall consider the proposed amendments, plans, and explanatory
materials submitted by the applicant; the impact of the proposal on roads,
sewer facilities, water supplies, schools and other public service facilities, the impact of
the proposal on regional housing needs and the effectiveness of the proposal in providing
housing units of a type actually available to and affordable by classes of persons otherwise
unlawfully excluded by the challenged provisions, the suitability of the site for the
intensity of use proposed (considering the site's soils, slopes, woodlands, wetlands, floodplains,
aquifers, natural resources and other natural features), the impact of the proposed
use on the site's soils, slopes, woodlands, wetlands, floodplains, natural resources
and the impact of the proposal on the preservation of agriculture and other land uses
which are essential to public health and welfare.
Where Council fails to render this decision within the required period, or fails to hold the
hearing within the required period, the decision shall be deemed to have been rendered
against the amendment. When a deemed decision is rendered, Council shall give notice
of this within 10 days of the last day that it could have met to render a decision.
If Council determines that a validity challenge has merit, then it may either accept the
applicant's landowner curative amendment with or without revision or adopt an alternative
amendment that will cure the alleged defects in this Chapter.

distance that must be maintained between all parts (except for walks or
steps) of all buildings (except permitted accessory uses as stipulated) and
the side lot line on the side of the lot to which those parts are closest. The

E. Non-Side Street Setback (this is applicable only to corner lots). The distance
that must be maintained between all parts (except for walks or steps) of all
buildings (except permitted accessory uses as stipulated) and the non-side

formed by the side of the principal building(s) that is closest to the non-side
street lot line is the non-side street yard.
If the sidewalks directly in front of any lot are not legally included as a part of
that lot, then six feet shall be subtracted from that lot's minimum and maximum
front setback requirements. If the sidewalks directly along the side street side of a
corner lot are not legally included as a part of that lot, then 6 feet shall be subtracted
from that lot's minimum and maximum side street setback requirements.
These adjustments are to compensate for the setbacks that are already provided
for the involved lot by the sidewalk property, and may not be interpreted as allowing
the construction of a structure beyond the lot's legal boundaries.
