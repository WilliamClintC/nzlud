§ 72-1. Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to assure compliance with Act 3 of 2008,
the Pennsylvania Right-to-Know Law,14 as amended; to provide access to
public records of the Borough of Hellertown (hereinafter "the Borough");

utilized in the receipt and processing of public record requests and the
retrieval and copying of public records.
§ 72-2. Designated Open Records Officer. [Amended 2-22-2011 by
Res. No. 11-02]
It is the policy of the Borough to require the presence of a designated
employee when public records are examined and inspected and to charge
reasonable fees for duplication of the records of the Borough. The Borough
of Hellertown designates the Borough Manager, Cathy L. Kichline, as the
Open Records Officer, responsible for assuring compliance with the

resolution at the Borough's reorganization meeting.
A. All requests for public records of the Borough under this article shall be
specific in identifying and describing each public record requested. In
no case shall the Borough be required to create a public record which
does not exist or to compile, maintain, format or organize a public
record in a manner in which the Borough does not currently compile,
maintain, format or organize the public record. All requests for public
records shall be submitted in writing and include the date of the
request; requestor's name, address and telephone number; certification
of United States residency; signature of requestor; and if duplication is
requested, appropriate payment. A sample open records request form is
attached hereto.15

§ 72-5. Response.
B. The designated employee shall make a good faith effort to determine
whether each record requested is a public record.
C. The Borough shall facilitate a reasonable response to a request for the
Borough's public records. In no case is the Borough expected to provide
extraordinary staff to respond to the request but will respond in a
manner consistent with the Borough's administrative responsibilities
and consistent with the requirements of the Pennsylvania Right-to-
Know Law.
D. The designated employee shall respond to the requestor within five
business days from the date of receipt of the written request. If the
Borough does not respond within five business days of receipt thereof,
the request is deemed denied.
E. The response provided by the Borough shall consist of:
(1) Approval for access to the public record;
(2) Review of the request by the designated employee; or
(3) Denial of access to the record requested.
F. If access to the public record requested is approved, the public record
shall be available for access during the regular business hours of the

requestor, while also taking reasonable measures to protect Borough
public records from the possibility of theft and/or modification. The
presence of a designated employee is required when public records are
examined and inspected.
A. Fees for duplication of public records shall be as established by the
Commonwealth's Office of Open Records. The Borough may, at its
discretion, waive fees.
B. In the event the estimated cost of fulfilling a request submitted under
this article is expected to exceed $100, the designated employee(s)
shall obtain the expected cost in advance of fulfilling the request to
avoid unwarranted expense of Borough resources.
A. If the request is being reviewed, the notice provided by the Borough
shall be in writing and include the reason for the review and the
expected response date, which shall be within 30 days of the notice of
review. If the Borough does not respond within 30 days thereof, the
request is deemed denied. Review of the request is limited to situations
where:
15.Editor's Note: Request forms are on file in the Borough office.
§ 72-3 HELLERTOWN CODE § 72-5
1:34
§ 72-6. Appeals.
(1) The record requested contains information which is subject to
access, as well as information which is not subject to access that
must be redacted prior to a grant of access. The redacted
information is considered a denial as to that information;
(2) The record requires retrieval from a remote location;
(3) A timely response cannot be accomplished due to staffing
limitations;
(4) A legal review is necessary to determine whether the record
requested is a public record;
(5) The requestor has failed to comply with the Borough's policy and
procedure requirements;
(6) The requestor refuses to pay the applicable fees; or
(7) The extent or nature of the request precludes a response within the
required time period.
B. Upon determination that one of the factors listed above applies, the
Borough shall send written notice to the requestor within five business
days of receipt of the request for access. The notice shall include a
statement notifying the requestor that the request for access is being
reviewed, the reason for the review, a reasonable date that a response
is expected to be provided and an estimate of applicable fees owed
when the record becomes available. If the date that a response is
expected to be provided is in excess of 30 days, following the five
business days allowed for, the request for access shall be deemed
denied unless the requestor has agreed, in writing, to an extension to
the date specified in the notice. If the requestor agrees to the extension,
the request shall be deemed denied on the day following the date
specified in the notice if the Borough has not provided a response by
that date.
A. If access to the record requested is denied, the notice provided by the
Borough shall be in writing as indicated on the form attached hereto
entitled "Denial of Request to Review and/or Duplicate Borough
Records."16
B. If the request is denied or deemed denied, the requestor may file an
appeal with the commonwealth's Office of Open Records within 15
business days of a deemed denial. The appeal shall state the grounds
upon which the requestor asserts that the record is a public record and
shall address any grounds stated by the Borough for delaying or
denying the request.

evidence as a whole. The decision shall clearly and concisely explain the
rationale for the decision. A petition for review under this section shall
stay the release of documents until a decision is issued.
D. This article shall be available for review at the Borough office.

§ 204-21. Identification.
§ 204-22. Description and special requirements of identified
floodplain areas.
The identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific areas:
A. The identified floodplain area shall be any areas of the Borough of
Hellertown classified as special flood hazard areas (SFHAs) in the Flood
Insurance Study (FIS) and the accompanying Flood Insurance Rate
Maps (FIRMs) dated July 16, 2014, and issued by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), or the most recent revision
thereof, including all digital data developed as part of the Flood
Insurance Study and any Borough-identified flood hazard areas, if so
outlined.
B. The above-referenced FIS and FIRMs, and any subsequent revisions
and amendments, are hereby adopted by the Borough of Hellertown
and declared to be a part of this chapter.
A. The Floodway Area/District shall be those areas identified as
"Floodway" on the FIRM as well as those floodway areas which have
been identified in other available studies or sources of information for
those special flood hazard areas where no floodway has been identified
in the FIS. The floodway represents the channel of a watercourse and
the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the
base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation
by more than one foot at any point.
(1) Within any floodway area, no encroachments, including fill, new
construction, substantial improvements, or other development
shall be permitted unless it has been demonstrated through
hydrologic and hydraulic analysis performed in accordance with
standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment
would not result in any increase in flood levels within the
community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
(2) No new construction or development shall be allowed, unless a
permit is obtained from the Department of Environmental
Protection regional office.
B. AE Area without floodway shall be those areas identified as an AE Zone
on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base
flood elevations have been provided but no floodway has been
determined.
(1) No permit shall be granted for any construction, development, use,
or activity within any AE Area/District without floodway unless it is
demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed

C. A Area/District.
(1) The A Area/District shall be those areas identified as an A Zone on
the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no
one-percent annual chance flood elevations have been provided.
For these areas, elevation and floodway information from other
federal, state, or other acceptable source shall be used when
available. Where other acceptable information is not available, the
elevation shall be determined by using the elevation of a point on
the boundary of the identified floodplain area which is nearest the
construction site.
(2) In lieu of the above, the municipality may require the applicant to
determine the elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering
techniques. Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken
only by professional engineers or others of demonstrated
qualifications, who shall certify that the technical methods used
correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. Studies,
analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail
to allow a thorough technical review by the municipality.
D. Community identified flood hazard areas shall be those areas where
Hellertown Borough has identified local flood hazard or ponding areas,
as delineated and adopted on a Local Flood Hazard Map, using best
available topographic data and locally derived information such as flood
of record, historic high water marks, soils or approximate study
methodologies.
E. The X Zone shall be those areas identified as other flood areas on the
FIRM and for which have been designated as having 0.2% annual
change flood.

technical or scientific data. See § 204-26B for situations where FEMA
notification is required.
§ 204-24. Boundary disputes.
Should a dispute concerning any identified floodplain boundary arise, an
initial determination shall be made by the Floodplain Administrator, and any
party aggrieved by this decision or determination may appeal to the Zoning
Hearing Board. The burden of proof shall be on the appellant.
§ 204-25. Jurisdictional boundary changes.
Prior to development occurring in areas where annexation or other
corporate boundary changes are proposed or have occurred, the community
shall review flood hazard data affecting the lands subject to boundary
changes. The community shall adopt and enforce floodplain regulations in
areas subject to annexation or corporate boundary changes which meet or
exceed those in 44 CFR 60.3.

detrimental to property values, business opportunities, and the
enjoyment of life; is inconsistent with the Borough's property
maintenance goals, aesthetic standards and desire for a clean and safe
Borough; and results in additional graffiti and in other properties
nearby becoming the target of graffiti unless it is quickly removed from
public and private property. Graffiti results in visual pollution and is a
public nuisance. Graffiti must be abated as quickly as possible to avoid
detrimental impacts on the Borough and its residents and to prevent
the further spread of graffiti.

Borough Code Enforcement Officer shall have full jurisdiction over
the administration and enforcement of the Hellertown Graffiti
Ordinance.
C. It is the intention of the Borough of Hellertown through the adoption of
this chapter to provide additional enforcement tools to protect public
and private property from acts of graffiti vandalism and defacement.
The chapter is not intended to conflict with any existing graffiti state
law.

ARTICLE I
Reimbursement for Costs
[Adopted 5-19-2003 by Ord. No. 655]
§ 303-1. Purpose.
The purpose of this article and the policy of the Borough of Hellertown
shall be to protect and promote the public health, safety and welfare of
its citizens and to attempt to prevent the Hellertown Borough Police from
having to make a second and/or subsequent response to disorderly parties
on private property and to prevent its police officers from having to make
several return trips to a location of the party, gathering or event in response
to complaints to disperse uncooperative participants. The Borough has
found that repeated occurrence of these events constitutes a drain on
the Hellertown Borough Police personnel and resources which, at times,
causes other areas of the Borough to be left with minimum levels of police
protection. The Borough finds that there is a rational relationship between
imposition of a fine and/or other penalties upon responsible persons who
permit uncooperative participants to threaten the health, safety and general
welfare of the general public and cessation of that activity.
§ 303-2. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
LARGE EVENT  A large event shall include, but not be limited to, large
parties or gatherings of five or more persons who have assembled or are
assembling for a special occasion and/or for a social activity.
POLICE SERVICES  Police services shall include the salaries of the
responding officers at the salary then in effect for each classification of each
individual officer for the amount of time actually spent in responding to or
remaining at the party, gathering or event, the actual costs of any medical
treatment to an injured officer not covered by insurance and the cost of
repairing any damage to Borough equipment or property and any other
costs that arise out of the Borough of Hellertown performing its function in
dispersing uncooperative participants pursuant to this article.
RESPONSIBLE PERSON  A responsible person for the event and/or social
gathering is the individual or individuals who own the property where the
party, gathering or event takes place, the individual in of the premises and/
or the individual who organized the event. If the individual responsible for
the event is a minor, then the parent or guardian of the minor will be jointly
and severally liable for the costs incurred for police services up to the
amount permitted by law.
SECOND POLICE RESPONSE  Services provided by a Borough police
officer during a second and/or further additional call to a location after the
distribution of oral or written warning that the party, gathering or event
is in violation of a Borough ordinance and/or violation of the laws of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
§ 303-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 303-3
1:169
§ 303-3. Second response for police services at large events.
When a large party, gathering or event, as defined under this article, occurs
on private property and a police officer or officers at the scene determine
that there is a threat to the public peace, health, safety or general welfare,
the person responsible, as defined under this article, for the event shall be
held liable for the costs of providing police services for the second police
response by the Hellertown Borough Police if the Borough police officer or
another Borough police officer is required to return to the location a second
time after providing an oral or written warning on the initial response to the
scene, to control the threat to the public peace, health, safety and general
welfare. The failure by the responsible person to control the threat to the
public peace, health, safety or general welfare after receiving an oral or
written warning from the police officer to control the threat to the public
peace, health, safety or general welfare shall be subject to the police service
fees, as defined under this article. Nothing herein shall be construed to
prevent the Hellertown Borough Police on the second and/or return call in
arresting and/or citing the violators of the Borough ordinances and/or the
state Crimes Code.
§ 303-4. Police service fees.
The police service fees shall include the costs of personnel and equipment
but shall not exceed the cost of $500 for a single incident. The Borough
does not waive its right to seek reimbursement for actual costs exceeding
$500 through any and all other applicable remedies and/or procedures
at the disposal of the Borough of Hellertown. The amount of such police
service fees d against the responsible person shall be deemed a debt to
the Borough, and the debtor shall be the responsible person or persons
receiving said services and, if minors, their parents or guardians, as
permitted by law.
§ 303-5. Billing.
A. The Borough Chief of Police shall notify the Borough Manager upon the
rendering of such police services of the name, address and telephone
number of the responsible person and/or persons, the date and time of
the incident and the services performed and costs thereof, and such
other information as deemed required to indicate to the Borough the
costs of the police services. The Borough Manager shall take the
appropriate steps to cause the appropriate billings to be prepared and
submitted to the responsible person or persons.
B. The responsible person or persons shall have 30 days to remit payment
to the Borough of Hellertown. In the event that payment is not received
by the Borough of Hellertown within this time frame, the Borough
Solicitor may commence an action for appropriate relief at the
Magisterial District Judge or other court of competent jurisdiction to
seek payment of police service fees. In addition to paying the police
service fee, the responsible person shall also be liable for costs of suit
§ 303-3 HELLERTOWN CODE § 303-5
1:170
§ 303-6. Prosecution.
and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred by the Borough in the
proceedings to collect the police service fees.
A. Nothing in this article shall be construed as affecting the ability of the
Borough to initiate and/or continue concurrent or subsequent criminal
prosecutions for any violation of the provision of this article, any other
Borough ordinance or any state law arising out of the same
circumstances necessitating the application of this article. Any person
who shall violate the provisions of this article in addition to the police
service fee shall be subject, upon conviction before the Magisterial
District Judge in and for the Borough, to pay a fine of not less than $100
per violation.
B. A separate offense shall be deemed committed for each day in which a
violation of this article occurs. Persons violating this article shall be
liable for any fines imposed, plus court costs and reasonable attorneys'
fees incurred by the Borough in the proceedings to enforce the
provisions of this article.

residential rental license as herein provided. Such newly created
§ 326-3 HELLERTOWN CODE § 326-5
1:180
units shall be exempt from further inspection, unless a complaint
has been made about the premises or the Borough public official
has probable cause to believe that a violation has occurred
pursuant to this article, for a period of five years and will then be
inspected again when the designated area in which the premises
are located is next scheduled for inspection after the five-year
exemption has expired.
(2) Existing rental properties. The Borough of Hellertown shall fully
inspect each residential rental unit no more frequently than once
within a five-year period unless a complaint of violation has
occurred or the Borough public official has probable cause to
believe that a violation is occurring pursuant to this article or the
property has been sold pursuant to the section of this article below.
Unless sooner revoked for cause, the residential rental license shall
remain valid until such time as the next regularly scheduled
inspection occurs; provided, however, that the owner, operator,
responsible agent or manager complies with the requirements of
this article and annually provides the Borough with a properly
completed license questionnaire and pays the annual license
renewal fee to the Borough as the article requires.

managed by someone other than the owner, does not correct code and/
or ordinance violations found in response to a complaint or phased-in
inspection within the time frame cited by the Borough public official

vacant, it shall remain vacant. Notices issued pursuant to this section
shall be served in the same manner as set forth in the section entitled
"Notice of violations."
C. Reinstatement of residential rental license. A residential rental license
shall be reinstated if the owner or operator of a residential rental unit
corrects the reasons for the revocation of the residential rental license

residential rental unit, the new owner shall obtain a new residential

be submitted prior to obtaining the residential rental license. Failure

of the residential rental license. If a property is sold and subject to
reinspection pursuant to this section, the property shall thereafter be
inspected every five years pursuant to the section entitled "Phased-in
inspections."
A. The Borough public official shall make or cause to be made inspections

or the person in charge thereof, shall give the public officer free access
thereto and to all parts thereof and to the premises on which it is
located at all reasonable times for the purpose of such inspection,
examination and survey. To ensure that the five-year phased-in year
inspections are conducted in a fair and uniform manner and to provide
landlords with notice of those areas to be inspected, the Borough public
official shall inspect the items set forth in Exhibit "1" attached to this
article.57 This list shall not be construed to be and is not an all-inclusive
list and may be amended from time to time by the Borough public
official.

occupant or other person in charge of a structure subject to the
provisions of this article refuses, impedes, inhibits, interferes with,
restricts or obstructs entry and free access to every part of the

sought, the Borough public official shall promptly apply for an
administrative search/inspection warrant to a court of competent
jurisdiction and shall supply all necessary affidavits and testimony to
indicate that there is reasonable or probable cause to conduct an
inspection. For the purposes of this section, a reasonable or probable
cause to gain access and inspect shall include, without being limited to,

the applicable Borough and/or laws of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania. If the Borough public officer, at his sole discretion, is
satisfied with the landlord's response, no search pursuant to this
section shall occur. If the Borough public officer determines no effort

discretion, before proceeding to inspect the property pursuant to the

taken by the Borough public official ordering the property vacated
or to remain vacant.
C. Any person aggrieved by any decision of the Board may appeal to the
Court of Common Pleas of Northampton County within 30 days from the
date of the Board's decision. Such appeal shall be made by a duly
verified petition which shall set forth the factual and legal basis upon
which the decision of the Board is alleged to be illegal, in whole or in
part. Such petition shall be presented to the Court of Common Pleas,
and a notice thereof must be given to the Board within 30 days after the

B. National pretreatment standards and national categorical standards.
All industrial users are subject to the National Pretreatment Standards.
The National Categorical Standards found at 40 CFR Chapter I,
Subchapter N, Parts 405-471 are hereby incorporated into this article
by reference as though set forth in full. Industrial users must comply
with all applicable categorical standards and other requirements
promulgated by EPA. Any categorical standard, if more stringent than
the limitations imposed under this article, shall immediately supersede
the limitations imposed under this article.
(1) Where a categorical standard is expressed only in terms of either
the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the
Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator may impose equivalent
concentration or mass limits in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(c).
(2) When wastewater subject to a categorical standard is mixed with
wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the Industrial
Pretreatment Coordinator shall impose an alternate limit using the
combined waste stream formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e).
(3) An industrial user may obtain a variance from a categorical
standard from the EPA if the industrial user can prove, pursuant to
the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.13, that
factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally different from
the factors considered by EPA when developing the categorical
standard. If a variance is obtained, the City reserves the right to
modify the industrial user's permit to incorporate the revised
standards and requirements.
(4) An industrial user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a
categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15.
C. Modification of national categorical standards. Where the City's POTW
treatment plant achieves consistent removal of pollutants limited by
national categorical standards, the City may apply to the approval
authority for modification of specific limits in the national categorical
standards. "Consistent removal" is defined by the EPA in 40 CFR
403.7(b). The City may then modify pollutant discharge limits in the
national categorical standards if the requirements contained in 40 CFR,
§ 338-18 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 338-18
1:209
Part 403, Section 403.7 are fulfilled and prior approval from the
approval authority is obtained.
D. Specific pollutant discharge limitations; local limits.
(1) In accordance with 40 CFR 403.5(c), the City imposes the following
specific pollutant discharge limitations for all industrial users:
Pollutant (total)
Local Limit
(mg/l)
Arsenic 0.11
Cadmium 0.05
Chromium 0.91
Copper 1.35
Lead 0.39
Mercury 0.007
Molybdenum 0.22
Nickel 1.36
Selenium 0.23
Silver 0.21
Zinc 2.58
Cyanide 0.38
(2) The specific pollutant discharge limitations listed above are the
highest allowable concentration in any type of sample, either a
grab or composite, collected over any time interval, unless
otherwise specified in an IWDP.
(3) The specific pollutant discharge limitations listed above apply at
the point where the wastewater is discharged to the POTW or at
the point designated by the Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator.
(4) In addition to industrial users, the City reserves the right to apply
the specific pollutant discharge limitations listed above to any
user's wastewater discharge which is not composed of strictly
domestic sewage.
(5) The City reserves the right to establish alternate specific pollutant
discharge limitations in individual industrial waste discharge
permits, but only in accordance with regulatory requirements. In
no event shall any alternate limit allow the total loading allocated
to all industrial users for any pollutant to exceed the maximum
allowable industrial headwork's loading as determined in the City's
most recent local limits evaluation approved by the approval
authority. The specific pollutant discharge limitations, if more
stringent than the national categorical standards, shall
immediately supersede the national categorical standards.
§ 338-18 HELLERTOWN CODE § 338-18
1:210
E. State requirements. State requirements and limitations on discharges
shall apply in any case where they are more stringent than federal
requirements and limitations or those in this article.
F. City's right of revision. The City reserves the right to establish by
ordinance more stringent limitations or requirements on discharges to
the POTW if deemed necessary.
G. Excessive discharge. No user shall increase the use of process water
solely for the purpose of complying with this article or in any way
attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for
adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the limitations
contained in the national categorical standards or in any other
pollutant-specific limitation developed by the City or state. The
Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator may impose mass limitations on
users who are using dilution to meet applicable national categorical
standards or in any other pollutant-specific limitations or requirements
or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.
H. Accidental discharges/slug loads. Each industrial user shall provide
protection from accidental discharges/slug loads of prohibited
materials or other substances regulated by this article. Where facilities
are provided to prevent accidental discharges/slug loads of prohibited
materials, these facilities shall be provided and maintained at the
industrial user's own cost and expense. In the case of an accidental
discharge/slug loads, it shall be the responsibility of the industrial user,
upon discovery and after assessing the situation and taking initial
corrective action, to immediately telephone and notify the Industrial
Pretreatment Coordinator of the incident. The notification shall include
location of discharge, type of waste, estimated concentration and
volume if known, and initial corrective actions taken by the industrial
user.
(1) Written notice. Within five days following a accidental discharge/
slug loads; the industrial user shall submit to the Industrial
Pretreatment Coordinator a detailed written report including the
date, time, duration of the discharge as well as describing the
cause of the discharge, all corrective measures implemented or
attempted, and measures to be taken by the industrial user to
prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not
relieve the industrial user of any expenses, loss, damage, or other
liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW,
fish kills, or any other damage to person or property, nor shall such
notification relieve the industrial user of any fines, civil penalties,
or other liability which may be imposed by this article or other
applicable articles or laws.
(2) Notice to employees. A notice shall be permanently posted on the
industrial user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising
employees whom to call in the event of an accidental discharge/
§ 338-18 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 338-18
1:211
slug load. Employers shall ensure that all employees are advised of
the emergency notification procedures.
I. New or updated accidental discharge/slug control plans. An accidental
discharge or slug control plan, as prescribed under 40 CFR
403.8(f)(2)(v), shall be required:
(1) For new source industrial users. Detailed plans showing facilities
and operating procedures to provide protection from accidental
discharges or slugs shall be submitted to the City for review as part
of the IWDP application, and shall be approved by the City before
construction of the facility.
(2) For existing industrial users. The Industrial Pretreatment
Coordinator shall evaluate whether each industrial user needs a
new or updated accidental discharge/slug control plan.
J. Contents of accidental discharge/slug control plans.
(1) Should the Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator require the
industrial user to develop, submit for approval, and implement a
new or updated accidental discharge/slug control plan, the
accidental discharge/slug control plan shall address, at a minimum,
the following:
(a) Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch
discharges;
(b) Description of stored chemicals;
(c) Procedures for immediately notifying the Industrial
Pretreatment Coordinator of any accidental or slug discharge,
as required by Section 923.02(h) of the City of Bethlehem
Codified Ordinances, adopted herein by reference.
(d) Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or
slug discharge. Such procedures shall include, but are not
limited to, inspection and maintenance of storage areas,
handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading
operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training,
building of containment structures or equipment, measures for
containing toxic organic pollutants, including solvents, and/or
measures and equipment for emergency response.
(2) When an existing industrial user is required by the Industrial
Pretreatment Coordinator to provide and/or modify an accidental
discharge/slug control plan, the industrial user shall provide the
plan within 60 days of notification. Should the plan require
construction or implementation of measures to meet compliance,
the plan shall provide a schedule for those actions. After initial
review, should additional information be required to provide a
complete plan, it shall be furnished to the Industrial Pretreatment
§ 338-18 HELLERTOWN CODE § 338-18

users of the City's POTW for the implementation of the industrial
pretreatment program established herein. The applicable charges or fees
are set forth below.
Coordinator within 30 days of the date of notification. Failure to
submit a revised plan and/or failure to provide a complete plan
after the thirty-day submission period may render the industrial
waste discharge permit void.
(3) The City's review and approval of accidental discharge/slug control
plans shall not relieve the industrial user from the responsibility to
modify the industrial user's facility as necessary to meet the
requirements of this article.
(4) If not specifically required by the Industrial Pretreatment
Coordinator, the information, requirements, etc., called for in a
plan are not waived by the City, and the industrial user shall
provide all necessary items, procedures, etc., to prevent any
accidental discharge and/or slug discharge to the POTW.
(5) An approved state pollution prevention plan may substitute for all
or a portion of the contents of an accidental discharge/slug control
plan to the extent that it satisfies the requirements described
herein.
(6) All users are required to notify the POTW immediately of any
changes at its facility affecting potential for a slug discharge.

by the Borough to recover its costs incurred by implementation and
enforcement of the disposal and discharge of industrial waste and
other applicable waste generated within the Borough and
deposited into the City of Bethlehem's POTW.
C. Industrial waste surcharge.
(1) When approval is granted by the City to a user to discharge
industrial waste into the POTW, the user's sewer rental will be
based on the prevailing rate for normal domestic sewage plus a
quarterly surcharge based on the relative strength of said
industrial waste contribution and calculated as follows:
Surcharge = 0.00834 x Flow x {[(BOD5  300) x BOD5 Cost] +
[(TSS  350) x TSS Cost] + [(NH3 - N  50) x NH3-N Cost]}
Where:
Surcharge= Surcharge calculated quarterly;
0.00834 = constant to convert industrial waste strength from
mg/l to thousand pounds;
Flow = total quarterly discharge flow of the industrial
waste in million gallons;
BOD5 = biochemical oxygen demand (5-day) of the
industrial waste in mg/l;
300 = value expressing the BOD5 of normal domestic
sewage in mg/l;
BOD5
Cost
= annual City treatment cost per thousand pounds of
BOD5;
TSS = total suspended solids of the industrial waste in mg/
l;
350 = value expressing the TSS of normal domestic
sewage in mg/l;
TSS
Cost
= annual City treatment cost per thousand pounds of

NH3-N;
(2) The City reserves the right to substitute the following formula for
the surcharge in the event that BOD5 is not the normal measure of
the strength of the industrial waste:
§ 338-19 HELLERTOWN CODE § 338-19
1:214
Surcharge = 0.00834 x Flow x {[(COD  600) x COD Cost] +
[(TSS  350) x TSS Cost] + [(NH3-N  50) x NH3-N Cost]}
Where:
Surcharge= Surcharge calculated quarterly;
0.00834 = constant to convert industrial waste strength from
mg/l to thousand pounds;
Flow = total quarterly discharge flow of the industrial
waste in million gallons;
COD = chemical oxygen demand of the industrial waste
in mg/l;
600 = value expressing the COD of normal domestic
sewage in mg/l;
COD
Cost
= annual City treatment cost per thousand pounds
of COD;
TSS = total suspended solids of the industrial waste in
mg/l;
350 = value expressing the TSS of normal domestic
sewage in mg/l;
TSS
Cost
= annual City treatment cost per thousand pounds
of TSS;
NH3-N = ammonia-nitrogen of the industrial waste in mg/l;
50 = value expressing the NH3-N of normal domestic
sewage in mg/I;
NH3-N
Cost
= annual City treatment cost per thousand pounds
of NH3-N;
(3) When actual industrial waste values of BOD5 and/or COD and/or
TSS and/or NH3-N are less than the normal domestic sewage
values, then the normal domestic sewage values of 300, 600, 350
and/or 50 mg/l, respectively, shall be used in the calculation of the
surcharge in place of the actual industrial waste values.
(4) The annual City treatment costs per thousand pounds of BOD5,
COD, TSS and NH3-N shall be determined at the beginning of each
calendar year, based upon the City Sewer Fund's actual operating
costs from the previous year.
(5) In no instance shall the sewer rental for industrial waste be less
than the prevailing rate for normal domestic sewage.
(6) In order to ascertain the strength of an industrial waste requiring a
surcharge, the City shall cause appropriate analysis (BOD5, COD,
TSS and NH3-N) to be made quarterly, the average of which shall
be used to establish the surcharge for the ensuing quarter. A more
extensive analysis may be required under Section 923.04 of the
City of Bethlehem Codified Ordinances, adopted herein by
§ 338-19 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 338-19

reference. All sampling and analysis shall be completed in
accordance with the provisions of this article. All expenses for
these analyses shall be borne by the user.
(7) The City reserves the right to recalculate and adjust the surcharge
of any user at any time during the year due to the introduction of
new wastewater constituents or any substantial increase in the
strength of the wastewater. A substantial increase shall mean 15%
or greater.
A. It shall be unlawful for any significant and/or categorical industrial user
to discharge to the POTW tributary to the City's POTW treatment plant
without having first obtained a City industrial waste discharge permit
(IWDP), except as authorized by the Director of Water and Sewer

1:226
(1) Samples should be collected using twenty-four-hour flowproportional
composite collection techniques. In the event that
flow-proportional sampling is infeasible or not warranted in the
opinion of the Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator, the Industrial
Pretreatment Coordinator may authorize the use of timeproportional
sampling, a minimum of four grab samples where the
user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of
the effluent being discharged or a frequency of grab samples
acceptable to the Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator. The
Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator may allow grab samples to be
composited prior to analysis.
(2) Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols,
sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using
standard grab collection techniques.

techniques, all samples collected inappropriately shall be
discarded and recollected at the sole expense of the user.
(6) Sampling facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and
maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user
to keep its sampling location or facility in good working order shall
not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are
unrepresentative of its discharge.
(7) All sampling locations utilized to meet the discharge monitoring
provisions of this article shall be approved by the Industrial
Pretreatment Coordinator.
O. Analytical requirements. Wastewater pollutant analyses completed to
comply with any provision of this article shall meet the following
requirements:
(1) All pollutant analyses shall be performed in accordance with the
techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136, unless otherwise
specified in an applicable categorical standard. If 40 CFR Part 136
does not contain analytical techniques for the pollutant in question,
analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures
approved by the Administrator.
(2) The user shall provide the Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator
with the name, address and telephone number of any contract
laboratory intended to be utilized for pollutant analyses at least 48
hours prior to the collection of any samples. The Industrial
§ 338-20 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 338-20
1:227
Pretreatment Coordinator may recommend the use of an alternate
contract laboratory.
(3) Copies of laboratory analysis results shall be forwarded to the user
and the Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator simultaneously.
(4) Laboratory analysis results obtained by a user following improper
protocols or deemed technically deficient by the Industrial
Pretreatment Coordinator shall be discarded and samples shall be
reanalyzed at the sole expense of the user.
P. Flow measurement. All wastewater-flow-monitoring data obtained to
comply with any provision of this article shall meet the following
requirements:
(1) All new, required flow-measuring devices shall be approved by the
Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator prior to installation. The flowmeasuring
device(s) shall be properly designed, compatible with

Pretreatment Coordinator may require that existing flowmeasuring
devices be serviced by a certified technician or replaced
at the sole expense of the user.
(3) Flow-monitoring facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean,
and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a
user to keep its flow-monitoring facility in good working order shall
not be grounds for the user to claim that the measurements are
unrepresentative of its volume of flow to the POTW.
(4) If a user does not properly calibrate or maintain its flow-monitoring
equipment or if flow measurements are deemed inaccurate by the
Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator, the Industrial Pretreatment
Coordinator shall utilize the user's metered water usage records to
determine the volume of wastewater flow to the POTW. In this case,
all claims of product uptake, evaporation or other water losses shall
be precluded.
(5) If a user does not have a flow-measurement device, the Industrial
Pretreatment Coordinator may:
(a) Require installation of flow-monitoring facilities in accordance
with the provisions of this article; or
(b) Rely on the user's metered water usage records to determine
the volume of wastewater flow to the POTW. In this case,
metered water losses may be considered by the Industrial
Pretreatment Coordinator. Unmetered claims of product
uptake, evaporation or other losses shall be precluded unless
appropriate documentation can be provided by the user.
§ 338-20 HELLERTOWN CODE § 338-20
1:228
Q. Monitoring facilities.
(1) The City shall require to be provided and operated at the user's
own expense, sampling manholes or any other device or facility
suitable and appropriate to enable inspection, sampling, and flow
measurement of the building sewer and/or internal drainage
systems. Such manhole device or facility should normally be
situated on the user's premises in the user's possession, but the
City may, when a location would be impractical or cause undue
hardship on the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the
public street or sidewalk area and located so that it will not be
obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles.
(2) There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or
facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for
analysis. The facility, sampling, and measuring equipment shall be
maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at
the expense of the user.
R. Inspection and sampling.
(1) The City shall inspect, at a minimum annually, the facilities of any
user to ascertain whether the purpose of this article is being met
and all requirements are being complied with. Persons or
occupants of premises connected to the sewage collection system
shall allow the City or its representative ready access at all
reasonable times to all parts of the premises for the purpose of
inspection, sampling or in the performance of any duties. The
user's records of monitoring activities and results shall be available
for inspection and copying. The City shall have the right to set up
on the user's property such devices as are necessary to conduct
sampling inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering
operations without notification to the user.
(2) Where a user has security measures in force which would require
proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises,
the user shall make necessary arrangements with their security
guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification,
personnel from the City will be permitted to enter and to perform
their specific responsibilities within 10 minutes of their initial time
of arrival. Delaying City personnel for more than 10 minutes for any
reason or to complete process changes or to alter wastewater
constituency prior to sample collection shall be a violation of this
article and shall subject the user to the sanctions set forth in this
article.
(3) Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly
removed by the user at the written request of the Industrial
Pretreatment Coordinator and shall not be replaced without
§ 338-20 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 338-20
1:229
approval of the Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator. The costs of
clearing such access shall be borne by the user.
S. If the Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator has been refused any
records or access to a building, structure or property, or any part
thereof, or if the Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator believes that
there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine or specific
inspection and sampling program of the City designed to verify
compliance with this article or any permit or order issued hereunder or
to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the
community, then the Director of Water and Sewer Resources may seek
issuance of a search warrant from the appropriate judicial authority.
T. Pretreatment.
(1) Users shall provide wastewater treatment as necessary to comply
with this article and shall achieve compliance with all applicable
pretreatment standards, local limits, and the prohibitions set out in
Sections 923.02 of the City of Bethlehem Codified Ordinances,
adopted herein by reference, within the time limitations specified
by the agency issuing the standards. Any facilities necessary for
compliance shall be provided, operated and maintained at the
user's expense. Detailed plans describing such facilities and
operating procedures shall be submitted to the Industrial
Pretreatment Coordinator for review and shall be acceptable to the
Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator before such facilities are
constructed. The City's review of such plans and operating
procedures shall in no way relieve the user from the responsibility
of additional or future modifications of such facilities as necessary
to produce a discharge acceptable to the City under the provisions
of this article.
(2) Whenever deemed necessary, the Industrial Pretreatment
Coordinator may require users to restrict their discharge during
peak flow periods, designate that certain wastewater be
discharged only at specific points of the POTW, relocate and/or
consolidate points of discharge, separate domestic sewage waste
streams from industrial waste streams, and/or such other
conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and determine
the user's compliance with the requirements of this article.
(3) The Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator may require any person
discharging into the POTW to install and maintain, on its property
and at its expense, a suitable storage and flow-control facility to
ensure equalization of flow. A IWDP may be issued solely for flow
equalization.
(4) Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided when they are
necessary for the proper handling of wastewater containing
excessive amounts of grease and oil or sand; except that such
interceptors shall not be required for residential sources. All
§ 338-20 HELLERTOWN CODE § 338-20
1:230
interception units shall be of type and capacity approved by the
Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator and shall be so located to be
easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Such interceptors
shall be inspected, cleaned and repaired regularly, as needed, by
the user at its expense.
U. Publication of users in significant noncompliance. The City shall
annually publish, in a newspaper of general circulation that provides
meaningful public notice within the jurisdictions served by the POTW,
all users which at any time during the previous 12 months were in
significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards or
requirements. For the purpose of this provision, a user is in significant
noncompliance if its violation meets one or more of the following
criteria:
(1) Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as
those in which 66% or more of all of the measurements taken
during a six-month period exceed (by any magnitude) a numeric
pretreatment standard or requirement, including instantaneous
limits, as defined by 40 CFR 403.3(1);
(2) Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in
which 33% or more of all of the measurements for each pollutant
parameter taken during a six-month period equal or exceed the
product of a numeric pretreatment standard or requirement,
including instantaneous limits, as defined by 40 CFR 403.3(1)
multiplied by the applicable TRC (TRC = 1.4 for BOD5, CBOD5,
TSS, fats, oil, and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except
pH);
(3) Any other violation of a pretreatment effluent limit (daily maximum
or longer-term average) that the City determines has caused, alone
or in combination with other discharges, interference or passthrough
(including endangering the health of POTW personnel or
the general public);
(4) Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent
endangerment to human health, welfare or to the environment or
has resulted in the POTW's exercise of its emergency authority
under 40 CFR 403.8(f)(1)(vi)(B) to halt or prevent such a discharge;
(5) Failure to meet, within 90 days after the schedule date, a
compliance schedule milestone contained in a local control
mechanism or enforcement order for starting construction,
completing construction, or attaining final compliance;
(6) Failure to provide, within 45 days after the schedule date, required
reports such as baseline monitoring reports, ninety-day compliance
reports, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on
compliance with compliance schedules;
(7) Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or
§ 338-20 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 338-20
1:231
(8) Any other violation or group of violations which may include
violations of BMPs that the City determines will adversely affect the
operation or implementation of the City's pretreatment program.
V. Confidential information.
(1) Information and data on a user obtained from reports,
questionnaires, permit applications, permit and monitoring
programs and from inspections shall be available to the public or
other governmental agency without restriction unless the user
specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction
of the City that the release of such information would divulge
information, processes or methods of production entitled to
protection as trade secrets or other confidential business
information of the user.
(2) When requested by the person furnishing a report, the portions of a
report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall
not be made available for inspection by the public but shall be
made available upon written request to governmental agencies for
uses related to this article, the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES) permit, State Disposal System permit
and/or the pretreatment programs; provided, however, that such
portions of a report shall be available for use by the EPA or the
state in judicial review or enforcement proceedings involving the
person furnishing the report. Effluent data, as defined in 40 CFR
2.302(a)(2), will not be recognized as confidential information.
W. Record retention.
(1) Users shall maintain records of all information resulting from any
discharge monitoring activities completed by the user. At a
minimum, such records must include:
(a) The date, exact place, method, time of sampling and the names
of the person(s) collecting the samples;
(b) Dates analyses were performed;
(c) Who performed the analyses;
(d) Analytical techniques/methods used; and
(e) The results of such analyses.
(2) Users shall retain and preserve for no less than three years any
records, reports, chemical analyses, etc., made by or on behalf of
the user in connection with its discharge, records associated with
implementation of BMPs and any other records required by the City
related to the MIPP. In addition, any records that pertain to matters
that are the subject of special orders or any other enforcement or
litigation activities brought by the City shall be retained and
preserved by the user until all enforcement activities have
§ 338-20 HELLERTOWN CODE § 338-20
1:232
§ 338-21. Enforcement (923.05).
concluded and all periods of limitation with respect to any and all
appeals have expired. The user shall, upon request and within the
time frame specified by the Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator,
furnish to the City copies of any records required to be kept by this
article.
A. Suspension. The City and/or the Borough and the Borough Authority
may suspend the wastewater treatment service and/or an IWDP without
prior notice when such suspension is necessary in order to stop an
actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present an
imminent and substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of
persons, to the environment, causes interference to the POTW or
causes the City and/or the Borough and Borough Authority to violate
any condition of their NPDES permit. In the event of a failure of the
person to comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the City shall
take steps as deemed necessary, including immediate termination of
water service and/or immediate severance of the sewer connection, to
prevent or minimize damage to the POTW system or endangerment to
any individuals. The service and/or IWDP shall be restored within five
working days after, in the opinion of the City, the actual or threatened
cause for the suspension has been removed. The above actions shall be
taken only as ordered by the Director of Water and Sewer Resources.
B. Notice of suspension.
(1) In the event that the City and/or the Borough and Borough
Authority decides it is necessary to suspend their wastewater
treatment service for reasons other than as described above, the
user shall be given a fifteen-day notice of such suspension. Any
person notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment service
and/or IWDP shall stop or eliminate the contribution as required in
the suspension notice. Between the time of the notice of suspension
of services and the date services are terminated, the user shall
have the right to have a show cause hearing with the hearing board
regarding the cause of the suspension.
(2) The City shall reinstate the IWDP and/or wastewater treatment
service within five working days upon proof of the elimination of
the noncomplying discharge or in compliance with instruction of
the hearing board. A detailed written statement submitted by the
user describing the cause of the harmful contributions and the
measures taken to prevent any future occurrence shall be
submitted to the City within five days of the date of occurrence. In
the event of a failure of the user to comply with the suspension
notice, the City may take such steps as deemed necessary to
terminate the service.
C. Revocation of permit. Any user who violates the conditions of this
article, or applicable state and federal regulations, is subject to having
§ 338-20 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 338-21
1:233
the user's permit revoked as described in Section 923.04(k) of the City
of Bethlehem Codified Ordinances, adopted herein by reference.
D. Notification of violation. Whenever the City finds that any user has
violated or is violating this article, an industrial waste discharge permit
or any prohibition, limitation of requirements contained herein, the City
may serve upon such person a written notice of violation stating the
nature of the violation. Within 30 days of the date of the Notice, a plan
for the satisfactory correction thereof shall be submitted to the City by
the user.
E. Hearing board.
(1) A hearing board shall be appointed by the Mayor of the City of
Bethlehem, as needed, for the purpose of hearing and deciding
appeals between the City and users on matters concerning
interpretation and execution of the provisions of this article. Cost of
appeals shall be borne by the user requesting an appeal.
(2) The chairperson of the board shall be a member of City Council's
Public Works Committee; one member shall be a professional
engineer skilled in practice of sanitary engineering; one member
shall be a representative of industry or manufacturing enterprise;
one member shall be a representative of a local environmental
organization; and one member shall be selected at large for that
member's interest in accomplishing the objectives of this article.
(3) Terms on the board shall be for a period of five years. The Mayor
shall appoint representatives to fill vacancies on the board to
complete unexpired terms. Interim appointments may be permitted
to serve an additional full term on the board. Hearing boards may
be appointed as standing panels or on a case-by-case basis, as
determined from time to time, in the sole discretion of the Mayor.
F. Show cause hearing.
(1) The City, the Borough and Borough Authority may order any user
who causes or allows an unauthorized discharge to enter the POTW
to show cause before the hearing board why the proposed
enforcement action should not be taken. A notice shall be served on
the user specifying the time and place of a hearing to be held by the
hearing board regarding the violation, the reasons why the action
is to be taken, the proposed enforcement action, and directing the
user to show cause before the hearing board why the proposed
enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing
shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return
receipt requested) at least 10 days before the hearing. Service may
be made on any agent or officer of a corporation.
(2) The hearing board may itself conduct the hearing and take the
evidence, or may designate any one or more of its members, or any
officer or employee of the assigned department to:
§ 338-21 HELLERTOWN CODE § 338-21
1:234
(a) Issue, in the name of the hearing board, notices of hearings
requesting the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the
production of evidence relevant to any matter involved in such
hearings.
(b) Receive evidence.
(c) Transmit a report of the evidence and hearing, including
transcripts and other evidence, together with
recommendations to the hearing board for action thereon.
(3) At any hearing pursuant to this article, testimony taken must be
under oath and recorded stenographically. The transcript, so
recorded, will be made available to any member of the public or any
party to the hearing upon payment of the usual charges thereof.
(4) After the hearing board has reviewed the evidence, it may issue an
order to the user responsible for the discharge, directing that,
following a specified time period, the sewer service be discontinued
unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or other related
appurtenances shall have been installed on existing treatment
facilities, devices or other related appurtenances and are properly
operated. Further and/or other orders and directives as are
necessary and appropriate may be issued.
G. Consent orders. The City may enter into consent orders, assurances of
voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an
agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such
documents will include specific action to be taken by the user to correct
the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document.
H. Compliance orders. When the Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator
finds that a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of
this article, an IWDP or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the City may issue an order to
the user responsible for the discharge, directing that the user come into
compliance within a specified time. If the user does not come into
compliance within the time provided, wastewater service may be
discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other
related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance
orders also may contain other requirements to address the
noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management
practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to
the POTW. A compliance schedule contained in any compliance order
shall not be construed as an extension of the deadline for compliance
established for any pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a
compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including
any continuing violation.
I. Cease and desist orders. When the Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator
finds that a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of
this article, an IWDP or order issued hereunder, or any other
§ 338-21 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 338-21
1:235
pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations
are likely to recur, the City and/or the Borough and Borough Authority
may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such
violations and directing the user to:
(1) Immediately comply with all requirements; and
(2) Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation,
including halting operations, terminating the discharge or hauling
noncompliant discharges off site for proper disposal.
J. Administrative fines.
(1) When the Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator finds that a user has
violated or continues to violate any provision of the City of
Bethlehem Codified Ordinances adopted herein by reference, an
IWDP or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment
standard or requirement, the City may fine such user in an amount
not to exceed the amount set forth in Section 923.99 of the City of
Bethlehem Codified Ordinance, adopted herein by reference, for
each violation regardless of jurisdictional boundaries. Such fines
shall be assessed in accordance with the terms set forth in this
article and/or the City's Enforcement Response Plan. In the case of
weekly, monthly or other long-term average discharge limits, fines
shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation.
(2) A lien against the user's property will be sought and other
enforcement collection action may be taken for unpaid fines.
(3) Users desiring to dispute such fines shall file a written request for
the City to reconsider the fine along with the full payment of the
fine amount within 30 days of being notified of the fine. The hearing
board may convene to deliberate on the matter. In the event the
appeal is successful, the payment, together with any interest
accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user. The City may add
the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as
notices and orders, to the fine when the fine and or a portion of
same is substantiated.
(4) Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against or a
prerequisite for taking any other action against the user.
K. Legal action. The City and/or the Borough and Borough Authority shall
be able to seek injunctive relief for noncompliance by users with
pretreatment standards or requirements. Injunctive relief is available
for violations of any requirement stated in this article and/or the City of
Bethlehem Codified Ordinance or industrial waste discharge permits,
including, but not limited to, wastewater discharge violations, failure to
allow access by the City to a user's facility, failure to submit reports by a
specified deadline, or any violation of any order of the City. The City
Solicitor and/or Borough Solicitor may commence an action for
§ 338-21 HELLERTOWN CODE § 338-21
1:236
appropriate legal and/or equitable relief in the local Court of Common
Pleas.
L. Remedies nonexclusive. The remedies provided for in this article are
not exclusive. The City and/or Borough and Borough Authority may take
any, all, or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant
user. Enforcement of industrial pretreatment program violations will be
in accordance with this article and/or the City's Enforcement Response
Plan. However, the City may take other action against any user when
the circumstances warrant. Further, the City is empowered to take
more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant user.
Where the Enforcement Response Plan does not provide guidelines on
enforcement action for a specific instance of noncompliance, the City
may impose other appropriate enforcement action to address the
noncompliance.
M. Appeals. A user may appeal the terms of an IWDP administrative fine or
any administrative action within 30 days of notice of its issuance. The
written appeal request shall provide the name, address and telephone
number of the appellant as well the date that the City and/or Borough
and Borough Authority took the action which is the subject matter of
the appeal. In its petition, the appealing party shall also indicate the
provisions objected to, the reasons for this objection, and the
alternative condition, if any.
(1) Failure to submit a timely appeal for review shall be deemed to be a
waiver of the administrative appeal.
(2) The conditions of the current IWDP shall remain in effect pending
the appeal of the new IWDP.
(3) The City and/or Borough and Borough Authority shall respond with
its position within 60 days of filing of an appeal.
(4) The user must file its appeal with the hearing board described in
Section 923.05(e) of the Codified Ordinances of the City of
Bethlehem to conduct a hearing and decide an appeal on the
matter.
(5) Aggrieved parties seeking judicial review of the final administrative
decision must do so by filing a complaint with the local Court of
Common Pleas within 30 days of the decision of the hearing board.
N. Conference option. At the time an appeal is requested, the user may
also request a conference with the City and/or Borough and Borough
Authority prior to the scheduling of a hearing board hearing. Said
conference will include appropriate members of the municipal and/or
authority staff and its agents. Violations and penalties will be explained
and discussed. Electing this option does not foreclose and/or affect the
user's right to a hearing, provided that the written request for the
hearing was filed within 30 days of service as noted above. The purpose
of this option is to provide the user with an informal forum within which
§ 338-21 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 338-21

§ 338-22. Repealer and ability to amend and repeal all of or parts of
this article without the consent of the City of Bethlehem (923.06).
§ 338-23. Holding tank waste (923.08).
to discuss the alleged violations and expedite conclusion and/or
resolution of outstanding enforcement actions. If resolution is not
reached within 90 days of the scheduled conference, the City shall
schedule the matter for hearing board hearing. In any event, either
party may request a hearing board hearing at any point during the
conference proceedings.
A. All ordinances and parts of ordinances inconsistent herewith be and the
same are hereby repealed.
B. The Borough of Hellertown has executed an agreement with the City of
Bethlehem dated November 4, 1985, and has adopted this article to
enforce the terms of that agreement. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, the Borough of Hellertown, in its sole and absolute
discretion, unilaterally reserves the right to amend, alter or repeal this
article and any part thereof; provided, however, the Borough of
Hellertown shall serve prior written notice, not less than 60 days prior
to the date of enactment of such amendment of repeal, upon the City of
Bethlehem. The Borough of Hellertown reserves the right to engage in
such activities on more than one occasion, provided notice thereof is
given to the City of Bethlehem and such action on the part of the City of
Bethlehem, with or without the consent of the City of Bethlehem and
also over the objection of the City of Bethlehem, shall constitute a pro
tonto modification of this agreement and, if applicable, a repeal of this
agreement, it being mutually agreed that the Borough of Hellertown for
itself, its successors and assigns has reserved the unilateral rights
stated above.
C. The Borough of Hellertown reserves all rights pursuant to the aforesaid
paragraph to alter, amend or repeal this article without the consent of
the City of Bethlehem, its successor or assigns.
A. Holding tank waste. The City may accept discharged, trucked or hauled
waste exclusively from holding tanks for treatment. The decision for
approval shall be based on, but not limited to, the source,
characteristics and volume of waste to be discharged. In no instance
shall holding tank waste be discharged to the POTW without prior
approval by the Superintendent. All holding tank waste discharges shall
be regulated through the City's industrial pretreatment program.
B. Septage. The City may accept for treatment trucked and hauled septage
which originated from chemical toilets, campers, trailers or residential,
commercial, or industrial septic tanks/cesspools containing domestic
sewage only. The decision for approval shall be based on, but not
limited to, the characteristics of the septage in conjunction with the
volume of septage to be discharged. In no instance shall septage be
§ 338-21 HELLERTOWN CODE § 338-23
1:238
§ 338-24. Penalty (923.99).
discharged to the POTW without prior approval by the Superintendent.
All septage discharges shall be regulated in accordance with the City's
industrial pretreatment program and/or septage management plan.
C. Discharge points. The City shall designate the authorized discharge
point(s) for holding tank waste and septage. All such discharges must
be made at the designated point(s).
D. Application for discharge. The City may require that some or all of the
information listed in Section 923.04(d) of the City of Bethlehem
Codified Ordinances, adopted herein by reference, be submitted to the
Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator for review as part of the
decisionmaking process for approval to discharge holding tank waste or
septage.
E. Approval to discharge. The City may issue a letter of approval for
limited frequency discharges or may require that a permit be obtained
for the proposed discharge. Permits will be obtained in accordance with
Section 923.04 of the City of Bethlehem Codified Ordinances, adopted
herein by reference, and/or the City's septage management plan
incorporated into this article by reference.
F. Enforcement. Users will adhere to and obey all terms and conditions
stated in their individual approval letters or permits and the
requirements of this article. Any violation of the terms and conditions of
individual approval letters or permits or the requirements of this article
shall subject the user to the sanctions set out in this article. Obtaining
an approval to discharge holding tank waste or septage from the City
does not relieve a user of its obligation to comply with any other
requirements of federal, state and local law.
G. Fees. A fee based on the City's current fee schedule will be levied on all
holding tank waste or septage discharged to the City's POTW. Holding
tank waste and septage may also be subject to surcharge fees as
described in Section 923.03 (§ 338-19 of this article). (See City of
Bethlehem Codified Ordinances, Ord. 2009-1, passed 1-6-2009, adopted
herein by reference.)
A. Criminal penalties. A user who willfully or negligently violates any
provision of this article, an IWDP or order issued hereunder, or who
willfully or negligently introduces any substance into the POTW which
causes personal injury, property damage, pass-through, interference, or
any user who knowingly makes any false statements, representations or
certifications in any application, record, report, plan or other document
filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this article, an IWDP or
order issued under this article, or who falsifies, tampers with or
knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method
required under this article may be subject to criminal prosecution in
§ 338-23 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 338-24
1:239
accordance with the applicable provisions of the Pennsylvania Crimes
Code, 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 101 et seq.
B. Civil penalties.
(1) In accordance with PA Act 9, any user who has violated or
continues to violate any provision of this article, an IWDP, or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement shall be liable to the City for a maximum civil penalty
of $25,000 per violation per day.
(2) In determining the amount of civil liability, there shall be taken into
account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to,
the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and
duration of the violation, any economic benefit gained through the
user's violation, corrective actions by the user, the compliance
history of the user, and any other factor as justice requires. All
penalties shall be assessed in accordance with this article and the
City's Enforcement Response Plan.
(3) Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.
(4) In the event any user's violation(s) results in the imposition of a fine
or other penalty on the City or the Borough and Borough Authority
by the EPA, the state or any other agency, such violation(s) shall be
punishable by a civil penalty at least equal to the dollar amount
imposed upon the City or the Borough and Borough Authority plus
their administrative, legal, engineering costs, and expenses, but
not more than $25,000 per day per violation.
C. Pursuant to 40 CFR 403.8(f)(l)(vi)(A), any penalties required under this
section will apply per violation per day. Each day on which a violation
shall occur or continue shall be deemed a separate and distinct offense.
In the case of weekly, monthly or other long-term average discharge
limits, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the
violation. In addition to the penalties provided herein, the City and/or
Borough and Borough Authority may recover reasonable costs for any
loss, damage, cleaning, repair, or replacement work caused by the
violation, attorneys' fees, court costs, court reporters' fees and other
expenses of litigation by appropriate suit at law against the person
found to have violated this article or the orders, rules, regulations, and
permits issued hereunder.

General Provisions
§ 378-1. Short title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Act 167 Stormwater
Management Ordinance."
§ 378-2. Statement of findings.
The governing body of the Borough finds that:
§ 378-3. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to promote the public health, safety and
welfare within the Saucon Creek Watershed by minimizing the damages and
maximizing the benefits described in § 378-2 of this chapter by provisions
designed to:
A. Inadequate management of accelerated runoff of stormwater resulting
from development throughout a watershed increases flood flows and
velocities, contributes to erosion and sedimentation, changes the
natural hydrologic patterns, destroys aquatic habitat, elevates aquatic
pollutant concentrations and loadings, overtaxes the carrying capacity
of streams and storm sewers, greatly increases the cost of public
facilities to carry and control stormwater, undermines floodplain
management and flood control efforts in downstream communities,
reduces groundwater recharge, and threatens public health and safety.
B. A comprehensive program of stormwater management, including
reasonable regulation of development and activities causing
accelerated erosion and loss of natural infiltration, is fundamental to
the public health, safety and welfare and the protection of the people of
the Borough and all of the people of the commonwealth, their resources
and the environment.
C. Stormwater can be an important resource by providing groundwater
recharge for water supplies and baseflow of streams, which also
protects and maintains surface water quality.*
D. Public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an
essential component in successfully addressing stormwater.*
E. Federal and state regulations require certain boroughs to implement a
program of stormwater controls. These Boroughs are required to obtain
a permit for stormwater discharges from their separate storm sewer
systems under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES).*
F. Nonstormwater discharges to Borough separate storm sewer systems
can contribute to pollution of waters of the commonwealth by the
Borough.*
§ 378-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 378-3
1:271
§ 378-4. Statutory authority.
The Borough is empowered to regulate these activities by the authority of
the Act of October 4, 1978, P.L. 864 (Act 167), 32 P.S. § 680.1 et seq., as
amended, the "Stormwater Management Act," and the Borough Code.
§ 378-5. Applicability.
A. Manage stormwater runoff impacts at their source by regulating
activities which cause such problems.
B. Utilize and preserve the desirable existing natural drainage systems.
C. Encourage infiltration of stormwater, where appropriate, to maintain
groundwater recharge, to prevent degradation of surface water and
groundwater quality and to otherwise protect water resources.
D. Maintain the existing flows and quality of streams and watercourses in
the Borough and the commonwealth.
E. Preserve and restore the flood-carrying capacity of streams.
F. Provide for proper maintenance of all permanent stormwater
management BMPs that are implemented in the Borough.
G. Provide review procedures and performance standards for stormwater
planning, design and management.*
H. Manage stormwater impacts close to the runoff source which requires a
minimum of structures and relies on natural processes.*
I. Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including
regulations at 25 Pa. Code Chapter 93.4a to protect and maintain
"existing uses" and maintain the level of water quality to support those
uses in all streams and to protect and maintain water quality in "special
protection" streams.*
J. Prevent scour and erosion of stream banks and streambeds.*
K. Provide standards to meet the NPDES permit requirements.*
A. This chapter shall only apply to those areas of the Borough which are

§ 378-6. Exemptions.
(2) Subdivision.
(3) Construction of new or additional impervious surfaces (driveways,
parking lots, etc.).
(4) Construction of new buildings or additions to existing buildings.
(5) Diversion or piping of any natural or man-made stream channel.
(6) Installation of stormwater systems or appurtenances thereto.
(7) Regulated earth disturbance activities.*
A. Impervious cover. Any proposed regulated activity, except those defined
in § 378-5B(5) and (6), which would create 10,000 square feet or less of
additional impervious cover is exempt from the drainage plan
preparation provisions of this chapter. The date of the Borough
adoption of the Stormwater Management Ordinance shall be the
starting point from which to consider tracts as "parent tracts" in which
future subdivisions and respective impervious area computations shall
be cumulatively considered. For development taking place in stages,
the entire development plan must be used in determining conformance
with these criteria. Additional impervious cover shall include, but not
be limited to, additional indoor living spaces, decks, patios, garages,
driveways, storage sheds and similar structures, any roof, parking or
driveway areas and any new streets and sidewalks constructed as part
of or for the proposed regulated activity. Any additional areas proposed
to initially be gravel, crushed stone, porous pavement, etc., shall be
assumed to be impervious for the purposes of comparison to the
exemption criteria. Any existing gravel, crushed stone or hard-packed
soil areas on a site shall be considered as pervious cover for the
purpose of exemption evaluation. All of the impervious cover added
incrementally to a site above the initial 10,000 square feet shall be
subject to the provisions of this chapter. If a site has previously received
an exemption and is proposing additional development such that the
total impervious cover on the site exceeds 10,000 square feet, the total
impervious cover on the site proposed since the original ordinance date
must meet the provisions of this chapter.
B. Prior drainage plan approval. Any regulated activity for which a
drainage plan was previously prepared as part of a subdivision or land
development proposal that received preliminary plan approval from the
Borough prior to the effective date of this chapter is exempt from the
drainage plan preparation provisions of this chapter, except as cited in
Subsection C, provided that the approved drainage plan included
design of stormwater facilities to control runoff from the site currently
proposed for regulated activities consistent with ordinance provisions
in effect at the time of approval and the approval has not lapsed under
the Borough's Planning Code.80 If significant revisions are made to the

Approvals issued pursuant to this chapter do not relieve the applicant of
the responsibility to secure required permits or approvals for activities
regulated by any other applicable code, rule, act or ordinance.
§ 378-8. Duty of persons engaged in the development of land.
Notwithstanding any provisions of this chapter, including exemption and
waiver provisions, any landowner and any person engaged in the alteration
or development of land which may affect stormwater runoff characteristics
shall implement such measures as are reasonably necessary to prevent
injury to health, safety or other property. Such measures shall include such
actions as are required to manage the rate, volume, direction and quality
of resulting stormwater runoff in a manner which otherwise adequately
protects health and property from possible injury.

date of this chapter, preparation of a new drainage plan subject to
the provisions of this chapter shall be required. Significant revisions
would include a change in control methods or techniques, relocation
or redesign of control measures or changes necessary because soil or
other conditions are not as stated on the original drainage plan.
C. These exemptions shall not relieve the applicant from implementing
such measures as are necessary to protect health, safety, property and
state water quality requirements. These measures include adequate
and safe conveyance of stormwater on the site and as it leaves the site.
These exemptions do not relieve the applicant from the responsibility to
secure required permits or approvals for activities regulated by any
other applicable code, rule, act or ordinance.
D. No exemptions shall be provided for regulated activities as defined in
§ 378-5B(5) and (6).

Chapters 93 and 96)  including:
Each stream segment in Pennsylvania has a "designated use," such
as "cold water fishes" or "potable water supply," which are listed in
Chapter 93. These uses must be protected and maintained, under state
regulations.
A.
"Existing uses" are those attained as of November 1975, regardless
of whether they have been designated in Chapter 93. Regulated earth
disturbance activities must be designed to protect and maintain
existing uses and maintain the level of water quality necessary to
protect those uses in all streams, and to protect and maintain water
quality in special protection streams.
B.
Water quality involves the chemical, biological and physical
characteristics of surface water bodies. After regulated earth
disturbance activities are complete, these characteristics can be
impacted by addition of pollutants such as sediment and changes in
habitat through increased flow volumes and/or rates as a result of
changes in land surface area from those activities. Therefore,
permanent discharges to surface waters must be managed to protect
the stream bank, streambed and structural integrity of the waterway, to
prevent these impacts.

Stormwater Management Requirements
§ 378-11. General requirements.
A. All regulated activities in the Borough shall be subject to the
stormwater management requirements of this chapter.
B. Storm drainage systems shall be provided to permit unimpeded flow in
natural watercourses except as modified by stormwater detention
facilities, pipe systems or open channels consistent with this chapter.
C. The existing locations of concentrated drainage discharge onto
adjacent property shall not be altered without written approval of the
affected property owner(s).
D. Areas of existing diffused drainage discharge onto adjacent property
shall be managed such that, at minimum, the peak diffused flow does
not increase in the general direction of discharge, except as otherwise
provided in this chapter. If diffused flow is proposed to be concentrated
and discharged onto adjacent property, the developer must document
that there are adequate downstream conveyance facilities to safely
transport the concentrated discharge to the point of predevelopment
flow concentration, to the stream reach, or otherwise prove that no
harm will result from the concentrated discharge. Areas of existing
diffused drainage discharge shall be subject to any applicable release
rate criteria in the general direction of existing discharge whether they
are proposed to be concentrated or maintained as diffused drainage
areas.
E. Where a site is traversed by watercourses other than those for which a
one-hundred-year floodplain is defined by the Borough, there shall be
provided drainage easements conforming substantially with the line of
such watercourses. The width of any easement shall be adequate to
provide for unimpeded flow of storm runoff based on calculations made
in conformance with § 378-17 for the one-hundred-year return period
runoff and to provide a freeboard allowance of 1/2 foot above the design
water surface level. The terms of the easement shall prohibit
excavation, the placing of fill or structures, and any alterations which
may adversely affect the flow of stormwater within any portion of the
easement. Also, periodic maintenance of the easement to ensure proper
runoff conveyance shall be required. Watercourses for which the onehundred-
year floodplain is formally defined are subject to the applicable
Borough floodplain regulations.85
F. When it can be shown that, due to topographic conditions, natural
drainage swales on the site cannot adequately provide for drainage,
open channels may be constructed conforming substantially to the line

shall be calculated using the Manning Equation.
G. Post-construction BMPs shall be designed, installed, operated and
maintained to meet the requirements of the Clean Streams Law86 and
implementing regulations, including the established practices in 25 Pa.
Code Chapter 102 and the specifications of this chapter, to prevent
accelerated erosion in watercourse channels and at all points of
discharge.
H. No earth disturbance activities associated with any regulated activities
shall commence until approval by the Borough of a plan which
demonstrates compliance with the requirements of this chapter.*
I. Techniques described in Appendix D (Low-Impact Development)87 of
this chapter are encouraged because they reduce the costs of
complying with the requirements of this chapter and the state water
quality requirements.*
J. Infiltration for stormwater management is encouraged where soils and
geology permit, consistent with the provisions of this chapter and,
where appropriate, the Recommendation Chart for Infiltration
Stormwater Management BMPs in Carbonate Bedrock in Appendix B.88
Infiltration is encouraged for capturing and treating the water quality

A. No regulated earth disturbance activities within the Borough shall
commence until approval by the Borough Engineer of an erosion and
sediment control plan for construction activities. Written approval by
DEP or a delegated county conservation district shall satisfy this
requirement.
B. An erosion and sediment control plan is required by DEP regulations for

Code § 102.4(b).
C. A DEP NPDES Stormwater Discharges Associated with Construction
Activities Permit is required for regulated earth disturbance activities
under 25 Pa. Code Chapter 92.
D. Evidence of any necessary permit(s) for regulated earth disturbance
activities from the appropriate DEP regional office or county
conservation district must be provided to the Borough before the
commencement of an earth disturbance activity.
E. A copy of the erosion and sediment control plan and any permit, as
required by DEP regulations, shall be available at the project site at all
times.
A. No regulated earth disturbance activities within the Borough shall
commence until approval by the Borough Engineer of a plan which
demonstrates compliance with this chapter. DEP has determined that
this chapter meets state water quality requirements. Therefore, any
approvals under this chapter would satisfy the post-construction
stormwater management requirements associated with an NPDES
permit for stormwater discharges associated with construction
activities.*
B. The water quality volume (WQv) shall be captured and treated. The
WQv shall be calculated two ways.
(1) First, WQv shall be calculated using the following formula:
§ 378-12 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 378-14
1:287
WQv = (c)(P)(A)/12
Where
WQv = Water quality volume in acre-feet
c = Rational Method post-development runoff coefficient
for the two-year storm
P = 1.25 inches
A = Area in acres of proposed regulated activity
(2) Second, the WQv shall be calculated as the difference in runoff
volume from predevelopment to post development for the two-year
return period storm. The effect of closed depressions on the site
shall be considered in this calculation. The larger of these two
calculated volumes shall be used as the WQv to be captured and
treated, except that in no case shall the WQv be permitted to
exceed 1.25 inches of runoff over the site area.
C. The WQv shall be calculated for each post-development drainage
direction on a site for sizing BMPs. Site areas having no impervious
cover and no proposed disturbance during development may be
excluded from the WQv calculations and do not require treatment.
D. If an applicant is proposing to use a wet pond, constructed wetland or
other BMP that ponds water on the land surface and may receive direct
sunlight, the discharge from that BMP must be treated by infiltration, a
vegetated buffer, filter strip, bioretention, vegetated swale or other
BMP that provides a thermal benefit to protect the high quality waters
of the Saucon Creek from thermal impacts.
E. Any stormwater runoff from the site as a result of the regulated
activities must either be treated with infiltration or two acceptable
BMPs, such as those listed in Subsection N.
F. Infiltration BMPs shall not be constructed on fill.
G. The applicant shall document the bedrock type(s) present on the site
from published sources. Any apparent boundaries between carbonate
and noncarbonate bedrock shall be verified through more detailed site
evaluations by a qualified geotechnical professional.
H. For each proposed regulated activity in the watershed, the applicant
shall conduct a preliminary site investigation on the portion of the site
that is judged to be the best candidate hydrogeologically for possible
infiltration, including gathering data from published sources, a field
inspection of the site, a minimum of one test pit and a minimum of two
percolation tests, as outlined in Appendix E.89 This investigation will
determine depth to bedrock, depth to the seasonal high-water table,
soil permeability and location of special geologic features, if applicable.
89.Editor's Note: Appendix E is included at the end of this chapter.
§ 378-14 HELLERTOWN CODE § 378-14
1:288
The location(s) of special geologic features shall be verified by a
qualified geotechnical professional.
I. For entirely noncarbonate sites, the WQv shall be infiltrated unless the
applicant demonstrates that it is infeasible to infiltrate the WQv for
reasons of seasonal high-water table, permeability rate, soil depth or
isolation distances; or except as provided in Subsection T. The
preliminary site investigation described in Subsection H shall continue
on different areas of the site until a suitable infiltration location is found
or the entire site is determined to be infeasible for infiltration. For
proposed infiltration areas, the additional site investigation and testing
as outlined in Appendix E 90 shall be completed. The Borough may
determine infiltration to be infeasible if there are known existing
conditions or problems that may be worsened by the use of infiltration.
The following conditions are suitable for infiltration in noncarbonate
areas:
(1) Depth to bedrock below the invert of the BMP greater than or equal
to two feet.
(2) Depth to seasonal high-water table below the invert of the BMP
greater than or equal to three feet. (If the depth to bedrock is
between two and three feet and the evidence of the seasonal highwater
table is not found in the soil, no further testing to locate the
depth to seasonal high-water table is required.)
(3) Soil permeability greater than or equal to 0.5 inches/hour and less
than or equal to 12 inches per hour.
(4) Setback distances or buffers as follows:
(a) One hundred feet from water supply wells.
(b) Ten feet downgradient or 100 feet upgradient from building
foundations.
(c) Fifty feet from septic system drainfields.
(d) Fifty feet from a geologic contact with carbonate bedrock
unless a preliminary site investigation is done in the carbonate
bedrock to show the absence of special geologic features
within 50 feet of the proposed infiltration area.
(e) One hundred feet from the property line unless documentation
is provided to show that all setbacks from wells, foundations
and drainfields on neighboring properties will be met.
(5) If it is not feasible to infiltrate the full WQv, the applicant shall
infiltrate that portion of the WQv that is feasible based on the site
characteristics.
90.Editor's Note: Appendix E is included at the end of this chapter.
§ 378-14 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 378-14
1:289
J. In entirely carbonate areas, in addition to the testing required in
Subsection H, the preliminary site investigation shall include an
assessment of the remainder of the site for possible infiltration based
on required isolation distances from special geologic features and the
likely soil depth and permeability based on published data or other site
data available. Where infiltration BMPs are proposed, the applicant
shall conduct the additional site investigation and testing as outlined in
Appendix E.91 The soil depth, percolation rate and proposed loading
rate, each weighted as described in § 378-17, along with the buffer from
special geologic features shall be compared to the Recommendation
Chart for Infiltration Stormwater Management BMPs in Carbonate
Bedrock in Appendix B92 to determine if the site is recommended for
infiltration. If at any point in the preliminary site investigation the data
(e.g., location of Karst features on the site or the published soils data
for the site) indicates that the entire site will not be recommended for
infiltration based on the chapter standards, then no further
investigation is required. In addition to the recommendation from
Appendix B, the following conditions are required for infiltration in
carbonate areas:
(1) Depth to bedrock below the invert of the BMP greater than or equal
to two feet.
(2) Depth to seasonal high-water table below the invert of the BMP
greater than or equal to three feet. (If the depth to bedrock is
between two and three feet and the evidence of the seasonal highwater
table is not found in the soil, no further testing to locate the
depth to seasonal high-water table is required.)
(3) Soil permeability greater than or equal to 0.5 inches/hour and less
than or equal to 12 inches per hour.
(4) Setback distances or buffers as follows:
(a) One hundred feet from water supply wells.
(b) Ten feet downgradient or 100 feet upgradient from building
foundations.
(c) Fifty feet from septic system drainfields.
(d) One hundred feet from the property line, unless documentation
is provided to show that all setbacks from wells, foundations
and drainfields on neighboring properties will be met.
(5) Applicants are not required to use infiltration BMPs on a carbonate
site even if the site falls in the "Recommended" range on the chart
91.Editor's Note: Appendix E is included at the end of this chapter.
92.Editor's Note: Appendix B is included at the end of this chapter.
§ 378-14 HELLERTOWN CODE § 378-14
1:290
in Appendix B.93 If infiltration is not proposed, the WQv shall be
treated by two acceptable BMPs, as specified in Subsection O.
K. If a site has both carbonate and noncarbonate areas, the applicant shall
investigate the ability of the noncarbonate portion of the site to fully
meet this chapter to control runoff for the whole site through
infiltration. If that proves infeasible, the applicant shall perform the
preliminary site investigation for the carbonate area to determine the
appropriate design strategy. No infiltration structure in the
noncarbonate area shall be located within 50 feet of a boundary with
carbonate bedrock, except when a preliminary site investigation has
been done showing the absence of special geologic features within 50
feet of the proposed infiltration area.
L. If infiltration BMPs are proposed in carbonate areas, the postdevelopment
two-year runoff volume leaving the site shall be 80% or
more of the predevelopment runoff volume for the carbonate portion of
the site to prevent infiltration of volumes far in excess of the
predevelopment infiltration volume.
M. Site areas proposed for infiltration shall be protected from disturbance
and compaction except as necessary for construction of infiltration
BMPs.
N. If infiltration of the entire WQv is not proposed, the remainder of the
WQv shall be treated by two acceptable BMPs in series for each
discharge location. Sheet flow draining across a pervious area can be
considered as one BMP. Sheet flow across impervious areas and
concentrated flow shall flow through two BMPs. If sheet flow from an
impervious area is to be drained across a pervious area as one BMP, the
length of the pervious area must be equal to or greater than the length
of impervious area. In no case may the same BMP be employed
consecutively to meet this requirement. Acceptable BMPs are listed
below along with the recommended reference for design.

P. The use of infiltration BMPs is prohibited on hot spot land use areas.
Q. Stormwater infiltration BMPs shall not be placed in or on a special
geologic feature(s). Additionally, stormwater runoff shall not be
discharged into existing on-site sinkholes.
R. Applicants shall request, in writing, public water suppliers to provide
the Zone I wellhead protection radius, as calculated by the method
outlined in the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection
Wellhead Protection Regulations, for any public water supply well
within 400 feet of the site. In addition to the setback distances specified
in Subsections I and J, infiltration is prohibited in the Zone I radius as
defined and substantiated by the public water supplier in writing. If the
applicant does not receive a response from the public water supplier,
the Zone I radius is assumed to be 100 feet.
S. The volume and rate of the net increase in stormwater runoff from the
regulated activities must be managed to prevent the physical
degradation of receiving waters from such effects as scour and stream
bank destabilization, to satisfy state water quality requirements.
T. The Borough may, after consultation with DEP, approve alternative
methods for meeting the state water quality requirements other than
those in this section, provided that they meet the minimum
requirements of and do not conflict with state law, including but not
limited to the Clean Streams Law.94
A. To implement the provisions of the Saucon Creek Watershed
Stormwater Management Plan, the Borough is hereby determined to be
a "conditional no-detention district."
B. Conditional no-detention districts. Within these districts, the capacity of
the "local" runoff conveyance facilities (as defined in Article II) must be
calculated to determine if adequate capacity exists. For this
determination, the developer must calculate peak flows assuming that
the site is developed as proposed and that the remainder of the local
watershed is in the existing condition. The developer must also
calculate peak flows assuming that the entire local watershed is
94.Editor's Note: See 35 P.S. § 691.1 et seq.
§ 378-14 HELLERTOWN CODE § 378-15
1:296
§ 378-16. Stormwater management district implementation
provisions.
developed per current zoning and that all new development would use
the runoff controls specified by this chapter. The larger of the two peak
flows calculated will be used in determining if adequate capacity exists.
If adequate capacity exists to safely transport runoff from the site to
the main channel (as defined in Article II), these watershed areas may
discharge post-development peak runoff without detention facilities.
If the capacity calculations show that the "local" runoff conveyance
facilities lack adequate capacity, the developer shall either use a onehundred-
percent release rate control or provide increased capacity of
downstream elements to convey increased peak flows consistent with
§ 378-16P. Any capacity improvements must be designed to convey
runoff from development of all areas tributary to the improvement
consistent with the capacity criteria specified in § 378-16D. By
definition, a storm drainage problem area associated with the "local"
runoff conveyance facilities indicates that adequate capacity does not
exist.
A. Applicants shall provide a comparative preconstruction and postconstruction
stormwater management hydrograph analysis for each
direction of discharge and for the site overall to demonstrate
compliance with the provisions of this chapter.
B. Any downstream capacity analysis conducted in accordance with this
chapter shall use the following criteria for determining adequacy for
accepting increased peak flow rates:
(1) Natural or man-made channels or swales must be able to convey
the increased runoff associated with a two-year return period event
within their banks at velocities consistent with protection of the
channels from erosion.
(2) Natural or man-made channels or swales must be able to convey
the increased twenty-five-year return period runoff without
creating any hazard to persons or property.
(3) Culverts, bridges, storm sewers or any other facilities which must
pass or convey flows from the tributary area must be designed in
accordance with DEP Chapter 105 regulations (if applicable) and,
at minimum, pass the increased twenty-five-year return period
runoff.
C. For a proposed development site located within one release rate
category subarea, the total runoff from the site shall meet the
applicable release rate criteria. For development sites with multiple
directions of runoff discharge, individual drainage directions may be
designed for up to a one-hundred-percent release rate so long as the
total runoff from the site is controlled to the applicable release rate.
§ 378-15 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 378-16
1:297
D. For a proposed development site located within two or more release
category subareas, the peak discharge rate from any subarea shall be
the predevelopment peak discharge for that subarea multiplied by the
applicable release rate. The calculated peak discharges shall apply
regardless of whether the grading plan changes the drainage area by
subarea. An exception to the above may be granted if discharges from
multiple subareas recombine in proximity to the site. In this case, peak
discharge in any direction may be a one-hundred-percent release rate,
provided that the overall site discharge meets the weighted average
release rate.
E. For a proposed development site located partially within a release rate
category subarea and partially within a conditional no-detention
subarea, a significant portion of the site area subject to the release rate
control may not be drained to the discharge point(s) located in the nodetention
subarea except as part of a no-harm or hardship waiver
procedure.
F. No portion of a site may be regraded between the Saucon Creek
Watershed and any adjacent watershed except as part of a no-harm or
hardship waiver procedure.
G. Within a release rate category area, for a proposed development site
which has areas which drain to a closed depression(s), the design
release from the site will be the lesser of: (a) the applicable release rate
flow assuming no closed depression(s) or (b) the existing peak flow
actually leaving the site. In cases where (b) would result in an
unreasonably small design release, the design discharge of less than or
equal to the release rate will be determined by the available
downstream conveyance capacity to the main channel calculated using
Subsection D and the minimum orifice criteria.
H. Off-site areas which drain through a proposed development site are not
subject to release rate criteria when determining allowable peak runoff
rates. However, on-site drainage facilities shall be designed to safely
convey off-site flows through the development site using the capacity
criteria in Subsection D and the detention criteria in § 378-17.
I. For development sites proposed to take place in phases, all detention
ponds shall be designed to meet the applicable release rate(s) applied
to all site areas tributary to the proposed pond discharge direction. All
site tributary areas will be assumed as developed, regardless of
whether all site tributary acres are proposed for development at that
time. An exception shall be sites with multiple detention ponds in series
where only the downstream pond must be designed to the stated
release rate.
J. Where the site area to be impacted by a proposed development activity
differs significantly from the total site area, only the proposed impact
area shall be subject to the release rate criteria. The impact area
includes any proposed cover or grading changes.
§ 378-16 HELLERTOWN CODE § 378-16
1:298
K. Development proposals which, through groundwater recharge or other
means, do not increase either the rate or volume of runoff discharged
from the site compared to predevelopment are not subject to the
release rate provisions of this chapter.
L. No-harm water quantity option. For any proposed development site not
located in a conditional no-detention district, the developer has the
option of using a less restrictive runoff control (including no detention)
if the developer can prove that special circumstances exist for the
proposed development site and that no harm would be caused by
discharging at a higher runoff rate than that specified by the plan.
Special circumstances are defined as any hydrologic or hydraulic
aspects of the development itself not specifically considered in the
development of the plan runoff control strategy. Proof of no harm would
have to be shown from the development site through the remainder of
the downstream drainage network to the confluence of the creek with
the Lehigh River. Proof of no harm must be shown using the capacity
criteria specified in Subsection D if downstream capacity analysis is a
part of the no-harm justification.
(1) Attempts to prove no harm based upon downstream peak flow
versus capacity analysis shall be governed by the following
provisions:
(a) The peak flow values to be used for downstream areas for the
design return period storms (two-, ten-, twenty-five-, and onehundred-
year) shall be the values from the calibrated
Watershed Model for the Little Lehigh Creek or as calculated
by an applicant using an alternate method acceptable to the
Borough. The flow values from the watershed model would be
supplied to the developer by the Borough upon request.
(b) Any available capacity in the downstream conveyance system
as documented by a developer may be used by the developer
only in proportion to his development site acreage relative to
the total upstream undeveloped acreage from the identified
capacity (i.e., if his site is 10% of the upstream undeveloped
acreage, he may use up to 10% of the documented downstream
available capacity).
(c) Developer-proposed runoff controls which would generate
increased peak flow rates at storm drainage problem areas
would, by definition, be precluded from successful attempts to
prove no harm, except in conjunction with proposed capacity
improvements for the problem areas consistent with
Subsection O.
(2) Any no-harm justifications shall be submitted by the developer as
part of the drainage plan submission per Article IV.
M. Regional detention alternatives. For certain areas within the Borough,
it may be more cost-effective to provide one control facility for more
§ 378-16 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 378-16
1:299
§ 378-17. Calculation methodology.
than one development site than to provide an individual control facility
for each development site. The initiative and funding for any regional
runoff control alternatives are the responsibility of prospective
developers. The design of any regional control basins must incorporate
reasonable development of the entire upstream watershed. The peak
outflow of a regional basin would be determined based on the required
release rate at the point of discharge.
N. Capacity improvements.
(1) In certain instances, primarily within the conditional no-detention
areas, local drainage conditions may dictate more stringent levels
of runoff control than those based upon protection of the entire
watershed. In these instances, if the developer could prove that it
would be feasible to provide capacity improvements to relieve the
capacity deficiency in the local drainage network, then the capacity
improvements could be provided by the developer in lieu of runoff
controls on the development site. Peak flow calculations shall be
done assuming that the local watershed is in the existing condition
and then assuming that the local watershed is developed per
current zoning and using the specified runoff controls. Any capacity
improvements would be designed using the larger of the above
peak flows and the capacity criteria specified in Subsection D. All
new development in the entire subarea(s) within which the
proposed development site is located shall be assumed to
implement the developer's proposed discharge control, if any.
(2) Capacity improvements may also be provided as necessary to
implement any regional detention alternatives or to implement a
modified no-harm option which proposes specific capacity
improvements to provide that a less stringent discharge control
would not create any harm downstream.
A. Stormwater runoff from all development sites shall be calculated using
either the Rational Method or the Soil-Cover-Complex Methodology.
B. Infiltration BMP loading rate percentages in the Recommendation
Chart for Infiltration Stormwater Management BMPs in Carbonate
Bedrock in Appendix B95 shall be calculated as follows:
(Area tributary to infiltration BMP/base area of infiltration BMP)
*100%
The area tributary to the infiltration BMP shall be weighted as
follows:
All disturbed areas to be made
impervious:
Weight at 100%
95.Editor's Note: Appendix B is included at the end of this chapter.
§ 378-16 HELLERTOWN CODE § 378-17
1:300
All disturbed areas to be made
pervious:
Weight at 50%
All undisturbed pervious areas: Weight at 0%
All existing impervious areas: Weight at 100%
C. Soil thickness is to be measured from the bottom of any proposed
infiltration system. The effective soil thickness in the Recommendation
Chart for Infiltration Stormwater Management BMPs in Carbonate
Bedrock in Appendix D is the measured soil thickness multiplied by the
thickness factor based on soil permeability, as follows:
Permeability Range*
(inches/hour) Thickness Factor
6.0 to 12.0 0.8
2.0 to 6.0 1.0
1.0 to 2.0 1.4
0.75 to 1.0 1.2
0.5 to 0.75 1.0
NOTES:
* If the permeability rate falls on a break between two thickness
factors, the smaller thickness factor shall be used.
Sites with soil permeability greater than 12.0 inches/hour or less
than 0.5 inch/hour are not recommended for infiltration.
D. The design of any detention basin intended to meet the requirements of
this chapter shall be verified by routing the design storm hydrograph
through the proposed basin using the Storage Indication Method or
other methodology demonstrated to be more appropriate. For basins
designed using the Rational Method technique, the design hydrograph
for routing shall be either the Universal Rational Hydrograph or the
modified rational method trapezoidal hydrograph which maximizes
detention volume. Use of the modified rational hydrograph shall be
consistent with the procedure described in Section "PIPE.RAT" of the
Users' Manual for the Penn State Urban Hydrograph Method (1987).
E. BMPs designed to store or infiltrate runoff and discharge to surface
runoff or pipe flow shall be routed using the Storage Indication Method.
F. BMPs designed to store or infiltrate runoff and discharge to surface
runoff or pipe flow shall provide storage volume for the full WQv below
the lowest outlet invert.
G. Wet detention ponds designed to have a permanent pool for the WQv
shall assume that the permanent pool volume below the primary outlet
is full at the beginning of design event routing for the purposes of
evaluating peak outflows.
§ 378-17 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 378-17
1:301
H. All stormwater detention facilities shall provide a minimum one foot
freeboard above the maximum pool elevation associated with the twoyear
through twenty-five-year runoff events. A 0.5 foot freeboard shall
be provided above the maximum pool elevation of the one-hundred-year
runoff event. The freeboard shall be measured from the maximum pool
elevation to the invert of the emergency spillway. The two-year through
one-hundred-year storm events shall be controlled by the primary
outlet structure. An emergency spillway for each basin shall be
designed to pass the one-hundred-year return frequency storm peak
basin inflow rate with a minimum 0.5 foot freeboard measured to the
top of basin. The freeboard criteria shall be met considering any off-site
areas tributary to the basin as developed, as applicable. If this
detention facility is considered to be a dam as per DEP Chapter 105, the
design of the facility must be consistent with the Chapter 105
regulations, and may be required to pass a storm greater than the onehundred-
year event.
I. The minimum circular orifice diameter for controlling discharge rates
from detention facilities shall be three inches. Designs where a lessersize
orifice would be required to fully meet release rates shall be
acceptable, provided that as much of the site runoff as practical is
directed to the detention facilities.
J. Runoff calculations using the Soil-Cover-Complex Method shall use the
Natural Resources Conservation Service Type II twenty-four-hour
rainfall distribution. The twenty-four-hour rainfall depths for the
various return periods to be used consistent with this chapter may be
taken from NOAA Atlas 14, Volume 2 or the PennDOT Intensity 
Duration  Frequency Field Manual ("PDT-IDF") (May 1986) for Region
4.
(1) The following values are taken from the PDT-IDF Field Manual:
Return Period
24-Hour Rainfall Depth
(inches)
1-year 2.40
2-year 3.00
5-year 3.60
10-year 4.56
25-year 5.52
50-year 6.48

§ 378-17 HELLERTOWN CODE § 378-17
1:302
K. Runoff calculations using the Rational Method shall use rainfall
intensities consistent with appropriate times of concentration and
return periods and the intensity-duration-frequency curves as
presented in Appendix A.97
L. Runoff Curve Numbers (CNs) to be used in the Soil-Cover-Complex
Method shall be based upon the matrix presented in Appendix A.
M. Runoff coefficients for use in the Rational Method shall be based upon
the table presented in Appendix A.98
N. All time of concentration calculations shall use a segmental approach
which may include one or all of the flow types below:
(1) Sheet flow (overland flow) calculations shall use either the NRCS
average velocity chart (Figure 3-1, Technical Release-55, 1975) or
the modified kinematic wave travel time equation (Equation 3-3,
NRCS TR-55, June 1986). If using the modified kinematic wave
travel time equation, the sheet flow length shall be limited to 50
feet for designs using the Rational Method and limited to 150 feet
for designs using the Soil-Cover-Complex Method.
(2) Shallow concentrated flow travel times shall be determined from
the watercourse slope, type of surface and the velocity from Figure
3-1 of TR-55, June 1986.
(3) Open channel flow travel times shall be determined from velocities
calculated by the Manning Equation. Bankfull flows shall be used
for determining velocities. Manning "n" values shall be based on
the table presented in Appendix A.99
(4) Pipe flow travel times shall be determined from velocities
calculated using the Manning Equation assuming full flow and the
Manning "n" values from Appendix A.
O. If using the Rational Method, all predevelopment calculations for a
given discharge direction shall be based on a common time of
concentration considering both on-site and any off-site drainage areas.
If using the Rational Method, all post-development calculations for a
given discharge direction shall be based on a common time of
concentration considering both on-site and any off-site drainage areas.
P. The Manning Equation shall be used to calculate the capacity of
watercourses. Manning "n" values used in the calculations shall be
consistent with the table presented in Appendix A100 or other
appropriate standard engineering 'n' value resources. Pipe capacities
shall be determined by methods acceptable to the Borough.

1:308
(1) That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity of lot size or shape, or exceptional
topographical or other physical conditions peculiar to the
particular property, and that the unnecessary hardship is due to
such conditions and not the circumstances or conditions generally
created by the provisions of this chapter in the stormwater
management district in which the property is located;
(2) That, because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there
is no possibility that the property can be developed in strict
conformity with the provisions of this chapter, including the noharm
provisions, and that the authorization of a waiver is therefore
necessary to enable the reasonable use of the property;

§ 390-21 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 390-22
1:373
§ 390-23. Storm drainage systems.
"The property owner shall have the responsibility for the perpetual
maintenance of the permanent stormwater management facilities. No
changes shall be made to the stormwater management facilities or
finish grading without prior written approval from the Borough. A
blanket easement is hereby granted giving the Borough the right,
but not the obligation, to enter the property to perform any required
maintenance which has not been properly performed in a timely
manner. The property owner shall be responsible for the cost of any
maintenance which is performed by the Borough. The Borough shall
lien the property for said costs until the Borough has been reimbursed
in full."
A. Storm drainage systems shall be provided in order to:
(1) Permit unimpeded flow of normal watercourses except as modified
by stormwater detention facilities required by § 390-23C or open
channels pursuant to § 390-23B(8).
(2) Ensure adequate drainage of all low points along the line of streets.
(3) Intercept stormwater runoff along streets at intervals related to the
extent and grade of the area drained.
(4) Take surface water from the bottom of vertical grades, lead water
from springs and avoid excessive use of cross-gutters at street
intersections and elsewhere.
(5) Prevent overloading of drainage systems and watercourses
downstream as a result of increased rate of runoff caused by the
proposed development.
B. General requirements.
(1) A site drainage plan for the proposed subdivision tract shall be
prepared which illustrates the following information:
(a) Mapping of the watershed area or areas in which the proposed
subdivision is located.
(b) Calculations of runoff for all points of runoff concentration
within the site.
(c) Complete drainage systems for the subdivision. All existing
drainage features which are to be incorporated in the design
shall be so identified. If the subdivision is to be developed in
stages, a general drainage plan for the entire subdivision shall
be presented, on which the first stages for the drainage system
shall be indicated.
§ 390-22 HELLERTOWN CODE § 390-23
1:374
(2) The existing points of natural drainage discharge onto adjacent
property shall not be altered without the written approval of the
affected landowners.
(3) No stormwater runoff or natural drainage shall be so diverted as to
overload existing drainage systems or create flooding or the need
for additional drainage structures on other private properties or
public lands without approved provisions being made by the
developer for properly handling such conditions.
(4) Storm drainage systems through the subdivision/land development
shall be designed to convey the peak runoff that will occur when all
tributary areas upstream are developed to the extent reasonable
projected during the next 40 years. The calculation of this runoff
rate shall take into account the land use and development
regulations including runoff controls in effect in the tributary
areas.
(5) Where a subdivision is traversed by watercourses other than
permanent streams, there shall be provided a drainage easement
conforming substantially with the line of such watercourse. The
width of the easement shall be adequate to provide unimpeded flow
of stormwater runoff based on calculations made in conformance
with § 390-23D and to provide a freeboard allowance of 1/2 foot
above the design water surface level. The terms of the easement
shall prohibit excavation, the placing of fill or structures and any
alterations which may adversely affect the flow of stormwater
within any portion of the easement. Also, periodic cutting of
vegetation in all portions of the easement shall be required.
(6) Drainage facilities that are located on state highway rights-of-way
shall be approved by the Pennsylvania Department of
Transportation, and a letter indicating such approval shall be
directed to the Borough Planning Commission.
(7) All streets shall be designed so as to provide for the eventual
discharge of surface water away from their right-of-way.
(8) When it can be shown to the satisfaction of the Borough Engineer
that, due to topographic conditions, natural drainage swales on the
site cannot adequately provide for drainage, open channels may be
constructed conforming substantially to the line and grade of such
natural drainage swales. Capacities of open channels shall be
calculated using the Manning equation as explained in Appendix
B.143
(9) Storm drainage facilities and appurtenances shall be so designed
and provided as to minimize erosion in watercourse channels and
at all points of discharge.
143. Editor's Note: See Article VIII, Appendixes.
§ 390-23 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 390-23
1:375
C. Stormwater detention.
(1) Stormwater detention facilities shall be used whenever postdevelopment
runoff would exceed predevelopment runoff for the
design storms as determined by the Borough Engineer.
(2) Whenever detention facilities are required under § 390-23C(1),
facilities will be designed to provide that the peak runoff rate at all
points of discharge from the site, when developed, will not exceed
the peak runoff rate at each of those points prior to development
unless existing or planned detention facilities located elsewhere in
the same drainage basin will provide that the peak runoff rate from
the drainage basin after the site is developed will not exceed the
peak runoff rate prior to development.
(3) Where detention facilities are included as part of the storm
drainage system, the following provisions will apply:
(a) Detention points shall be designed so that they return to
normal conditions within approximately 12 hours after the
termination of the storm, unless the Borough Engineer finds
that downstream conditions may warrant other design criteria
for stormwater release.
(b) The developer shall demonstrate that such ponds are designed,
protected and located to assure that public safety is maximized
and health problems are prevented.
(c) The developer shall verify that the operation of the detention
facilities will not aggravate potential downstream peaking
conditions.
(d) Emergency overflow facilities shall be provided for detention
facilities to handle runoff in excess of design flows.
(e) If the lands of the proposed land development will remain in
common ownership, the developer shall provide written
assurances to the Borough that the detention ponds will be
properly maintained.
(f) If the lands of the proposed land development will be conveyed
to two or more separate owners, the developer shall provide
written assurances to the Borough that the detention ponds
will be properly maintained or dedicate the land on which the
detention ponds are located to the Borough, which shall then
be responsible for maintaining the detention ponds.
D. Calculations of runoff and design and storm frequency.
(1) Storm drainage systems required by this chapter shall be designed
to provide protection from a ten-year to one-hundred-year storm, as
determined by the Borough Planning Commission. A ten-year
design storm would be appropriate where a storm in excess of the
§ 390-23 HELLERTOWN CODE § 390-23
1:376
§ 390-24. Underground utilities and utility easements.
In accordance with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission
Investigation Docket No. 99, as amended from time to time, all electric
utility distribution lines shall be installed underground in subdivisions or
land developments of five or more dwelling units. In addition, the following
design requirements shall be observed:
design storm would have minor impact, such as inconvenience to
traffic on local streets. A twenty-five-year design storm would be
appropriate where a storm in excess of the design storm would
cause major inconvenience to people and traffic in high-use areas
such as business districts and major highways. A one-hundred-year
design storm would be appropriate where a storm in excess of the
design storm would cause damage to existing or future structures
or their contents.
(2) Stormwater runoff from watersheds of 200 or less acres shall be
calculated by the Rational Method as described in Manual Number
37 of the American Society of Civil Engineers. The Rational Method
of runoff calculation is explained in Appendix B.144
(3) Stormwater runoff from watersheds of more than 200 acres shall
be calculated using the Soil Cover Complex Method developed by
the Soil Conservation Service (now the Natural Resources
Conservation Service) or other appropriate method acceptable to
the Borough Engineer.
(4) The Manning equation explained in Appendix B shall be used in
calculating capacities of watercourses and storm sewers, except
culverts which shall be designed using methods acceptable to the
Borough Engineer.
(5) Complete detailed drainage calculations and applicable charts and
nomographs certified by the design engineer shall be submitted to
the Municipal Engineer.
(6) Hydrograph models, such as the Natural Resources Conservation
Services Soil Cover Complex Method, shall be used as the method
of computation for the design of stormwater detention facilities.
E. Improvement specifications. Inlets shall be designed and located to
prevent hazardous conditions for vehicles, bicycles or pedestrians.
A. Established public utility and state and federal governmental agency
design standards shall be observed in preparing the utility plan.
B. Utility line to be installed within street rights-of-way shall be located
according to Borough or Borough Authority requirements.

above grade) shall not be removed unless they are located within the
proposed cartway or sidewalk portion of a street right-of-way or within
15 feet of the foundation area of a new building. Areas in which trees
are retained shall remain at original grade level and undisturbed
wherever possible.
B. Where no existing trees are retained along street rights-of-way, trees
shall be planted at intervals of between 50 and 100 feet, but in no
instance shall there be less than one tree per lot. Trees shall not be
retained or planted within three feet of the street curb or the sidewalk.
Trees may be retained or planted between the street curb and the
sidewalk if there is a minimum distance of six feet.
C. A landscape plan shall be drawn for all developments and subdivisions.
The shall show existing and proposed vegetative cover; plant schedule
with botanical and common names, root condition, size and general
notes; planting details; and the following note: "Street trees, buffers
and other required landscaping shall be maintained by the property
owner and replaced if it dies or loses its effectiveness for the purpose to
which it was required."145
D. The landscape plan shall include trees in addition to those required
along the street rights-of-way. The following standards are to be used as
a guide to the number, not the spacing or location, of additional trees

major intersections in the study area. Volume/capacity
calculations shall be completed for all major
intersections. The level-of-service data must be
presented in a matrix format.
[b] All access points and pedestrian crossings shall be
examined as to the feasibility of installing traffic
signals. This evaluation shall compare the projected
traffic and pedestrian volumes to the warrants for
traffic signal installation. Levels of service for all
streets and intersections shall be listed.

NOTE:
As recommended by the IESNA.
(e) Intensity. No light source or combination thereof which casts
light on a public street shall exceed a meter reading of one
footcandle as measured from the center line of said street, nor
shall any light source or combination thereof which casts light
on adjacent residential property or open space exceed 0.1
footcandle as measured at the property line or one footcandle
on an adjacent nonresidential property of similar use.
(f) Method of measuring light intensity. The footcandle level of a
light source shall be taken after dark with the light meter held
six inches above the ground with the meter facing the light
source. A reading shall be taken with the light source on, then
with the light source off. The difference between the two
readings will be identified as the illumination intensity.
(g) Height. The maximum height above the ground grade
permitted for light sources mounted on a pole is 20 feet. A light
source mounted on a building shall not exceed the height of the
face of the building to which it is attached, and no light sources
shall be located on the roof unless said light enhances the
architectural features of the building.
(h) Hours. Outdoor lighting which serves commercial or industrial
uses that do not operate after dark must be turned off 1/2 hour
after closing, except for approved security lighting. For those
commercial or industrial uses that offer services after dark,
outdoor lighting may be utilized during the nighttime hours,
provided the commercial or industrial use is open for service.
Once the commercial or industrial use closes, the outdoor
lighting must be turned off one hour after closing except for
security lighting.
(i) Security lighting. In all zones, exterior lighting of a building
and/or grounds for security surveillance purposes is permitted.
Such lighting shall be arranged and of sufficient illumination to
enable the detection of suspicious movement rather than the
recognition of definitive detail.
§ 390-29 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 390-29
1:395
(j) Illumination under outdoor canopies. Under-canopy lighting
shall be accomplished using flat-lens full-cutoff fixtures aimed
straight down and shielded in such a manner that the lowest
opaque edge of the fixture shall be below the light source at all
lateral angles. The illumination in the area directly below the
canopy shall not exceed 20 average footcandles and the
maximum shall not exceed 30 footcandles. Outdoor canopies
include, but are not limited to, the following applications:
[1] Fuel island canopies associated with service stations and
convenience stores.
[2] Exterior canopies above storefronts in shopping centers
and malls.
[3] Exterior canopies above driveways and building
entrances.
[4] Pavilions and gazebos.
(k) Billboards and signs. The lighting of new, or replacement of
lighting systems of existing, billboards and signs shall be
subject to the following requirements:
[1] Externally illuminated billboards and signs shall have
fixtures mounted at the top of the billboard or sign and
aimed downward. The fixtures shall be designed, fitted and
aimed to shield the source from off-site view and to place
the light output onto the billboard or sign and not to
project their output into the windows of neighboring
residences, adjacent uses, past the face of the billboard or
sign, skyward or onto a public roadway. At no point on the
face of the sign or billboard and at no time shall the
illumination exceed 30 vertical footcandles during
nighttime.
[2] The maximum illumination on the face of an externally
illuminated billboard or sign shall not exceed 30
footcandles and shall have a maximum-to-minimum
uniformity ratio not to exceed 4:1.
[3] Rotating, traveling, pulsing, flashing, animated,
"marching" or oscillating light sources, lasers, beacons or
strobe lighting shall not be permitted except within the
Highway Commercial (HC) and Shopping Center (SC)
Zones and not within 200 feet of a signalized traffic
intersection, a residential use or an R-1, R-2 Zone.
[4] Signs incorporating LCD, LED, plasma, CRT, pixilated
lights or other animated and/or video-like displays shall be
limited to the HC and SC Zones.
§ 390-29 HELLERTOWN CODE § 390-29
1:396
[5] The use of highly reflective signage that creates nuisance
glare or a safety hazard shall not be permitted.
[6] Applications for the lighting or relighting of signs and
billboards shall be accompanied by catalog cuts of
proposed fixtures and any glare-reduction devices, and a
description of lamps, mounting locations, aiming angles
and proposed hours of operation, and method for
automatically extinguishing the lighting.
(l) Outdoor recreation. The nighttime illumination of outdoor
recreational facilities for baseball, basketball, soccer, tennis,
track and field, football or similar sports necessitates higher
than normally allowed fixture mounting heights and aiming
angles, utilizes very high-wattage lamps. The following
requirements shall apply to the lighting of outdoor recreation
facilities:
[1] Lighting shall be accomplished only through the use of
fixtures conforming to IESNA cutoff criteria, or as
otherwise approved by the Borough based on suitable
control of glare and light trespass.
[2] No outdoor recreation facility, whether public or private,
shall be illuminated after 11:00 p.m.
[3] Maximum mounting heights for recreational lighting shall
be 90 feet, unless approved by the Borough Council.
(7) Prohibitions. No searchlights, flashing lights or lights that may
cause a hazard by impairing driver's vision shall be permitted.
(8) Submission of lighting plans. Where site lighting is required by this
subsection or required by the Borough or proposed by the applicant
(except in the case of lighting on an individual residential
property), lighting plans shall be submitted for review and
approval. The submission shall contain the following in addition to
other required data:
(a) Plans indicating the location on the premises, and the type of
illuminating devices, fixtures, lamps, supports, reflectors and
other devices.
(b) Description of illuminating devices, fixtures, lamps, supports,
reflectors and other devices, and the description may include,
but is not limited to, catalog cuts by manufacturers and
drawings (including sections, where required; the angle of the
cutoff or light emissions, etc.).
(c) A point-by-point illuminance-grid plot on ten-feet-by-ten-feet
centers (or as necessary for suitable legibility) of footcandles
overlaid on the site plan, plotted out to 0.0 maintained
§ 390-29 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 390-29
1:397
footcandles, which demonstrates compliance with the light
trespass, illuminance and uniformity requirements.
(d) When landscaping plans are involved, they shall contain the
lighting fixture locations and shall demonstrate that the site
lighting and landscaping have been coordinated to minimize
conflict between vegetation and intended light distribution,
both initially and at vegetation maturity.
(e) When requested by the Borough, the applicant shall also
submit a visual impact plan that demonstrates appropriate
steps have been taken to mitigate the potential consequences
of on-site and off-site glare. This plan may require the inclusion
of footcandle values at specific off-site locations (e.g., bedroom
windows of adjacent residential uses, street center lines, etc.).
(f) Required plan notes. The following notes shall appear on the
lighting plan:
[1] "Post-approval alterations to lighting plans or intended
substitutions for approved lighting equipment shall be
submitted to the Borough for review and approval."
[2] "The Borough reserves the right to conduct postinstallation
nighttime inspections to verify compliance
with the requirements of this subsection and as otherwise
agreed upon by the Borough and, if appropriate, to require
remedial action at no expense to the Borough."
(9) Exemptions. The standards of this subsection shall not apply to the
following:

§ 390-25 shall be planted.
§ 390-29 HELLERTOWN CODE § 390-30
1:398
§ 390-30. Improvement guarantee procedure.
A. Before the Borough Council approves any final plan and as a
prerequisite for approval, the developer shall deliver to the Borough
Council a performance guarantee in the amount of 110% of the cost of
completion of all improvements required by this chapter, estimated as
of 90 days following the date scheduled for completion by the
developer. Annually, the Borough may adjust the amount of the
performance guarantee by comparing the actual cost of the
improvements which have been completed and the estimated cost for
completion of the remaining improvements as of the expiration of the
90th day after either the original date scheduled for completion or a
rescheduled date of completion. Subsequent to said adjustment, the
Borough may require the developer to post additional security in order
to assure that the financial security equals 110%. Any additional
security shall be posted by the developer in accordance with this
subsection.
B. The amount of financial security required shall be based upon an
estimate of the cost of completion of the required improvements,
submitted by the developer and prepared by a professional engineer
licensed as such in the commonwealth and certified by such engineer to
be a fair and reasonable estimate of such cost. The Borough, upon
recommendation of the Borough Engineer, may refuse to accept such
estimate for good cause shown. If the developer and the Borough are
unable to agree upon the estimate, then the estimate shall be
recalculated and recertified by another professional engineer licensed
as such in this commonwealth and chosen mutually by the Borough and
the developer. The estimate certified by the third engineer shall be
presumed fair and reasonable and shall be the final estimate. In the
event that a third engineer is so chosen, fees for the services of said
engineer shall be paid equally by the Borough and the developer.
C. If the developer requires more than one year from the date of posting of
the performance guarantee to complete the required improvements,
the amount of the performance guarantee may be increased by an
additional 10% for each one-year period beyond the first anniversary
date from posting of the performance guarantee or to an amount not to
exceed 110% of the cost of completing the required improvements as
reestablished on or about the expiration of the preceding one-year
period by using the above bidding procedure.
D. The stated period for completion of the improvements shall not be
longer than two years from the date of final subdivision approval. Upon
written application signed by both the obligor and the surety of a
performance guarantee in a form approved by the Borough Solicitor,
the Borough Council may, at its discretion, extend such period by not
more than two years by formal resolution. In the event of default under
the performance guarantee, the proceeds of the performance
guarantee received by the Borough shall be used to construct and
install the improvements. [Amended 9-17-1990 by Ord. No. 566]
§ 390-30 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 390-30
1:399
§ 390-31. Approval of improvements and release of performance
guarantee by the Borough Council.
E. Before the Borough Council approves any final plan and as a
prerequisite for approval, the developer shall deliver to the Borough
Council a maintenance guarantee in an amount of not less than 15% of
the Borough Engineer's estimate of the cost of all improvements
required by this chapter, guaranteeing that the developer shall
maintain all such improvements in good condition for a period of one
year after completion of construction and installation of all such
improvements and approval of all such improvements by the Borough
Council.152
A. As the work of installing the required improvements proceeds, the
developer may request the Borough Council to release or authorize the
release, from time to time, of such portions of the performance
guarantee necessary for payment to the contractor(s) performing the
work. Any such request shall be in writing addressed to the Borough
Council, and the Borough Council shall have 45 days from receipt of
such request within which to allow the Borough Engineer to certify, in
writing, to the Borough Council that such portion of the work upon the
improvements has been completed in accordance with the final
subdivision approval. Upon such certification, the Borough Council
shall authorize release by the bonding company or lending institution of
an amount as estimated by the Borough Engineer fairly representing
the value of the improvements completed. The Borough Council may,
prior to final release at the time of completion and certification by its
Engineer, require retention of 10% of the estimated cost of the
aforesaid improvements. [Amended 9-17-1990 by Ord. No. 566]
B. Nothing herein, however, shall be construed as limitation of the
developer's right to contest or question, by legal proceedings or
otherwise, any determination of the Borough Council or the Borough
Engineer.
C. General improvement construction standards.153
(1) All improvements shall be provided, constructed and installed by
the developer as stated in the improvements agreement, as shown
on the approved plans, and in accordance with the standards of this
or other Borough ordinances.
(2) Prior to construction, the contractor shall secure all necessary
permits from the Borough and outside agencies, if required by law.
(3) All material and equipment shall be new when installed and in good

equipment shall be purchased for the subdivision or land
development and not leased.
(4) Compliance with all state and federal and/or local regulations and
rules regarding the safety of all the people on the construction site
is the developer's responsibility.
(5) The Borough and/or its agents, employees or consultants have no
control over the actual construction of improvements and cannot
stop improvement construction even if it is proceeding improperly.
The construction methods, procedures and safety precautions are
the developer's or contractor's responsibility.
(6) Shop drawings shall be submitted to the Borough Engineer for
approval, when requested, in order to ascertain that the materials
that the developer proposes to use comply with applicable
requirements.
(7) Survey cut sheets shall be submitted to the Borough Engineer at
least three working days prior to the start of any construction for
which control of line and grade is required. Work shall not
commence until the cut sheets are approved by the Borough
Engineer.
(8) Not more than 100 feet of trench shall be excavated in advance of
pipe or utility installation and backfilling. All trenches shall be
closed at the end of each working day, or appropriate safety
precautions shall be taken to guard against accidents or collapse of
trench walls.
(9) Any erosion or sinkholes which exist within any public street or
right-of-way shall be repaired to the satisfaction of the Borough.
Eroded areas and/or sinkholes may not be filled with construction
waste materials or any other type of debris.
(10) All construction activities shall be limited to the project site. Any
debris, erosion, material or activity which extends beyond this limit
must be removed, cleaned and/or repaired within 24 hours and to
the satisfaction of the Borough.
(11)Working hours. Usual working hours of 7:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. shall
be observed. Work beyond these times will require Borough
approval.
(12) Traffic control. Any temporary traffic controls required to make
improvements on, within or adjacent to a Borough street shall
require seven-day prior notice and review and approval by the
Borough. Any temporary traffic controls required to make
improvements on, within or adjacent to a state highway shall
require PennDOT review and approval and notification to the
Borough.
§ 390-31 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 390-31
1:401
D. In the event that any improvements which may be required have not
been provided per this chapter or in accord with the approved final
plan, the Borough Council is hereby granted the power to enforce any
corporate bond or other security by appropriate legal and equitable
remedies. If proceeds of such bonds or other security are insufficient to
pay the cost of installing or making repairs or corrections to all the
improvements covered by said security, the Borough Council may, at its
option, install part of such improvements in all or part of the subdivision
or land development and may institute appropriate legal or equitable
action to recover the monies necessary to complete the remainder of
the improvements. All of the proceeds, whether resulting from the
security or from any legal equitable action brought against the
developer, or both, shall be used solely for the installation of the
improvements covered by such security and not for any other Borough
purpose.

Appendixes
§ 390-40. Appendix A  Application Forms. (Reserved)
§ 390-41. Appendix B  Storm Drainage Runoff Calculation.
A. Rational formula. The rational formula used in calculating runoff is Q =
CIA. In this equation, Q is the peak runoff in cubic feet per second, C is
the runoff coefficient which depends on the nature of the land cover, I is
the intensity of rainfall in inches per hour for a duration equal to the
time of concentration for the drainage area involved, and A is the
watershed area in acres. The time of concentration is the time required
for runoff from the upper reaches of the watershed to reach the point
for which runoff rates are being calculated.
B. Values of coefficient (C). Runoff coefficients used in the rational formula
shall be based on the guidelines in the following table and acceptable to
the Borough Engineer:

A. The Borough of Hellertown adopts the provisions of Article XI-D, Local
Real Estate Transfer Tax, 72 P.S. § 8101-D et seq., (Tax Reform Code of
1971) and imposes a realty transfer tax authorized under that article,
subject to the rate limitations therein. The tax imposed under this
section shall be at a rate set forth in Subsection C.
B. The tax imposed under Subsection A and all applicable interest and
penalties shall be administered, collected and enforced under the Act of
December 31, 1965 (P.L. 1257, No. 511), as amended, known as "The
Local Tax Enabling Act, 53 P.S. § 6901 et seq., provided that, if the
correct amount is not paid by the last date prescribed in 72 P.S.
§ 8102-C for timely payment, the Borough of Hellertown, pursuant to 72
P.S. § 8102-D of the Local Real Estate Transfer Tax (Tax Reform Code of
1971), authorizes and directs the Department of Revenue of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to determine, collect and enforce the
tax, interest and penalties. Whenever a declaration is required to be
filed under 72 P.S. § 8101-C et seq., a declaration is also required to be
filed under this article.
C. Every person who makes, executes, delivers, accepts or presents for
recording any document or in whose behalf any document is made,
executed, delivered, accepted or presented for recording shall be
subject to pay for, in respect to the transaction or any part thereof, a tax
at the rate of 1% of the value of the real estate represented by such
document, which tax shall be payable at the earlier of the time the
document is presented for recording or within 30 days of acceptance of
such document or within 30 days of becoming an acquired company.
D. The payment of the tax imposed herein shall be evidenced by the
affixing of an official stamp or writing by the Recorder of Deeds,
§ 405-12 HELLERTOWN CODE § 405-13
1:428
§ 405-14. Exempt parties.
The United States, the commonwealth, or any of their instrumentalities,
agencies or political subdivisions shall be exempt from payment of the tax
imposed by this article. The exemption of such governmental bodies shall
whereon the date of the payment of the tax, amount of the tax and the
signature of the collecting agent shall be set forth.
E. It is the intent of this article that the entire burden of the tax imposed
herein on a person or transfer shall not exceed the limitations
prescribed in the Local Tax Enabling Act, Act of December 31, 1965,
P.L. 1257, 53 P.S. § 6901 et seq. and 53 P.S. §§ 6924.101 to 6924.312, so
that if any other political subdivision shall impose or hereafter shall
impose such tax on the same person or transfer then the tax levied by
the Borough of Hellertown under the authority of that Act shall during
the time such duplication of the tax exists, except as hereinafter
otherwise provided, be 1/2 of the rate and such 1/2 rate shall become
effective without any action on the part of the Borough of Hellertown;
provided, however, that the Borough of Hellertown and any other
political subdivision which impose such tax on the same person or
transfer may agree that, instead of limiting their respective rates to 1/2
of the rate herein provided, they will impose respectively different
rates, the total of which shall not exceed the maximum rate permitted
under "The Local Tax Enabling Act."
F. If for any reason the tax is not paid when due, interest at the rate in
effect at the time the tax is due, shall be added and collected. Any tax
imposed under this section that is not paid by the date the tax is due
shall bear interest as prescribed for interest on delinquent municipal
claims under the Act of May 16, 1923 (P.L. 207, No. 153) (53 P.S. § 7101
et seq.), as amended, known as "The Municipal Claims and Tax Liens
Act." The interest rate shall be the lesser of the interest rate imposed
upon delinquent commonwealth taxes as provided in Section 806 of the
Act of April 9, 1929 (P.L. 343, No. 176) (72 P.S. § 806), as amended,
known as "The Fiscal Code," or the maximum interest rate permitted
under the Municipal Claims and Tax Liens Act for tax claims.
G. Disbursements. The tax, interest and penalty that the Department of
Revenue collects under this article shall be remitted in the manner
provided by law to the appropriate recorder of deeds along with the
state tax payment imprint receipt which shall provide sufficient
information for the Recorder of Deeds to determine which political
subdivision are entitled to the collection. The recorder of deeds shall
record the state tax payment imprint receipt whether or not signed and
acknowledged by the Department of Revenue and shall index in the
grantor/grantee index to the original document upon which the tax has
been paid. The Department shall collect from the taxpayer, as part of its
determination process, the county recording fee for the state tax
payment imprint receipt.

A. A transfer to the commonwealth, or to any of its instrumentalities,
agencies or political subdivisions, by gift, dedication or deed in lieu of
condemnation or deed of confirmation in connection with condemnation
proceedings, or a reconveyance by the condemning body of the
property condemned to the owner of record at the time of
condemnation which reconveyance may include property fine
adjustments, provided said reconveyance is made within one year from
the date of condemnation.
B. A document which the Borough of Hellertown is prohibited from taxing
under the Constitution or statutes of the United States.
C. A conveyance to a municipality, township, school district or county
pursuant to acquisition by the municipality, township, school district or

confirms a transfer previously recorded but which does not extend or
limit existing record legal title or interest.
E. A transfer of division in kind for no or nominal actual consideration of
property passed by testate or intestate succession and held by
cotenants; however, if any of the parties take shares greater in value

previously husband and wife who have since been divorced, provided
the property or interest therein subject to such transfer was acquired
by the husband and wife or husband or wife prior to the granting of the
final decree in divorce; between parent and child or the spouse of such
child; between brother or sister or spouse of a brother or sister; and
between a grandparent and grandchild or the spouse of such
grandchild, except that a subsequent transfer by the grantee within one
year shall be subject to tax as if the grantor were making such transfer.

testate or intestate succession from a personal representative of a
decedent to the decedent's devisee or heir.

specifically named. No such exemption shall be granted unless the
§ 405-14 HELLERTOWN CODE § 405-15
1:430
Recorder of Deeds is presented with a copy of the trust instrument that
clearly identifies the grantor and all possible beneficiaries.
I. A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration to a trustee of a living
trust from the settler of the living trust. No such exemption shall be
granted unless the Recorder of Deeds is presented with a copy of the
living trust instrument.
J. A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration from a trustee of an
ordinary trust to a specifically named beneficiary that is entitled to

the trust to that beneficiary. However, any transfer of real estate from a
living trust during the settler's lifetime shall be considered for the
purposes of this article as if such transfer were made directly from the
settler to the grantee.

this article. Where the document by which title is acquired by a grantee
or statement of value fails to set forth that the property was acquired by
the grantee from, or for the benefit of, his principal, there is a
rebuttable presumption that the property is the property of the grantee
in his individual capacity if the grantee claims an exemption from
taxation under this clause.
O. A transfer made pursuant to the statutory merger or consolidation of a
corporation or statutory division of a nonprofit corporation, except
where the Department reasonably determines that the primary intent

association has been held by the grantee for more than two years.

purpose. For leases of coal, oil, natural gas or minerals, the statement
of value may be limited to an explanation of the reason each document

A. A person subject to the local services tax shall be assessed a pro rata
share of the tax for each payroll period in which the person is engaging
in an occupation. The pro rata share of the tax assessed on the person
for a payroll period shall be determined by dividing the combined rate
of the local services tax levied for the calendar year by the number of
payroll periods established by the employer for the calendar year. For
purposes of determining the pro rata share, an employer shall round
down the amount of the tax collected each payroll period to the nearest

1/100 of a dollar. Collection of the local services tax levied under this
section shall be made on a payroll-period basis for each payroll period
in which the person is engaging in an occupation, except as provided in
Subsection E.
B. If the Saucon Valley School District levied an emergency and municipal
services tax on the effective date of Act 7-2007, the school district may
continue to levy the local services tax in the same amount the Saucon
Valley School District collected on the effective date of Act 7-2007.
However, if the Borough of Hellertown in whole or in part within the
school district subsequently levies the local services tax, the school
district may only collect $5 on persons employed within the
municipality each calendar year. If the school district did not levy an
emergency and municipal services tax on the effective date of Act
7-2007, the school district shall be prohibited from levying the local
services tax within the Borough. If the Saucon Valley School District
and Borough of Hellertown both levy a local services tax at a combined
rate exceeding $10, the school district's pro rata share of the aggregate
local services taxes levied on persons employed within the Borough of
Hellertown shall be collected by the Borough or its tax officer based on
payroll periods as provided under Subsection A and shall be paid to the
school district on a quarterly basis within 60 days of receipt by the
municipality or its tax officer.
C. Except as provided in Subsection B, no person shall be subject to the
payment of the local services tax by more than one political subdivision
during each payroll period as established by § 405-40.
D. In the case of concurrent employment, an employer shall refrain from
withholding the local services tax if the employee provides a recent pay
statement from a principal employer that includes the name of the
employer, the length of the payroll period and the amount of the local
services tax withheld, and a statement from the employee that the pay
statement is from the employee's principal employer and the employee
will notify other employers of a change in the principal place of
employment within two weeks of its occurrence.
E. The local services tax shall be no more than $52 on each person for
each calendar year, irrespective of the number of political subdivisions
within which a person may be employed. The Borough shall provide a
taxpayer a receipt of payment upon request by the taxpayer.
F. The Borough shall adopt regulations for the processing of refund claims
for overpaid local services taxes for any calendar year. The regulations
shall be consistent with 53 Pa.C.S.A. §§ 8425 and 8426. Refunds made
within 75 days of a refund request or 75 days after the last day the
employer is required to remit the local services tax for the last quarter
of the calendar year under § 405-38 of this article, whichever is later,
shall not be subject to interest imposed under 53 Pa.C.S.A. § 8426. The
Borough shall only provide refunds for amounts overpaid in a calendar
year that exceed $1.

Borough's designee, as determined by the Borough. Each employer, in filing
this return and making payment of the tax withheld from his employees,
shall be entitled to retain a commission calculated at the rate of 2% of
the gross tax due and payable, provided that such tax is collected and
paid over by the employer on or before the dates hereinafter set forth.
It is further provided that, if the employer fails to file said return and
pay said tax, whether or not he makes collection thereof from the salary,
wages or commissions paid by him to said employee, the employer shall
be responsible for the payment of the tax, in full, without deducting a
commission and as though the tax had already been levied against him. The
Borough shall provide the taxpayer with a receipt to verify payment upon
request of the taxpayer.
§ 405-38. Dates for determining tax liability and payment.
G. For purposes of this section of the article, "combined rate" shall mean
the aggregate annual rate of the local services tax levied by a school
district and a municipality located in whole or in part within the school
district.
H. No employer shall be held liable for failure to withhold the local
services tax or for the payment of the withheld tax money to the
Borough if the failure to withhold taxes arises from incorrect
information submitted by the employee as to the employee's place or
places of employment, the employee's principal office or where the
employee is principally employed; and provided, further, that an
employee shall not be liable for payment of the local services tax in an
amount exceeding the amount withheld by the employer if the employer
complies with the provisions of §§ 405-42 and 405-36 of this article and
remits the amount so withheld in accordance with this section; and
provided, further, that employers shall be required to remit the local
services taxes 30 days after the end of each quarter of a calendar year.
A. Each employer shall use his employment records for the first day of
January to the 31st day of March 2008 for determining the number of
employees from whom said tax shall be deducted and paid over to the
Borough Manager and/or the Borough's designee on or before April 30,
2008.
B. Supplemental reports and payment of tax due thereon shall be made by
each employer on July 31, 2008; October 31, 2008 and January 31, 2009

1:444
§ 405-39. Self-employed individuals.
Each self-employed individual who performs services of any type of kind,
engaged in any occupation or profession within the Borough of Hellertown,
shall be required to comply with this article and pay the tax to the Borough
Manager or the Borough's designee on or before April 30, 2008, or as soon
thereafter as he engages in an occupation.
§ 405-40. Individuals engaged in more than one occupation.
§ 405-41. Employers and self-employed individuals residing beyond
the corporate limits of Borough.
All employers and self-employed individuals residing or having their place
of business outside of the Borough of Hellertown but who perform services
of any type or kind, or engage in any occupation or profession within
the Borough of Hellertown, do, by virtue thereof, agree to be bound by
and subject themselves to the provisions, penalties and regulations as
though they were residents of the Borough of Hellertown. Further, any
and January 31, 2009, respectfully. Thereafter the tax shall continue to
be enforced on a calendar-year basis.
A. Each individual who shall have more than one occupation within the
Borough of Hellertown shall be subject to the payment of this tax on his
principal occupation, and his principal employer shall deduct this tax
and deliver to him evidence of deductions on a form to be furnished to
the employer by the Borough Manager or the Borough's designee,
which form shall be evidence of deduction having been made and, when
presented to any other employer, shall be authority of such employer to
not deduct this tax from the employee's wages but to include such
employee on his return by setting forth his name, address and the name
or account number of the employer who deducted this tax.
B. In the event a person is engaged in more than one occupation, or an
occupation which requires his working in more than one political
subdivision during the calendar year, the priority of claim to collect
such local services tax shall be in the following order: First, the political
subdivision in which a person maintains his principal office or is
principally employed; second, the political subdivision in which the
person resides and works, if such a tax is levied by that political
subdivision; third, the political subdivision in which a person is
employed and which imposes the tax nearest in miles to the person's
home. The place of employment shall be determined as of the day the
taxpayer first becomes subject to the tax during the calendar year. It is
the intent of this provision that no person shall pay more than $52 in
any calendar year. In case of dispute, a tax receipt of the taxing
authority for that calendar year, declaring that the taxpayer has made
prior payment, shall constitute prima facie certification of payment to
all other political subdivisions.

or employee for the collection of this tax as hereinafter provided.
§ 405-42. Exemptions.
A. The Borough of Hellertown levying the local services tax shall exempt
the following person from the local services tax:
(1) Any person who served in any war or armed conflict in which the
United States was engaged and is honorably discharged or
released under honorable circumstances from active service if, as a
result of military service, the person is blind, paraplegic or a double
or quadruple amputee or has a service-connected disability
declared by the United States Veterans Administration or its
successor to be a total one-hundred-percent permanent disability.
(2) Any person who serves as a member of a reserve component of the
armed forces and is called to active duty at any time during the
taxable year.
(3) For purposes of this subsection, "reserve component of the armed
forces" shall mean the United States Army Reserve, United States
Navy Reserve, United States Marine Corps Reserve, United States
Coast Guard Reserve, United States Air Force Reserve, the
Pennsylvania Army National Guard or the Pennsylvania Air
National Guard.
(4) Any individual who derives earned income and net profits from all
sources within the Borough of Hellertown of less than $12,000 per
year from his occupation shall be exempt for the calendar year in
which the local services tax is levied.
B. A person seeking to claim an exemption from the local services tax may
annually file an exemption certificate with the Borough of Hellertown
and with the person's employer affirming that the person reasonably
expects to receive earned income and net profits from all sources within
the Borough of less than $12,000 in the calendar year for which the
exemption certificate is filed. In the event the Borough utilizes a tax
collection officer, the Borough shall provide a copy of the exemption
certificate to that officer. The exemption certificate shall have attached
to it by the employee a copy of all of the employee's last pay stubs or
W-2 forms from employment within the Borough for the year prior to
the fiscal year for which the employee is requesting to be exempted
from the local services tax. Upon receipt of the exemption certificate
and until otherwise instructed by the Borough levying the tax or except
as required Subsection C, the employer shall not withhold the tax from
the person during the calendar year or the remainder of the calendar
year for which the exemption certificate applies. Employers shall
§ 405-41 HELLERTOWN CODE § 405-42
1:446
§ 405-43. Administration of tax.
ensure that the exemption certificate forms are readily available to
employees at all times and shall furnish each new employee with a
form at the time of hiring. The Department of Community and Economic
Development shall develop and make available to the Borough and
employers uniform exemption certificates required by this subsection
pursuant to Act 7-2007.166
C. With respect to a person who claimed an exemption for a given calendar
year from the local services tax, upon notification to an employer by the
person or by the political subdivision that the person has received
earned income and net profits from all sources within that political
subdivision equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that calendar year or that
the person is otherwise ineligible for the tax exemption for that
calendar year, or upon an employer's payment to the person of earned
income within the Borough in an amount equal to or in excess of
$12,000 in that calendar year, an employer shall withhold the local
services tax from the person under Subsection D.
D. If a person who claimed an exemption for a given calendar year from
the local services tax becomes subject to the tax for the calendar year
under Subsection C, the employer shall withhold the tax for the
remainder of that calendar year. The employer shall withhold from the
person, for the first payroll period after receipt of the notification under
Subsection C, a lump sum equal to the amount of tax that was not
withheld from the person due to the exemption claimed by the person
under this subsection, plus the per-payroll amount due for that first
payroll period. The amount of tax withheld per payroll period for the
remaining payroll periods in that calendar year shall be the same
amount withheld for other employees. In the event the employment of a
person subject to withholding of the tax under this subsection is
subsequently severed in that calendar year, the person shall be liable
for any outstanding balance of tax due, and the Borough levying the tax
may pursue collection under this article.
E. Except as provided in Subsection C, it is the intent of this subsection
that employers shall not be responsible for investigating exemption
certificates, monitoring tax exemption eligibility or exempting any
employee.
A. It shall be the duty of the Borough Manager or the Borough's designee
to accept and receive payments of this tax and to keep a record thereof
showing the amount received by him from each employer or selfemployed
person, together with the date the tax was received.
B. The Borough Manager or the Borough's designee is hereby charged
with the administration and enforcement of this article and is hereby
charged and empowered to prescribe, adopt and promulgate rules and

enforcement of this article, including provisions for the examination of
payroll records of any employer subject to this article; the examination
and correction of any return made in compliance with the article;
and any payment alleged or found to be incorrect or as to which
overpayment is claimed or found to have occurred, or any payment
made by a taxpayer who is engaged in a business or occupation or
businesses or occupations from which he derives less than $12,000 per
year. Any person aggrieved by any decision of the Borough Manager
shall have the right to appeal to the Court of Common Pleas of
Northampton County as in other cases provided.
C. The Borough Manager or the Borough's designee is hereby authorized
to examine the books and payroll records of any employer in order to
verify the accuracy of any return made by an employer or, if no return
was made, to ascertain the tax due. Each employer is hereby directed
and required to give the Borough Manager the means, facilities and
opportunity for such examination.
D. The Borough Manager or Borough's designee has the authority to
collect any delinquent and/or unpaid local services tax. The Borough
Manager and/or the Borough designee shall demand, receive and
collect from all corporations, political subdivisions, associations,
companies, firms or individuals employing persons owing delinquent
local services tax or whose spouse owes delinquent local services tax,
or having in possession unpaid commissions or earnings belonging to
any person or persons owing delinquent local services tax or whose
spouse owes delinquent local services tax, upon the presentation of a
written notice and demand certifying that the information contained
therein is true and correct and containing the name of the taxable
person or the spouse thereof and the amount of tax due.
E. Upon the presentation of such written notice and demand, it shall be
the duty of any such corporation, political subdivision, association,
company, firm or individual to deduct from the wages, commissions or
earnings of such individual employees, then owing or that shall within
60 days thereafter become due, or from any unpaid commissions or
earnings of any such taxable income in its or his possession or that shall
within 60 days thereafter come into its or his possession, a sum
sufficient to pay the respective amount of the delinquent local services
tax and costs shown upon the written notice or demand, and to pay the
same to the Borough Manager or the Borough's designee of the taxing
district in which such delinquent tax was levied within 60 days after
such notice shall have been given.
F. No more than 10% of the wages, commissions or earnings of the
delinquent taxpayer or spouse thereof may be deducted at any one time
for delinquent local services tax. Such corporation, political
subdivision, association, firm or individual shall be entitled to deduct
from the moneys collected from each employee the costs incurred from
the extra bookkeeping necessary to record such transactions, not

G. Upon the failure of any such corporation, political subdivision,
association, company, firm or individual to deduct the amount of such
taxes or to pay the same over to the Tax Collector, less the cost of
bookkeeping involved in such transaction, as herein provided, within
the time hereby required, such corporation, political subdivision,
association, firm or individual shall forfeit and pay the amount of such
tax for each such individual whose taxes are not withheld and paid over
or that are withheld and not paid over together with a penalty of 10%
added thereto, to be recovered by an action of assumpsit in a suit to be
instituted by the Tax Collector or by the proper authorities of the taxing
district as debts of like amount are now by law recoverable, except that
such person shall not have the benefit of any stay of execution or
exemption law. The Tax Collector shall not proceed against a spouse or
his employer until he has pursued collection remedies against the
delinquent taxpayer and his employer under this section.
A. In the event that any tax under this article remains due or unpaid 30
days after the due dates above set forth, the Borough Manager or the
Borough's designee may sue for the recovery of any such tax due or
unpaid under this article, together with interest and penalty.

per annum on the amount of said tax shall be calculated, beginning with
the due date of said tax, and a penalty of 5% shall be added to the flat
rate of said tax for nonpayment thereof. Where suit is brought for the
recovery of this tax, the individual liable therefor shall, in addition, be
responsible and liable for the costs of collection.

(b) Four handicapped parking spaces at the Water Street Park

B. An applicant who wishes to apply for a handicapped parking space shall
apply to the Hellertown Police Department. Prior to the granting of a
handicapped parking space, the Borough of Hellertown shall review the
current status of all off-street parking of the applicant to determine
whether or not the applicant's request meets the Borough's
handicapped parking space policy. The Borough shall determine
whether or not the applicant's request meets the Borough Handicapped
Parking Space Policy.175 The Borough shall determine whether or not to
grant, in its sole and absolute discretion, a handicapped parking space.

the handicapped parking space to the Borough of Hellertown. The
Borough shall renew said application under the criteria set forth in the
Borough Handicapped Parking Space Policy and determine, in its sole
and absolute discretion, whether to grant the applicant's renewal
request.
D. A failure by the applicant to reapply by January 31 of each subsequent
year shall render the applicant's present handicapped parking space
void and the space shall be removed by the Borough. Should an
applicant wish to reestablish the handicapped parking space after it has
been removed by the Borough, the applicant shall be required to
reapply to the Hellertown Police Department as if this were the first
request for a handicapped parking space.
E. In the event that applicant no longer needs to have the handicapped
parking space, the applicant shall, within 30 days, notify the Borough
175. Editor's Note: A copy of the Borough Handicapped Parking Space Policy is on file in the

confirming the possession of a handicapped parking space and the
location of the handicapped parking space. The applicant shall request
that the handicapped parking space be renewed. A failure to comply
shall render the applicant's space void, and the space shall be removed
by the Borough. Should an applicant wish to reestablish the
handicapped parking space after it has been removed by the Borough,
the applicant shall be required to reapply to the Hellertown Police
Department as if this were the first request for a handicapped parking
space.

1:522
§ 425-33. Angle parking.
§ 425-34. Residential permit parking.
B. The Borough may consider written requests for additional loading and
unloading zones on Main Street, at its sole discretion. Any additional

include any new loading and unloading zones.
C. All controls and regulations created hereinunder shall become effective
and enforceable according to law upon the enactment and adoption of
this section.
A. Only angle parking shall be permitted on the following portions of
streets:
Street Side Between
(Reserved)
B. On all streets where angle parking is required, every vehicle parked at
the angle shall be parked with its front nearest the curb.
A. Findings and purpose. The Borough finds that:
(1) Certain residential areas in the Borough are subjected to commuter
vehicle parking, therefore depriving the residents of those areas of
spaces in which to park their own vehicles.
(2) Those residential streets are also subjected to a high degree of
commuter traffic which substantially reduces the quality of the
ambient air level.
(3) The establishment of a parking permit program for certain affected
areas should facilitate efficient movement of traffic by providing for
parking preference during certain hours of the day and days of the
week. Therefore, the Borough considers it to be in the interest of
the people of the Borough to provide for the establishment of a
residential permit parking program to ensure primary access to
available parking spaces by neighborhood residents and also to
provide a cleaner ambient air level.
B. Definitions. For the purpose of this section, words and terms listed in
this subsection, as follows, shall have the following meanings:
COMMUTER VEHICLE  A motor vehicle parked in a residential area
by a person not a resident of that residential area.
PROPRIETOR  A person who owns or leases real estate within a
residential area of which he is not a resident but who owns or manages
a business enterprise or professional office maintained at that address.
For the purpose of this section, a proprietor shall be entitled to one
parking permit for that business or professional office address.
§ 425-32 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 425-34
1:523
RESIDENT  A person who owns or leases real property within a
residential area and who maintains either a voting residence or bona
fide occupancy, or both, at that address.
RESIDENTIAL AREA  A contiguous area containing public highways
or parts of public highways primarily abutted by residential property or
residential and nonbusiness property (such as schools, parks, places of
worship, hospitals and nursing homes).
C. Criteria. The residential areas designated in Subsection D of this
section are those deemed impacted and hence eligible for residential
parking on the basis of the following criteria:
(1) During any period between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 6:30 p.m.,
Monday through Saturday, except legal holidays, the number of
vehicles parked (or standing), legally or illegally, on the streets in
the area is equal to 70% or more of the legal on-street parking
capacity of the area. For the purpose of this criterion, a legal
parking space shall be 20 linear feet.
(2) During the same period as specified in Subsection C(1) above, 10%
or more of the vehicles parked (or standing) on the streets in the
area are not registered in the name of a person residing in the area.
For the purpose of this criterion, the latest available information
from the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation regarding
registration of motor vehicles shall be used, provided that, in
determining that a specific area identified as impacted and eligible
for residential permit parking is designated as a residential permit
parking area, the following factors are taken into consideration:
(a) The local and metropolitan needs with respect to clean air and
environment.
(b) The possibility of a reduction in total vehicle miles driven in the
Borough.
(c) The likelihood of alleviating traffic congestion, illegal parking
and related health and safety hazards.
(d) The proximity of public transportation to the residential area.
(e) The desire and need of the residents for residential permit
parking and their willingness to bear the administrative costs
in connection with it.
(f) The need for parking in excess of the residential permit
parking program in proximity to establishments located in the
residential permit parking area and used by the general public
for religious, health or educational purposes.
D. Designation of residential permit parking areas.
(1) The following are designated as residential permit parking areas:
§ 425-34 HELLERTOWN CODE § 425-34
1:524
Area Bounded by and Including
(Reserved)
(2) Signs shall be erected along the streets in each residential permit
parking area, indicating the days, hours, locations and conditions
under which parking shall be by permit only.
E. Application for permit. Application for a residential parking permit shall
be made to the Chief of Police or his designee by the person desiring the
permit, who shall be only the owner or the driver of a motor vehicle who
resides on or is a proprietor of property immediately adjacent to a
street or other location within a residential parking permit area. A
separate application shall be required for each motor vehicle, and each
application shall be accompanied by a permit fee, in an amount as
established by resolution of the Borough, which shall be for the use of
the Borough, to be applied to the cost of administering the residential
permit parking program. Each application shall contain the following
information: the name of the owner or the driver, as the case may be, of
the motor vehicle; the address of the resident or the proprietor, as the
case may be; the make, model and registration number of the motor
vehicle; and the driver number as taken from the applicant's current
driver's license. At the discretion of the Chief of Police or his designee,
the applicant shall be required, at the time of making application, to
present his driver's license and the vehicle registration card.
F. Issuance of permit. Upon receipt of the application and the permit fee,
and determination by him that the information upon the application
shows that the applicant is entitled to a residential parking permit, the
Chief of Police or his designee shall issue to the applicant a residential
parking permit, which shall be valid for the remainder of the calendar
year. The permit shall display the serial and registration numbers of the
motor vehicle, the residential parking area number and the expiration
date. The permit shall be renewable annually before the expiration date
upon making application for renewal and payment of the permit fee. It
shall be unlawful and a violation of this section for any person to display
other than the current and valid permit while standing or parking in a
residential permit parking area at any time when those permits are to
be displayed.
G. Temporary and exemption parking permits. Temporary parking permits
may be issued by the Chief of Police or his designee, upon payment of a
fee in an amount as established by resolution of the Borough Council, to
bona fide visitors of residents of a designated residential permit
parking area, and exemption parking permits may be issued, without
payment of a fee, to handicapped persons.
H. Responsibility of permit holder.
(1) Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, the
holder of a residential parking permit shall be permitted to stand or
§ 425-34 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 425-34
1:525
§ 425-35. Parking prohibited during street sweeping hours.
It shall be unlawful for any person to park a vehicle or to allow the same to
remain parked, at any time established on any of the following portions of
the highways of the Borough on the days hereby respectively designated for
street sweeping purposes:
park a motor vehicle operated by him in any designated residential
parking area during those times when parking of motor vehicles
is permitted in that area. While a vehicle for which a residential
parking permit has been issued is so parked, that permit shall be
displayed so as to be clearly visible through the windshield of the
vehicle. A residential parking permit shall not guarantee or reserve
to the holder a parking space within a designated residential
permit parking area.
(2) A residential parking permit shall not authorize its holder to stand
or park a motor vehicle in any place where or at any time when
stopping, standing or parking of motor vehicles is prohibited or set
aside for other specified types of vehicles, nor shall the permit
exempt its holder from the observance of any traffic or parking
regulation other than residential permit parking regulation or
restriction.
(3) No person other than the permit holder whose name appears on the
permit shall use a residential parking permit or display it on a
vehicle operated; any such use or display by a person other than
the permit holder shall constitute a violation of this section by the
permit holder and by the person who so used or displayed the
parking permit.
(4) It shall constitute a violation of this section for any person falsely to
represent himself as eligible for a residential parking permit or to
furnish false information in an application to the Chief of Police or
his designee in order to obtain a residential parking permit.
I. Revocation of permits. The Chief of Police or his designee shall have
authority to revoke the residential parking permit of any permit holder
found to be in violation of any provision of this section. Upon written
notification to the present holder of the revocation, the permit holder
shall surrender the permit to the Chief of Police or his designee. Failure
to do so, when so requested, shall constitute a violation of this section,
provided that any person receiving such a notice may, within 10 days
after the date of the notice, appeal to the Borough for a hearing on the
revocation, and the decision of the Borough shall be final.

[Amended 4-16-2012 by Ord. No. 763]
(5) Fractional space. In all districts when required parking spaces
results in the requirement of a fractional space, any fraction may

(6) Nonapplicability of existing buildings and uses. The provisions of
Subsection A(1) through (5) shall not apply to any building,

§ 450-20 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 450-20
1:623
chapter, whether continued as a permitted or a nonconforming use,

number of off-street parking spaces required under this chapter.
The Zoning Hearing Board, by grant of a variance, may permit onstreet
parking spaces to count towards the off-street parking

from a building entrance.
(c) The applicant offers evidence of a shared parking agreement
meeting all of the following:
[1] The shared parking is guaranteed by a legally binding
agreement in a form acceptable to the Borough. If
requested by the Zoning Officer, the applicant shall
periodically provide evidence that the agreement remains
in effect If such agreement becomes legally ineffective,
then all parking shall be provided as would otherwise be
required.
[2] Calculate the minimum amount of parking required for
each land use as if it were a separate use. Determine peak
parking requirements by multiplying the minimum parking
required for each proposed land use by the corresponding
percentage in the table below for each of the six time
periods. Calculate the column total of each of the six time
periods. The column (time period) with the highest value
shall be the minimum parking requirement.

(5) Surface area calculation. The size of any sign shall be completed by
multiplying its greatest height by its greatest length, exclusive of
supporting structures. In the case of signs that have no definable
edges, such as raised letters attached to a building facade, the sign
size shall be that area within a single continuous perimeter
enclosing the extreme limits of the actual message or copy area. In
§ 450-22 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 450-22
1:633
computing the surface area of a multifaced sign, only one side shall
be considered, provided all faces are identical. If the interior angle
formed by the two faces of a double-face sign is greater than 45°,
then both sides of such sign shall be considered in calculating the
sign area. Structural members not bearing advertising matter or
not in the form of a symbol shall not be included in the computation
of surface areas.
D. Sign placement, height, clearance, projections from walls and
illumination.
(1) Sign placement. Sign placement shall be subject to the following
requirements:

lines for streets, sidewalks or driveways, through confusion
with a traffic control device (by reason of color, location, shape
or other characteristics), or through other means.
(b) No sign shall be erected, attached or displayed within 25 feet
of the point of the intersection of the street right-of-way lines at
a street corner except for flat wall signs in accord with the
provision of Subsection D(3) and (4). The requirements of
§ 450-18G, Corner clearances, shall apply to signs.
(2) Sign height.
(a) Freestanding signs shall not exceed 18 feet in height, except in
the Highway Commercial District. In the Highway Commercial
District, signs shall not exceed 36 feet in height.
(b) No attached wall sign shall be erected upon the roof of a
building or extend above the height of the building, except in
the Industrial, Shopping Center and Highway Commercial
Districts. In the Industrial and Shopping Center Districts,
attached signs may be erected upon the roof of the building or
extend above the height of the building, if the sign is no higher
than 18 feet from the average finished grade of the building. In
the Highway Commercial District, attached signs may be
erected upon the roof of the building or extend above the
height of the building if the sign is no higher than 36 feet from
the average finished grade of the building.
(c) Bulletin board signs shall not exceed four feet in height.

ARTICLE VI
Special Exception Uses
§ 450-23. Procedure for special exception uses.
The Zoning Hearing Board shall make a determination that the proposed
special exception use will or will not be permitted pursuant to the
procedures set forth in § 450-64. The use shall be permitted if the standards
and criteria set forth in this article are met. The use shall not be permitted
if the standards and criteria set forth in this article are not met. The Zoning
Hearing Board may attach reasonable conditions and safeguards which are
necessary for the protection of the public health, safety, general welfare or
morals of the community in the permitting of a special exception use.
§ 450-24. General standards.
These standards are applicable to all applications for special exception uses
as set forth in Article IV.
A. Such use shall be one which is specifically authorized as a special
exception use in the district within which such particular site is located.
B. For every special exception use, the Board shall determine that there is
appropriate provision for access facilities adequate for the estimated
traffic from public streets and sidewalks, so as to assure the public
safety and to avoid traffic congestion. Vehicular entrances and exits
shall be clearly visible from the street and not within 75 feet of the
intersection of the street lines at a street intersection if alternative
locations are available. [Amended 9-17-2012 by Ord. No. 775]
C. For every special exception use, the Board shall determine that there
are fully adequate parking areas and off-street truck loading spaces, in
conformity with this chapter and all other pertinent ordinances, for the
anticipated number of occupants, employees and patrons, and that the
layout of the parking spaces, truck loading berths and interior
driveways is convenient and conducive to safe operation.
D. For every special exception use, the Board may require a protective
planting strip not less than 10 feet nor more than 30 feet in width,
situated within any required or rear yard, designed and laid out with
suitable evergreen plant material which will be planted at a minimum
height of four feet and will attain and shall be maintained at a height of
not less than eight feet so as to provide an effective natural screen
between the nonresidential and residential districts or uses. A planting
plan specifying the type, size and location of existing and proposed
plant material shall be required.
E. For every special exception use, where the installation of outdoor
floodlighting or spotlighting is intended, the Board shall determine that
such lighting will not shine directly upon any abutting property, nor
upon the street. No unshielded lights shall be permitted.
§ 450-23 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 450-24
1:645
§ 450-25. Standards relevant to individual uses.
These standards are applicable to the individual uses listed in Article IV.
These standards are to be applied in addition to those set forth in § 450-24.
§ 450-26. Adult-oriented establishments and massage parlors.
[Amended 7-2-2007 by Ord. No. 706]
F. For every special exception use, the Board shall determine that
adequate provisions will be made for collection and disposal of
stormwater runoff from the site.
G. For every special exception use, the Board shall determine that
adequate provision has been made for snow removal.
A. Purposes. To serve the intent and respond to the findings provided in
Title 68, Article II, Subpart E, Chapter 55 of the Pennsylvania
Consolidated Statutes, as amended, which are hereby included by
reference.215 To serve the overall objectives of this section and the
following purposes:
(1) To recognize the adverse secondary impacts of adult-oriented
establishments that affect health, safety and general welfare
concerns of the Borough. These secondary impacts have been
documented in research conducted across the nation. These
secondary impacts typically include, but are not limited to,
increases in criminal activity, increases in activities that increase
the risk of transmission of sexually transmitted diseases, increases
in activities that increase the risk of transmission of other
communicable diseases, increases in blight, decreases in the
stability of residential neighborhoods, and decreases in property
values for surrounding homes, and decreases in the marketability
of nearby commercial business space. The research conducted
across the nation concluded that adult-oriented establishments
typically involved insufficient self-regulation to control these
secondary effects.
(2) To limit adult-oriented establishments to locations where these
secondary impacts can be minimized, particularly as they affect
residential neighborhoods and commercial revitalization.
(3) To not attempt to suppress any activities protected by the "free
speech" protections of the State and United States Constitutions,
but instead to control secondary effects.
B. A lot or parcel which contains an adult-oriented establishment or
massage parlor shall not be located within 1,000 lineal feet of another
lot or parcel which contains an adult-oriented establishment or
massage parlor.
215. Editor's Note: See 68 Pa.C.S.A. § 5501 et seq.
§ 450-24 HELLERTOWN CODE § 450-26
1:646
C. The setbacks for an adult-oriented establishment or massage parlors
shall also apply from dwellings, uses and residential districts located in
an adjacent municipality. The lot line of a lot occupied by an adultoriented
establishment or massage parlor shall be located a minimum
of the following distances:
(1) One thousand feet from an elementary or secondary school; child
day-care center or nursery school; church, synagogue, mosque or
similar place of regularly scheduled religious worship; library;
public park or playground; hotel/motel; bed-and-breakfast; or
residential dwelling unit.
(2) Seven hundred fifty feet from a residential or conservation zoning
district.
D. A fifty-foot buffer yard shall be provided, regardless of zoning district,
along the side and rear lot lines for adult-oriented establishments. The
buffer shall include continuous, opaque screening by evergreens with
an initial height of five feet. The buffer shall be installed and maintained
at all times by the property owner.
E. No pornographic material, displays, signs or words shall be placed in
view of persons who are not inside the adult-oriented establishment.
Definite precautions shall be made to prohibit minors from entering the
premises.
F. No adult-oriented establishment or massage parlor shall be used for
any purpose that violates any federal, state or municipal law.
G. The adult-oriented establishment shall not include the sale or display of
"obscene" materials, as defined by Pennsylvania criminal law, as may be
amended by applicable court decisions.
H. An adult-oriented establishment shall be prohibited in all districts
except as a special exception use in the Shopping Center District. An
adult-oriented establishment is a distinct use and shall not be allowed
under any other use, such as a retail store or club.

expanding or limiting Borough police powers or as modifying any
principles of substantive law.
B. Participation in mediation shall be wholly voluntary. The
appropriateness of mediation shall be determined by the particulars of
each case and the willingness of the parties to negotiate. Any
municipality offering the mediation option shall assure that, in each
case, the mediating parties, assisted by the mediator as appropriate,
develop terms and conditions for:

§ 450-64. Special exception uses.
Where a use requires a special exception review by the Board, as noted in
§ 450-23, the applicant shall request a hearing by the Board.
§ 450-65. Variances.
A. The Board shall hear and decide on the request in accordance with the
standards and criteria for special exception uses as set forth in Article
VI of this chapter. In determining that a use shall be permitted, the
Board may attach such reasonable conditions and safeguards as it may
deem necessary to implement the purposes of this chapter.
B. The Board may require the submission or presentation of such plans
and other materials as it deems necessary to make a proper
determination. Any subsequent amendment or addition to plans for
which a permit is sought shall be subject to review and public hearing
of the Board.
C. If the special exception use involves the site plan review process, the
following procedure should also be in use. The Board's hearing and
decision shall follow the receipt of the Planning Commission's site plan
review report. The Planning Commission shall have 30 days from the
date of the regular meeting of the Planning Commission next following
the date the application is submitted within which to file its report
thereon. In the event the Planning Commission fails to file its report
within 30 days, such application shall be deemed to have been approved
by the Planning Commission. The Planning Commission may have
representation at the public hearing held by the Zoning Hearing Board
on such applications. [Amended 12-2-2013 by Ord. No. 783]
(1) The applicant shall submit four sets of the site plans to the
Secretary of the Zoning Hearing Board when filing a request for a
special use.
(2) The plans shall indicate the data cited in § 450-78A(1).
(3) One set of plans shall be submitted to the Planning Commission,
which shall review the plans in accord with the criteria in
§ 450-78A(2) and also the relevant special exception use standards.
(4) One set of plans shall be submitted to the Zoning Officer or his
designee for review relative to Borough zoning standards.
D. A special exception use which is approved by the Zoning Hearing Board
shall be construed to be a conforming use, except when accomplished
by variance.
A. The Board shall hear requests for variances where it is alleged that the
provisions of this chapter inflict unnecessary hardship upon the
applicant, such as appeal from a denial of a building permit by the
Zoning Officer or his designee. The Board may by rule prescribe the
§ 450-64 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 450-65

§ 450-66. Borough Council's functions; conditional uses. [Added
9-17-2012 by Ord. No. 775; amended 4-18-2016 by Ord. No. 805]
form of application and may require preliminary application to the
Zoning Officer or his designee. The Board may grant a variance,
provided that all of the following findings are made where relevant in a
given case: [Amended 9-17-2012 by Ord. No. 775]
(1) That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity, narrowness or shallowness of lot size or
shape, or exceptional topographical or other physical conditions
peculiar to the particular property, and that the unnecessary
hardship is due to such conditions and not the circumstances or
conditions generally created by the provisions of this chapter in the
neighborhood or district in which the property is located.
(2) That because of such physical circumstances or conditions there is
no possibility that the property can be developed in strict
conformity with the provisions of this chapter and that the
authorization of a variance is, therefore, necessary to enable the
reasonable use of the property.
(3) That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
appellant.
(4) That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is
located, nor substantially or permanently impair the appropriate
use or development of adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the
public welfare.
(5) That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance that will afford relief and will represent the least
modification possible of the regulation in issue.
B. In granting any variance, the Board may attach such reasonable
conditions and safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement the
purposes of this chapter. No variance shall be granted to allow a
structure or use in a district in which such structure or use is restricted.
A use permitted as the result of the granting of a variance shall be
construed to be a nonconforming use.
C. The variance shall be considered void unless the construction or use
which necessitated the variance request is undertaken within one year
of the issuance of the variance.
A. Where the Borough Council, in this chapter, has stated conditional uses
to be granted or denied by the Borough Council pursuant to express
standards and criteria, the Borough Council shall hold a hearing on and
decide requests for such conditional uses in accordance with such
standards and criteria. The hearing shall be conducted by the Board or
the Board may appoint any member or an independent attorney as a
§ 450-65 HELLERTOWN CODE § 450-66
1:692
hearing officer. The decision or, where no decision is called for, the
findings shall be made by the Board. However, the appellant or the
applicant, as the case may be, in addition to the Borough, may, prior
to the decision of the hearing, waive decision or findings by the Board
and accept the decision or findings of the hearing officer as final.
In granting a conditional use, the Borough Council may attach such
reasonable conditions and safeguards, in addition to those expressed in
this chapter, as it may deem necessary to implement the purposes of
this article in this chapter.
B. Advisory report. No application for a conditional use shall be granted by
the Borough Council until Borough Council has first received and
considered an advisory report thereon from the Hellertown Planning
Commission with respect to the location of such use in relation to the
needs and growth pattern of the Borough and, where appropriate, with
reference to the adequacy of the site area and arrangement of
buildings, driveways, parking areas, off-street truck loading spaces, and
other pertinent features of the site plan. The Planning Commission shall
have 30 days from the date of receipt of the applicant's application
within which to file its report thereon.
C. Filing of conditional use application. For any use permitted by
conditional use, a conditional use must be obtained from the Borough
Council. In addition to the information required to be shown on the
zoning permit application, the conditional use application must show:
(1) Floor plans and elevations of proposed structures;
(2) Names and addresses of adjoining property owners, including
properties directly across a public right-of-way;
(3) A scaled drawing (site plan) of the site with sufficient detail and
accuracy to demonstrate compliance with all applicable provisions
of this chapter; and
(4) A written description of the proposed use in sufficient detail to
demonstrate compliance with all applicable provisions of this
chapter.
D. General criteria. Each applicant must demonstrate compliance with the
following in addition to those set forth in § 450-66E:
(1) The proposed use shall be consistent with the purpose and intent of
this chapter;
(2) The proposed use shall not detract from the use and enjoyment of
adjoining nearby properties;
(3) The proposed use will not affect a change in the character of the
subject property's neighborhood;
§ 450-66 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 450-66
1:693
(4) Adequate public facilities are available to serve the proposed use
(e.g., schools; fire, police, and ambulance protection; sewer, water,
and other utilities: vehicular access; etc.);
(5) For development within a floodplain, the application complies with
the requirements of the Borough's Floodplain Ordinance;232
(6) The proposed use shall comply with all applicable regulations of
this chapter; and
(7) The proposed use will not substantially impair the integrity of the
Borough's Comprehensive Plan.
E. Conditions. Borough Council, in approving conditional use applications,
may attach conditions considered by it to be necessary to protect the
public welfare and the purposes listed above, including conditions
which are more restrictive than those established for other uses in the
same zone. These conditions shall be enforceable by the Zoning Officer,
and failure to comply with such conditions shall constitute a violation of
this chapter and be subject to the penalties described in this article.
F. Site plan approval. Any site plan presented in support of the conditional
use pursuant to Subsection A shall become an official part of the record
for said conditional use. Approval of any conditional use will also bind
the use in accordance with the submitted site plan; therefore, should a
change in the site plan be required as part of the approval of the use,
the applicant shall revise the site plan prior to the issuance of a zoning
permit. Any subsequent change to the use on the subject property, not
reflected on the originally approved site plan, shall require another
conditional use approval to be obtained.
G. Hearing procedures.
(1) Before voting on the approval of a conditional use, the Borough
Council shall hold a public hearing thereon, pursuant to public
notice. The hearing shall be conducted by the Borough Council. The
Borough Council shall submit each such application to the Borough
Planning Commission at least 30 days prior to the hearing on such
application to provide the Borough Planning Commission an
opportunity to submit recommendations. If, after any public
hearing held upon an application, the proposed application is
revised, the Borough Council shall hold another public hearing,
pursuant to public notice, before proceeding to vote on the
application.
(2) Public notice, as defined herein, shall be published and written
notice given to the applicant, the Zoning Officer, the Borough
Planning Commission, and such other persons as the Borough
Council may designate and to any person who has made timely
request for the same. Written notices shall be given at such time
232. Editor's Note: See Ch. 204, Flood Damage Prevention.
§ 450-66 HELLERTOWN CODE § 450-66
1:694
and in such manner as shall be prescribed by ordinance or, in the
absence of ordinance provision, by rules of the Borough Council.
In addition to the written notice provided herein, written notice of
said hearing shall be conspicuously posted on the affected tract of
land at least one week prior to the scheduled date of the hearing.
(3) The Borough Council may prescribe reasonable fees with respect to
hearings. Fees for said hearings may include compensation for the
Secretary, notice and advertising costs, and necessary
administrative overhead connected with the hearing. The costs,
however, shall not include legal expenses, expenses for
engineering, architectural, or other technical consultants, or
expert witness costs.
(4) The first hearing before the Borough Council shall be commenced
within 60 days from the date of receipt of the applicant's
application, unless the applicant has agreed in writing to an
extension of time. Each subsequent hearing before the Borough
Council shall be held within 45 days of the prior hearing, unless
otherwise agreed to by the applicant in writing or on the record. An
applicant shall complete the presentation of his case-in-chief within
100 days of the first hearing. Upon the request of the applicant, the
Borough Council shall assure that the applicant receives at least
seven hours of hearings within the 100 days, including the first
hearing. Persons opposed to the application shall complete the
presentation of their opposition to the application within 100 days
of the first hearing held after the completion of the applicant's
case-in-chief. An applicant may, upon request, be granted
additional hearings to complete his case-in-chief provided the
persons opposed to the application are granted an equal number of
additional hearings. Persons opposed to the application may, upon
the written consent or consent on the record by the applicant and
municipality, be granted additional hearings to complete their
opposition to the application provided the applicant is granted an
equal number of additional hearings for rebuttal.
(5) The hearings shall be conducted by the Borough Council. The
decision, or where no decision is called for, the findings shall be
made by Borough Council.
(6) The parties to the hearing shall be the Borough, any person
affected by the application who has made timely appearance of
record before the Borough Council, and any other person, including
civic or community organizations, permitted to appear by the
Borough Council. The Borough Council shall have power to require
that all persons who wish to be considered parties enter
appearances in writing on forms provided by the Borough Council
for that purpose.
(7) The Borough Council President shall have power to administer
oaths and issue subpoenas to compel attendance of witnesses and
§ 450-66 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 450-66
1:695
production of relevant documents and papers, including witnesses
and documents requested by the parties.
(8) The parties shall have the right to be represented by counsel and
shall be afforded the opportunity to respond and present evidence
and argument and cross-examine adverse witnesses on all relevant
issues.
(9) Formal rules of evidence shall not apply, but irrelevant, immaterial,
or unduly repetitious evidence may be excluded.
(10) The Borough Council may keep a stenographic record of the
proceedings. The appearance fee for a stenographer shall be
shared equally by the applicant and the Borough Council. The cost
of the original transcript shall be paid by the Borough Council if the
transcript is ordered by the Borough Council or shall be paid by the
person appealing the decision of the Borough Council, if such
appeal is made, and in either event the cost of additional copies
shall be paid by the person requesting such copy or copies. In other
cases, the party requesting the original transcript shall bear the
cost thereof.
(11) The Borough Council shall not communicate, directly or indirectly,
with any party or his representative in connection with any issue
involved except upon notice and opportunity for all parties to
participate, shall not take notice of any communication, reports,
staff memoranda, or other materials, except advice from its
solicitor, unless the parties are afforded an opportunity to contest
the material so noticed, and shall not inspect the site or its
surroundings after the commencement of hearings with any party
or his representative unless all parties are given an opportunity to
be present.
H. Time limitation.
(1) If a conditional use is granted, the necessary permit shall be
secured and the authorized action begun within two years after the
date when the conditional use is finally granted, and the building or
alterations, as the case may be, shall be completed within three
years of said date. For good cause, the Borough Council may at any
time, upon application in writing, extend either of these deadlines.
(2) Should the appellant or applicant fail to obtain the necessary
permits within said two-year period or, having obtained the permit,
should he fail to commence work thereunder within such two-year
period, it shall be conclusively presumed that the appellant or
applicant has waived, withdrawn, or abandoned his application,
and all approvals and permits granted to him shall be deemed
automatically rescinded by the Borough Council.
(3) Should the appellant or applicant commence construction or
alteration within said two-year period but should he fail to
§ 450-66 HELLERTOWN CODE § 450-66
1:696
complete such construction or alteration within said three-year
period, the Borough Council may, upon 10 days' notice in writing,
rescind or revoke the granted conditional use, if the Borough
Council finds that no good cause appears for the failure to complete
the construction or alteration within said three-year period and if
the Borough Council further finds that conditions have so altered
or changed in the interval since the granting of the conditional use
that revocation of the action is justified.
(4) As an alternative to the preceding, an applicant can request, as
part of the original application before the Borough Council, the
granting of a timetable associated with the request, which would
supersede the deadlines imposed in Subsection H(1) and (2). In so
doing, the applicant or appellant must demonstrate that the times
requested are logically related to normal and expected progress of
the project. In approving a timetable under this subsection, the
Borough Council must establish a definite time frame for issuance
of a zoning permit and completion of construction of the project.
I. Decisions.
(1) The Borough Council shall render a written decision or, when no
decision is called for, make written findings on the conditional use
application within 45 days after the last hearing before the
Borough Council. Where the application is contested or denied,
each decision shall be accompanied by findings of fact or
conclusions based thereon, together with any reasons therefor.
Conclusions based on any provisions of the Municipalities Planning
Code233 or of any ordinance, rule or regulation shall contain a
reference to the provision relied on and the reasons why the
conclusion is deemed appropriate in the light of the facts found.
(2) Where the Borough Council fails to render the decision within the
period required by this section or fails to commence, conduct or
complete the required hearing as provided in § 450-66G(4), the
decision shall be deemed to have been rendered in favor of the
applicant unless the applicant has agreed in writing or on the
record to an extension of time. When a decision has been rendered
in favor of the applicant because of the failure of the Borough
Council to meet or render a decision as hereinabove provided, the
Borough Council shall give public notice of the decision within 10
days from the last day it could have met to render a decision in the
same manner as required by the public notice requirements of
§ 450-66G(2). If the Borough Council shall fail to provide such
notice, the applicant may do so.
(3) Nothing in this section shall prejudice the right of any party
opposing the application to appeal the decision to a court of
competent jurisdiction. A copy of the final decision or, where no

Appeals under § 450-62A(1) through (9) may be filed with the Board in
writing by the landowner affected, any officer or agency of the Borough,
or any person aggrieved. Requests for a variance under § 450-65 and for
special exception under § 450-64 may be filed with the Board by any
landowner or any tenant with the permission of such landowner.
§ 450-68. Time limitations.235
§ 450-69. Stay of proceedings.236
decision is called for, of the findings shall be delivered to the
applicant personally or mailed to him no later than the day
following its date. To all other persons who have filed their name
and address with the Board not later than the last day of the
hearing, the Borough shall provide, by mail or otherwise, brief
notice of the decision or findings and a statement of the place at
which the full decision or findings may be examined.
A. No person shall be allowed to file any proceeding with the Board later
than 30 days after an application for development, preliminary or final,
has been approved by an appropriate Borough officer, agency or body if
such proceeding is designed to secure reversal or to limit the approval
in any manner, unless such person alleges and proves that he had no
notice, knowledge or reason to believe that such approval had been
given. If such person has succeeded to his interest after such approval,
he shall be bound by the knowledge of his predecessor in interest. The
failure of anyone other than the landowner to appeal from an adverse
decision on a tentative plan pursuant to § 709 of the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code or from an adverse decision by a zoning
officer on a challenge to the validity of an ordinance or map pursuant to
§ 916.2 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code shall preclude
an appeal from a final approval, except in the case where the final
submission substantially deviates from the approved tentative approval.
B. All appeals from determinations adverse to the landowners shall be
filed by the landowner within 30 days after notice of the determination
is issued.
A. Upon filing of any proceeding referred to in § 450-67 and during its
pendency before the Board, all land development pursuant to any
challenged ordinance, order or approval of the Zoning Officer or his
designee or of any agency or body, and all official action thereunder,
shall be stayed unless the Zoning Officer or his designee or any other
appropriate agency or body certifies to the Board facts indicating that

§ 450-70. Enactment of Zoning Ordinance amendments.237
such stay would cause imminent peril to life or property, in which case
the development or official action shall not be stayed otherwise than
by a restraining order, which may be granted by the Board or by the
court having jurisdiction of zoning appeals, on petition, after notice
to the Zoning Officer or his designee or other appropriate agency or
body. When an application for development, preliminary or final, has
been duly approved and proceedings designed to reverse or limit the
approval are filed with the Board by persons other than the applicant,
the applicant may petition the court having jurisdiction of zoning
appeals to order such person to post bond as a condition to continuing
the proceedings before the Board.
B. After the petition is presented, the court shall hold a hearing to
determine if the filing of the appeal is frivolous. At the hearing,
evidence may be presented on the merits of the case. It shall be the
burden of the applicant for a bond to prove the appeal is frivolous. After
consideration of all evidence presented, if the court determines that the
appeal is frivolous, it shall grant the petition for a bond. The right to
petition the court to order the appellant to post bond may be waived by
the appellee, but such waiver may be revoked by him if an appeal is
taken from a final decision of the court.
C. The question whether or not such petition should be granted and the
amount of the bond shall be within the sound discretion of the court. An
order denying a petition for bond shall be interlocutory. An order
directing the responding party to post a bond shall be interlocutory.
D. If an appeal is taken by a respondent to the petition for a bond from an
order of the court dismissing a zoning appeal for refusal to post a bond,
and the appellate court sustains the order of the court below to post a
bond, the respondent to the petition for a bond, upon motion of the
petitioner and after hearing in the court having jurisdiction of zoning
appeals, shall be liable for all reasonable costs, expenses and attorneys'
fees incurred by the petitioner.
A. For the preparation of amendments to this chapter, the procedure set
forth in § 607 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code for the
preparation of a proposed zoning ordinance shall be optional.238
B. Before voting on the enactment of an amendment, the Borough Council
shall hold a public hearing thereon, pursuant to public notice. In
addition, if the proposed amendment involves a zoning map change,
notice of said public hearing shall be conspicuously posted by the
Borough at points deemed sufficient by the Borough along the tract to

(1) In addition to the requirement that notice be posted under
Subsection B, notice of the public hearing shall be mailed by the
Borough at least 30 days prior to the date of the hearing by first
class mail to the addresses to which real estate tax bills are sent for
all real property located within the area being rezoned, as
evidenced by tax records within the possession of the Borough. The
notice shall include the location, date and time of the public
hearing. A good faith effort and substantial compliance shall satisfy
the requirements of this subsection.
(2) This subsection shall not apply when the rezoning constitutes a
comprehensive rezoning.
C. In the case of an amendment other than that prepared by the planning
agency, the Borough Council shall submit each such amendment to the
planning agency at least 30 days prior to the hearing on such proposed
amendment to provide the planning agency an opportunity to submit
recommendations.
D. If after any public hearing held upon an amendment, the proposed
amendment is changed substantially or is revised to include land
previously not affected by it, the Borough Council shall hold another
public hearing, pursuant to public notice, before proceeding to vote on
the amendment.
E. If the county planning commission shall have been created for the
county in which the municipality proposing the amendment is located
then, at least 30 days prior to the public hearing on the amendment by
the Borough Council, the Borough shall submit the proposed
amendment to the county planning commission for recommendations.
F. The Borough may offer a mediation option as an aid in completing
proceedings authorized by this section. In exercising such an option,
the Borough and mediating parties shall meet the stipulations and
follow the procedures set forth in Article IX of the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code.
G. Within 30 days after enactment, a copy of the amendment to this
chapter shall be forwarded to the County Planning Commission.
A. A landowner who desires to challenge on substantive grounds the
validity of a zoning ordinance or map or any provision thereof which
prohibits or restricts the use or development of land in which he has an
interest may submit a curative amendment to the Borough Council with
a written request that his challenge and proposed amendment be heard
and decided as provided in § 916.1 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities
Planning Code.240 The Borough Council shall commence a hearing
239. Editor's Note: Added at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I).
§ 450-70 HELLERTOWN CODE § 450-71

thereon within 60 days of the request as provided in § 916.1 of the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code. The curative amendment
and challenge shall be referred to the planning agency or agencies as
provided in § 450-72, and notice of the hearing thereon shall be given as
provided in § 450-73 and in § 916.1 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities
Planning Code.
B. The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with § 908 of the
Municipalities Planning Code241 and all references therein to the zoning
hearing board shall, for purposes of this section, be references to the
Borough Council; provided, however, that the provisions of § 908(1.2)
and (9) shall not apply and the provisions of § 916.1 shall control. If a
municipality does not accept a landowner's curative amendment
brought in accordance with this subsection and a court subsequently
rules that the challenge has merit, the court's decision shall not result
in a declaration of invalidity for the entire zoning ordinance and map,
but only for those provisions which specifically relate to the
landowner's curative amendment and challenge.
C. The Borough Council of the Borough which has determined that a
validity challenge has merit may accept a landowner's curative
amendment, with or without revision, or may adopt an alternative
amendment which will cure the challenged defects. The Borough
Council shall consider the curative amendments, plans and explanatory
material submitted by the landowner and shall also consider:
(1) The impact of the proposal upon roads, sewer facilities, water
supplies, schools and other public service facilities.
(2) If the proposal is for a residential use, the impact of the proposal
upon regional housing needs and the effectiveness of the proposal
in providing housing units of a type actually available to and
affordable by classes of person otherwise unlawfully excluded by
the challenged provisions of the ordinance or map.
(3) The suitability of the site for the intensity of use proposed by the
site's soils, slopes, woodlands, wetlands, floodplains, aquifers,
natural resources and other natural features.
(4) The impact of the proposed use on the site's soils, slopes,
woodlands, wetlands, floodplains, natural resources and natural
features; the degree to which these are protected or destroyed; the
tolerance of the resource to development and any adverse
environmental impacts.
(5) The impact of the proposal on the preservation of agriculture and
other land uses which are essential to public health and welfare.

landowner's curative amendment filed under § 450-71, nor shall the
Zoning Hearing Board be required to give a report requested under
§ 450-62 or § 916.1 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code244
subsequent to the declaration and proposal based upon the grounds
identical to or substantially similar to those specified in the resolution
required in Subsection A(1)(a). Upon completion of the procedure as set
forth in Subsections A and B, no rights to cure pursuant to the
provisions of § 450-70 and § 916.1 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities
Planning Code shall, from the date of the declaration and proposal,
accrue to any landowner on the basis of the substantive invalidity of the
unamended zoning ordinance for which there has been a curative
amendment pursuant to this section.
D. The Borough having utilized the procedures as set forth in Subsections
A and B may not again utilize said procedure for a thirty-six-month
period following the date of the enactment of a curative amendment, or

this section and shall include the time and place of the meeting at which
passage will be considered, a reference to a place within the Borough
where copies of the proposed ordinance or amendment may be
examined without charge or obtained for a charge not greater than the
cost thereof. The Borough Council shall publish the proposed ordinance
or amendment once in one newspaper of general circulation in the
Borough not more than 60 days nor less than seven days prior to
passage. Publication of the proposed ordinance or amendment shall
include either the full text thereof or the title and a brief summary,
prepared by the Borough Solicitor and setting forth all the provisions in
reasonable detail. If the full text is not included:

ARTICLE VIII
Administration and Enforcement
§ 450-74. Interpretation.
A. In applying and interpreting the provisions of this chapter, they shall be
held to be minimum requirements adopted for the promotion of the
public health, safety, morals, comfort, convenience and general welfare.
The following specific regulations shall apply:
(1) A minimum required lot or yard size for one building or structure
shall not be used as any part of a required lot or yard for a second
structure.
(2) The required lot or yard for an existing building or structure shall
not be diminished below the minimum requirements of this chapter.
(3) The parking spaces required for one building or structure or use
shall not be included in the computation of required parking spaces
for a second building or structure or use.
B. Relation of Zoning Ordinance to other provisions of law and to private
covenants and agreements.
(1) Nothing contained in this chapter shall be taken to repeal,
abrogate, annul or in any way impair or interfere with any
provisions of law or ordinance or regulations existing or as may be
adopted in the future. Nor is it intended by this chapter to interfere
with or abrogate or annul any easements, covenants or other
agreements between parties. Where this chapter imposes a greater
restriction upon the use of buildings, structures, premises, lots or
land or upon the height of buildings or structures, or requires
larger lots, yards, courts or other open spaces than imposed or
required by such other provisions of law, ordinance or regulations,
or by such easements, covenants or agreements, the provisions of
this chapter shall control.
(2) Wherever the provisions of any other law or ordinance or
regulations impose a greater restriction than this chapter, the
provisions of such other law or ordinance or regulations shall
control.
(3) No provisions contained in this chapter shall be construed as
justifying the encroachment of any building or structure within any
street lines now or hereafter laid down on the Official Borough
Map.
(4) Where a lot is formed from part of a lot already improved, the
separation must be made in such a manner as not to impair any of
the provisions of this chapter, whether related to the then-existing
improvement or to a proposed or future new improvement on the
lot so formed, and in such a manner that both the remainder of the
§ 450-74 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 450-74
1:705
§ 450-75. Enforcement by Zoning Officer or his designee.
former lot and the new lot so formed shall comply with the lot area
and lot width provisions of this chapter.
A. Administration. It shall be the duty of the Zoning Officer or his designee
to administer and enforce the provisions of this chapter in accordance
with its literal terms. Should the said Zoning Officer or his designee be
in doubt as to the meaning or intent of any provisions of this chapter or
as to the location of any district boundary line on the Zoning Map or as
to the propriety of issuing a zoning and building permit in a particular
case related to the provision of this chapter, he shall appeal the matter
to the Zoning Hearing Board for interpretation and decision.
(1) Appointment and powers of Zoning Officer or his designee. For the
administration of this chapter, a Zoning Officer or his designee,
who shall not hold any elective office in the Borough, shall be
appointed. The Zoning Officer or his designee shall meet
qualifications established by the Borough and shall be able to
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Borough a working
knowledge of municipal zoning. The Zoning Officer or his designee
shall not have the power to permit any construction or any use or
change of use which does not conform to this chapter. The Zoning
Officer or his designee may be authorized to institute civil
enforcement proceedings as a means of enforcement when acting
within the scope of his employment.
(2) Powers and duties. If the Zoning Officer shall find that any of the
provisions of this chapter are being violated, he/she shall notify in
writing the person responsible for such violations, indicating the
nature of the violation, and ordering the action necessary to correct
it. Such action may include ordering the discontinuance of unlawful
use of land or structures, the removal of unlawful structures or
unlawful additions and alterations, the discontinuance of any
unlawful work being done, or such other action as is deemed
necessary to correct the violation. The Zoning Officer shall, with
the approval of the Borough Council or when directed by it,
institute appropriate action or proceedings in the name of the
Borough to prevent, restrain, correct or abate the violation. All of
the enforcement, violations and penalty provisions of the State
Municipalities Planning Code, as amended, are hereby
incorporated into this chapter by reference. As of the adoption date
of this chapter, these provisions were primarily in Sections 616.1
and 617.2 of such Act (53 P.S. §§ 10616.1 and 10617.2). [Amended

A. In order to assure that certain land use proposals specified in Article IV
do not negatively impact the Borough as a result of the site layout, the
grant of a building permit is conditioned upon the approval of the site
plan by the Borough Planning Commission under the provisions of this
section. The procedure shall apply only when the use is a permitted one.
When the use is a special exception, the procedures of § 450-64 shall
apply.
(1) Procedure.
(a) The applicant shall submit four sets of the site plans to the
Zoning Officer or his designee when making application for the
building permit. The plan shall include the following
information:
[1] A statement as to the proposed use of the building or land.
§ 450-76 HELLERTOWN CODE § 450-78
1:710
[2] A site layout drawn to a scale of not less than one inch
equal 50 feet, showing the location, dimensions and height
of proposed buildings, structures or uses and any existing
buildings in relation to property and street lines. If the
application relates to property which is scheduled to be
developed in successive stages, such plans shall show the
relationship of the portion scheduled for initial
development to the proposed layout of the entire property.
[3] The location, dimensions and arrangements of all open
spaces and yards and buffer yards, including methods to
be employed for screening.
[4] The location, size, arrangement and capacity of all areas to
be used for motor vehicle access, off-street parking, offstreet
loading and unloading and provisions to be made for
lighting such areas.
[5] The dimensions, location and methods of illumination for
signs, if applicable.
[6] The location and dimensions of sidewalks and all other
areas to be devoted to pedestrian use.
[7] Provisions to be made for treatment and disposal of
sewage and industrial wastes, water supply and storm
drainage.
[8] The capacity and arrangement of all buildings used or
intended to be used for dwelling purposes, including the
proposed density.
[9] A description of any proposed industrial or commercial
operations in sufficient detail to indicate effects of these
operations in producing noise, glare, air pollution, water
pollution, fire hazards, traffic congestion or other safety
hazards.
[10] Description of methods to be employed in controlling any
excess noise, air pollution, smoke, fumes, water pollution,
fire hazards or other safety hazards.
[11] The bounds of any easements of record at the
Northampton County Recorder of Deeds Office.
[12] Any other data deemed necessary by the Zoning Officer or
his designee to enable him to determine the compliance of
the proposed development with the terms of this chapter.
(b) The Zoning Officer or his designee shall review the plans for
conformance to Borough zoning standards and submit the
comments as well as a set of the plans to the Borough Planning
§ 450-78 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 450-78
1:711
Commission and the Borough Engineer within 10 working
days.
(c) Within 40 days of the date of the regular meeting of the
Planning Commission next following the date the application is
submitted, the Planning Commission shall approve or
disapprove the plans at a public meeting based on the
considerations contained in Subsection A(2). [Amended
12-2-2013 by Ord. No. 783]
(d) If the Planning Commission fails to act within the required time
period, the plans shall be deemed approved.
(e) If the plans are disapproved, the reasons for such action shall
be written on a set of plans, which shall then be returned to the
applicant.
(f) The applicant may appeal an unfavorable decision to the Court
of Common Pleas of Northampton County.
(2) Site plan review criteria. The Planning Commission shall use the
following criteria in reviewing site plans:
(a) Preservation of natural features. Insofar as practicable, natural
features on the site shall be preserved.
(b) Building arrangement. Elements of the site plan shall be
harmoniously and efficiently organized in relation to existing
desirable trees, topography, views within and beyond the site,
the size and shape of the site, the character of adjoining
property and the size of the buildings.
(c) Access, parking and circulation. With respect to vehicular and
pedestrian circulation, special attention shall be given to
location and number of access points, on-site circulation,
separation of pedestrian and vehicular traffic, and
arrangement and location of parking areas. The need for
adequate signalization, channelization and other traffic control
measures shall be given consideration.
(d) Surface water drainage. Measures to ensure proper site
surface drainage shall be carefully considered. Stormwater
and surface water shall be conveyed and discharged in a
manner which shall not adversely affect neighboring
properties, the public storm drainage system or on-site
pedestrian and vehicular movement.
(e) Special features. Setbacks, buffer yard and other screening
methods shall be carefully considered to minimize the visual
effects of storage areas, service areas, truck loading areas,
utility structures and similar accessory structures.
§ 450-78 HELLERTOWN CODE § 450-78
1:712
§ 450-79. Nonconforming lots, structures and uses.
Within the districts established by this chapter or amendments that may
later be adopted there exist lots, structures and uses which would be
prohibited, regulated or restricted under the terms of this chapter or future
amendment. It is the intent of this chapter to permit these nonconformities
to continue until they are terminated. Any existing use which is permitted
by special exception in this chapter shall be deemed to be a "conforming
use" where it has met the standards and criteria of this chapter for that
special exception use.
B. However, and with respect to an application for a proposed permitted
use in the M Mixed, SC Shopping Center and I Industrial Districts, as
addressed in Article IV of this chapter, when the Zoning Officer or his
designee finds that such a proposal does not constitute a significant
departure from the previous use to which a parcel has been put, then
said Officer or his designee may waive the requirements of this section
and may require in their place the submission of a "sketch plan" for the
review and approval of the Zoning Officer or his designee, who, in turn,
shall refer said plan to the Hellertown Borough Planning Commission
for review and comment. Said sketch plan submission shall contain
those elements as may be stipulated by the Zoning Officer or his
designee from among those several elements as required for a site plan
pursuant to Subsection A(1) of this section. For these purposes, a
proposal shall be considered not to constitute a significant departure
from the previous use when said proposal:
(1) Does not entail any physical modifications to the "footprint" of any
existing structures and/or the construction of any new structures.
(2) Is not expected to generate additional traffic volumes and/or
significant changes to traffic patterns.
(3) Is not expected to affect negatively, in any manner, the general area
in which it is to be located.
(4) Will comply with all applicable terms of this chapter and all other
ordinances of the Borough and all pertinent state or federal
statutes.
A. Nonconforming uses. A nonconforming use shall be changed only to a
conforming use. A nonconforming use may not be changed to another
nonconforming use, except as provided in Subsection F. A
nonconforming use may be enlarged or extended only as a result of the
natural expansion of that use up to 50% of its existing floor area if all
proposed structures are in conformance with provisions of this chapter
and no conforming use is displaced. If a structure used by a
nonconforming use is accidentally and unintentionally damaged, it may
be restored or reconstructed and used as before, provided that the floor
area of such structure shall not exceed the floor area which existed
§ 450-78 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 450-79
1:713
prior to such damage and that it be completed within one year of such
happening.
B. Nonconforming structures. [Amended 4-16-2012 by Ord. No. 763]
(1) Provided, however, that the extension of a nonconforming structure
into side yards (as said side yards may be required pursuant to
provisions found elsewhere in this chapter) shall be permitted so
long as the proposed extension is so constructed so as to constitute
a continuation of the existing side building line, but in no
circumstances shall such an extension encroach any closer than
three feet to a side property line, and, additionally, that the total lot
coverage that may result from the inclusion of the proposed
extension together with the existing structure(s) shall not exceed
the maximum lot coverages as permitted elsewhere in this chapter.
(2) The extension of a nonconforming structure into setback areas
shall be permitted for any and all structures made nonconforming
due to a condemnation of private property, or when a preexisting
nonconforming structure is made more nonconforming due to a
condemnation of private property. Any nonconforming structure so
created or any nonconforming structure made more
nonconforming shall be permitted by right to extend into any front
yard, side yard, and/or rear yard setback to the depth of
encroachment created by the condemnation. The encroachment
into a setback area caused by a condemnation of private property
shall not be a violation of the Borough Zoning Ordinance. This
section applies immediately upon the date of taking.
C. Nonconforming lots. [Amended 4-16-2012 by Ord. No. 763]
(1) Any change made in the configuration of a nonconforming lot shall
be to bring such lot into conformance. A nonconforming lot may be
used for the erection of a dwelling within the standards of
§ 450-18C.
(2) The requirement that a change in the configuration of a
nonconforming lot shall be to bring such lot into conformance shall
not apply to any change made in the configuration of a
nonconforming lot if the change in configuration was caused by a
condemnation of private property. In that event, the configuration
of a nonconforming lot after condemnation shall be permitted as of
right immediately upon the date of taking.
D. Termination. A nonconforming use shall be deemed to have been
terminated and shall not thereafter be reinstated:
(1) When it is changed to a conforming use.
(2) When it has been discontinued for a period of 12 consecutive
months.

§ 450-80. Enforcement notice. [Added 9-17-2012 by Ord. No. 775]
E. Registration of nonconforming uses and structures. The Zoning Officer
or his designee shall, upon adoption of this chapter, identify and
register nonconforming uses and structures in the Borough as an aid to
the enforcement of this chapter. Upon identifying a nonconformity, the
Zoning Officer or his designee shall send notice to the owner of record
that a nonconformity exists on his property and with which provisions of
this chapter it does not conform. Failure by the Zoning Officer or his
designee to identify and register a nonconforming use or structure is
not to be construed as a recognition that a use or structure is in
conformance with this chapter.
F. Change of use. A lawfully existing nonconforming use may be changed
to another nonconforming use if, upon petition, the Zoning Hearing
Board shall have made a determination that such change will be
beneficial to the general neighborhood; and, further, provided that the
nonconforming use to which it is changed is of the same or more
restricted classification which is more appropriate to the neighborhood
in which it is situated than the original nonconforming use.
A. If it appears to the Borough that a violation of any zoning ordinance
enacted under this chapter or prior enabling laws has occurred, the
Borough shall initiate enforcement proceedings by sending an
enforcement notice as provided in this section.
B. The enforcement notice shall be sent to the owner of record of the
parcel on which the violation has occurred, to any person who has filed
a written request to receive enforcement notices regarding that parcel,
and to any other person requested in writing by the owner of record.
C. An enforcement notice shall state at least the following:
(1) The name of the owner of record and any other person against
whom the Borough intends to take action.
(2) The location of the property in violation.
(3) The specific violation with a description of the requirements which
have not been met, citing in each instance the applicable provisions
of this chapter.
(4) The date before which the steps for compliance must be
commenced and the date before which the steps must be
completed.
(5) That the recipient of the notice has the right to appeal to the
Zoning Hearing Board within a prescribed period of time in
accordance with procedures set forth in this chapter. The recipient
shall file an appeal within 30 days of receipt of the enforcement
notice. [Amended 10-16-2017 by Ord. No. 820]

§ 450-81. Causes of action. [Amended 9-17-2012 by Ord. No. 775]
In the case any building, structure, landscaping or land is, or is proposed to
be, erected, constructed, reconstructed, altered, converted, maintained or
used in violation of this chapter, the Borough Council or, with the approval
of the Borough Council, an officer of the Borough, or any aggrieved owner
or tenant of real property who shows that his property or person will be
substantially affected by the alleged violation, in addition to other remedies,
may institute any appropriate action or proceeding to prevent, restrain,
correct or abate such building, structure, landscaping or land, or to prevent,
in or about such premises, any act, conduct, business or use constituting
a violation. When any such action is instituted by a landowner or tenant,
notice of that action shall be served upon the Borough at least 30 days prior
to the time the action is begun by serving a copy of the complaint on the
Borough Council of the Borough. No such action may be maintained until
such notice has been given.
§ 450-82. Enforcement remedies. [Amended 7-2-2007 by Ord. No.
706; 9-17-2012 by Ord. No. 775]
(6) That failure to comply with the notice within the time specified,
unless extended by appeal to the Zoning Hearing Board,
constitutes a violation, with possible sanctions clearly described.
D. In any appeal of an enforcement notice to the Zoning Hearing Board,
the Borough shall have the responsibility of presenting its evidence
first.
E. Any filing fees paid by a party to appeal an enforcement notice to the
Zoning Hearing Board shall be returned to the appealing party by the
Borough if the Zoning Hearing Board or any court in a subsequent
appeal rules in the appealing party's favor.
A. Any person, partnership or corporation who or which has violated or
permitted the violation of any zoning ordinance enacted under this
chapter shall, upon being found liable therefor in a civil enforcement
proceeding commenced by the Borough, pay a judgment of not more
than $500 plus all court costs, including reasonable attorney's fees
incurred by the Borough as a result thereof. No judgment shall
commence or be imposed, levied or payable until the date of the
determination of a violation by the Magisterial District Judge. If the
defendant neither pays nor timely appeals the judgment, the Borough
may enforce the judgment pursuant to the applicable rules of civil
procedure. Each day that a violation continues shall constitute a
separate violation, unless the Magisterial District Judge determining
that there has been a violation further determines that there was a good
faith basis for the person, partnership or corporation violating the
ordinance to have believed that there was no such violation, in which
event there shall be deemed to have been only one such violation until
the fifth day following the date of the determination of a violation by the
§ 450-80 HELLERTOWN CODE § 450-82
1:716
Magisterial District Judge, and thereafter each day that a violation
continues shall constitute a separate violation. All judgments, costs
and reasonable attorney's fees collected for that violation of a zoning
ordinance shall be paid over to the Borough whose ordinance has been
violated.
B. The Court of Common Pleas, upon petition, may grant an order of stay,
upon cause shown, tolling the per-diem fine pending a final adjudication
of the violation and judgment.
C. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed or interpreted to
grant to any person or entity other than the Borough the right to
commence any action for enforcement pursuant to this section.
D. Violations and penalties.
(1) Any person, partnership or corporation who or which has violated
or permitted the violation of the provisions of this chapter shall,
upon being found liable therefor in a civil enforcement proceeding
commenced by the Borough, pay a judgment of not more than $500
plus all court costs, including the reasonable attorney's fees
incurred by the Borough as a result thereof. No judgment shall
commence or be imposed, levied or be payable until the date of the
determination of a violation by the Magisterial District Judge. If the
defendant neither pays nor timely appeals the judgment, the
Borough may enforce the judgment pursuant to the applicable
rules of civil procedure. Each day that a violation continues shall
constitute a separate violation, unless a Magisterial District Judge
determining that there has been a violation further determines that
there was a good faith basis for the person, partnership or
corporation violating this chapter to have believed that there was
no such violation, in which event there shall be deemed to have
been only one such violation until the fifth day following the date of
the determination of a violation by the Magisterial District Judge,
and thereafter each day that a violation continues shall constitute a
separate violation. All judgments, costs and reasonable attorney's
fees collected for the violation of this chapter shall be paid over to
the Borough. Imprisonment shall not be authorized by this chapter.
[Amended 3-21-2011 by Ord. No. 757]

Hellertown shall revoke the zoning permit required upon
conviction of any unlawful activities.
(4) In the event of any unlawful activities conducted by or in the name
of a corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, firm or
association, in addition to entity liability, the officers, agents or

petition, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission shall, after a public
hearing, decide that the present or proposed situation of the building in
question is reasonably necessary for the convenience or welfare of the

Commission to ensure that both the corporation and the municipality in

hearing and are granted an opportunity to appear, present witnesses, crossexamine
witnesses presented by other parties and otherwise exercise the
rights of a party to the proceedings.

part hereof, together with copies of all amendments hereof, together with
copies amendments hereto, shall be filed in the Borough Secretary's office
and in the Zoning Officer's or his designee's office and shall be open to
