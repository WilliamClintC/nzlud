Chapters. Chapters are numbered sequentially in Arabic throughout this Code.
Parts. Parts are numbered sequentially in Arabic throughout this Code.
Whenever other divisions are necessary, chapters shall be divided into subchapters, parts into
subparts and designated with the chapter or part number followed by a capital letter. For instance,

[Ord. 585, 9/12/2011]

part or section between existing chapters, parts or sections, the new chapter, part or section shall
be designated by the addition of a capital letter suffix or point number to the preceding chapter,
part or section number. Thus, a chapter introduced between Chapters 5 and 6 would be Chapter
5A, and sections in that chapter would be numbered, for instance, "§ 5A-101." If it becomes
necessary to introduce a part between existing Parts 5 and 6, the new part would be Part 5A, and
sections in that part would be numbered, for instance, "§ 5-5A01." A new section introduced
between existing §§ 5-105 and 5-106 would be "§ 5-105.1." When a number of new parts or
sections have been introduced, the chapter or part shall be renumbered.
If it becomes necessary to introduce a subsection between subsections, for instance, Subsections
5 and 6, the new subsection would be numbered Subsection 5.1.
If it becomes necessary to introduce a unit smaller than a subsection between existing units, the
entire subsection shall be revised and renumbered.
Vacated Numbers. Whenever a number is vacated by a revocation or repeal, the remaining
elements in the overall unit shall retain their old numbers until the overall unit is completely
revised. Prior to revision, the vacated number may be marked: "(Reserved)."

unlawful act.
Any building or structure has been constructed, exists or is maintained in violation of any
specific requirement or prohibition applicable to such building or structure provided by the
approved building or fire code of the jurisdiction, or of any law or ordinance to such an
extent as to present either a substantial risk of fire, building collapse or any other threat
to life and safety.
A building or structure, used or intended to be used for dwelling purposes, because of
inadequate maintenance, dilapidation, decay, damage, faulty construction or
arrangement, inadequate light, ventilation, mechanical or plumbing system, or otherwise,
is determined by the Code Official to be unsanitary, unfit for human habitation or in such
a condition that is likely to cause sickness or disease.
Any building or structure, because of a lack of sufficient or proper fire resistance-rated
construction, fire protection systems, electrical system, fuel connections, mechanical
system, plumbing system or other cause, is determined by the Code Official to be a
threat to life or health.
Any portion of a building remains on a site after the demolition or destruction of the
building or structure or whenever any building or structure is abandoned so as to
constitute such building or portion thereof as an attractive nuisance or hazard to the
public.

occupancy, and is not in danger of structural collapse, the Code Official is authorized to post a
placard of condemnation on the premises and order the structure closed up so as not to be an

welfare of its citizens, to establish rights and obligations of owners and occupants relating to
the rental of certain dwelling units in the Home Rule Borough of Edinboro and to encourage
owners and occupants to maintain and improve the quality of rental housing within the
community. It is also the policy of the Borough that owners, managers and occupants share
responsibilities to obey the various codes adopted to protect and promote public health,
safety and welfare. As means to those ends, this Subpart provides for a system of
inspections; issuance and renewal of rental license; and sets penalties for violations. This
Subpart shall be liberally construed and applied to promote its purposes and policies.
In considering the adoption of this Subpart, the Council of the Home Rule Borough of
Edinboro makes the following findings:
There is a greater incidence of violations of various codes of the Borough at residential
properties where owners do not reside in the Borough and rent such property to three or
more unrelated individuals than at owner-occupied residential properties or familyoccupied
residential rental properties.
There is a greater incidence of problems with the maintenance and upkeep of residential
properties where owners do not reside in the Borough and rent such property to three or
more unrelated individuals than at owner-occupied residential properties or familyoccupied
residential rental properties.
There is a greater incidence of disturbances which adversely affect the peace and quiet
of the neighborhood at residential properties where owners rent to three or more
unrelated individuals than at owner-occupied residential properties or family-occupied
residential rental properties.

Part 4. CURFEW
§ 6-401. Legislative Findings and Intent.
[Ord. 565, 11/24/2008, § 6.5.01]
Violence in our community committed by and against minors is a cause of great concern for the
immediate health, safety and general welfare of our citizens. The Borough highly values the
health, safety and general welfare of our minors and has a vested interest in preserving and
nurturing them as a valuable asset and investment in Edinboro's future. Persons under the age of
16 are vulnerable to be pressured to participate in violent unlawful activities and to be victims of
perpetrators of violent crimes due to their general lack of maturity and experience. Minors who are
present in public places during the late night and early morning hours are particularly vulnerable to
being victimized and abused. The Borough needs effective tools available to protect minors from
the dangers that exist in the late night and early morning hours at public places.

2. The Council for the Home Rule Borough of Edinboro, recognizing the problem of crimes
committed by and committed against minors during the late night and early morning hours and
believing that it can be dealt with more effectively by regulating the hours during which minors may
remain in public places and certain establishments without adult supervision, and by defining more
clearly certain duties and responsibilities upon those who have custody and responsibility for the
care of such minors, hereby enacts this Part with the intent of promoting the general welfare and
protecting the general public through the reduction of juvenile violence and crime within the Home
Rule Borough of Edinboro, promoting the safety and welfare of the Borough's minors whose youth
and inexperience renders them particularly vulnerable to becoming participants in criminal activity
and victims of perpetrators of crime, and fostering and strengthening parental responsibility for
children.

No insurance company, association or exchange (hereinafter "insuring agent") doing business in the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, shall pay a claim of a named insured for fire damage to a structure
located within the Home Rule Borough of Edinboro (hereinafter the "Borough") where the amount
recoverable for the fire loss to the structure under all policies exceeds $7,500, unless an insuring agent
is furnished by the Borough Treasurer with a municipal certificate or verbal notification pursuant to
§ 508(b) of Act 98 of 1992 and unless there is compliance with § 508(c) and (d) of Act 98 of 1992 and

less than the amount calculated under the foregoing transfer formula the insuring agent shall
transfer to the Borough from the insurance proceeds the amount specified in the estimate.

After the transfer, the named insured may submit a contractor's signed estimate of the costs

engineering, legal or administrative costs incurred by the Borough in connection with
such removal, repair or securing of the building or any proceeds related thereto.

Borough with the name and address of the named insured. Upon receipt of the
transferred funds and the name and address of the named insured, the designated officer
shall contact the named insured, certify that the proceeds have been received by the

followed.
When repairs, removal or securing of the building or other structure have been completed
in accordance with all applicable regulations and orders of the Borough and the required
proof of such completion received by the designated officer, and if the Borough has not
incurred any costs for repairs, removal or securing, the fund shall be returned to the
named insured. If the Borough has incurred costs for repairs, removal or securing of the

remain, the Borough shall transfer the remaining funds to the named insured.
To the extent that interest is earned on proceeds held by the Borough pursuant to this

Borough. To the extent that proceeds are returned to the named insured, interest earned
on such proceeds shall be distributed to the named insured at the time that the proceeds
are returned.
Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the ability of the Borough to recover any
deficiency. Furthermore, nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the Borough and
the named insured if some other reasonable disposition of the damaged property has been
negotiated.

citizenry. Therefore, the Borough Council of the Borough of Edinboro does hereby order as follows.
Editor's Note: This ordinance also superseded former Ch. 8, Floodplains, adopted 9/12/2011 by Ord.
585.
Editor's Note: See 32 P.S. § 679.101 et seq.
Part 2. GENERAL PROVISIONS

Promote the general health, welfare, and safety of the community.
Encourage the utilization of appropriate construction practices in order to prevent or minimize
flood damage in the future.
Minimize danger to public health by protecting water supply and natural drainage.
Reduce financial burdens imposed on the community, its governmental units, and its
residents, by preventing excessive development in areas subject to flooding.
Comply with federal and state floodplain management requirements.

[Ord. 593, 2/10/2014]
It shall be unlawful for any person, partnership, business or corporation to undertake, or cause to
be undertaken, any construction or development anywhere within the Borough of Edinboro unless
a permit has been obtained from the floodplain administrator.
A permit shall not be required for minor repairs to existing buildings or structures.
§ 8-203. Abrogation and Greater Restrictions.
[Ord. 593, 2/10/2014]
This chapter supersedes any other conflicting provisions which may be in effect in identified floodplain
areas. However, any other ordinance provisions shall remain in full force and effect to the extent that

identified floodplain areas or that land uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding
or flood damages.
This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the Borough of Edinboro or any officer or
employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any
administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.

§ 8-308. Placards.
[Ord. 593, 2/10/2014]
In addition to the permit, the floodplain administrator shall issue a placard, which shall be displayed on
the premises during the time construction is in progress. This placard shall show the number of the

§ 8-309. Start of Construction.
[Ord. 593, 2/10/2014]
Work on the proposed construction or development shall begin within 180 days after the date of
issuance of the development permit. Work shall also be completed within 12 months after the date
of issuance of the permit, or the permit shall expire, unless a time extension is granted, in writing,
by the floodplain administrator. The issuance of a development permit does not refer to the zoning
approval.
The "actual start of construction" means either the first placement of permanent construction of a
structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction
of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured
home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor
does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of
temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such
as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the "actual start of construction" means the first alteration of any wall,
ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external
dimensions of the building.
Time extensions shall be granted only if a written request is submitted by the applicant, who sets
forth sufficient and reasonable cause for the floodplain administrator to approve such a request,
and the original permit is compliant with the ordinance and FIRM/FIS in effect at the time the
extension is granted.

determines that there are reasonable grounds to believe that there has been a violation of any
provisions of this chapter, or of any regulations adopted pursuant thereto, the floodplain
administrator shall give notice of such alleged violation as hereinafter provided. Such notice shall:
Be in writing;
Include a statement of the reasons for its issuance;
Allow a reasonable time, not to exceed a period of 30 days, for the performance of any act it
requires;
Be served upon the property owner or his agent, as the case may require; provided, however,
that such notice or order shall be deemed to have been properly served upon such owner or
agent when a copy thereof has been served with such notice by any other method authorized
or required by the laws of this state;

[Ord. 593, 2/10/2014]
The identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific areas:
The Floodway Area shall be those areas identified in the FIS and the FIRM as floodway and
which represent the channel of a watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be
reserved in order to discharge the base flood without increasing the water surface elevation
by more than one foot at any point. This term shall also include floodway areas which have
been identified in other available studies or sources of information for those special flood
hazard areas where no floodway has been identified in the FIS and FIRM.
Within any Floodway Area, no encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, or other development, shall be permitted unless it has been demonstrated
through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis performed in accordance with standard
engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in
flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
Within any Floodway Area, no new construction or development shall be allowed, unless
the appropriate permit is obtained from the Department of Environmental Protection's
regional office.
The AE Area/District shall be those areas identified as an AE Zone on the FIRM included in
the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base flood elevations have been provided.
The AE Area adjacent to the floodway shall be those areas identified as an AE Zone on
the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base flood elevations have
been provided and a floodway has been delineated.
The AE Area without floodway shall be those areas identified as an AE Zone on the
FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base flood elevations have been
provided but no floodway has been determined.
No permit shall be granted for any construction, development, use, or activity within
any AE Area/District without floodway unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative
effect of the proposed development would not, together with all other existing and
anticipated development, increase the BFE more than one foot at any point.
No new construction or development shall be located within the area measured 50
feet landward from the top-of-bank of any watercourse, unless the appropriate permit
is obtained from the Department of Environmental Protection's regional office.
The A Area/District shall be those areas identified as an A Zone on the FIRM included in the
FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no base flood elevations have been provided. For these
areas, elevation and floodway information from other federal, state, or other acceptable
sources shall be used when available. Where other acceptable information is not available,
the base flood elevation shall be determined by using the elevation of a point on the boundary
of the identified floodplain area which is nearest the construction site.
§ 8-403. Changes in Identification of Area.
[Ord. 593, 2/10/2014]
The identified floodplain area may be revised or modified by the Borough Council where studies or
information provided by a qualified agency or person documents the need for such revision. However,
prior to any such change, approval must be obtained from FEMA. Additionally, as soon as practicable,
but not later than six months after the date such information becomes available, a community shall
notify FEMA of the changes by submitting technical or scientific data. See § 8-501, Subsection 2, for
situations where FEMA notification is required.

floodplain administrator may be appealed to the Edinboro Zoning Hearing Board. The burden of proof
shall be on the appellant to prove the determination is incorrect.
Part 5. TECHNICAL PROVISIONS
§ 8-501. General Requirements.
[Ord. 593, 2/10/2014]
Alteration or Relocation of Watercourse.
No encroachment, alteration, or improvement of any kind shall be made to any watercourse
until all adjacent municipalities which may be affected by such action have been notified by
the municipality and until all required permits or approvals have been first obtained from the
Department of Environmental Protection's regional office.
No encroachment, alteration, or improvement of any kind shall be made to any watercourse
unless it can be shown that the activity will not reduce or impede the flood-carrying capacity of
the watercourse in any way.
In addition, FEMA and the Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic
Development shall be notified prior to any alteration or relocation of any watercourse.
When a community proposes to permit the following encroachments: any development that
causes a rise in the base flood elevations within the floodway; or any development occurring in
Zones A1-30 and Zone AE without a designated floodway which will cause a rise of more than one
foot in the base flood elevation; or alteration or relocation of a stream (including, but not limited to,
installing culverts and bridges), the applicant shall (as per 44 CFR Part 65.12):
Apply to FEMA for conditional approval of such action prior to permitting the encroachments
to occur.
Upon receipt of the Administrator's conditional approval of map change and prior to approving
the proposed encroachments, a community shall provide evidence to FEMA of the adoption of
floodplain management ordinances incorporating the increased base flood elevations and/or
revised floodway reflecting the post-project condition.
Upon completion of the proposed encroachments, a community shall provide as-built
certifications. FEMA will initiate a final map revision upon receipt of such certifications in
accordance with 44 CFR Part 67.
Any new construction, development, uses or activities allowed within any identified floodplain area
shall be undertaken in strict compliance with the provisions contained in this chapter and any other
applicable codes, ordinances and regulations.

Part 3. CLOSE OUT SALES
§ 13-301. Factual Background.
[Ord. 540, 10/23/2006, § 1]
Sales to be licensed and regulated pursuant to the provisions of this Part have often been
conducted and advertised in such a manner as to mislead and defraud the public and otherwise to
result in harm to the public interest.
Such fraud and imposition on the public has included, by way of partial enumeration only, the
misrepresentation of the condition or necessity which is the occasion of such sale; the
misrepresentation of the identity of the person conducting such sale and/or the name and style in
which such sale is to be conducted; the misrepresentation that the goods offered at such sale are
selling at sacrifice prices; the misrepresentation that the operator of the sale is selling
merchandise on hand at the time when the necessity, which is the occasion of such sale, arose,
when in fact he is replenishing his stock with additional merchandise both prior to the
8/12/2020 Borough of Edinboro, PA Ecode360
https://ecode360.com/print/ED2326?guid=ED2326&children=true 138/492
commencement and during the conduct of such sale so as to keep foisting upon the public such
added merchandise as though it were part of the original stock; and, the excessive valuation and
misrepresentation of the quality, former price and ownership of the goods to be sold at such sale;
in order to prevent such fraud and imposition, the public interest requires the regulation of such
sales and the duration and conduct thereof; that the public interest therefore requires that no such
sale should be conducted without a license or otherwise than in accordance with this Part.
§ 13-302. Unlawful Advertisement.
[Ord. 540, 10/23/2006, § 2]
It shall be unlawful for any person in municipalities or townships of this commonwealth to advertise or
hold out by any means that the sale of any goods, wares or merchandise is a "closing out sale," a "sale
of goods damaged by fire, smoke or water," or a "defunct business sale," unless a license is first
obtained to conduct such a sale from the Treasurer of the City or the Secretary of the Borough or the
Secretary of the Board of Commissioners or Board of Supervisors of the Township in which such sale
is to be held.

pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases where the imposition of mass limitations
is appropriate. In such cases, the report required by Subsection 1 of this section shall indicate the
mass of pollutants regulated by pretreatment standards in the effluent of the user. These reports
shall contain in the results of sampling and analysis of the discharge, including the flow and the
nature and concentration, or production and mass where requested by the Superintendent, or
pollutants contained therein which are limited by the applicable pretreatment standards. The
frequency of monitoring shall be prescribed in the applicable pretreatment standard. All analysis
shall be performed in accordance with procedures established by the Superintendent pursuant to
the latest edition of "Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater," published
by the American Public Health Association or such alternate methods approved by the Borough
and which comply with state and federal law. Sampling methods, location, times, durations and
frequencies are to be determined on an individual basis subject to approval by the Borough. The
discharger shall have the option to use, at his own expense, more complete sampling methods,
locations, times, durations and frequencies than specified by the Borough.

Measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of the wastewater required by this Part
shall be performed by a qualified laboratory. When such analyses are required of a user, the user
shall make arrangements with any qualified laboratory, including that of the discharger, to perform
such analyses.
Monitoring of wastewater characteristics necessary for determination of compliance with
applicable pretreatment standards shall be conducted on the basis of the following schedule,
unless more frequent monitoring is required by authority other than this Part, or if the Borough, in
its judgment, determines that the characteristics of the specific discharger warrant a different
frequency monitoring. The Borough will outline the different frequency of monitoring in each
individual permit.
Average Actual Daily User Discharge Minimum Monitoring Frequency
Less than 1,000 gpd Semi-annual
1,000 to 10,000 gpd Quarterly
More than 10,000 gpd Monthly
Monitoring of wastewater characteristics for any purpose other than the determination of
compliance with pretreatment standards shall be conducted on a frequency deemed necessary by
the Borough.
Upon demonstration by any user that the characteristics of the wastewater contribution by that
user are consistent, the Borough may reduce the frequency, Subsection 2 above, except in no
case shall the frequency of monitoring be less than semiannual for the determination of
compliance with pretreatment standards.
In evaluating a wastewater contribution, the Borough shall consider discharge characteristic
factors such as continuous or batch operation, seasonal operation and other information provided
by the discharger. The Borough may obtain wastewater samples as required to verify the
consistency of discharge characteristics.
Fees for any given measurement, test or analysis of wastewater required by this Part and
performed by the Borough at the request of the user shall reflect direct cost of such testing. Costs
of analyses performed by an independent laboratory at the option of the user shall be borne
directly by the user.
§ 18-266. Monitoring Facilities.
[Ord. 468, 5/20/1996]
The Borough shall require to be provided and operated at the user's own expense, monitoring
facilities to allow inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of the building sewer and/or internal
drainage systems. The monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user's premises, but
the Borough may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the
user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area and located so that it
will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles. There shall be ample room in or near
such sampling manhole or facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for
analysis. The facility, sampling and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe
and proper operating condition at the expense of the user. Whether constructed on public or
private property, the sampling and monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the
Borough's requirements and all applicable local construction standards and specification.
Construction shall be completed within 90 days following written notification by the Borough.

The Borough shall consider such factors as volume and strength of discharge, rate of discharge,
quantities of toxic materials in the discharge, wastewater treatment facility removal capabilities
and cost effectiveness in determining whether or not access and equipment for monitoring
wastewater shall be required.
Where the Borough determines access and equipment for monitoring or measuring wastewater is
not practicable, reliable or cost effective, the Borough may specify alternative methods of
determining the characteristics of the wastewater discharge which will, in the Borough's judgment,
provide an equitable measurement of such characteristics.
§ 18-267. Inspection and Sampling.
[Ord. 468, 5/20/1996; as amended by Ord. 545, 2/26/2007, § 18-191; and by Ord. 585, 9/12/2011]
The Borough shall inspect the facilities of any user to ascertain whether the purpose of this Part is
being met and all requirements are being complied with. Persons or occupants of premises where
wastewater is created or discharged shall allow the Borough or their representative ready access at all
times to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination or in
the performance of any of their duties. The Borough, PA DEP and EPA shall have the right to set up on
the user's property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling inspection, compliance
monitoring and/or metering operations. Where a user has security measures in force which would
require proper identification and clearance before entry into their premises, the user shall make
necessary arrangements with their security guards so that upon presentation of suitable identification,
personnel from the Borough, PA DEP and EPA will be permitted to enter, without delay, for the
purposes of performing their specific responsibilities.
§ 18-268. Cost of Damage.
[Ord. 468, 5/20/1996]
If the drainage or discharge from any establishment causes a deposit, obstruction, or damage to any of
the Borough's wastewater facilities, the Borough shall cause the deposit or obstruction to be promptly
removed or cause the damage to be promptly repaired. The cost for such work, including materials,
labor and supervision, shall be borne by the person causing such deposit, obstruction or damage.
§ 18-269. Revocation of Permit.

The Borough may suspend the wastewater treatment service and/or a wastewater contribution
permit (WWCP) when such suspension is necessary, in the opinion of the Borough, in order to
stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent or substantial
endangerment to the health or welfare of persons, to the environment, causes interference to the
Borough WWCT or causes the Borough WWCT to violate any condition of its NPDES permit.
Any person notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment service and/or the wastewater
contribution permit (WWCP) shall immediately stop or eliminate the contribution. In the event of a
failure of the person to comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the Borough shall take such
steps as deemed necessary including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or
minimize damage to the Borough system or endangerment to any individuals. The Borough shall
reinstate the wastewater contribution permit (WWCP) and/or the wastewater treatment service
upon proof of the elimination of the noncomplying discharge. A detailed written statement
submitted by the user describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence shall be submitted to the Borough within 15 days of the date of
occurrence.
H.. Pretreatment.
§ 18-271. Wastewater With Special Characteristics.
[Ord. 468, 5/20/1996]
While the Borough does initially rely upon the Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards of
§ 18-254 to protect wastewater facilities or receiving waters, if any wastewater which contains
substances or possesses characteristics shown to have harmful effect upon the wastewater
facilities, processes, equipment or receiving waters, or constitutes a public nuisance or hazard, is
discharged or is proposed for discharge to the wastewater sewers, the Borough may:
Require pretreatment to a condition acceptable for discharge to the wastewater sewers.
Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge.
Require payment to cover added cost of handling and treating the wastewaters not covered
by existing fees or charges.
Require the development of compliance schedules to meet any applicable pretreatment
requirements.
Require the submission of reports necessary to assure compliance with applicable
pretreatment requirements.
Carry out all inspection, surveillance and monitoring necessary to determine compliance with
applicable pretreatment requirements.
Obtain remedies for noncompliance by any user. Such remedies may include injunctive relief,
the civil penalties, penalties specified in Part 2A or appropriate criminal penalties.
Reject the wastewater, if scientific evidence discloses that discharge will create unreasonable
hazards or have unreasonable deleterious effects on the wastewater facilities.
When considering the above alternatives, the Borough shall assure that conditions of the
Borough's NPDES permit(s) are met. The Borough shall also take into consideration cost
effectiveness and the economic impact of the alternatives on the discharger. If the Borough allows
the pretreatment or equalization of wastewater flows, the installation of the necessary facilities

shall be subject to review. The Borough shall review and recommend any appropriate changes to
the program, within 60 days of submittal.
Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the Borough shall be
provided, operated and maintained at the user's expense.
§ 18-272. Compliance With Pretreatment Requirements.
[Ord. 468, 5/20/1996; as amended by Ord. 545, 2/26/2007, § 18-199.2]
Persons required to pretreat wastewater in accordance with § 18-271 above shall provide a
statement, reviewed by an authorized representative of the user and certified to by a qualified
person indicating whether applicable pretreatment requirements are being met on a consistent
basis and, if not, describing the additional operation and maintenance or additional pretreatment
required for the user to meet the pretreatment requirements. Detailed plans showing the
pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the Borough for review, and
shall be acceptable to the Borough before construction of the facility. The review of such plans and
operating procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the facility
as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to the Borough under the provisions of this Part.
Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported to
and be acceptable to the Borough prior to the user's initiation of the changes. If additional
pretreatment or operation and maintenance will be required to meet the pretreatment
requirements, the user shall submit a plan (including schedules) to the Borough. The plan
(including schedules) shall be consistent with applicable conditions of the Borough's NPDES
permit(s) or other state or federal laws.
The Borough shall annually publish in the local paper a list of the users which were not in
compliance with any pretreatment requirements or standards at least once during the 12 previous
months. The notification shall also summarize any enforcement actions taken against the user(s)
during the same 12 months.
All records relating to compliance with pretreatment standards shall be made available to officials
of the EPA or the Borough upon request.
§ 18-273. Monitoring Requirements.
[Ord. 468, 5/20/1996]
Discharges of wastewater to the Borough's wastewater facilities from the facilities utilizing pretreatment
facilities shall be monitored in accordance with the provisions of §§ 18-265 and 18-266 of this Part.

expense.
§ 18-274. Sampling and Analysis.
[Ord. 468, 5/20/1996; as added by Ord. 545, 2/26/2007, § 18-199.4]
Sampling shall be performed so that a representative portion of the wastewater is obtained for
analysis.
All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of waters and wastes required in any
section of this Part shall be carried out in accordance with standard methods, by a laboratory
certified to perform the analyses. Such samples shall be taken at the approved monitoring stations
described in §§ 18-265 and 18-266, if such a station exists. If an approved monitoring station is
not required, then samples shall be taken from another location on the industrial sewer lateral

before discharge to the public sewer. Unless specifically requested otherwise, or unless
specifically not allowed in federal regulation, samples shall be gathered as flow proportioned
(where feasible) composite samples made up of individual samples taken not less than once per
hour for the period of time equal to the duration of industrial wastewater discharge during daily
operations (including any cleanup shift). All equipment used for sampling and analysis must be
routinely calibrated and inspected and maintained to ensure its accuracy.
§ 18-275. Sample Splitting.
[Ord. 468, 5/20/1996; as added by Ord. 545, 2/26/2007, § 18-199.5]
When so requested in advance by an industrial user, and when taking a sample of industrial
wastewater, the Borough representative(s) shall gather sufficient volume of sample so that the sample
can be split into two nearly equal volumes, each of size adequate for the anticipated analytical
protocols including any quality control (QC) procedures. One of the portions shall be given to the
representative of the industrial user whose wastewater was sampled, and the other portion shall be
retained by the Borough for its own analysis.
§ 18-276. Effect of Federal Law.
[Ord. 468, 5/20/1996]
In the event that the federal government promulgates a regulation for a given new or existing user in a
specific industrial subcategory that established pretreatment standards or establishes that such a user
is exempt from pretreatment standards, such federal regulations shall immediately supersede § 18-
271, Subsection 1, of this Part.
§ 18-277. Confidential Information.
[Ord. 468, 5/20/1996]
Information and data on a user obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit application, permits
and monitoring programs and from inspections shall be available to the public or other
governmental agency without restriction unless the user specifically requests and is able to
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Borough that the release of such information would divulge
information, processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets of the user.
When requested by the person furnishing a report, the portions of a report which might disclose
trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public but shall
be made available upon written request to government agencies for users related to this Part, the
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit, state disposal system permit/or
the pretreatment programs; provided, however, that such portions of a report shall be available for
use by the state or any state agency in judicial review or enforcement proceedings involving the
person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics will not be recognized as
confidential information.
Information accepted by the Borough as confidential, shall not be transmitted to any governmental
agency or to the general public by the Borough until and unless a ten-day notification is given to
the user.

A sewer service rental or charge is, and shall be, imposed upon all users of the wastewater
facilities.
The funds received by the Borough from collection of wastewater service charges shall be used
for the purpose of defraying the expenses of the Borough in the operation, maintenance, repair,
alteration, inspection, depreciation or other expense associated with the Borough wastewater
facilities and for such payments as the Borough may be required to make under any lease or
agreement it may enter into for said wastewater facilities with the Authority. In addition, necessary
expenditures to establish a reserve to provide a margin of safety of at least 15% over and above
the above enumerated purposes.
Each user which discharges pollutants that cause an increase in the cost of managing the effluent
or sludge from the wastewater facilities shall pay for such increased cost.
Charges and fees for the use of the wastewater facilities and services shall be based upon the use
of such system, or contractual obligations for a level of use in excess of current use.
Each user shall pay its proportioned share of operation and maintenance (including replacement)
and debt service costs of the public wastewater facilities and services based on the user's
proportionate contribution to the total wastewater loading.
§ 18-279. Determination of System Use.
[Ord. 468, 5/20/1996; as amended by Ord. 545, 2/26/2007, § 18-199.12; and by Ord. 585, 9/12/2011]
The use of the Borough's wastewater facilities shall be a bimonthly charge based upon the water
consumption of the property served as measured by the charges for water supplied for the then
current period. Charges for water will be computed at the rate established by or fixed in
accordance with the appropriate fees schedule.
Bulk sewer charges for Edinboro University will be established as per the current
Borough/University Sewer Service Agreement.
Bulk sewer charges for Washington Township (excluding those properties covered under the
2005 Sewer Service Agreement) will be established as per the 2007 Borough/Washington
Township Sewer Service Agreement or any applicable agreement which supersedes this
agreement.
Whenever the owner, occupant or user of any property subject to this Part shall deposit into the
sewer system of the Borough of Edinboro wastes having a biochemical oxygen demand in excess
of 250 parts per million, such property owner shall be subject to an increase of 4% above his
normal sewer rental rate for each increase of 10% of the biochemical oxygen demand above the
rate of 250 parts per million of such sewage so deposited. The measurement and determination of
such waste shall be made by the Superintendent of the sewage disposal plant under such rules
and regulations as Council may prescribe.
For a property which uses water, all or part of which is from a source or sources other than the
Borough water system, there shall be a sewer rental based separate from and in addition to any
sewer rental based on the consumption of water from the Borough's water system. Such separate
or additional sewer rental shall be measured by the quantity of water from the source or sources
other than the Borough's water system which is discharged into the Borough's sewers from said
property. The owner of such property shall install without cost to the Borough a meter or meters to
measure the quantity of water received from other than the Borough's water system and deposited
into the Borough's sewers. No meter shall be installed or used for such purpose without the
approval of the Superintendent of the WWCT; and the sewer rental based upon water received

from other than the Borough's water system shall be the same amount as is required to be paid by
the owner of the property receiving the same quantity of water from the Borough's water system. If
the owner of said property fails to install an approved meter or meters, the Council or the Borough
Manager shall make an estimate of the amount of water from sources other than the Borough's
water system which discharged into the Borough's sewers from the said property and the property
owner shall pay the applicable rate of sewer rental based upon such estimate.
All sewer rentals shall be due and payable as herein provided. They may be included in the same
bills and be collected at the same times and in the same manner as charges for water. Said
payments shall apply to all properties subject to the payment of sewer rents without regard to the
source of water used by them. The sewer rental imposed by this Part shall be payable every two
months.
All sewer rentals imposed and remaining shall comply with the current Borough Council approved
fee and/or rate schedule. All late charges and collection procedures shall be outlined in the current
Borough Council approved fee schedule.
No sewer rental is hereby imposed on properties outside the Borough of Edinboro from which
sewage and other liquid wastes are discharged into the sewers of the Borough, under any
agreement between the Borough and such property owners, or otherwise; nor upon any properties
within the Borough not accessible to sewer services from the Borough's facilities. All sewer
connections outside the Borough and discharged into the Borough system, shall be paid by a
mutual intermunicipal agreement (Borough/Township 2005 Sewer Service Agreement).
The Borough Manager is hereby charged with the duty of collecting all sewer rentals and is
authorized, with the approval of Council, to adopt such regulations with respect thereto as may in
his discretion seem fit and proper.
§ 18-280. Financial Management System.
[Ord. 468, 5/20/1996]
The Borough shall maintain an adequate financial management system that will accurately

so as to cause as little inconvenience as possible to public travel. In order to expedite the flow
of traffic or to abate a dirt or dust nuisance, the Manager may require the permittee to provide
toe boards or bins; and if the excavated area is muddy and causes inconveniences to
pedestrians, temporary wooden plank walks shall be installed by the permittee as directed by
the Manager. If the street is not wide enough to hold the excavated material without using part
of the adjacent sidewalk, the permittee shall keep a passageway at least 1/2 the sidewalk
width open along such sidewalk line.
Work authorized by a permit shall be performed between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 7:00
p.m., Monday through Saturday, unless the permittee obtains written consent from the
Manager to do the work at an earlier or later hour. Such permission shall be granted only in
case of an emergency or in the event the work authorized by the permit is to be performed in
traffic-congested areas.
In granting any permit, the Manager may attach such other conditions thereto as may be
reasonably necessary to prevent damage to public or private property or to prevent the
operation from being conducted in a manner hazardous to life or property or in a manner
likely to create a nuisance. Such conditions may include, but shall not be limited to:
Limitations on the period of the year in which the work may be performed.
Restrictions as to the size and type of equipment.
Designation of routes upon which materials may be transported.
The place and manner of disposal of excavated materials.
Requirements as to the laying of dust, the cleaning of streets, the prevention of noise and
other results offensive or injurious to the neighborhood, the general public or any portion
thereof.
Regulations as to the use of streets in the course of the work.
Backfilling and Restoring Opening.
All pavement cuts, openings and excavations shall be properly made, backfilled and
temporarily surfaced by the permittee according to Borough specifications.
The Manager must be notified by the permittee during the forty-eight-hour period preceding
beginning of backfilling of the date and approximate time at which back filling will be begun.
The work of final restoration, including both paving surface and paving base, shall be
performed directly by the Borough or under the strict supervision of the Manager.

If the Manager finds that paving surfaces adjacent to the street opening may be damaged
where trenches are made parallel to the street, or where a number of cross-trenches are laid
in close proximity to one another, or where the equipment used may cause such damage, he
may require a negotiated contribution from the permittee for the resurfacing in place of
patching of such street if the total area of the proposed patch or probably damaged area
exceeds 25% of the total pavement surfacing between curb faces or between concrete gutter
edges in any block. Such negotiations shall be carried on and contributions agreed upon prior
to issuance of a permit.
All grass or associated lawn areas which have been disturbed, shall be properly backfilled
and reseeded to the satisfaction of the Manager.
If any trees or shrubs have been damaged or uprooted, it shall be the responsibility of the
permittee to properly repair or replace those species under the supervision of the Manager.
After excavation is commenced, the work of making and backfilling the same shall be
prosecuted with due diligence.
The Manager shall make such inspections as he may deem necessary of all work authorized
by a permit. The Manager is empowered to provide a full-time inspector, if necessary, to
ensure compliance with the provisions of this Part.
The permittee shall notify the Manager upon completion of all work accomplished under the
provisions of the permit. A certificate of final inspection shall be issued by the Manager to
each permittee no sooner than one year after the permanent restoration of the excavation has
been made, provided the work authorized by the permit has been performed according to
Borough specifications. Prior to the issuance of a certificate, the Manager shall make a final
inspection of the restoration to determine whether Borough specifications have been adhered
to.
If any settlement in a restored area occurs within a period of one year from date of completion
of the permanent restoration, any expense incurred by the Borough in correcting such
settlement shall be paid by the permittee or recovered from his bond, unless the permittee
submits proof satisfactory to the Manager that the settlement was not due to defective
backfilling.
In no case shall any opening made by a permittee be considered in the charge or care of the
Borough or any of its officers or employees, and no officer or employee is authorized in any
way to take or assume any jurisdiction over any such opening, except in the exercise of the
police power, when it is necessary to protect life and property; provided, however, the
Borough shall assume charge when making the final restoration.

In the event a Borough road needs to be cut to gain access to the sanitary sewer main line the
following road cut specifications shall be observed:
Bonding.
Connection costs are primarily dependent on size/type of pipe and depth. For the normal
size water and sewer line (3/4 inch to six inches) the current cost is about $80/per linear
foot plus the cost of roadway pavement restoration. This cost can change from time to
time per the Borough of Edinboro fee schedule. If the excavation becomes more than
routine a review by the Borough Engineer will become necessary which could increase
the per foot restoration costs. The contractor will bear all engineering cost at 100%.
Pavement shall be saw cut for full pavement depth to the width of the trench plus 12
inches on each side.
The pavement shall be cut 18 inches beyond the trench limits on both sides to top of
base course.
Sewer and water lines shall be installed to the requirements of the Municipal
Authority of the Borough of Edinboro and the Edinboro Water Authority.
Excavated material may be reused as backfill if the material is a granular material
meeting PennDOT Publication 408 requirements for 2RC. Otherwise, dispose of off
site and replace with 2RC to subbase elevation.
Backfill shall be compacted in four-inch lifts or less when using a jumping-jack or
eight-inch lifts when using a backhoe tamper attachment to a minimum of 95% of the
maximum Standard Proctor Density.
The top six inches of the backfill (subbase) shall be 2A material meeting the
requirements of PennDOT Publication 408, § 350.
The subbase shall be compacted to 100% of the maximum Standard Proctor
Density.
The base course shall be four-inch BCBC or match the existing, whichever is
greater. The material and placement shall follow PennDOT Publication 408
requirements.
The surface course shall be two inch ID-2 wearing or match existing, whichever is
greater. The material and placement shall follow PennDOT Publication 408
requirements.
Joints between the pavement and patch shall be sealed using AC-20 material.
Pavement shall be maintained for a period of one year from restoration. Settling shall
be repaired to Borough's satisfaction.
Cuts in PennDOT rights-of-way are required to have a PennDOT highway occupancy
permit. Restoration to PennDOT standards if in conflict with the above.

to determine if the proposed development is in general accordance with this chapter. The
developer is encouraged to further discuss the proposal with PennDOT or utility companies as
may be appropriate. Meetings with the Erie County Department of Health and the Erie County
Department of Planning are also advisable. The Erie County Subdivision Guide shall also be taken
into consideration when any subdivision of land is proposed.
A sketch plan may be prepared and presented for review and discussion at the same time. Sketch
plans should generally include those items listed under Part 7, "Plan Requirements." The

consideration when any subdivision of land is proposed.
In cases where the subdivision fronts on an existing or proposed state highway or has proposed
streets entering on such highways, the developer shall submit the plans to the Pennsylvania
Department of Transportation (PennDOT) for review and permits(s) as required. All plots shall
note the requirements of § 420 of the Act of June 1, 1945, P.L. 1242, No. 428, the State Highway
Law, 36 P.S. § 670-420.

The Borough of Edinboro Code Enforcement Officer shall receive all preliminary plans. After
receipt, the Code Officer shall review said plans for completeness. The Borough may forward
plans to the Borough Engineer as part of the review process. The entire fee for such a review shall
be assessed to the developer in accordance with § 503 of the Municipalities Planning Code, 53
P.S. § 10503. Subdivisions which are not in substantial compliance with this chapter will be
returned to the developer as an incomplete submission. After such review, a copy of the plan will
be referred to the Borough of Edinboro Planning Commission and a copy referred to the Erie
County Department of Planning for review and recommendations.
Before acting on the preliminary plan, the Borough Council may arrange for a public hearing
thereon. Required public notice shall be given.
The Borough Council shall take final action on the preliminary plan no later than 90 days following
the date of the next regular meeting of the Borough Planning Commission following the date that
the application is filed with the Borough; provided, however, that should the next regular meeting
occur more than 30 days following the filing of the application, the ninety-day period shall then be
measured from the 30th day following the day the application was filed. The Borough Council shall
render its decision during a public meeting. The Borough Council may approve the plan,
disapprove the plan or approve the plan with certain conditions. If the Borough Council either
disapproves the plan or approves it conditionally, it shall cite the provisions of this chapter upon
which it has based such action. Within 15 days after its action, the Borough Council shall notify the
developer, in writing, of the action taken, and specifying what revisions or additions, if any, will be
required prior to the approval of the final plan. If the developer fails to accept the Council's
revisions or conditions, if any, set forth in its preliminary plan approval within 20 days from
notification, the approval shall be automatically rescinded.
Any revisions of the preliminary plan required, as a condition prerequisite to approval, will be
noted on two copies of the preliminary plan. One copy of the conditionally approved preliminary
plan will be returned to the developer and one copy will be retained by the Borough.
The purpose of the preliminary plan is to define, in detail, the design, construction standards, lot
layout, and related items for a subdivision. It is necessary that such matters be resolved prior to
the submission of the final plan. [See also § 508(4)(v) of the Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S.
§ 10508(4)(v).]
One reproducible original or permanent copy of the preliminary plan on stable plastic tracing film
will be required. Said copy is to show the preliminary plan as approved with all required changes.
§ 22-304. Final Plan Application.
[Ord. 474, 4/14/1997, § 304]
After the developer has received official notification that the preliminary plan has been approved or
conditionally approved and what changes, if any, must be made if the plan is to proceed to
consideration as a final plan and has accepted these conditions, the developer has two years in
which to submit a final plan. If the developer does not do so within the two-year period, the
approval of the preliminary plan shall become null and void unless an extension of time is
requested by the developer in writing and is granted, in writing, by the Borough before the
expiration date. [See also § 508(4)(v) of the Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. § 10508(4)(v).]
The information, certificate, and plans to be filed with the final plan application shall include those
items listed under Part 7, "Plan Requirements."
Assurance of the completion of improvements, where required, shall be submitted in accordance
with Part 5.

At least one copy of the final plan on stable plastic drafting film (permanent copies), along with 10
prints thereof and all other exhibits required for approval shall be filed with the Code Officer. The
final plan shall be filed one week prior to the Planning Commission meeting. A copy of typical
exhibits is found in the Appendix.
When an extension of time is granted for the submission of a final plan, the Borough shall do one
of two things when the final plan is submitted:
Make a finding that the conditions on which its approval of the preliminary plan were based
have not changed substantially.
Require changes in the plan, prior to final approval, that will reflect any substantial changes
on the site of the subdivision or in its surrounding, that have taken place since the grant of
preliminary approval.
It is not necessary for the whole plan that received preliminary approval to be submitted as a final
plan. The final plan may be submitted in sections, each covering a portion of the entire proposed
subdivision shown on the preliminary plan. In the case where development is projected over a
period of years, the Borough may authorize submission of final plats by section or stages of
development subject to such requirements or guarantees as to improvements in future sections or
stages of development as it finds essential for the protection of any finally approved section of the
development. [See also §§ 508(4)(v) and 508(4)(vi) of the Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S.
§ 10508(4)(v), (vi).]
The developer must provide sewerage and water system plans for the entire development site of
the preliminary plan regardless of the number of sections or stages to be initially developed. (See
also § 503.1 of the Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. § 10503.1.)
§ 22-305. Approval of Final Plan.
[Ord. 474, 4/14/1997, § 305]
The Code Enforcement Officer of the Borough of Edinboro shall receive all final plans. Plans must
be received at least one week prior to the Planning Commission meeting. After receipt, the Code
Officer shall review said plans for completeness and conformance to the preliminary plan and any
conditions relevant thereto. The Borough may forward plans to the Borough Engineer as part of
the review process. Any fee for such a review shall be assessed in accordance with § 503 of the
Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. § 10503. Submissions which are not in substantial
compliance with this chapter will be returned to the developer as incomplete submissions. After
such review, a copy of the plan will be sent to the Borough of Edinboro Planning Commission and
a copy referred to the Erie County Department of Planning for review/recommendations by these
bodies, respectively. The Erie County Department of Planning shall have 30 days in which to
complete its review. This time period shall commence on the date that an administratively
complete final plan (including any other exhibits required for approval) is submitted to the County.
The Erie County Subdivision Process Guide shall also be taken into consideration.
Before acting on the final plan, the Borough Council may arrange for a public hearing thereon.
Adequate public notice shall be given.
If after the reviews required by Subsection 1, the Borough Council finds that the final plan is in
conformance with this chapter, it shall sign the final plan. One copy of the final plan will be retained
for the Borough's records.
If the Borough Council finds that the final plan is not in conformance with this chapter, the plan
shall be disapproved. Council shall not sign the final plan, and shall notify the developer as to the
section(s) of this chapter that is not being complied with.

The developer may wish to seek a modification of certain regulations where, owing to special
conditions, a literal enforcement of this chapter would result in unnecessary hardship to the
developer. All requests for modification shall then be reviewed and considered by the Borough
Council in accordance with § 22-1407 of this chapter.
The Borough Council shall take final action on the final plan no later than 90 days following the
date of the next regular meeting of the Planning Commission following the date that the
application is filed with the Code Officer; provided, however, that should the next regular meeting
occur more than 30 days following the filing of the application, the ninety-day period shall then be
measured from the 30th day following the day the application was filed. The Borough Council shall
render its decision during a public meeting. The decision shall be communicated to the developer
in writing no later than 15 days following the date the decision was made. The formal date of
approval shall be deemed to be that date following approval by the Borough Council whereby the
developer provides satisfactory evidence that all conditions set forth by the Borough Council's
approval have been met. In no event shall that time extend beyond 120 days from the date of the
Borough Council's action.
No final plan shall receive approval by the Borough Council unless the developer shall have filed
with the Borough financial guarantees in accordance with § 509 of the Municipalities Planning
Code, 53 P.S. § 10509, in favor of the Borough or designated agency, or shall have completed all
required improvements listed in Part 9 or as the Borough may require in the public interest.
Upon completion of the improvements in accordance with the specifications of this chapter or
those of the Borough or designated agency, the developer shall take steps to dedicate the
improvements and have the same accepted by the Borough or designated agency.
§ 22-306. Recording of Plan.
[Ord. 474, 4/14/1997, § 306; as amended by Ord. 545, 2/26/2007, § 22-306]
After completion of all procedures and upon approval of the final plan, the plan shall then be
immediately recorded with the County Recorder of Deeds. In no case shall the final plan be
recorded after 90 days from the date of the final plan approval (see § 22-305, Subsection 6) or 90
days after the date of delivery of an approved plan signed by the Borough Council, following
completion of conditions imposed for such approval, whichever is later. Should the developer fail
to record the final plan within such a period, the approval shall be considered null and void in
accordance with § 513 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. § 10513.
Reapproval thereafter may be granted by the Borough Council, provided no changes have been
made to the final plan.
The final plan shall be recorded with the County Recorder of Deeds before proceeding with the
sale of lots, issuance of building permits or the construction of buildings. Proof of such recordation
shall be required by the Borough.
Recording the final plan after approval shall have the effect of an irrevocable offer to dedicate all
public streets and other public ways to public use, and to dedicate or reserve all park reservations,
and school sites and other public service areas as hereafter provided. Approval shall not impose
any duty upon the Borough concerning maintenance or improvement of any such dedicated
streets, parks, areas or portions of same until the proper authorities of the Borough shall have
made actual appropriation of the same by ordinance.

[Ord. 474, 4/14/1997, § 500.1]
The purpose of these regulations is to provide sound subdivision and land development standards for
the Borough of Edinboro.
§ 22-502. Improvements.
[Ord. 474, 4/14/1997, § 501]
The developer shall, for all major subdivisions, agree to complete all improvements in accordance
with these regulations or such other improvements as the Borough may require in the public
interest as a prerequisite to approval of the final plan. Such improvements include those which will
be dedicated to the Borough, an appropriate municipal authority or similar designated agency.

The Borough Council shall require the Borough Engineer to check final construction plans for their
correctness and to inspect the construction of improvements. The Borough Engineer will be used
for all improvements where the Borough is to assume ownership or be responsible for
maintenance. The entire cost of plan review and inspection will be borne by the developer in
accordance with the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code. [See generally §§ 503(1) and
510(g), 53 P.S. §§ 10503(1), 10510(g).] The review and inspection of improvements to be
dedicated to authorities or agencies where the Borough will not maintain same will be in
accordance with such organization's practices.
Upon completion of the improvements in accordance with the specifications of this chapter and
upon final inspection of the improvements by the Borough Engineer, the developer shall take the
final steps to dedicate the improvements and have the same accepted by the Borough. (See Part
12.) Improvements to be dedicated to authorities or agencies where the Borough will not maintain
same will be in accordance with such organization's practices.
Improvements may include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following:
Monuments or markers.
Grading, streets, curbs and walks, as required.
Sanitary sewers.
Water service, including fire hydrants.
Storm drainage improvements, as required.
Erosion and sedimentation control measures, as required.
Street lighting.
Street signs.
§ 22-503. Financial Security.
[Ord. 474, 4/14/1997, § 502]
The purpose of this section is to provide for the filing of financial security as allowed by § 509 of
the Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. § 10509. Where the improvement is to be dedicated to
an authority or agency other than the Borough, the developer will follow that organization's
practices. Where the authority is primarily a financing authority and the Borough will actually
operate and maintain the proposed improvement, the bond will run in favor of the Borough. In any
event, it is the clear intent of this chapter that all improvements required by this chapter be either
installed and approved or the developer will post adequate financial security as required by § 509
of the Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. § 10509, before final plan approval is granted.
An assurance of proper completion of the improvements by financial security in the
subdivision shall be made by one of the following methods, or such other method as shall be
satisfactory to the Borough of Edinboro:
A bond, irrevocable letter of credit, restrictive or escrow account, certified check or other
security satisfactory to the Borough and in accordance with § 509 of the Municipalities
Planning Code, 53 P.S. § 10509, which shall run or be made payable to the Borough.
In the case of a bond, it shall also:
Be with surety satisfactory to the Borough.

Be in form, sufficiency and execution acceptable to the Borough.
The amount of the financial security shall be in an amount determined to equal 110% of the
cost of the required improvements in accordance with § 509 of the Municipalities Planning
Code, 53 P.S. § 10509, and shall be approved by the Borough Engineer.
The bond, certified check or other securities shall specify the time for the completion of the
required improvements. Such time shall be satisfactory to the Borough Council, but not
exceed one year. When the improvements have been completed and approved by the
Borough, the guarantee shall be released and returned. When a portion of the required
improvements has been completed and approved by the Borough, a portion of the bond,
monies or security commensurate with the cost of the improvement may be released and
returned in accordance with § 509 of the Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. § 10509. In no
event shall the entire performance assurance be returned to the developer. At least 15% shall
be retained until:
All improvements have been completed, approved by the Borough Engineer and
accepted by the Borough.
The required maintenance bond (see Part 12) has been filed and accepted by the
Borough.
All the requirements of Part 12, specifically including the filing of as-built drawings, have
been met.
In the event that cash or its equivalent is deposited as an improvement guarantee, it shall be
held in an escrow fund, which may bear interest to the credit of the developer, but the
developer shall pay all costs for the maintaining of such escrow fund.
As the work of installing the required improvements proceeds, the developer posting the
financial security may request the Borough Council to release of such portions of the financial
security necessary for payment to the contractor or contractors performing the work. Any such
requests shall be in writing, addressed to the Borough Council, and the Borough Council shall
have 45 days from receipt of such request within which to allow the Borough Engineer to
certify, in writing, that such portion of the work on the improvements has been completed in
accordance with the approved plan and specifications. On such certification, the Borough
Council shall authorize release by the bonding company or lending institution of an amount as
estimated by the Borough fairly representing the value of the improvements completed or, if
the Borough Council fails to act within said forty-five-day period, the Borough Council shall be
deemed to have approved the release of funds as requested.
For circumstances relating to financial security not specifically delineated in the chapter,
including the amount of same and the resolution of disagreements relative to such security, it
is the intention of the Borough of Edinboro to follow the guidelines and procedures as set forth
by §§ 509 and 510 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. §§ 10509,
10510.
In the event that any improvement which may be required have not been installed as provided
in the chapter or in accordance with the approved final plan, the Borough of Edinboro may
enforce any corporate bond, or other security by appropriate legal and equitable remedies. It
proceeds of such bond, or other security are insufficient to pay the cost of installing or making
repairs or corrections to all the improvements covered by said security, the Borough of
Edinboro may institute appropriate legal or equitable action to recover the monies necessary
to complete the remainder of the improvements. All of the proceeds, whether resulting from
the security or from or both, shall be used solely for the installation of the improvements
covered by such security, and not for any other Borough purpose.

The design standards set forth by these regulations are intended to insure proper development in
the Borough of Edinboro:
The following land subdivision principles, standards and requirements shall be applied by the
Borough of Edinboro in evaluating the plans for proposed subdivisions and shall be
considered minimum requirements, except as provided for above.
In reviewing subdivision plans, the Borough will consider the adequacy of existing or
proposed community facilities to serve the additional dwelling units proposed by the
subdivision. A reservation of land for community facilities may be requested when
appropriate.
The subdividing of land shall be done in a manner that will not have the effect of debarring
adjacent property owners from access to the streets and ways of the allotment. The Borough
may require dedicated, improved, or undedicated parcels to be provided for future access to
adjacent land.
Land which is unsuitable for development because of hazards to life, safety, health, or
property, shall not be subdivided or developed until such hazards have been eliminated or
unless adequate safeguards against such hazards are provided for in the subdivision or land
development plan land included as having unsuitable characteristics would be the following:
Land subject to flooding or which has a high ground water table.
Land which, if developed, will create or aggravate a flooding condition upon other land.
Land subject to subsidence.
Land subject to underground fires.
Land containing significant areas of slopes greater than 16%.
Land which, because of topography or means of access, is considered hazardous by the
Borough of Edinboro.
Land which is subject to ground pollution or contamination.
Proposed subdivisions and land developments shall be coordinated with existing nearby
neighborhoods so that the community, as a whole, may develop harmoniously.
Proposed land uses shall conform to the Borough Zoning Ordinance [Chapter 27].
§ 22-802. Streets.
[Ord. 474, 4/14/1997, § 802]

The Borough of Edinboro requires that minor/local and cul-de-sac streets with a rolled gutter be
installed (see Appendix 22-A). This design is consistent with recent Borough development
practices. Other street designs, in residential areas, are discouraged, unless it is necessary to
continue an existing street of other design.
Residential, other culs-de-sac follow commercial/industrial standards.
Residential, other culs-de-sac follow commercial/industrial standards.
In cases where a new subdivision is planned to join the street system on an existing subdivision,
the above minimum requirements shall apply except where the existing streets and right-of-ways
are larger than required. In this event, the Borough may require that the new streets and rights-ofway
be as large as those in the existing subdivision. Any street or way that is planned, though not
already established, shall be continued at not less than its width as planned.
Provisions for additional street width (right-of-way) may be required by the Borough in specific
cases for:
Public safety and convenience.
Parking in commercial and industrial areas and in areas of high-density residential
development.
Widening existing streets (rights-of-way) where the width does not meet with the requirements
of these regulations.

General design criteria for streets not otherwise covered in this chapter shall be in accordance
with specifications as set forth by the Borough and the typical cross-section as shown in the
Appendix of this chapter. All details of the cross-section including crown, curb (if any) pavement,
shoulders (if any) subgrade, storm sewers and roadside swales shall be followed.
Culs-de-sac.
In no event shall a street be allowed to dead end without a permanent or temporary cul-desac.
Residential dead end streets (culs-de-sac) may be permitted when it is clear that through
traffic is not essential to the street system in that district, and under existing conditions. A
dead end street must have adequate turning space for vehicles, which shall include a
minimum right-of-way radius of 50 feet, and a minimum road edge (excluding shoulders) or
curb radius of 40 feet. The entire turnaround area is to be paved. Full pavement shall extend
to the outer edge of the forty-foot radius. In no event shall the shoulder area be considered as
part of the required minimum road width. Culs-de-sac shall be signed with a "No Outlet" sign
for ingress traffic and a "Stop" sign for egress traffic. (Note, see Subsection 16.) In no event
shall a cul-de-sac serve more than 20 dwelling units.
Where a temporary residential cul-de-sac is proposed in a residential development, the
developer will be allowed to install a paved temporary facility with a minimum radius of 40 feet
provided that such a temporary cul-de-sac will not be permitted for more than a two-year
period and further provided that the developer shall post a bond, in accordance with the
provisions of § 22-502 of this chapter, in an amount sufficient to construct a permanent culde-
sac according to the requirements of this chapter in the event the street is not continued in
said two-year period. The temporary facility must be constructed of subbase material with a
wearing surface of BCBC or a bituminous surface treatment per PA DOT Publication 408,
§ 480. If the street is not constructed in said two-year period, the developer shall construct a
cul-de-sac in full accordance with the standards of this chapter. In such event, the bond shall
be returned. In the event the developer neither continues the street nor constructs the cul-desac
in a two-year period, the Borough shall use the bond funds to construct same. (See also
§ 22-503, Subsection 1G). Where a temporary cul-de-sac is proposed, the needed street
right-of-way to the tract boundary shall be clearly shown on the preliminary and final plat. The
right-of-way of any future street shall meet the requirements of this chapter. Area needed to
provide the temporary turn-around may be provided by an easement. Said easements shall
be so designed as to meet the requirements of this chapter. If the cul-de-sac shall become
permanent, the easement and improvements will be considered as a permanent dedication to
the Borough of Edinboro. If the road is extended and the temporary cul-de-sac is no longer
needed, then the easement will be terminated.
Street intersections shall comply with the following requirements:
All curbs or pavement outer edge at intersections shall be rounded by a minimum radius of:
Collector, commercial and arterial streets 40 feet
Minor, local streets 25 feet[4]
Industrial streets 50 feet
Thirty-foot radii shall be used where minor streets intersect collector and/or arterial streets.
Curbed streets, where there is no curb, a twenty-foot return will be used.
When fences, hedges or other plantings, structures, or walls on any lot corner would create a
traffic hazard by limiting clear vision across a corner lot from a height of three feet above the
finished paved area, at the center line of the right-of-way, such structure and/or vegetation
shall be removed in conjunction with grading the right-of-way to provide a minimum site line of
120 feet along the center line of:

Seventy-five feet from the point of intersection of the center lines of two streets where
both are minor streets.
One hundred feet from the point of intersection of the center lines of two streets where
one is a collector street.
One hundred fifty feet from the point of intersection of the center lines of two streets
where one is an arterial street.
Alternatively, Table 2.3 in PA DOT Publication 70 may be used. When an arterial, commercial,
industrial or collector and a minor street intersect, each shall retain its respective footage
requirements along the center line to form the sight triangle. No building or structure shall be
permitted in this sight triangle. Sight triangles shall be shown on the plan.
Where the grade of any street at the approach to an intersection exceeds 4%, a leveling area
shall be provided, if possible, with a transitional grade not to exceed 3% for a minimum
distance of 50 feet from the nearest right-of-way line of the intersection.
Intersections of more than two streets shall not be allowed.
Minimum street intersection angles shall be 75°. Right angle intersections shall be used
whenever possible.
Intersecting minor/local streets shall be separated by 350 feet or more, measured between
center lines along the center line of the intersected street.
Horizontal curves shall be laid on all deflecting angles along the center line of streets, and the
degree of curvature shall be set to assure the proper sight distance as required by Table 22-8-A.
Vertical curves shall be used in changes of grade exceeding 1%, and shall be designed for
maximum visibility as set forth by Table 22-8-A.
In general, minor and collector streets shall not join into the same side of arterial streets at
intervals of less than 800 feet.
Half streets shall be prohibited. If circumstances render this impractical, adequate provisions for
the concurrent dedication of the remaining half of the street must be furnished by the developer.
Where there exists a half street in an adjoining subdivision, the remaining half shall be provided in
the proposed development. The use of reserve strips is prohibited.
The provisions for the extension and continuation of major streets into and from adjoining areas
are required. Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed major street, the
Borough may require reverse frontage lots or such treatments as will provide protection for
abutting properties, reduction in the number of intersections with the major traffic streets, and
separation of local and through traffic.
When the subdivision adjoins unsubdivided acreage, new streets or reserved right-of-ways shall
be provided through to the boundary lines of the development.
Where a subdivision borders on, or contains a railroad right-of-way, an arterial highway right-ofway
or a stream, ravine, steep hill or swamp, the Borough may require a street approximately
parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way or other obstruction at a distance suitable for the
appropriate use of the intervening land. Such distances shall also be determined with due regard
for the requirements of approach grades and future grade separations, and for nonresidential uses
of land, where permitted.
If the lots in a development are large enough for resubdivision, or if a portion of the tract is not
subdivided, suitable access and street openings for such resubdivision shall be provided. Such

NOTES:
For arterial roads, PA DOT standards will apply.
Please see cul-de-sac definition  a cul-de-sac is the entire street not merely the vehicular
turnaround.
Grades in excess of the allowable percentage may be approved by the Borough where it is
clear that it is necessary and that no traffic hazard is or will be created thereby.
Sight distance shall be measured along the center line of the street between points where a
driver's eyes at three feet six inches in height can see an object six inches high. Values
shown are minimums. Greater values may be required depending on site-specific criteria.
Alleys are prohibited.
All required traffic control devices shall comply with, and be installed in accordance with,
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, 67 Pa. Code, Chapter 211,
Publication 68. Additionally, it shall be the developer's responsibility to perform all required traffic
and engineering studies in accordance with PA DOT, 67 Pa. Code, Chapter 201, for all traffic
control devices.
§ 22-803. Curbs and Sidewalks.
[Ord. 474, 4/14/1997, § 803]
Curbs. As set forth by § 22-802, the Borough does not wish curbed streets for new residential
development. However, if curbs are installed, the following criteria are to be followed:
Where sidewalks are installed, curbs shall be depressed at intersections to sufficient width to
accommodate wheelchairs. Depression shall be in line with sidewalks where provided. (Note:
appropriate federal ADA standards will be used.)
Curbs shall be vertical.
All curbs shall be constructed in accordance with Borough of Edinboro street construction
specifications.
Sidewalks. Sidewalks shall be provided for all major subdivisions and for any minor subdivisions
where sidewalks exist on abutting parcel(s). The width, depth, design and specifications for
sidewalks shall comply with the current Sidewalk Ordinance [Chapter 21, Part 2].

§ 22-804. Blocks.
[Ord. 474, 4/14/1997, § 804]
Blocks shall be designed to insure proper fire safety.
In general, all blocks in a subdivision shall have a maximum length of 1,600 feet. Blocks
subdivided into lots shall be approximately two lot depths in width, except lots along a major
thoroughfare which front on an interior street. Block lengths shall not be less than 600 feet.
In commercial areas, the block layout shall conform, with due consideration to site conditions, to
the best possible layout to serve the buying public, to permit good traffic circulation and the
parking of cars, to make delivery and pickup efficient, and to reinforce the best design of the units
in the commercial areas.
The block layout in industrial areas shall be governed by the most efficient arrangement of space
for present use and future expansion, with due regard for worker and customer access parking. Of
special interest will be an accommodation of truck traffic.
§ 22-805. Lots and Building Lines.
[Ord. 474, 4/14/1997, § 805]
The depth-to-width ratio of usable lot length shall be a maximum of 2 1/2 to 1.
Double frontage and reverse frontage lots should be avoided except where essential to provide
separation of residential development from traffic arteries or to overcome specific disadvantages
of topography and orientation. A planting screen easement across which there shall be no right of
access may be required by the Borough along the line of lots abutting such a traffic artery or other
disadvantageous use.
Side lines of lots, so far as practical, shall be at right angles or radial to street lines.
Lots abutting local streets shall front upon the streets which parallel the long dimension of the
block, if possible.
All lots shall abut by their frontage on a publicly dedicated street.
§ 22-806. Lot Grading for Subdivisions and Land Developments.
[Ord. 474, 4/14/1997, § 806]
Blocks and lots shall be graded to provide proper drainage away from buildings and to prevent the
collection of stormwater in pools.
Lot grading shall be of such design as to carry surface waters to the nearest practical street, storm
drain, or natural water course. Where drainage swales are used to deliver surface waters away
from buildings, their grade shall not be less than 1% nor more than 4%. The swales shall be
sodded, planted or lined as required. A grading and drainage plan shall be required for all
subdivisions and land developments, except minor subdivisions.
No final grading, fill or cut shall be permitted with a cut face steeper in slope than two horizontal to
one vertical except under one or more of the following conditions:

The material in which the excavation is made is sufficiently stable to sustain a slope of
steeper than two horizontal to one vertical, and a written statement of a civil engineer,
licensed by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and experienced in erosion control, to that
effect is submitted to the Borough Engineer and approved by same. The statement shall state
that the site has been inspected and that the deviation from the slope specified hereinbefore
will not result in injury to persons or damage to property.
A concrete or stone masonry wall constructed according to sound engineering standards for
which plans are submitted to the Borough Engineer for review and written approval is
provided.
The top or bottom edge of slopes shall be a minimum of three feet from property or right-of-way
lines of streets or alleys in order to permit the normal rounding of the edge without encroaching on
the abutting property. All property lines, or right-of-way lines, where walls or slopes are steeper
than one horizontal to one vertical and five feet or more in height shall be protected by a protective
fence no less than three feet in height approved by the Borough Engineer.
§ 22-807. Easements.
[Ord. 474, 4/14/1997, § 807]
Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainage way, channel or stream, a drainage
easement may be required that conforms substantially with the water line of such watercourse,
drainage way, channel or stream and of such width as will be adequate to preserve the unimpeded
flow of natural drainage, or for the purpose of widening, deepening, relocating, improving or
protecting such drainage facilities.
Where desirable or necessary, adequate easements or dedications for public service utilities shall
be provided for sewer, water, electric power, gas lines, storm drainage and similar services; and
no structure or obstruction of any kind shall be placed or allowed to be placed where it will
interfere in any way with such easements.
Utility and drainage easements, where required, shall have a minimum width of 10 feet from
center line and be placed at the side or rear of lots whenever possible from the center line.
§ 22-808. Street Names.
[Ord. 474, 4/14/1997, § 808]
The developer may choose his street names subject to § 22-703, Subsection 8E, and the Borough.
The developer shall consult with postal authorities prior to naming new street. The names of existing
Borough streets shall not be used unless the new street is clearly an extension of an existing street. In
such instances, the existing street name shall be used.
§ 22-809. Stormwater Drainage.
[Ord. 474, 4/14/1997, § 809; as amended by Ord. 585, 9/12/2011]
Governed by the Borough. All new roads that use rolled paved drainage swales or concrete curbs will
provide storm drainage facilities in accordance with specifications as set forth by the Borough Engineer
and the Borough of Edinboro. See Chapter 23, "Stormwater Management."

design and construction standards as found elsewhere in the chapter are applicable to land
development as such standards may be appropriate. Land development is characterized by the
fact that the development site is typically in single ownership and the buildings and/or use areas
are often rented or leased to prospective users. It shall be unlawful for an applicant to construct
land developments as defined herein until:
The final site plan has been approved by the Borough and recorded as required by this
chapter.
A valid permit from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection or the Erie
County Department of Health, where applicable, has been approved for issue to the applicant.

stages. The land development shall be processed, and submission requirements shall be the same as
that required for subdivisions. Developers are specifically reminded to prepare a stormwater
management plan. Where a development involves a building, or buildings, of less than 10,000 square
feet in aggregate size, the successful filing of a permit under the Borough Zoning Ordinance [Chapter
27], will be regarded as compliance with this Part and no other application will be required. The
processing requirements, drawing size, certifications, acknowledgments, number of copies, etc., for
submission of site plans shall be the same as for subdivisions (unless otherwise noted) and as set
forth in Parts 3 and 7 of this chapter. The final site plan shall be recorded in the County Recorder of
Deed's Office.
§ 22-1303. Site Plan.
[Ord. 474, 4/14/1997, § 1303]
In lieu of a plot plan, the developer shall submit a site plan. Such plan shall be at a scale of one
inch to 20 feet. Where building development and parking lot development is in excess of 50,000
square feet combined, topographic data at two-foot contour intervals shall be required. Each site
plan shall, through one or more pages, show:
Existing site conditions (topography, as needed, drainage, tree clusters, buildings, utilities,
roads and nearby properties).
Proposed developments, including buildings (with footprints and frontal elevations), parking,
vehicular and pedestrian access areas, storm drainage, landscaping, utility location and size.
Property information with a boundary survey completed by a professional land surveyor.

§ 22-1305. Assurance for Completion and Maintenance of
Improvements.
[Ord. 474, 4/14/1997, § 1305]
Insofar as the land development involves the use, lease or rental of buildings and/or space on the site
and site improvements (such as roads, parking areas and stormwater drainage devices), which are to
be privately maintained or maintained by a private (nonpublic) organization created by the developer;
there is no need for Borough acceptance of the site improvements (roads, stormwater drainage
devices). However, in these instances, roads and stormwater drainage systems shall be designed and
built to the standards established in this chapter, and the Borough shall ascertain that these
improvements are, in fact, built to such standards. Where the developer does not intend to maintain
the improvement and where a homeowners association or similar organization will not be organized for
these responsibilities, the developer will submit a plan for maintenance of such facilities. This
document will be legally enforceable, one clearly establishing maintenance responsibility. It must be
approved by the Borough. Any proposed improvement to be offered for public dedication will follow the
requirements for same as specified by the chapter. Among other remedies to enforce this section of
the chapter, the Borough may refuse to issue zoning certificates or building permits.

The Council of Borough of Edinboro finds that:
Inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting from development
throughout a watershed increases flood flows and velocities, contributes to erosion and
sedimentation, overtaxes the carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers, greatly
increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater, undermines the
floodplain management and flood reduction efforts in upstream and downstream
communities, reduces groundwater recharge, threatens public health and safety, and
increases non-point source pollution of water resources.
A comprehensive program of stormwater management, including reasonable regulation of
development and activities causing accelerated runoff, is fundamental to the public health,
safety, welfare and the protection of the people of Borough of Edinboro and all the people of
the commonwealth, their resources and the environment.
Inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting from land development
and redevelopment throughout a watershed can also harm surface water resources by
changing the natural hydrologic patterns; accelerating stream flows (which increase scour and
erosion of streambeds and stream banks thereby elevating sedimentation); destroying aquatic
habitat; and elevating aquatic pollutant concentrations and loadings such as sediments,
nutrients, heavy metals, and pathogens. Groundwater resources are also impacted through
loss of recharge.
Stormwater is an important water resource which provides groundwater recharge for water
supplies and base flow of streams, which also protects and maintains surface water quality.
Public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an essential component in
successfully addressing stormwater issues.
§ 23-103. Purpose.
[Ord. 585, 9/12/2011]
The purpose of this chapter is to promote health, safety and welfare within the Borough of
Edinboro, Erie County, by minimizing the harms and maximizing the benefits described in § 23-
102 of this chapter through provisions intended to:
Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including regulations at 25 Pa. Code,
Chapter 93, to protect, maintain, reclaim and restore the existing and designated uses of
surface waters.
Manage accelerated runoff and erosion and sedimentation problems close to their source, by
regulating activities that cause these problems.
Preserve the natural drainage systems as much as possible.
Maintain groundwater recharge, to prevent degradation of surface and groundwater quality,
and to otherwise protect water resources.
Maintain existing flows and quality of streams and watercourses.
Preserve and restore the flood-carrying capacity of streams and prevent scour and erosion of
stream banks and streambeds.
Manage stormwater impacts close to the runoff source, with a minimum of structures and a
maximum use of natural processes.

§ 23-304. Volume Controls.
[Ord. 585, 9/12/2011]
The use of non-structural BMPs as described in the BMP Manual shall be utilized for all regulated
activities to the maximum extent practicable.
Stormwater runoff volume controls shall be implemented using the design storm method or, if
applicable, the simplified method.
The design storm method (CG-1 in the BMP Manual) is applicable to any sized regulated
activity. This method requires detailed calculations based on site conditions.
The post-development total runoff volume shall not exceed the pre-development total
runoff volume for the two-year, twenty-four-hour storm event.
For the purposes of pre-development runoff volume determination, existing non-forested
pervious areas conditions shall be considered as meadow (good condition).
For the purposes of pre-development runoff volume determination, 20% of existing
impervious area, when present, shall be considered meadow (good condition).
The simplified method (CG-2 in the BMP Manual) is independent of site conditions and should
be used if the design storm method is not followed. This method is not applicable to regulated
activities greater than one acre or for projects that require detailed design of stormwater
storage facilities. For new impervious surfaces:
Stormwater facilities shall capture at least the first two inches of runoff from all new
impervious surfaces.
At least the first one inch of runoff from new impervious surfaces shall be permanently
removed from the runoff flow, i.e., it shall not be discharged into drainageways. Removal
options include reuse, evaporation, transpiration and infiltration.
Wherever possible, infiltration facilities should be designed to accommodate infiltration of
the entire permanently removed runoff; however, in all cases at least the first 0.5 inch of
the permanently removed runoff should be infiltrated.
Actual field infiltration tests at the location of the proposed elevation of the stormwater
BMPs are required. Infiltration test shall be conducted in accordance with the BMP
manual. Notification of the Borough shall be provided to allow witnessing of the testing.
Proposed graveled areas shall be considered impervious.
In cases where it is not possible or desirable to use infiltration-based best management
practices to partially fulfill the requirements in either Subsection 2A or 2B, the following

procedure shall be used:
At a minimum, the following documentation shall be provided to justify the decision to not
use infiltration BMPs:
Description of and justification for field infiltration/permeability testing with respect to
the type of test and test locations.
An interpretive narrative describing existing site soils and their structure as these
relate to the interaction between soils and water occurring on the site. In addition to
providing soil and soil profile descriptions, this narrative shall identify depth to
seasonal high water tables and depth to bedrock, and provide a description of all
subsurface elements (fragipans and other restrictive layers, geology, etc.) that
influence the direction and rate of subsurface water movement.
A qualitative assessment of the site's contribution to annual aquifer recharge shall be
made, along with identification of any restrictions or limitations associated with the
use of engineered infiltration facilities.
The provided documentation must be signed and sealed by a professional engineer
or geologist.
The following water quality pollutant load reductions will be required for all disturbed
areas within the proposed development:
Pollutant Load Units
Required Reduction
(%)
Total Suspended Solids (TSS) Pounds 85
Total Phosphorous (TP) Pounds 85
Total Nitrate (NO ) Pounds 50
The performance criteria for water quality best management practices shall be
determined form the BMP manual.
§ 23-305. Rate Controls.
[Ord. 585, 9/12/2011]
The peak post-development flow rates shall not exceed the peak pre-development flow rates for
the one-, two-, ten-, twenty-five-, fifty- and one-hundred-year, twenty-four-hour storm events.
For the purposes of pre-development flow rate determination, existing non-forested pervious areas
conditions shall be considered as meadow (good condition).
For the purposes of pre-development peak flow rate determination, 20% of existing impervious
area, when present, shall be considered meadow (good condition).
For comparison of peak flow rates, flows shall be rounded to the nearest tenth of a cubic foot per
second.

Requirements. Regulated activities wholly or partially within "sensitive areas" and "stormwater
hotspots" as defined below shall meet the performance standards set forth below.
Definitions.
SENSITIVE AREAS
Are defined as those areas that, if developed, have the potential to endanger the source for a
"public water system," as defined by 25 Pa. Code, Chapter 109 (relating to safe drinking
water). These areas consist of the Zone 1 and Zone 2 wellhead protection areas as
determined by the owner of the public water system, or as defined by 25 Pa. Code, Chapter
109.
STORMWATER HOTSPOTS
Are areas in which land development projects have a high potential to endanger local water
quality, and could potentially threaten ground water reservoirs. The PADEP wellhead
protection contaminant source list shall serve as a guide in determining such areas.
Performance Standards.
The developer of a sensitive area must provide written notice to the owner of the water
system prior to the design phase for the regulated activity.
The limits of the sensitive areas or stormwater hotspots must be identified and described in
the SWM site plan and report to document the location of regulated activities relative to the
sensitive areas or stormwater hotspots.
Applicants proposing regulated activities in sensitive areas or involving stormwater hotspots
shall prepare and implement a preparedness, prevention, and contingency plan (PPC Plan)
per the PADEP publication "Guidelines for the Development and Implementation of
Environmental Emergency Response Plans."
Stormwater hotspot developments must use an acceptable pre-treatment BMP prior to
volume control and/or rate control BMPs. Acceptable pre-treatment BMPs for these
developments include those based on filtering, settling, or chemical reaction processes such
as coagulation.
Consideration should be given to not using infiltration BMPs in sensitive areas within the Zone
1 wellhead protection area of a water supply.
Consideration should be given to not using infiltration BMPs in stormwater hotspots if
infiltration would cause adverse migration of contamination.
Applicants for projects involving stormwater hotspots shall consult with PADEP as to the
applicability of industrial stormwater NPDES permit requirements.
Part 4. DESIGN CRITERIA
§ 23-401. Design Criteria for Stormwater Management Facilities.
[Ord. 585, 9/12/2011]
General Design Requirements.
Stormwater shall not be transferred from one watershed to another, unless (1) the watersheds
are sub-watersheds of a common watershed which join together within the perimeter of the
property; (2) the effect of the transfer does not increase the peak rate discharge onto adjacent
lands; or (3) easements from the affected landowner(s) are provided.

Consideration shall be given to the relationship of the subject property to the drainage pattern
of the watershed. A concentrated discharge of stormwater to an adjacent property shall be
contained within an existing watercourse or confined in an easement or returned to a predevelopment
flow type condition.
BMPs shall be designed in accordance with the BMP Manual to meet the standards of Part 3
of this chapter.
Alteration of existing watercourses shall be approved by issuance of a permit by PADEP
under 25 Pa. Code, Chapter 105, as applicable.
Should any stormwater management facility require a dam safety permit under 25 Pa. Code,
Chapter 105, the facility shall be designed in accordance with PADEP regulations and obtain
the appropriate PADEP permit prior to approval by the Borough.
Drainageways or site grading shall be adequate to convey the runoff into the stormwater
management facility intended to receive the runoff. In other words, if a stormwater
management facility is intended to treat the one-hundred-year peak runoff from a drainage
area, then it must be ensured that the one-hundred-year peak runoff from the drainage area
does not bypass that facility.
Stormwater Management Facility Design Requirements.
No outlet structure from a stormwater management facility, or swale, shall discharge directly
onto a Borough or state roadway without approval from the Borough or PennDOT.
The top, or toe, of any slope, or perimeter of any stormwater management facility shall be
sufficiently distant from any property line, building, roadway, or structure to ensure that the
adjacent property, building, roadway, or structure will not be harmed and that adequate
access is provided to the stormwater management facility.
Where the BMP Manual requires the bottom of infiltration/storage facilities to be located a
minimum of two feet above the seasonal high groundwater table, the bottom of such facilities
may be lower if adequate subsurface drainage is provided. Flows from subsurface drainage
need not be accounted for in volume control or rate control calculations.
Energy dissipaters and/or level spreaders shall be installed at points where pipes or
drainageways discharge to or from basins. Discharges to drainage swales shall be dissipated,
or piped, to an acceptable point.
All disturbed areas not otherwise resurfaced shall be stabilized by a minimum uniform 70%
perennial vegetative cover, with a density capable of resisting accelerated erosion.
Specifications shall be provided for vegetation serving a water quality function as part of a
BMP.
A safety fence may be required, at the discretion of the Borough, where the location and
layout of a stormwater management facility is potentially dangerous to the public. The fence
shall be a minimum of four feet high, and of a material acceptable to the Borough. The fence
shall provide for appropriate maintenance access.
Stormwater management facilities that store runoff shall have appropriately designed primary
outlet structures that direct the facility discharge downstream to an appropriate location in a
manner that protects the structural integrity of the stormwater management facility. The
primary outlet structure shall be designed to pass all design storms up to and including the
one-hundred-year event. Outlet structures shall be constructed of structurally stable,
corrosion resistant materials such as reinforced concrete. Trash racks shall be provided
where debris can be reasonably expected to clog an outlet structure, particularly for small
outlet orifices.

Stormwater management facilities that store runoff shall have an appropriately designed
emergency spillway that protects the structural integrity of the stormwater management
facility. The emergency spillway shall be designed to convey the one-hundred-year peak flow
rate assuming the primary outlet structure is blocked. Where storage is provided behind a
berm, and the one-hundred-year water surface flowing over the emergency spillway is over
one foot above the lowest elevation along the toe of the berm, a minimum of one foot of
freeboard shall be provided as measured from the top of the berm to the one-hundred-year
water surface. The spillway shall be armored to prevent erosion during the one-hundred-year
peak flow, assuming a blocked primary outlet structure, and calculations shall be submitted
documenting the adequacy of the proposed armor.
Embankments for stormwater management facilities that store runoff shall be constructed in
accordance with § 206 of PennDOT Publication 408, except in place density and moisture
testing shall not be required unless the maximum water depth is four feet or greater, or as
otherwise required by the Borough.
Stormwater Conveyance Facilities.
All storm sewer pipes, grass waterways, open channels, swales and other stormwater
carrying facilities that service drainage areas within the site must be able to convey postdevelopment
runoff from the ten-year design storm.
Stormwater management facilities that convey off-site water through the site shall be
designed to convey the twenty-five-year storm event (or larger events, as determined by the
Borough).
Storm Sewers.
Storm sewers must be able to convey post-development runoff without surcharging inlets
for the ten-year storm event.
When connecting to an existing storm sewer system, the applicant must demonstrate that
the proposed system will not exacerbate any existing stormwater problems and that
adequate downstream capacity exists.
Inlets, manholes, pipes, and culverts shall be constructed in accordance with the
specifications set forth in PennDOT's Publication 408, and as detailed in the,"
PennDOT's Publication 72M, "Standards for Roadway Construction (RC) or other detail
approved by the Borough. All material and construction details (inlets, manholes, pipe
trenches, etc.), must be shown on the SWM site plan, and a note added that all
construction must be in accordance with PennDOT's Publication 408 and PennDOT's
Publication 72M, latest edition.
A minimum pipe size of 18 inches nominal diameter shall be used for all public or private

Runoff Volumes. Runoff volumes shall be calculated using the NRCS Runoff Curve Number
Method. Combining curve numbers for land areas proposed for development with curve numbers
for areas unaffected by the proposed development into a single weighted curve number is not
acceptable.
Runoff Hydrographs. Runoff hydrographs shall be calculated by the NRCS Unit Hydrograph
Method. Computer models utilizing this method may be used where appropriate for the
application. Curve numbers shall be based an appropriate engineering reference, such as NRCS
Publication TR-55, "Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds." Average antecedent runoff
conditions shall be used. Computations shall be that produce a full hydrograph shall be used.

method, as appropriate.
Peak Runoff Rates. Peak runoff rates shall be calculated using the NRCS Unit Hydrograph
Method per the previous paragraph. The rational method may be used to calculate peak runoff
only for the design of conveyance structures. The rational method may not be used to document
compliance with the volume control and rate control requirements of this chapter, or for developing
stormwater hydrographs.
Hydrograph Routing. The routing of hydrographs through stormwater management facilities shall
be calculated using the storage indication method or modified puls method.
Pipe and Channel Capacity. Manning's equation shall be used for hydraulic computations and to
determine the capacity of open channels, pipes, and storm sewers. Manning's "n" values shall be
obtained from an appropriate engineering reference, such as PennDOT's Drainage Manual,

Part 8. MAINTENANCE RESPONSIBILITIES
§ 23-801. Maintenance Responsibilities.
[Ord. 585, 9/12/2011]
The SWM site plan and report shall describe the future operation and maintenance
responsibilities. The description shall outline required inspection and maintenance schedules,
detail inspection and maintenance actions required for each BMP and stormwater management
facility, and identify the entity who will carry out inspections and maintenance.
Maintenance responsibilities shall be consistent with the following principles:
Stormwater management facilities shall be maintained as necessary to ensure the facilities
remain structurally sound, resistant to accelerated erosion, and serve their intended purposes
of conveyance, volume control, rate control, and/or water quality control.
To the greatest extent possible, stormwater management facilities shall be privately owned
and maintained.
Stormwater management facilities within the right-of-way of streets to be dedicated to the
Borough shall be dedicated to the Borough to own and maintain. In the absence of written
agreement by the Borough to the contrary, the Borough shall neither own nor maintain
stormwater management facilities outside the street right-of-way.
Stormwater management facilities and the easements in which they are contained shall be
enumerated as permanent real estate appurtenances and recorded as deed restrictions or
easements that run with the land.
The Borough, in consultation with the Borough Engineer and Borough Solicitor, shall make the
final determination of the continuing maintenance responsibilities prior to final approval of the
SWM site plan and report. The Borough may require a dedication of certain stormwater
management facilities as a condition of approval of the SWM site plan and report. Such a
requirement is not an indication that the Borough will accept the facilities. The Borough reserves
the right to accept or reject the ownership and operating responsibility for any portion of the
stormwater management facilities.
If the Borough accepts ownership of stormwater BMPs, the Borough may, at its discretion, require
a fee from the applicant to the Borough to offset the future cost of inspections, operations, and

maintenance. The amount of such fees, if any, shall be determined by the Borough in consultation
with the Borough Engineer.
It shall be unlawful to alter or remove any permanent stormwater BMP required by an approved
SWM site plan and report, or to allow a property to remain in a condition which does not conform
to an approved SWM site plan and report, unless an alternative SWM site plan and report has
been submitted and approved by the Borough.
Each stormwater management facilities constructed prior to the effective date of this chapter shall
continue to be operated and maintained in accordance with the approved schedule for inspection
and maintenance for that facility. Whether or not such schedule exists, the property owner shall
operate and maintain such facilities as necessary to ensure the facility remains structurally sound,
resistant to accelerated erosion, and serves its intended purposes of conveyance, volume control,
rate control, and/or water quality control.
§ 23-802. Maintenance Agreement for Privately-Owned
Stormwater Facilities.
[Ord. 585, 9/12/2011]
For stormwater management facilities that are to be owned and maintained by an entity other than
the Borough, prior to final approval of the SWM site plan and report, the landowner shall execute
an operation and maintenance agreement (O&M agreement) to provide for their future operation
and maintenance in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. The O&M agreement shall be
substantially of the form provided in Appendix 23-A. The O&M agreement shall be recorded with
the SWM site plan and made a part thereof.
The O&M agreement shall be subject to the review and approval of the Borough in consultation
with the Borough Solicitor and Borough Engineer, as required.
If the landowner fails to adhere to the O&M agreement or otherwise fails to properly operate and
maintain privately owned stormwater management facilities, the Borough may perform the
maintenance required and charge the landowner appropriate fees and take other action as
appropriate to enforce the O&M agreement. Nonpayment of fees may result in a lien against the
property.
The owner of the property containing the stormwater management facilities will be accountable to
the Borough for operation and maintenance of the facilities, regardless of whether the owner has a
separate agreement with another entity for operation and maintenance.

1.5% of the value of the real estate represented by such document, which tax shall be payable at
the earlier of the time the document is presented for recording or within 30 days of acceptance of
such document or within 30 days of becoming an acquired company.

shall not exceed the limitations prescribed in the Local Tax Enabling Act, Act of December 31,
1965, P.L. 1257, 53 P.S. § 6924.101 et seq., so that if any other political subdivision shall impose
or hereafter shall impose such tax on the same person or transfer then the tax levied by the
Borough of Edinboro under the authority of that Act shall during the time such duplication of the
tax exists, except as hereinafter otherwise provided, be 1/2 of the rate and such 1/2 rate shall
become effective without any action on the part of the Borough of Edinboro; provided, however,
that the Borough of Edinboro and any other political subdivision which impose such tax on the
same person or transfer may agree that, instead of limiting their respective rates to 1/2 of the rate
herein provided, they will impose respectively different rates, the total of which shall not exceed
the maximum rate permitted under the Local Tax Enabling Act.
Administration. The tax imposed under § 24-401 and all applicable interest and penalties shall be
administered, collected and enforced under the Act of December 31, 1965, P.L. 1257, No. 511, as
amended, known as the "Local Tax Enabling Act"; provided, that if the correct amount of the tax is
not paid by the last date prescribed for timely payment, Home Rule Borough of Edinboro, pursuant
to § 1102-D of the Tax Reform Code of 1971, 72 P.S. § 8102-D, authorizes and directs the
Department of Revenue of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to determine, collect and enforce
the tax, interest and penalties.
Interest. Any tax imposed under § 24-401 that is not paid by the date the tax is due shall bear
interest as prescribed for interest on delinquent municipal claims under the Act of May 16, 1923,
P.L. 207, No. 153, 53 P.S. § 7101 et seq., as amended, known as the "Municipal Claims and Tax
Liens Act." The interest rate shall be the lesser of the interest rate imposed upon delinquent
commonwealth taxes as provided in § 806 of the Act of April 9, 1929, P.L. 343, No. 176, 72 P.S.

§ 24-604. Imposition of Tax.
[Ord. 552, 11/26/2007, § 4]
A tax to be utilized for emergency services, which shall include emergency medical services,
police services and/or fire services, road construction and/or maintenance, reduction of property
taxes, property tax relief through implementation of homestead and farmstead exclusion in
accordance with 53 Pa.C.S.A. Chapter 85, Subchapter F. Said local service tax is hereby levied
upon the privilege of engaging in an occupation within the corporate limits of the Borough of
Edinboro. Each individual who exercises such privilege for any length of time during any year
wherein he has earned income and/or net profits of $12,000 or more shall pay a tax in the amount
of $52 in accordance with the provisions of this Part. This tax is in addition to all other taxes of any
kind or nature levied by the Borough. It shall be the obligation of each such person so engaged in
an occupation to pay or cause to be paid the tax herein imposed by the due date for the quarter in
which he earns the annual required minimum of $12,000. The adoption of this Part shall constitute
notice and demand for payment of this tax.
Each employer shall register with the Tax Collector the employer's name, address and other
information the Tax Collector may require within 15 days after the effective date of this Part or
within 15 days after first becoming an employer.
Each employer within the Borough, as well as those employers situated outside the Borough
but who engaged in business within the Borough, is hereby charged with the duty of collecting
from each of his employees engaged by him and performing for him within the Home Rule
Borough of Edinboro said tax of $52 per year and making a return and payment thereof to the
Tax Collector. Each employee subject to the tax shall be assessed a pro rata share of the tax
for each payroll period in which the employee is engaged in the Home Rule Borough of
Edinboro. The pro rata share of the tax assessed on an employee for a payroll period shall be
determined by dividing the $52 rate of the tax by the number of payroll periods established by
the employer for the calendar year. For purposes of determining the pro rata share, an
employer shall round down the amount of the tax collected each payroll period to the nearest
1/100 of a dollar. Collection of a local services tax levied under this paragraph shall be made
on a payroll period basis for each payroll period in which the person is engaging in an
occupation except as provided in Subsection 1J. Each employer is hereby authorized to
deduct this tax from each employee who has not otherwise claimed an exemption from paying
the tax, whether said employee is paid by salary, wages, or commission. Each employer shall

Remitting starting on or before March 31 of the current tax year, file a return on a form
prescribed by the Tax Collector, and pay to said Tax Collector the full amount of taxes
deducted on or before April 30 of the current tax year. For each taxpayer for whom no prior
deduction has been made, who is employed after the effective date of this Part, and in any of
the three-month periods ending June 30, September 30 and December 31 of the current tax
year, each employer shall deduct the tax from compensation payable to the taxpayer, file a
return on a form prescribed by the Tax Collector, and pay said collector the full amount of all
tax deducted on or before July 31 or October 31 of the current tax year, or January 31 of the
following year, respectively. The employer will provide the employee with evidence of
deduction on a form to be furnished to the employer by the Tax Collector.
Any employer who discontinues business or ceases operation before December 31 of any
year during which this tax is in effect shall file the return hereinabove required and pay the tax

to the Tax Collector, within 15 days after discontinuing business or ceasing operations. The
failure of an employer to deduct the tax shall not relieve the employee from the duty to file a
return and pay the tax. Any employer who fails to deduct the tax as required by this section,
or who fails to pay such tax to the Tax Collector, shall be liable for such tax in full, as though
the tax had originally been levied against such employer.
All self-employed individuals who perform services of any type or kind or engage in any
occupation or profession within the Borough shall be required to comply with this Part and pay
the tax to the Tax Collector by April 20 of each year, unless he or she has otherwise claimed
an exemption from the tax.
As to employees who present official receipts evidencing prior full payment of the tax imposed
hereby, either directly or by collection through employers, the employer shall not deduct the
tax but shall maintain adequate records concerning such employees.
If a local services tax is levied at a combined rate exceeding $10 in a calendar year, a person
subject to the local services tax shall be assessed a pro rata share of the tax for each payroll
period in which the person is engaging in an occupation. The pro rata share of the tax
assessed on the person for a payroll period shall be determined by dividing the combined rate
of the local services tax levied for the calendar year by the number of payroll periods
established by the employer for the calendar year. For purposes of determining the pro rata
share, an employer shall round down the amount of the tax collected each payroll period to
the nearest 1/100 of a dollar. Collection of a local services tax levied under this paragraph
shall be made on a payroll period basis for each payroll period in which the person is
engaging in an occupation, except as provided in Subsection 1J.
If a school district levied an emergency and municipal services tax on the effective date of this
paragraph, the school district may continue to levy the local services tax in the same amount
the school district collected on the effective date of this paragraph. However, if a municipality
located in whole or in part within the school district subsequently levies the local services tax,
the school district may only collect $5 on persons employed within the municipality each
calendar year. A school district that did not levy an emergency and municipal services tax on
the effective date of this paragraph shall be prohibited from levying the local services tax. If a
school district and a municipality located in whole or in part within the school district both levy
a local services tax at a combined rate exceeding $10, the school district's pro rata share of
the aggregate local services taxes levied on persons employed within the municipality shall
be collected by the municipality or its tax officer based on payroll periods as provided under
Subsection 1F and shall be paid to the school district on a quarterly basis within 60 days of
receipt by the municipality or its tax officer.
Except as otherwise provided for in Subsection 1G, no person shall be subject to the payment
of the local services tax by more than one political subdivision during each payroll period as
established by Subsection 1I of this Part.
With respect to a person subject to the local services tax at a combined rate exceeding $10,
the situs of the tax shall be the place of employment on the first day the person becomes
subject to the tax during each payroll period. With respect to a person subject to the local
services tax at a combined rate of not more than $10, the situs of the tax shall be the place of
employment determined as of the day the person first becomes subject to the tax during the
calendar year. In the event a person is engaged in more than one occupation, that is,
concurrent employment, or an occupation which requires the person working in more than
one political subdivision during a payroll period, the priority of claim to collect the local
services tax shall be in the following order: first, the political subdivision in which a person
maintains the person's principal office or is principally employed; second, the political
subdivision in which the person resides and works, if the tax is levied by that political
subdivision; and third, the political subdivision in which a person is employed and which
imposes the tax nearest in miles to the person's home.

In the case of concurrent employment, an employer shall refrain from withholding the local
services tax if the employee provides a recent pay statement from a principal employer that
includes the name of the employer, the length of the payroll period and the amount of the
local services tax withheld and a statement from the employee that the pay statement is from
the employee's principal employer and the employee will notify other employers of a change
in principal place of employment within two weeks of its occurrence. The Department of
Community and Economic Development shall develop a uniform employee statement form.
The local services tax shall be no more than $52 on each person for each calendar year,
irrespective of the number of political subdivisions within which a person may be employed. A
political subdivision shall provide a taxpayer a receipt of payment upon request by the
taxpayer.
The Home Rule Borough of Edinboro shall adopt regulations for the processing of refund
claims for overpaid local services taxes for any calendar year. The regulations to be adopted
by the Home Rule Borough of Edinboro shall be consistent with 53 Pa.C.S.A. §§ 8425 and
8426. Refunds made within 75 days of a refund request or 75 days after the last day the
employer is required to remit the local services tax for the last quarter of the calendar year,
whichever is later, shall not be subject to interest imposed under 53 Pa.C.S.A. § 8426. The
Home Rule Borough of Edinboro shall only provide refunds for amounts overpaid in a
calendar year that exceed $1.
For purposes of this section, the phrase "combined rate" shall mean the aggregate annual
rate of the local services tax levied by a school district and a municipality located in whole or
in part within the school district.

[Ord. 552, 11/26/2007, § 5]
All employers and self-employed individuals residing or having their places of business outside of the
Borough but who perform services of any type or kind or engage in any occupation or profession within

proceeding against either the employer or employee for the collection of this tax as hereinafter
provided. Provided, however, no person shall be subject to the payment of the local services tax to
more than one political subdivision during each payroll period. Each such taxpayer who first becomes

shall file the return and pay the tax on or before April 30 of the current tax year, and each such
taxpayer who first becomes subject to the tax after March 31 of the current tax year, shall file the return
and pay the tax on or before July 31 or October 31 of the current tax year, or January 31 of the
following year, whichever of such payment dates first occurs at least 30 days after the taxpayer
becomes subject to the tax.

pertaining to the Water and Sewer Departments, collect all water and sewer rents and accounts
and deposit same to the credit of the Borough of Edinboro in a depository designated by the

§ 26-102. Connections, Regulations, Metering and Repairs.
[Ord. 585, 9/12/2011]
Water Metering. All customers of the Water Department must take the same through a meter. This
meter shall be kept in repair at the expense of the user or owner of the property. In case any meter
fails to register from any cause, the amount charged for water during any one billing period shall
be estimated by the Borough Manager/Authorized Representative. Such estimate shall be based
upon the average amount registered during the like period. All water customers shall pay the
designated minimum. Any property with a structure will pay the designated minimum bill,
regardless if it is occupied or not. If the existing structure is removed the owner may either pay the
bimonthly minimum bill or a reinstatement fee per EDU for a replacement structure. All properties
with one or more regulated rental units shall pay at least the minimum usage rate for each unit.
Applications for Water Connection.
All applications for use of water must be made in writing to the Borough Manager by the
owner of the property to be benefitted or his authorized agent.
It shall be mandatory for every property within the Borough to be connected to the Borough
water system.
The water shall not be turned on permanently in any case until the Borough Manager is
satisfied that each and every rule relating to the subject has been complied with including the
payment of any and all connection/tapping fees.
Meter Installation. All meters shall be furnished by the Borough at actual cost, upon application
duly made to the Borough, in writing, by the owner of the property. The installation of all new
meters shall be the responsibility of the property owner and at the expense of property owner. The
Borough shall be notified within one working day of installation so as to perform an inspection. The

time. Water meters shall constitute one unit consisting of both the inside and outside apparatus.
Any work performed by the Borough will be at the current approved rate and approved by the
Borough Manager.
Water Shutoff Policy.
The objective of this section shall be to provide incentive for customers to pay their water bills
in a timely manner and to consider those who truly have difficulty making payment of
delinquencies upon their accounts. As such, the policy provides a notification process to
encourage customers to pay their bills and allows for installment payment plans to be
developed for accounts which involve substantial sums to help those customers satisfy
delinquencies with regard to budgetary constraints.
The owner of the property ultimately shall be liable for any and all services, repairs, charges
and damages which are incurred or occur at the property, whether or not the same are
authorized by the owner. The owner shall further be responsible for all costs, charges,
collection fees, penalties, interest, liens and court costs and other sums assessed, imposed
or incurred in the event water bills are not paid in timely fashion. Such costs and charges shall
include, but are not limited to, collection fees assessed upon referral of a delinquent account
to the Borough and all charges imposed or incurred in collection, notifications, and
implementation of termination and/or restoration of water service in accordance with this
policy, general law regarding municipal claims and/or ordinances of the Borough of Edinboro.
Water rental shall be assessed on an every two-month basis and shall be deemed to be
assessed and payable as of 20 days from the mailing of billing. All fees not paid in full by 20
days following mailing shall be deemed delinquent, and penalties as established by resolution
shall be imposed immediately upon such unpaid account. All bills not paid in full within 30
days will be forwarded to the Borough Manager/Authorized Agent for shut off notification.
All accounts with a delinquent assessment of $25 or more shall be subject to a shut off
notification. Upon review the Borough Manager/Authorized Representative may authorize
appropriate notification of shut off. A ten-day final notice shall/may be given such delinquents,
and if the bill remains unpaid, the water shall/may be shut off without further notice.
All costs incurred as a consequence of notices of termination and in connection with
termination of water service to properties for nonpayment of assessments shall be the sole
responsibility of the property owner, these costs including, but not limited to, certified mail and
service charges, charges incurred by the water provider in connection with termination, shut
off and restoration of services and charges imposed by the provider and representing lost
revenue during the period of service termination. All cost must be paid in full to the Borough
prior to restoration of water service to the premises. In addition, minimum bimonthly charges
shall assess during any period of water termination. Regardless, minimum charges shall be
assessed for shut-off and turn-on services.
Pennsylvania law and procedures of the applicable water authorities require notification to the
landlord and to tenants prior to termination of water service, such notification to be effected by
the applicable provider of water service.
As to all accounts delinquent as of the date of this Part, the Borough Manager/Authorized
Representative, shall initiate procedures to terminate water service to such properties
remaining delinquent 30 days after adoption of this policy, such procedures to be initiated only
as accounts having delinquencies of $25 or more as provided herein, unless the owners shall
by such date have entered into binding and written agreements providing for repayment of all
sums due, with interest of 10% within 12 months by means of equal monthly installments, all
such agreements to provide as well as that all water assessed during the term thereof shall
be paid timely and in full.

Failure of a property owner to satisfy all sums due or to enter into an appropriate written
repayment agreement shall result in procedures to terminate water service to the property.
In the event any person or entity shall enter into an agreement and fail to comply fully with its
provisions, the Borough Manager/Authorized Representative, upon the 10 days' prior written
notice, shall initiate procedures to terminate water service to the property. Failure to make
payment of an installment within 10 days after it is due or to pay promptly all currently
assessed rental shall be deemed default without any obligation of the Borough to give any
notices or demands.
Should any property owner assert a claim that he, she, it by virtue of financial hardship not
caused by the applicant, is unable to satisfy the account's delinquency within 12 months, such
person shall submit application for relief to the Borough Manager prior to the 90 days after
adoption of this policy. Any applicant for relief on the ground of hardship must supply to the
Borough Manager, with the certification of hardship, a written authorization form allowing the
Borough Manager to obtain information concerning the applicant, such authorization to be
pursuant to that form. In such event, the Borough Manager shall consider such applications
and have authority in proper cases to deny relief or, where appropriate, to allow for extended
periods of time in which a property owner may satisfy the account delinquency. All repayment
agreements must provide for prompt payment of all rental assessed during the repayment
term and for payment in equal monthly installments of delinquent rental. In no event may a
repayment term extend longer than 36 months, terms duration to be based upon the amount
of the delinquency and the applicant's financial circumstances as substantiated to the
Borough Manager, whose decision shall be final. No such request shall be considered without
provision by the applicant of all information requested and the authorization to obtain
additional information.
All water rents and charges shall have a lien upon the lots and building or buildings until paid
and the owner of the lot or lots and building or buildings upon which the meter is placed shall
be liable for the water rents and charges even if the premises using the meter are rented to a
tenant.
Service Outside Municipality. The Council of the Borough of Edinboro hereby authorizes and
directs its proper officers to enter into and execute a contract or contracts with such municipalities
for the furnishing or supplying them in emergencies, or otherwise, with water, providing such
contracts do not infringe, in any way, upon the requisite supply demanded by the public within the
geographical limits of the Borough of Edinboro, said water to be charged for at rate not less than
the prevailing Borough rate, created and fixed by this Part. All connections outside of the host
municipality shall be charged a onetime connection fee. This sum is for the purpose of recouping
original construction cost of the system. All requests for service extension shall be first
recommended by the Borough Manager and approved by majority vote of the Borough Council.
No connections shall be made until Council approval has been received and a formal agreement
is made with the municipality to be serviced. The Borough Council reserves the right to deny any
request for services.
Water Connection Regulations.
The service line from the curb stop to and including the premise shall be the responsibility of
the property owner. This service line shall be kept in good condition by the property owner
under penalty of discontinuation of water service by the Borough. The customer shall be
responsible for the maintenance and repair of the service line from the curb stop, including
the customer's premises.
Service lines will not be installed when the service line passes over or through premises
which at the time may be the property of persons other than the owner of the premises to be
supplied, unless the owner of the premises supplied assumes all liability and furnishes a rightof-
way agreement in a form satisfactory to the Council or its duly authorized representative.

All breaks or blockages in the water service line must be repaired immediately (within 24
hours) by the property owner. The service line installed by the customer shall not be less in
size and quality than prescribed by the Borough and shall be installed not less than the
required depth below the surface as specified by the Borough and shall not be covered until
the water line is inspected by the Borough. If any defects in workmanship or material are
found, water service shall not be turned on until such defects are remedied. All plumbing
connections shall be installed in accordance with the plumbing code in force at the time of the
installation of the service line.
The Borough Manager/Authorized Representative reserves the right to inspect the plumbing
on any premises and, if it shall be found not in conformity with the rules of the Borough, to
refuse water service until the objectionable or improper work is corrected.
All landlords are required to notify the Borough within 15 days of any change in customer
account information. This would include any change in tenant information and/or billing
address.
No person but an authorized employee of the Borough shall tap any main or distributing pipe,
unless approved by the Borough Manager.
No tap will be made on any water main unless written permission is provided by the Borough
Manager/Authorized Representative.
Every street connection shall be provided with a curb stop and curb box at the approximate
property line of each property to control the entire water supply from each street connection
and to drain all pipes and fixtures on the premises. The curb stop and curb box at the property
line are the property of the Borough, placed there for its use.
All service lines installed from the property line to the meter or meters must be at least four
feet below the surface of the ground.
Where water pipe is put into buildings having front areas, it must be carried down in the street
four feet outside the area wall to three feet below the floor of the area and pass under the
floor at that depth.
In addition to the curb stop at the street connection every service pipe must have a separate
shutoff valve equipped with a drain inside the premises controlling the supply of water to the
meter. It must be so placed and kept so as to be always ready for use. It must control the
entire water supply and drain all pipes and fixtures on said premises. Service requirements
are a meter that will produce a radio read signal, a back-flow assembly on the incoming line
and an expansion tank to offset thermal expansion.
Whenever two or more parties are supplied by the same service pipe, the failure of any one of
the users to pay water rents when due, or to comply with any rule or regulation, shall
authorize the Borough Water Department to turn the water off from said pipe until the rates,
terms and conditions, rules and regulations are complied with. If discovered by the Borough
that there is only one shutoff the landlord will be required to add additional shutoffs at his cost.
Premises intended to be occupied by more than one establishment, firm or family must be
provided with an independent shutoff equipped with a drain located before each meter, for
each office, store, floor, apartment or set of apartments into which water is introduced, so that
any portion of the same which may be separately occupied can be drained without interfering
with the supply of the other occupants. If there is more than one unit, and the renters are
paying the water bill, there must be separate plumbing and a separate meter for each unit.
Pipes and fixtures must be placed and arranged in such a manner as will secure them against
freezing. Whenever it may become necessary to carry pipes along outer walls, beneath floors,
through open spaces or places where they may be affected by drafts of air, they must be

thoroughly boxed and packed, or otherwise protected against the cold. All pipes must be free
from jogs and sags that will obstruct the drainage, be securely fastened to their places and so
pitched that when the shutoff is turned off all water will flow toward the equipped drain, as
required in this Part.
Whenever a complaint is made by any water customer that their water supply has been
disrupted, a representative of the Water Department will investigate the reason for the
disruption. If the source of the cause of the problem is in the Borough's supply system, then
the repair will be performed by the Water Department. If the source of the problem is in the
customer's supply system, then the repair is the responsibility of the customer. If the water
customer still insist that the fault is with the pipe or pipes of the Borough, an agreement will
first be made that the complaining party shall pay all expense in case the trouble is found to
have originated with their portion of the water system. Should the fault prove to be with the
pipes of the Borough Water Department no charges shall be made against the water
customer and they shall be refunded the amount of the plumber's bill from the preliminary
examination, provided the amount is reasonable, of which the Borough Manager shall be sole
judge.
The Water Department shall furnish no material for use on private premises and do no work
thereon except at the cost of the party benefitted and approved by the Borough Manager.
Extension of Water Service.
Extension of the water main and/or distributing pipes shall only be made after petition by the
real estate owners, or their authorized agents, along the line proposed and upon their
entering into an agreement with the Borough. The property owners/authorized agents will
install all water main extensions, hydrants, main valves and house lines. All construction will
be in accordance with Edinboro Borough regulations and applicable building codes and
inspected by the Borough agents and approved by the Zoning Office at the owners cost prior
to any building permits being issued.
All pipe installed in the streets shall be installed in accordance with the Borough
specifications, applicable building codes, copies of which may be obtained from the Borough
Manager.
Reserved Rights and Inspection. The customer's premises shall be open at all reasonable times
upon notice by the Water Department/Authorized Representatives for the purposes of conducting
surveys and investigations, inspecting pipes and fixtures, reading meters, turning off and on water
and enforcing rules generally, including water use practices within the customer's premises.
Insufficient Supply. The Borough Council may limit or stop the supply of water in cases of
emergency and shut it off for repairs or extensions, they, being the judges of the time and
necessity. The Borough of Edinboro shall not be liable in damages for any insufficient supply of
Borough water.
§ 26-103. Special Uses.
[Ord. 585, 9/12/2011]
Special Uses. The supply pipe to each outdoor fountain shall be furnished with a special curb stop
at the curb, if practicable, which shall always be under the control of the Borough Manager.
Outdoor fountains will only be allowed to flow between the 15th day of May and 1st day of October
of each year. Faucets to public drinking fountains shall be self-closing of a style approved by the

§ 26-104. Backflow and Cross-Connection Control Plan.
[Ord. 585, 9/12/2011]
Purpose. The purpose of this section is:
To protect the public water supply system from contamination or pollution by isolating within
the customer's water system contaminants or pollutants which could backflow through the
service connection into the public water supply system.
To prohibit cross-connections, actual or potential, between the public potable water system
and any non-potable water source or system.
To provide for the maintenance of a continuing program of cross-connection control which will
systematically and effectively prevent the contamination or pollution of the public and the
customer's potable water system.
Application. This section shall apply to all premises (commercial and noncommercial) served by
the public water supply system of the Edinboro Water Department.
Policy. The Water Department and the customer have the joint responsibility for the protection of
the public water supply system from contamination due to backflow of contaminants through the
water service connection. All properties that receive water from the Water Department shall install
backflow preventers, and the type of preventer will be determined by the severity of the health
hazard. The Water Department shall give notice to the customer to install such approved backflow
prevention device and/or assembly at each service connection to his premises. The customer
shall immediately install such approved device and/or assemblies and failure, refusal or inability
on the part of the consumer to install such device or assembly shall constitute grounds for
discontinuing water service to the premises until such device or assembly have been installed.
Water System.
The water system shall be considered as made up of two parts: the Water Department system
and the customer's water system.
The public water system shall consist of the source facilities and the distribution system and
shall include all those facilities of the public water supply system under the control of the
Water Department up to the point where the customer's water system begins.
The source shall include all components of the facilities utilized in the production, treatment,
storage and delivery of water to the public distribution system.
The public distribution system shall include the network of water lines used for delivery of
water from the source to the customer's water system.
The customer's water system shall include all facilities beyond the service connection, which
are utilized in conveying water from the public distribution system to points of use.
Cross-Connections Prohibited.
No water service connection shall be installed or maintained to any premises where actual or
potential cross-connections to the public water supply cross-connections are abated or

controlled to the satisfaction of the Borough Manager.
No connection shall be installed or maintained whereby water from an auxiliary water supply
may enter a public or customer's water system. Unless such auxiliary water supply and the
method of connection and use of such supply shall have been approved by the Borough
Manager/Authorized Representative.
Survey and Investigations.
The customer's premises shall be open at all reasonable times upon notice by the Water
Department/Authorized Representative for the purposes of conducting surveys and
investigations of water use practices within the customer's premises to determine whether
there are direct or indirect pollutants could backflow into the public potable water system.
On request by the Borough Manager/Authorized Representative, the customer shall furnish
information on water use practices within his premises.
It shall be the responsibility of the water customer to conduct periodic surveys of water use
practices on his premises to determine whether there are actual or potential crossconnections
to his water system through which contaminants or pollutants could backflow into
the public water supply system.
Where Protection is Required.
An approved backflow prevention device and/or assembly shall be installed prior to the first
branch line leading off each service line to a customer's water system.
An approved backflow prevention device and/or assembly shall be installed on each service
line to a customer's water system where the following conditions exist, the type of protection
to be determined by the following conditions:
Systems having an auxiliary water supply, even if such system has been accepted as an
additional source by the Edinboro Water Department and approved by the Pennsylvania
Department of Environmental Protection (DEP).
Systems where any substance is handled that may create an actual or potential hazard
to the public water supply system. This shall include systems having sources or auxiliary
systems containing process fluids or water originating from the public water supply
system, which are no longer under the sanitary control of the water purveyor.
Systems having internal cross-connections that, in the judgment of the Borough
Manager/Authorized Representative, are not correctable or intricate plumbing
arrangements which make it impractical to determine whether or not cross-connections
exist.
Systems where, because of security requirements or other prohibitions or restrictions, it
is impossible or impractical to make a complete cross-connection survey.
Others specified by the Water Department.
An approved backflow prevention device and/or assembly shall be installed on each service
line to a customer's water system.
Type of Protection Required.
The type of protection required under Subsection 7 shall depend on the degree of hazard
which exists as follows:

Reduced pressure principal backflow assemblies must be installed above ground in a heated
building or hot box unless you provide a one piece water tight concrete vault with sump
pumps that will have adequate sized drains to handle the relief port. Provide adequate lighting
to permit maintenance inspection and testing of the backflow assembly.
When installing a backflow prevention device and/or assembly, the installer must comply and
be aware of all safety considerations when installations are performed. Major safety
considerations are thermal expansion and device discharge damage. Thermal expansion can
cause hot water tanks and other storage vessels to explode when there are no provisions
made for thermal expansion. In many cases it may be necessary to install a thermal
expansion tank on hot water heaters to prevent the hot water's relief valve from discharging
or, more importantly, to keep the tank from exploding.
Many backflow prevention devices and/or assemblies discharge large amounts of water for
various reasons. This discharge of water could pose a hazard when the valves are
discharging onto or around electrical equipment. Equipment damage or electrocution could
occur. The installer must ensure that valve discharge will not cause safety hazards or
property damage.
Inspection and Maintenance.
It shall be the duty of the customer to have inspections, tests and overhaul made in
accordance with the following schedule, or more often where inspections indicate a need:
Air separation shall be inspected at the time of installation and at least every 12 months
thereafter.
Residential dual check devices will be replaced every five years, at the expense of the
property owner. The Water Department will notify residents when it is time to replace the
backflow device. The owner will have 30 days from the date of the notice to pick up the
valve from the Borough and either install it or have it installed, owner shall return the old
unit to the Borough to prove that it has been replaced. Check valves above one inch will
be testable double check valves assemblies and follow the same inspection schedule as
reduced pressure principal assemblies (see below).
Reduced pressure zone assemblies must be inspected and tested for tightness at the
time of installation and at least every 12 months thereafter. These assemblies shall be
dismantled, inspected internally, cleaned, and repaired whenever needed and at least
every three years.
Interchangeable connections must be inspected at the time of installation and at least
every 12 months thereafter.
Inspections, tests and overhaul of backflow prevention devices and/or assemblies shall be
made at the expense of the water customer and shall be performed by a person certified to
inspect, test or overhaul backflow prevention devices.
All inspections in this section must be done by a certified backflow tester whose certificate
must be on file in the Borough Office. If not they must send it with the test results or they will
not count. Each backflow tester must recertify every three years.
Whenever backflow prevention devices and/or assemblies required by these regulations are
found to be defective, they shall be repaired or replaced at the expense of the customer
without delay.
The water customer with service lines above one inch must maintain a complete record of
each backflow prevention device and/or assembly from purchase to retirement. This shall
include a comprehensive listing that includes a record of all tests, inspections and repairs.

[Ord. 457, 1/31/1994, § 301]
A map entitled the "Edinboro Borough Zoning Map" is hereby adopted as part of this chapter. The
Zoning Map shall be kept on file and be available for examination at the Borough offices.
§ 27-302. Zoning Districts.
[Ord. 457, 1/31/1994, § 302]
The Borough is divided into the districts set forth by this chapter and as shown by the district
boundaries on the Zoning Map. The districts are:
A-Agricultural District. It is the intent of this district to establish and preserve areas for
agricultural and low-density outdoor recreation uses that do not significantly change the
natural character of the land or attract large numbers of people.
U-University District. The University District is established to preserve areas occupied by the
University of Edinboro and facilitate their use by that institution.
RC-Recreation District. The purpose of this District is to preserve public recreational areas
owned by the Borough of Edinboro for the beneficial use of its citizens and to recognize and
protect the integrity of adjacent residential areas.
Residential Districts. Districts designated for residential use are for dwellings and uses
normally associated with residential neighborhoods. The specific purpose for each of the
residential districts is as follows:
R-1 and R-1A Single-Family Residential Districts. These zones are for single-family
dwellings and related uses. Uses for these two districts are similar; however, a higher
developmental density is permitted in the R-1A District.

G.
R-2 Single-Family and Limited Multi-family Residential District. This district is established
to provide an area of single-family and limited multi-family dwellings as a varied
residential district.
R-3 Lakeside Residential District. The purpose of this district is to accommodate
development in the Lakeside District of Edinboro.
R-4 Multi-family Residential District. The intent of this district is to establish an area for a
variety of housing types and provide for more intense residential densities as may be
required for apartment and townhouse development.
RLB-Residential Limited Use District. This zone is designed to permit a variety of residential
and limited business uses in the Borough. Its purpose is to afford limited commercial activities
which are amenable to residential uses while preserving the character of an established
residential area. As it is the intent of this chapter to preserve the residential character of the
neighborhood, generally nonresidential uses (listed under special exceptions in Table 27-306-
1) will only be allowed in converted residences.
Commercial District. The commercial districts are designed to provide for needed commercial
and related activities within the Borough:
C-1 Downtown Business District. This district is specifically designed for the existing
downtown Edinboro business district. It allows for a wide range of commercial, upper
floor residential and related uses while recognizing the physical limitations of this already
built up area. Most off-street parking and loading/unloading requirements are eliminated
for this zone.
C-2 Periphery Business District. This district is designed to accommodate a wide range
of commercial, residential and related uses.
I-1 Industrial District. The Industrial District is designed to allow space for existing and new
development to support the Borough's economic life. Development within this zone is
expected to be of a quality that will be compatible with surrounding land use. It is specifically
aimed at light manufacturing, fabrication, wholesale uses, nonhazardous research and
development and similar activities.
§ 27-303. Annexed Areas.
[Ord. 457, 1/31/1994, § 303]
Any territory hereafter annexed by the Borough of Edinboro will be automatically zoned R-1, until
otherwise classified by the Borough.
§ 27-304. District Boundaries.
[Ord. 457, 1/31/1994, § 304]
District boundaries that are shown between the lines of streets, streams, and transportation right-ofways,
shall be deemed to follow the center lines. The vacation of streets shall not affect the locations
of such district boundaries. When the Zoning Officer cannot definitely determine the location of a
district boundary by such center lines, by the scale or dimensions stated on the Zoning Map, or by the
fact that it clearly coincides with a property line, he shall refuse action and the Zoning Hearing Board,
upon appeal, shall interpret the location of the district boundary with reference to the scale of the
Zoning Map and the purpose set forth in all relevant provisions of this chapter.
§ 27-305. Zoning District Changes.
8/12/2020 Borough of Edinboro, PA Ecode360

Board may attach reasonable conditions and safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement the
purpose of this chapter and protect the neighborhood. Conditional uses may be granted or denied by
Borough Council pursuant to the recommendations of the Edinboro Planning Commission and the
express standards and conditions of this chapter. In allowing a conditional use, the Borough Council
may attach such reasonable conditions and safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement the
purposes of this chapter and protect the neighborhood. Uses in each category shall be according to

Part 4. SUPPLEMENTARY REGULATIONS
§ 27-401. Nonconforming Uses and Structures.
[Ord. 457, 1/31/1994, § 401; as amended by Ord. 561, 5/12/2008, § 3]
The following provisions shall apply to all nonconforming uses and structures. It is the intention of
Edinboro Borough that all legal nonconforming uses and structures shall be able to continue;
however, all changes in such uses shall only be as allowed in this Part:
Any nonconforming use may be continued, or may be changed to a use of the same or a
more restrictive classification. The nonconforming use may not be extended or expanded
unless to a conforming use, except as permitted by the Board in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter.
Any nonconforming structure or building or sign which has been damaged or destroyed by fire
or any other means may be reconstructed and used as before, if such reconstruction is
performed within six months of discontinuance of use and if the restored building covers no
greater area and contains no greater cubic content. If approved by the Board, a reconstructed
structure or building may exceed its original lot coverage and cubic content but must meet the

minimum yard requirements of the district in which the structure is located, and it must meet
the off-street parking and loading requirements of this chapter.
Except as provided for in § 27-401, Subsection 1C(1) through (4) in the event that any
nonconforming use conducted in a structure, or otherwise, ceases, for whatever reasons, for
a period of 1 year, such nonconforming use shall not be resumed and any further use shall be
in conformity with the provisions of this chapter.
[Amended by Ord. No. 613, 1/7/2019]
For a period beginning on January 1, 2019 and terminating on January 1, 2022, the
above § 27-401, Subsection 1C shall not apply to regulated rental unit(s), currently
licensed as a "student house," located within the Edinboro Borough that currently
maintain a nonconforming use status.
If a nonconforming use in a regulated rental unit ceases during the three (3) year period
identified above, the regulated rental unit shall not lose its nonconforming use status.
No later than January 1, 2021, the Borough Manager of the Edinboro Borough shall notify
all affected owners of regulated rental units whether the period referenced in § 27-401,
Subsection 1C(1) shall be extended and if so, the term for which it shall be extended.
Unless the Borough Council acts to extend the period referenced in § 27-401, Subsection
1C(1) for an additional period of years, § 27-401, Subsection 1C(1) through (3) shall
sunset as of January 1, 2022.
The nonconforming use of a structure or building may be extended throughout those parts
thereof which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of adoption of
this chapter. A nonconforming building or structure may be enlarged or replaced if such
expansion does not occupy an area greater than 50% more than the structure occupied prior
to such expansion, enlargement or reconstruction. Furthermore, such activities must meet all
regulations, including but not limited to, the minimum yard regulations and height restrictions
of the district in which the structure is located, and must meet all other off-street parking and
loading requirements of this chapter.
Nothing contained herein shall require any change in the overall layout, plans, construction,
size or designated use of any development, building, structure or part thereof for which official
approval and required permits have been granted prior to the effective date of this chapter
and where construction is complete within six months from the date of issuance of the permit.
Once changed to a conforming use, no structure or land shall be permitted to revert to a
nonconforming use.
Whenever the boundaries of a district shall be changed so as to transfer an area from one
district to another of a different classification, this Part shall also apply to any uses or
structures which thereby become nonconforming.
§ 27-402. Existing Lots of Record.
[Ord. 457, 1/31/1994, § 402]
Any lot of record existing at the effective date of this chapter, and held in separate ownership different
from the ownership of adjoining lots, may be used for the erection of a structure conforming to the use
regulations of the district in which it is located even though its lot area and width are less than the
minimum required by this chapter; however, such lot must comply with the yard, height and coverage
standards of the zoning district wherein it is located. Any multi-family use must meet the appropriate
density standards of the zoning district. Where two or more adjacent lots of record with less than the
required area and width are held by one owner, on or before the date of enactment of this chapter, the
request for a permit shall be referred to the Zoning Hearing Board which may require replatting to

the existing structure has a front yard less than the minimum depth required, the minimum front
yard shall be the average depth of the front yard of the existing structure on the adjacent lot and
the minimum depth required for the district; where structures exist on both adjacent lots, the
minimum depth of the front yard shall be the average depth of the front yards of the existing
adjacent structures.
All structures, whether attached to the principal structure or not, and whether open or enclosed,
including porches, carports, balconies or platforms above normal grade level, shall not project into
any minimum front, side or rear yards except as noted in this subsection, Subsection 3 and
Subsection 4. Overhangs of up to 18 inches will be allowed (see illustration). Steps to exterior
doors will be permitted (see illustration). A chimney may project not more than two feet into a
required yard. Bay windows and balconies may project not more than two feet into a required
yard.
A wall or fence under six feet six inches in height and paved terraces without walls, roofs or other
enclosures may be erected within the limits of any yard. Retaining walls and fences required for
screening under this chapter are not subject to the six-foot high limitation. Fences may be
permitted in front yard areas provided they are no higher than three feet and do not obstruct the
required free sight triangle at intersections. (See the Borough's subdivision regulations relative to
intersection sight distance [Chapter 22]). Fences shall be constructed in accordance with Borough
codes. Fences shall not be electrified, use spikes, broken glass, barbed wire or similar material
designed to injure persons who attempt to climb them.
Swimming pools shall be permitted in rear yards only; provided, that the pool is located not less
than 10 feet from any side yard line, and 10 feet from the rear yard line. (See also § 27-410.)

orientation of development (designation of front and rear yard) shall follow existing usage. Where
no other through lots exist nearby, both frontages shall be considered front yards.
For corner lots, the short frontage shall be considered the front yard, the long frontage shall be
considered a side yard. Where frontage measurements are equal the dominant orientation of
surrounding properties shall determine the front yard.
§ 27-404. Temporary Structures.
[Ord. 457, 1/31/1994, § 404]
Temporary structures in conjunction with construction work shall be permitted only during the period
that the construction work is in progress. Permits for temporary structures shall be issued for a sixmonth
period.

to provide parking on the same lot with the principal use.
Screening and Landscaping. Off-street parking areas for more than five vehicles, and offstreet
loading areas, shall be effectively screened (see definition of "screening") on any
side which adjoins a residential district or use. In addition, there shall be a planting strip
of at least five feet between the front lot line and the parking lot. Such planting strip shall
be suitably landscaped and maintained.
Minimum Distance and Setbacks. No off-street loading or parking area for more than five
vehicles shall be closer than five feet to any adjoining property line containing a dwelling,
residential district, school, hospital or similar institution.

loading areas and access drives shall have a paved or oiled surface, graded with positive
drainage to dispose of surface water. Parking areas larger than 10,000 square feet shall
submit a plan, including drainage provisions, to the Borough for approval. Lots shall be
designed to provide for orderly and safe loading and parking.

Planning Code, 53 P.S. § 10101 et seq., rule or regulation shall contain a reference to the
provision relied on and the reasons why the conclusion is deemed appropriate in the light of
the facts found.
Where the Borough Council fails to render the decision within the period required by the
subsection or fails to commence, conduct or complete the required hearing as provided in
§ 27-607, the decision shall be deemed to have been rendered in favor of the applicant
unless the applicant has agreed in writing or on the record to an extension of time. When a
decision has been rendered in favor of the applicant because of the failure of the Borough
Council to meet or render a decision as hereinabove provided, the Borough Council shall give
public notice of the decision within 10 days from the last day it could have met to render a
decision in the same manner as required by the public notice requirements of this chapter and

The parties to the hearing shall be the Borough, any person affected by the application who

the hearing officer. Where the Board fails to render the decision within the period required by
this chapter or the Municipalities Planning Code, or fails to hold the required hearing within 60
days from the date of the applicant's request for a hearing, the decision shall be deemed to
have been rendered in favor of the applicant unless the applicant has agreed in writing or on
the record to an extension of time. When a decision has been rendered in favor of the
applicant because of the failure of the Board to meet or render a decision as herein above

decision or findings and a statement of the place at which the full decision or findings may be
examined.
§ 27-608. Board's Functions.

Appeals from a determination by the Borough Engineer or the Zoning Officer with reference to the
administration of any floodplain or flood hazard ordinance or such provisions within a land use
ordinance.
Applications for variances from the terms of the zoning ordinance and flood hazard ordinance or
such provisions within a land use ordinance, pursuant to § 910.2 of the Municipalities Planning
Code, 53 P.S. § 10910.2 and Subsection 8 of this section.

Code, 53 P.S. § 10916.2.
Appeals from the determination of the Zoning Officer or municipal engineer in the administration of
any land use ordinance or provision thereof with reference to sedimentation and erosion control
and stormwater management insofar as the same relate to development not involving Article V or
VII applications of the Municipalities Planning Code, §§ 10501 et seq., 10701 et seq.
Variances. The Board shall hear requests for variances where it is alleged that the provisions of
this chapter inflict unnecessary hardship upon the applicant. The Board may by rule prescribe the
form of application and may require preliminary application to the Zoning Officer. The Board may
grant a variance provided that all of the following findings are made where relevant in a given
case:
There are unique physical circumstances or conditions, including irregularity, narrowness or
shallowness of lot size or shape, or exceptional topographical or other physical conditions
peculiar to the particular property, and that the unnecessary hardship is due to such
conditions, and not the circumstances or conditions generally created by the provisions of this
chapter in the neighborhood or district in which the property is located.
Because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is no possibility that the property
can be developed in strict conformity with the provisions of this chapter and that the
authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of the
property.
Such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the applicant.
The variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential character of the neighborhood or district
in which the property is located, nor substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or
development of adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the public welfare.
The variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum variance that will afford relief and will
represent the least modification possible of the regulation in issue. In granting any variance,
the Board may attach such reasonable conditions and safeguards as it may deem necessary
to implement the purpose of this chapter.
Special Exceptions. The Board shall hear and decide requests for special exceptions in
accordance with the standards and criteria of this chapter. In granting a special exception, the
Board may attach such reasonable conditions and safeguards, in addition to those expressed in
the chapter, as it may deem necessary to implement the purposes of this chapter and the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. § 10101 et seq.

No person shall be allowed to file any proceeding with the Board later than 30 days after an application
for development, preliminary or final, has been approved by an appropriate Borough officer, agency or
body if such proceeding is designed to secure reversal or to limit the approval in any manner unless
such person alleges and proves that he had no notice, knowledge or reason to believe that such
approval had been given. If such person has succeeded to his interest after such approval, he shall be
bound by the knowledge of his predecessor in interest. See also § 914.1 of the Municipalities Planning
Code, 53 P.S. § 10914.1.
§ 27-611. Stay of Proceedings.
[Ord. 457, 1/31/1994, § 611]
Upon filing of any proceeding referred to in § 27-608 and during its pendency before the Board, all land
development pursuant to any challenged ordinance, order or approval of the Zoning Officer or of any
agency or body, and all official action thereunder shall be stayed unless the Zoning Officer or any other
appropriate agency or body certifies to the Board facts indicating that such stay would cause imminent
peril to life or property, in which case the development or official action shall not be stayed otherwise
than by a restraining order, which may be granted by the Board or by the court having jurisdiction of
zoning appeals on petition after notice to the Zoning Officer or other appropriate agency or body. See

[Ord. 457, 1/31/1994, § 705; as amended by Ord. 545, 2/26/2007, § 27-702; and by Ord. 585,
9/12/2011]
A landowner who desires to challenge on substantive grounds the validity of this chapter or the
Zoning Map, or any provision thereof, which prohibits or restricts the use or development of land in
which he has an interest may submit a curative amendment to the Borough Council with a written
request that his challenge and proposed amendment be heard and decided as provided in § 916.1
of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Code (hereinafter "MPC"), 53 P.S. § 10916.1. The Borough
Council shall commence a hearing thereon within 60 days of the request as provided in § 916.1 of
the MPC, 53 P.S. § 10916.1. The curative amendment and challenge shall be referred to the
Edinboro Planning Commission and the Erie County Planning Department as provided in § 609
and notice of the hearing thereon shall be given as provided in §§ 610 and 916.1 of the MPC, 53
P.S. §§ 10609, 10610 and 10916.1.
The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with § 908 of the MPC, 53 P.S. § 10908, and all
references therein to the Zoning Hearing Board shall, for purposes of this section, be references to
the Borough Council; provided, however, that the provisions of § 908(1.2) and (9) of the MPC, 53

decision shall not result in a declaration of invalidity for this entire chapter and Zoning Map, but
only for those provisions which specifically relate to the landowner's curative amendment and
challenge.
The Borough Council, if it determines that a validity challenge has merit, may accept a
landowner's curative amendment, with or without revision, or may adopt an alternative
amendment which will cure the challenged defects. The Borough Council shall consider the
curative amendments, plans and explanatory material submitted by the landowner and shall also
consider:

If the Borough determines that this chapter, or any portion hereof, is substantially invalid, it shall
take the following actions:
The Borough shall declare by formal action this chapter or portions hereof substantially invalid
and propose to prepare a curative amendment to overcome such invalidity. Within 30 days of

report requested under §§ 909.1 or 916.1 of the MPC. 53 P.S. §§ 10909.1, 10916.1, subsequent
to the declaration and proposal based upon grounds identical or substantially similar to those

Part 8. PLANNED RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT
§ 27-801. Planned Residential Development.
[Ord. 457, 1/31/1994, § 801; as amended by Ord. 545, 2/26/2007, § 27-801; and by Ord. 585,
9/12/2011]
Purpose. The purpose of the planned residential development regulations is to encourage the
flexibility in the design and development of land in order to promote its most appropriate use; to
encourage grouping of housing and a mixture of housing types in alternative patterns and in a
variety of ways; to facilitate the adequate and economical provision of streets and utilities; and to
preserve the natural and scenic qualities of open areas. Planned residential developments are
permitted in the R-2 District.
Minimum Development Size. No planned residential development may include fewer than 10
acres of contiguous land.
General Standards. The planned residential development must meet all of the following
general standards:
The planned residential development is consistent with the Comprehensive Plan and this
chapter's statement of community development objectives.
The planned residential development is an effective and unified treatment of the
development possibilities on the project site, and the development plan makes
appropriate provision for the preservation of streams and stream banks, wetlands,
wooded cover, rough terrain, and similar areas.
The planned residential development shall be planned and developed to harmonize with
any existing or proposed development in the area surrounding the project site.
Performance bond for all improvements in the development must be posted as required
in the Edinboro Subdivision Ordinance [Chapter 22].
Connection to Edinboro sanitary sewer system shall be required.
Connection to public water supplies will be required.

Applicable Districts and Uses Permitted. Planned residential developments may be approved
in the R-2 Residential District and may include the following additional uses: multiple family
dwellings and related uses. Such additional uses shall be allowed only to the extent that the
Borough finds them to be compatibly and harmoniously incorporated into the design of the
planned development. (Mobile homes and mobile home parks are excluded from the planned
residential development district.)
Calculations of Project Densities. The number of dwelling units which may be constructed
within the planned residential development shall be determined by dividing the gross project
area by the required lot area per dwelling unit which is required in the R-2 District.
Increase in Density. It is recognized that the expense of complying with the approval process
contained in the planned residential development regulations may discourage developers
from seeking approval of a planned residential development project. At the time the outline or
preliminary development plan is filed, the applicant may apply for an increase in the densities
permitted by the zone in which the planned residential development is to be constructed. If it
gives its approval to the planned residential development, the Borough Council may authorize
the developer to increase permitted densities by an amount up to 10%. Additional increase in
density may be granted up to 27% providing:
If common open space is developed to more intense usable open space providing
facilities for active outdoor recreation, such as playgrounds, playground equipment,
picnic facilities, ball fields and equipment or other similar improvements to the open
space, an additional 10% increase in density may be permitted.
If Subsection 1E(1), above, is developed and unique indoor-outdoor buildings, to be used
for recreation or other similar activities of the residents of the development, such as
swimming pools, club houses, or other similar buildings are provided, then an additional
17% increase in density may be permitted.
Lot Size and Spacing of Buildings. The location of all structures shall be as shown on final
plans. The proposed location and arrangement shall not be detrimental to existing or
prospective adjacent dwellings or to the existing or prospective development of the
neighborhood. There shall be no minimum lot size, no minimum or maximum percentage of
lot coverage and no minimum lot width in the planned residential development. However,
every single-family dwelling shall have access to a public street, court, walkway, or other area
dedicated to public use. No dwelling and no addition to any dwellings shall be erected within a
distance of less than the height of the highest adjacent building. Vehicular access to dwellings
by means of adequate service drives and/or emergency entrances shall be provided in all
cases where dwellings do not front on a public street, or where the Borough deems necessary
for public safety.
Perimeter Requirements. The requirements of this section apply only to structures located
within 200 feet of the perimeter of a planned residential development. If topographical or other
barriers do not provide adequate privacy for existing uses adjacent to the planned residential
development, the Planning Commission may require either or both of the following:
Structures located on the perimeter of the planned residential development must be set
back by a distance sufficient to protect the privacy and amenity of adjacent existing uses,
in no case less than the height of the buildings.
Structures located on the perimeter of the planned residential development must be
permanently screened in a manner which is sufficient to protect the privacy and amenity
of adjacent existing uses.
Common Open Space Required. The development plan will contain areas to be allocated for
common open space which satisfy the standards governing the usability and quality of
common open space that is contained in this chapter. No open area may be accepted as

common open space under the provisions of this chapter unless it meets the following
standards:
A minimum of three acres of common open space shall be provided including usable and
scenic green space for the first 10 acres plus one acre for each additional five acres or
fraction thereof of gross project area.
The location, shape, size, and character of the common open space must be suitable for
the planned residential development.
Common open space must be suitably improved for its intended use, but common open
space containing natural features worthy of preservation may be left unimproved. The
building, structures, and improvements which are permitted in the common open space
must be appropriate to the uses which are authorized for the common open space and
must conserve and enhance the amenities of the common open space having regard to
its topography and unimproved condition.
The development schedule which is part of the development plan must coordinate the
improvement of the common open space, the construction of buildings, structures, and
improvements in the common open space and the construction of residential dwellings in
the planned residential development.
If the final development plan provides for buildings, structures and improvements in the
common open space of a value in excess of $10,000, the developer must provide a bond
in the estimated amount of the improvements assuring that the buildings, structures and
improvements will be completed. The Borough Council shall release the bond or other
assurance when the buildings, structures or improvements have been completed
according to the development plan.
Conveyance and Maintenance of Common Space. All land shown on the final development
plan as common open space must be conveyed under one of the following options:
It may be conveyed to a public agency which will agree to maintain the common open
space and any buildings, structures or improvements which have been placed on it, in
which case the general public must have use of the open space.
It may be conveyed to trustees provided in an indenture establishing an association or
similar organization for the maintenance of the planned residential development. The
common open space must be conveyed to the trustees subject to covenants to be
approved by the Borough which restrict the common open space to the uses specified on
the final development plan, and which provide for the maintenance of the common open
space in a manner which assures its containing use for its intended purpose.
No common open space may be put to any use not specified in the final
development plan unless the final development plan has been amended to permit
that use. However, no change of use authorized under Subsection 1C may be
considered as a waiver of any of the covenants limiting the use of common open
space areas, and all rights to enforce these covenants against any use permitted are
expressly reserved.
If the common open space is not conveyed to a public agency, either one of the
following methods of enforcement must be provided:
The legal right to develop the common open space for the uses not specified in
the final development plan must be approved by the Borough.
The restrictions governing the use, improvement and maintenance of the
common open space must be stated as conditions to the conveyance of the

common open space, the fee title to the common open space to vest in a public
agency in the event of a substantial default in the stated conditions.
If the common open space is not conveyed to the Borough, or a public agency
approved by the Borough, the covenants governing the use, improvement and
maintenance of the common open space shall then be enforceable by the Borough,
and the instrument of conveyance shall so provide.
It is the purpose and intent of these regulations that the Borough shall have the
authority and powers to require the adequate maintenance of common open space
as set forth by Article VII of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning, 53 P.S.
§ 10701 et seq.
Application for Tentative Approval of Planned Residential Development. In order to provide an
expeditious method for processing a development plan for a planned residential development
under the provisions of this chapter, and to avoid the delay and uncertainty which would arise
if it were necessary to secure approval, by a multiplicity of procedures, of a plat of subdivision

of the planned residential development and subsequent modifications of the regulations
relating thereto, to the extent such modification is vested in the Borough, shall be
determined and established by the Borough Council with the advice of the Planning
Commission.
The provisions shall require only such information in the application as is reasonably
necessary to disclose to the Borough of Edinboro:
The location, size and topography of the site and the nature of the landowner's
interest in the land proposed to be developed.
The density of land use to be allocated to parts of the site to be developed.

Application for Final Approval.
An application for final approval may be for all the land included in a development plan or,
to the extent set forth in the tentative approval, for a section thereof. Said application
shall be made to the Zoning Officer of the municipality designated by this chapter within
one year of the official written communication granting tentative approval. The application
shall include any drawings, specifications, covenants, easements, performance bond,
and such other requirements as may be specified by this chapter, as well as any
conditions set forth in the official written communication at the time of tentative approval.
A public hearing on an application for final approval of the development plan, or the part
thereof, submitted for final approval, shall not be required provided the development plan
or the part thereof submitted for final approval is in compliance with the development plan
theretofore given tentative approval and with any specified conditions attached thereto.
The submission shall be reviewed by the Zoning Officer and the Planning Commission
for compliance prior to being forwarded to the Borough Council. This review is to take
place in 35 days.
In the event the application for final approval has been filed, together with all drawings,
specifications and other documents in support thereof, and as required by the chapter
and the official written communication of tentative approval, by the Borough shall, within
45 days from the date of the regular meeting of the Borough Council or the Planning
Commission, whichever first reviews the application, next following the date the
application is filed, grant such development plan final approval. Provided, however, that
should the next regular meeting occur more than 30 days following the filing of the
application, the forty-five-day period shall be measured from the 30th day following the
day the application has been filed.
In the event the development plan as submitted contains variations from the development
plan given tentative approval, the Borough may refuse to grant final approval and shall,
within 45 days from the date of the regular meeting of the Borough Council or Edinboro
Planning Commission, whichever first reviews the application, next following the date the
application is filed, so advise the landowner in writing of said refusal, setting forth in said
notice the reasons why one or more of said variations are not in the public interest.
Provided, however, that should the next regular meeting occur more than 30 days
following the filing of the application, the forty-five-day period shall be measured from the
30th day following the day the application has been filed. In the event of such refusal, the
landowner may either:
Refile his application for final approval without the variations objected.

O.
File a written request with the approving body that it hold a public hearing on his
application for final approval.
If the landowner wishes to take either such alternate action, he may do so at any time within which he
shall be entitled to apply for final approval, or within 30 additional days if the time for applying for final
approval shall have already passed at the time when the landowner was advised that the
development plan was not in substantial compliance. In the event the landowner shall fail to take
either of these alternative actions within said time, he shall be deemed to have abandoned the
development plan. Any such public hearing shall be held pursuant to public notice within 30 days
after request for the hearing is made by the landowner, and the hearing shall be conducted in the
manner prescribed in this part for public hearings on applications for tentative approval. Within 30
days after the conclusion of the hearing, the Borough shall by official written communication either
grant final approval to the development plan or deny final approval. The grant or denial of final
approval of the development plan shall, in cases arising under this Part, be in the form and contain
the findings required for an application for tentative approval set forth in this chapter. Failure of the
Borough Council or Planning Commission to render a decision on an application for final approval
and communicate it to the applicant within the time and in the manner required by this section shall
be deemed an approval of the application for final approval, as presented, unless the applicant has
agreed in writing to an extension of time or change in the prescribed manner of presentation of
communication of the decision, in which case, failure to meet the extended time or change in manner
of presentation of communication shall have like effect.
A development plan, or any part thereof, which has been given final approval, shall be so
certified without delay by the Borough and shall be filed of record forthwith in the Office of
the Recorder of Deeds before any development shall take place in accordance therewith.
Upon the filing of record of the development plan, the zoning and subdivision regulations
otherwise applicable to the land included in such plan shall cease to apply thereto,
pending completion, in accordance with the time provisions stated in § 508 of the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. § 10508, of said planned residential
development or of that part thereof, as the case may be, that has been finally approved,
no modification of the provisions of said development plan, or part thereof, as finally
approved, shall be made except with the consent of the landowner. Upon approval of a
final plat, the developer shall record the plat in accordance with the provisions of § 513(a)
and post financial security in accordance with § 509 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities
Planning Code, 53 P.S. §§ 10513(a), 10509.
In the event that a development plan, or a section thereof, is given final approval and
thereafter the landowner shall abandon such plan or the section thereof that has-been
finally approved, and shall so notify the Borough in writing; or, in the event the landowner
shall fail to commence and carry out the planned residential development in accordance
with the time provisions stated in § 508 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning
Code, 53 P.S. § 10508, after final approval has been granted, no development or further
development shall take place on the property included in the development plan until after
the said property is reclassified by enactment of any amendment to this chapter in the
manner prescribed for such amendments in Part 7.
Enforcement. All enforcement procedures under this section shall be consistent with § 712.2
of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. § 10712.2.
