PREFACE 
This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Chickasha, Oklahoma. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 2012 Code, as supplemented through September 15, 2013, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 2012 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Sandra S. Fox, Senior Code Attorney, and Kellyn Wilcox, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Gina L. Snedeker, CPFA, CMC, Finance Director, for her cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that her efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Sec. 4-86. - Airport hazards contrary to public interest. 
(a)  This article is adopted pursuant to the authority conferred by the Airport Zoning Act, 3 O.S. § 100 et seq. (the "Act"). It is hereby found that an airport hazard endangers the lives and property of users of the airport and property or occupants of land in its vicinity, and also, if of the obstruction type, in effect reduces the side of the area available for the landing, taking off, and maneuvering of aircraft, thus tending to destroy or impair the utility of the airport and the public investment herein. Accordingly, it is hereby declared that: 
(1)  The creation or establishment of an airport hazard is a public nuisance and an injury to the community served by the airport; 
(2)  It is therefore necessary in the interest of the public health, public safety, and general welfare that the creation or establishment of airport hazards be prevented; and 
(3)  The prevention of these airport hazards or obstructions should be accomplished, to the extent legally possible, by the exercise of the police power without compensation. 
(b)  It is further declared that both the prevention of the creation and establishment of airport hazards and the elimination, removal, alteration, mitigation, or the marking and lighting of existing airport hazards are public purposes for which political subdivisions may raise and expend public funds and acquire land or property interest therein.

(a)  Future uses. Except as specifically provided in subsections (a)(1), (2) and (3) of this section, no material change shall be made in the use of land, no structure shall be erected or otherwise established, and no tree shall be planted in any zone hereby created unless a permit therefor shall have been applied for and granted upon the prior payment of the appropriate permit fees to be established from time to time. Each application for a permit shall indicate the purpose for which the permit is desired, with sufficient particularity to permit it to be determined whether the resulting use, structure, or tree would conform to the regulations herein prescribed. If such determination is in the affirmative, the permit shall be granted. No permit for a use consistent with the provisions of this article shall be granted unless a variance has been approved in accordance with subsection (d) of this section. 
(1)  In the area lying within the limits of the horizontal zone and conical zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground, except when, because of terrain, land contour, or topographic features, such tree or structure would extend above the height limits prescribed for such zones.

Nothing contained in any of the foregoing exceptions shall be construed as permitting or intending to permit any construction, or alteration of any structure, or growth of any tree in excess of any of the height limits established by this article except as set forth in section 4-88(10). 
(b)  Existing uses. No permit shall be granted that would allow the establishment or creation of an obstruction or permit a nonconforming use, structure, or tree to become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was on the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived or any amendments thereto or than it is when the application for a permit is made. Except as indicated, all applications for such a permit shall be granted. 
(c)  Nonconforming uses abandoned or destroyed. Whenever the zoning administrator determines that a nonconforming tree or structure has been abandoned or more than 80 percent torn down, physically deteriorated, or decayed, no permit shall be granted that would allow such structure or tree to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations. 
(d)  Variances. Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure, or permit the growth of any tree, or use property, not in accordance with the regulations prescribed in this article, may apply to the board of adjustment for a variance from such regulations. The application for variance shall be accompanied by a determination from the Federal Aviation Administration as to the effect of the proposal on the operation of air navigation facilities and the safe, efficient use of navigable airspace. Such variances shall be allowed where it is duly found that a literal application or enforcement of the regulations will result in unnecessary hardship and relief granted, will not be contrary to the public interest, will not be an airport hazard or create a hazard to air navigation, will do substantial justice, and will be in accordance with the spirit of this article. Additionally, no application for variance to the requirements of this article may be considered by the board of adjustment unless a copy of the application has been furnished to the city municipal airport board for advice as to the aeronautical effects of the variance. If the city municipal airport board does not respond to the application within 15 days after receipt, the board of adjustment may act on its own to grant or deny said application. 
(e)  Obstruction marking and lighting. Any permit or variance granted may, if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this article and be reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the owner of the structure or tree in question to install, operate, and maintain, at the owner's expense, such markings and lights as may be necessary. If deemed proper by the board of adjustment, this condition may be modified to require the owner to permit the city at its own expense to install, operate, and maintain the necessary markings and lights.

If the person fails to appear in response to the citation, a complaint shall be filed and the case shall be prosecuted as otherwise provided in this article. If the arrested resident is not released by being permitted to sign a citation as provided for in this subsection, he shall be admitted to bail either before or after arraignment, or shall be released on personal recognizance.

The court official, chief of police or his designated representative is authorized, subject to such conditions as shall be prescribed by the judge, to release a resident of the city on personal recognizance. 
(l)  If the defendant is not eligible for release upon personal recognizance as provided for in subsections (a) through (g) of this section, or if eligible but refuses to sign a written promise to appear, the officer shall deliver the person to an appropriate magistrate for arraignment and the magistrate shall proceed as otherwise provided for by law. If no magistrate is available, the defendant shall be placed in the custody of the appropriate jailer or custodian, to be held until a magistrate is available or bail is posted as provided for by ordinance before or after arraignment. 
(m)  If a resident or nonresident is arrested for any overweight violation, a violation of a special permit exceeding authorized permit weight, or violation relating to the transportation of hazardous material, the arresting officer may release the defendant, if the defendant deposits with the arresting officer appropriate bail or payment of the fine and costs in an amount and in the form as provided for in this article, except currency. 
(1)  In the event the defendant is additionally arrested for any violation for which personal recognizance is authorized pursuant to subsections (a) through (f) of this section, the arresting officer, for such additional violation, may either release the defendant upon such recognizance or require bail as provided for in this subsection (m). 
(2)  If the defendant is unable to post bail with the arresting officer, then the officer shall proceed as otherwise provided for in this section. 
(n)  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a juvenile may be held in custody pursuant to the provision of state law; provided, however, the arresting officer shall not be required to:

(2)  Place any other traffic offender into custody: 
a.  Who is injured, disabled, or otherwise incapacitated; 
b.  If custodial arrest may require impoundment of vehicle containing livestock, perishable cargo, or items requiring special maintenance or care; or 
c.  If extraordinary circumstances exist, which, in the judgment of the arresting officer, custodial arrest should not be made. In such cases, the arresting officer may designate the date and time for arraignment on the citation and release the person. If the person fails to appear without good cause shown, the court may issue a warrant for the person's arrest. 
(o)  The provisions of this section shall not be construed to: 
(1)  Create any duty on the part of the officer to release a person from custody; 
(2)  Create any duty on the part of the officer to make any inquiry or investigation relating to any condition which may justify release under this section; or 
(3)  Create any liability upon any officer, or the state or any political subdivision thereof, arising from the decision to release or not to release such person from custody pursuant to the provisions of this section. 
(p)  If the alleged offense is a violation of an ordinance restricting or regulating the parking of vehicles, including any regulations issued under such an ordinance, and the operator is not present, the police officer shall place on the vehicle, at a place reasonable likely to come to the notice of the operator, a citation conforming substantially to that prescribed in this section with such variation as the circumstances require. The operator of the vehicle is under the same obligation to respond to the citation as if it had been issued to him personally.

(a)  The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation, which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage. 
(Code 2012, § 25-1-1(B))  
Sec. 22-2. - Statement of purpose. 
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Protect human life and health; 
(2)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and 
(7)  Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. 
(Code 2012, § 25-1-1(C))  
Sec. 22-3. - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter uses the following methods: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers that are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters; 
(4)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; and 
(5)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
(Code 2012, § 25-1-1(D))  
Sec. 22-4. - Definitions. 
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:

Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
Area of special flood hazard is the land in the floodplain within the city subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. 
Base flood means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
Base flood elevation means the elevation in feet above mean sea level of the base flood or one percent chance flood. 
Basement means any area of the building having its floor sub-grade (below ground level) on all sides. 
BFE means base flood elevation. 
CFR means Code of Federal Regulations. 
Critical feature means an integral and readily identifiable part of a flood protection system, without which the flood protection provided by the entire system would be compromised.

Development permit means a permit issued by the city floodplain administrator which authorizes development in a special flood hazard area in accordance with this chapter. 
Elevated building means a non-basement building built, in the case of a building in zones AO, AE, A, and X, to have the top of the elevated floor adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during a flood up to the magnitude of the base flood. In the case of zones AE, A, and X, the term "elevated building" also includes a building elevated by means of fill or solid foundation perimeter walls with openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement of floodwaters. 
Existing construction means, for the purposes of determining rates, structures for which the start of construction commenced before the effective date of the FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date. The term "existing construction" may also be referred to as "existing structures." 
Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before August 4, 1972. 
Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads).

Flood insurance rate map means an official map of the city on which FEMA has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the city. 
Flood insurance study means the official report provided by FEMA for the city which contains flood profiles, water surface elevation of the base flood, as well as the floodway width, section area and mean velocity. 
Floodplain or floodprone area means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source. 
Floodplain administrator means a person accredited by the OWRB and designated by the city council to administer and implement laws, ordinances and regulations relating to the management of floodplains. 
Floodplain management means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage, including, but not limited to, emergency preparedness plans, flood control works and floodplain management regulations. 
Floodplain management regulations means zoning codes and ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose regulations and ordinances (such as floodplain, grading and erosion control regulations and ordinances) and other applications of police power. The term "floodplain management regulations" describes such state or local regulations, in any combination thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and reduction. 
Flood protection system means those physical structural works for which funds have been authorized, appropriated, and expended and which have been constructed specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of the areas within the city subject to a special flood hazard and the extent of the depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes hurricane tidal barriers, dams, reservoirs, levees or dikes. These specialized flood modifying works are those constructed in conformance with sound engineering standards 
Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. A floodway is located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 22-6. A floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters that carry debris and potential projectiles. 
Functionally dependent use means a use that cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term "functionally dependent use" includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities, but does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities. 
Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure. 
Historic structure means any structure that is: 
(1)  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of the Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register; 
(2)  Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as a registered historic district;

b.  Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs. 
Levee means a manmade structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control, or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding. 
Levee system means a flood protection system which consists of a levee or levees and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, that are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices. 
Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking or vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirement of 44 CFR 60.3. 
Manufactured home means a structure transportable in one or more sections that is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". 
Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
Mean sea level means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on the city's flood insurance rate map are referenced. 
New construction means, for the purpose of determining insurance rates, structures for which the start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, the term "new construction" means structures for which the start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by the city council and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by the city floodplain board. 
OWRB means the Oklahoma Water Resources Board. 
Recreational vehicle means a vehicle that is: 
(1)  Built on a single chassis; 
(2)  400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projections; 
(3)  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light-duty truck; and 
(4)  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
Start of construction (for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Public Law 97-348) includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets or walkways; nor does it include excavation for basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
Structure means a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. 
Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure where the cost of restoring the structure to it's before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before start of construction of the improvement. This includes structures that have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term "substantial improvement" does not, however, include either: 
(1)  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and that are the minimum necessary conditions; or 
(2)  Any alteration of a historic structure provided that the alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 
Variance is a grant of relief by the city to a person from the terms of this chapter when specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance, therefore, permits construction or development in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter. (For full requirements see 44 CFR 60.6.) 
Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with this chapter. 
Water surface elevation means the height, in relation to the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

Sec. 22-44. - Variances. 
(a)  General provisions. 
(1)  The floodplain board of the city may grant variances for uses which do not satisfy the requirements of the Oklahoma Floodplain Management Act or this article, if the applicant for the variance presents adequate proof that: 
a.  Compliance with this article will result in an arbitrary and unreasonable taking of property without sufficient benefit or advantage to the people; and 
b.  Satisfies the pertinent provisions of this section. 
However, no variance shall be granted where the effect of the variance will be to permit the continuance of a condition which unreasonably creates flooding hazards. 
(2)  Any variance so granted shall not be construed as to relieve any person who receives it from any liability imposed by the Oklahoma Floodplain Management Act or by other laws of the state. 
(3)  In no case shall variances be effective for a period longer than 20 years. 
(4)  Any person seeking a variance shall file a petition with the floodplain board, accompanied by a filing fee as established by the city council. 
(5)  Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing the relevant factors in section 22-43 and provisions of this section have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
(6)  Any person seeking a variance to build a structure below the base flood elevation will be issued a notice signed by the chairman of the floodplain board which states that: 
a.  The cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from permitting the structure to be built lower than the base flood elevation; and 
b.  Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. 
(7)  At such time as the floodplain board deems the petition ready for notification to the public, the floodplain board shall schedule a hearing and direct the applicant to publish notice thereof in a newspaper of general circulation in the county at least 30 days prior to the hearing. 
(8)  The floodplain board shall conduct the hearing and make determinations in accordance with the applicable provisions of this section. The floodplain board shall exercise wide discretion in weighing the equities involved and the advantages and disadvantages to the applicant and to the public at large when determining whether the variance shall be granted. 
(9)  Variances shall only be issued upon: 
a.  A showing of good and sufficient cause; 
b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; 
c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws, regulations or ordinances; and 
d.  A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(10)  Upon consideration of the factors stated in this section and the intent of this article, the floodplain board may attach such conditions to the granting of a variance as it deems necessary to further the purposes and objectives stated in section 22-43. 
(11)  The floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance; and a copy of any variance issued by the floodplain board shall be sent by the floodplain administrator to the OWRB and FEMA within 15 days after issuance of the variance. 
(b)  Special provisions. 
(1)  Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the state inventory of historic places, without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this article. 
(2)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(3)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(4)  Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that: 
a.  The criteria of subsections (a)(5), (a)(9), (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section are met; and 
b.  The structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.

Sec. 22-45. - Floodplain management fee schedule. 
The city shall establish the fee for development in the floodplain by resolution of the city council. 
(Code 2012, ch. 25, art. VI, § A)  
Sec. 22-46. - Penalties for noncompliance. 
(a)  No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this article and other applicable regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate or other certifications required in this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. Violation of the provisions of this article by failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this article or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined not more than the established rate for each violation, and in addition shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the city council or its city attorney from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. 
(b)  Enforcement of violations. The community development department is authorized to issue citations as set forth below: 
(1)  Each day during which a violation exists shall constitute a separate offense; 
(2)  For each offense cited, a penalty shall be established by resolution of the city council and shall be assessed to the owners of record; or 
(3)  Any person employed in connection therewith and who may have assisted in the commission of such violation. 
(c)  In addition to the penalties provided in section 1-14, the city may institute appropriate actions or proceedings at law or equity for the enforcement of the provisions of this article or to correct the violations thereof. The conviction and punishment of any person hereunder shall not relieve such person from the responsibility to correct prohibited buildings, structures, obstructions, or improvements, nor prevent the enforcement, correction, or removal thereof. 
(d)  The legally recorded owner of any property located in a special flood hazard area onto which fill material of any nature has been applied, with or without his knowledge and in violation of the provisions of this article, shall immediately and at his expense remove all such material upon written request to do so by the director of community development. Upon failure of the property owner to complete this work in a timely manner, the city council may order the work to be completed and expenses charged to the property owner or levied against the property.

This section shall be in addition to all other provisions of law or local ordinance or code requiring buildings or structures to be well maintained. 
(b)  Insofar as they are applicable to a landmark, historic site or improvement in a historic district, any provisions of the building code may be varied or waived, on application, by the building inspector, provided such variance or waiver does not endanger public health or safety. 
(c)  The historic preservation commission shall utilize, hereinafter, the "Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation" as the guidelines for reviewing applications for certificates of appropriateness. These standards are as follows: 
(1)  Every reasonable effort shall be made to provide a compatible use for a property, which requires minimal alteration of the building, structure or site and its environment, or to use a property for its originally intended purpose. 
(2)  The distinguishing original qualities or character of a building, structure, or site and its environment should not be destroyed. The removal or alteration of any historic material or distinctive architectural features should be avoided when possible. 
(3)  All buildings, structures and sites shall be recognized as products of their own time. Alterations that have no historic basis and which seek to create an earlier appearance shall be discouraged. 
(4)  Changes, which may have taken place in the course of time, are evidence of the history and development of a building, structure or site and its environment. These changes may have acquired significance in their own right, and this significance shall be recognized and respected. 
(5)  Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship which characterize a building, structure or site shall be treated with sensitivity. 
(6)  Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than replaced, wherever possible. In the event replacement is necessary, the new material should match the material being replaced in composition, design, color, texture and other visual qualities. Repair or replacement of missing architectural features should be based on accurate duplications of features, substantiated by historic, physical or pictorial evidence rather than on conjectural designs or the availability of different architectural elements from other buildings or structures. 
(7)  The surface cleaning of structures is undertaken with the gentlest means possible. Sandblasting and other cleaning methods that will damage the historic building materials shall not be undertaken. 
(8)  Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve archeological resources affected by, or adjacent to, any project. 
(9)  Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing properties shall not be discouraged when such alterations and addition do not destroy significant historic, architectural or cultural material, and such design is compatible with the size, scale, color, material and character of the property, neighborhood or environment. 
(10)  Wherever possible, new additional or alterations to structures shall be done in such a manner that if such additions or alterations were to be removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the structure would be unimpaired. 
(Code 2012, § 23-1-12)  
Sec. 26-65. - Uses adjacent to historic preservation district.

However, if neither the property owner nor mortgage holder can be located, notice may be given by posting a copy of the notice on the property, or by publication as defined in 11 O.S. § 1-102. The notice may be published once not less than ten days prior to any hearing by the hearing officer or action by the city pursuant to the provisions of this section. 
(2)  A hearing shall be held by the hearing officer to determine if the property is dilapidated and has become detrimental to the health, safety, or welfare of the general public and the community, or if the property creates a fire hazard that is dangerous to other property. 
(3)  Pursuant to a finding by the hearing officer that the condition of the property constitutes a detriment or a hazard and that the property would be benefited by the removal of such conditions, the city may cause the dilapidated building to be torn down and removed.

Such notice shall be published one time, not less than ten days prior to any hearing or action by the hearing officer pursuant to the provisions of this section. 
(4)  If the city anticipates summary abatement of a nuisance in accordance with the provisions of subsection (a)(10) of this section, the notice shall state that any subsequent need for boarding and securing the building within a six-month period after the initial boarding and securing of the building pursuant to such notice may be summarily boarded and secured by the city; that the costs of such boarding and securing shall be assessed against the owner; and that a lien may be imposed on the property to secure such payment, all without further prior notice to the property owner or mortgage holder. 
(5)  The owner of the property may give written consent to the municipality authorizing the boarding and securing of such unsecured building and to the payment of any costs incurred by giving written consent, the owner waives any right the owner has to a hearing by the hearing officer. 
(6)  If the property owner does not give written consent to such actions, a hearing may be held by the hearing officer to determine whether the boarding and securing of such unsecured building would promote and benefit the public health, safety, or welfare. Such hearing may be held in conjunction with a hearing on the accumulation of trash or the growth of weeds or grass on the premises of such unsecured building. In making such determination, the hearing officer shall apply the following standard: the hearing officer may order the boarding and securing of the unsecured building when the boarding and securing thereof would make such building less available for transient occupation, decrease a fire hazard created by such building or decrease the hazard that such building would constitute an attractive nuisance to children. Upon making the required determination, the hearing officer may order the boarding and securing of the unsecured building. 
(7)  After the hearing officer orders the boarding and securing of such unsecured building, the city clerk shall immediately file a notice of unsecured building and lien with the county clerk describing the property, stating the findings of the hearing officer at the hearing at which such building was determined to be unsecured, and stating that the municipality claims a lien on the property for the costs of boarding and securing such building and that such costs are the personal obligation of the property owner from and after the date of filing the notice. 
(8)  Pursuant to the order of hearing officer, the agents of the municipality are granted the right of entry on the property for the performance of the boarding and securing of such building and for the performance of all necessary duties as a governmental function of the municipality. 
(9)  After an unsecured building has been boarded and secured, the city shall determine the actual costs of such actions and any other expenses that may be necessary in conjunction therewith, including the cost of the notice and mailing. The city clerk shall forward a statement of the actual costs attributable to the boarding and securing of the unsecured building and a demand for payment of such costs, by mail to any property owners and mortgage holders as provided by state law. At the time of mailing of the statement of costs to any property owner or mortgage holder, the municipality shall obtain a receipt of mailing from the postal service, which receipt shall indicate the date of mailing and the name and address of the mailee. If the city boards and secures any unsecured building, the cost to the property owner shall not exceed the actual cost of the labor, materials, and equipment required for the performance of such actions. If such actions are done on a private contract basis, the contract shall be awarded to the lowest and best bidder. 
(10)  When payment is made to the municipality for costs incurred, the city clerk shall file a release of lien, but if payment attributable to the actual costs of the boarding and securing of the unsecured building is not made within 30 days from the date of the mailing of the statement to the owner of such property, the municipal clerk shall forward a certified statement of the amount of the costs to the county treasurer of the county in which the property is located. The costs shall be levied on the property and collected by the county treasurer as are other taxes authorized by law. Until fully paid, the costs and the interest thereon shall be the personal obligation of the property owner from and after the date the notice of unsecured building and lien is filed with the county clerk. In addition, the costs and the interest thereon shall be a lien against the property from the date the notice of the lien is filed with the county clerk. The lien shall be coequal with the lien of ad valorem taxes and all other taxes and special assessments and shall be prior and superior to all other titles and liens against the property. The lien shall continue until the costs and interest are fully paid. At any time prior to collection as provided for in this section, the municipality may pursue any civil remedy for collection of the amount owing and interest thereon, including an action in personam against the property owner and an action in rem to foreclose its lien against the property. A mineral interest if severed from the surface owner shall not be subject to any tax or judgment lien created pursuant to this section. Upon receiving payment, the city clerk shall forward to the county treasurer a notice of such payment and shall direct discharge of the lien. 
(11)  If the city or the hearing officer orders or causes a structure within the municipal limits to be boarded and secured, any subsequent need for boarding and securing within a six-month period constitutes a public nuisance and may be summarily boarded and secured without further prior notice to the property owner or mortgage holder. At the time of each summary boarding and securing, the municipality shall notify the property owner and mortgage holder of the boarding and securing and the costs thereof. The notice shall state that the property owner may request an appeal with the municipal clerk within ten days after the mailing of the notice. The notice and hearing shall be provided for in subsection (3) of this section. Unless otherwise determined at the hearing, the cost of such boarding and securing shall be determined and collected as provided for in subsections (a)(8) and (9) of this section. 
(12)  The city may determine that a building is unsecured and order that such building be boarded and secured in the manner provided for in this subsection even though such building has not been declared by the hearing officer to be dilapidated.

(a)  The city may cause property within the municipal limits to be cleaned of trash and weeds or grass to be cut or mowed in accordance with the following procedure: 
(1)  At least ten day's notice shall be given to the owner of the property by mail at the address shown by the current year's tax rolls in the county treasurer's office before the hearing officer holds a hearing or the city takes action. The notice shall order the property owner to clean the property of trash, or to cut or mow the weeds or grass on the property, as appropriate, and the notice shall further state that unless such work is performed within ten days of the date of the notice the work shall be done by the municipality and a notice of lien shall be filed with the county clerk against the property for the costs due and owing the municipality. At the time of mailing of notice to the property owner, the municipality shall obtain a receipt of mailing from the postal service, which receipt shall indicate the date of mailing and the name and address of the mailee. However, if the property owner cannot be located within ten days from the date of mailing by the city, notice may be given by posting a copy of the notice on the property or by publication, as defined in 11 O.S. § 1-102, one time not less than ten days prior to any hearing or action by the municipality. If the city anticipates summary abatement of a nuisance in accordance with the provisions of subsection (a)(7) of this section, the notice, whether by certified mail, posting or publication, shall state that any accumulations of trash or excessive weed or grass growth on the owner's property occurring within six months from and after the date of this notice may be summarily abated by the city; that the costs of such abatement shall be assessed against the owner; and that a lien may be imposed on the property to secure such payment, all without further prior notice to the property owner. 
(2)  The owner of the property may give his written consent to the municipality authorizing the removal of the trash or the mowing of the weeds or grass. By giving the written consent, the owner waives his right to a hearing by the hearing officer. 
(3)  A hearing may be held by the hearing officer to determine whether the accumulation of trash or the growth of weeds or grass has caused the property to become detrimental to the health, benefit, and welfare of the public and the community or a hazard to traffic, or creates a fire hazard to the danger of property. 
(4)  Upon a finding that the condition of the property constitutes a detriment or hazard, and that the property would be benefited by the removal of such conditions, the agents of the municipality are granted the right of entry on the property for the removal of trash, mowing of weeds or grass, and performance of the necessary duties as a governmental function of the municipality. Immediately following the cleaning or mowing of the property, the municipal clerk shall file a notice of lien with the county clerk describing the property and the work performed by the municipality, and state that the municipality claims a lien on the property for the cleaning or mowing costs. 
(5)  The city shall determine the actual cost of such cleaning and mowing and any other expenses as may be necessary in connection therewith, including the cost of notice and mailing. The municipal clerk shall forward by mail to the property owner, as specified in subsection (a)(1) of this section, a statement of such actual cost and demanding payment. If the cleaning and mowing are done by the municipality, the cost to the property owner for the cleaning and mowing shall not exceed the actual cost of the labor, maintenance, and equipment required and any applicable administrative and other direct costs. If the cleaning and mowing are done on a private contract basis, the contract shall be awarded to the best qualified bidder as determined by authorized city personnel; provided, however, that an administrative fee shall be assessed by the city in addition to the actual cost charged by the private contractor. 
(6)  If payment is not made within 30 days from the date of the mailing of the statement, the city clerk shall forward a certified statement of the amount of the cost to the treasurer of the county in which the property is located and the same shall be levied on the property and collected by the county treasurer as other taxes authorized by law. Until fully paid, the cost and interest thereon shall be the personal obligation of the property owner from and after the date the cost is certified to the county treasurer. In addition, the cost and the interest thereon shall be a lien against the property from the date the cost is certified to the country treasurer, coequal with the lien of ad valorem taxes and all other taxes and special assessments and prior and superior to all other titles and liens against the property, and the lien shall continue until the cost shall be fully paid. At the time of collection, the county treasurer shall collect a fee in the amount provided in the fee schedule for each parcel of property. The fee shall be deposited to the credit of the general fund of the county. At any time prior to the collection as provided in this section, the municipality may pursue any civil remedy for collection of the amount owing and interest thereon, including an action in personam against the property owner and an action in rem to foreclose its lien against the property. A mineral interest, if severed from the surface interest and not owned by the surface owner, shall not be subject to any tax or judgment lien created pursuant to this section. Upon receiving payment, if any, the city clerk shall forward to the county treasurer a notice of such payment and directing discharge of the lien. 
(7)  If notice is given by the city to a property owner ordering the property within the municipal limits to be cleaned of trash and weeds or grass to be cut or mowed in accordance with the procedures provided for in subsection (a)(1) of this section, any subsequent accumulations of trash or excessive weed or grass growth on the property occurring within a six-month period may be declared to be a nuisance and may be summarily abated without further prior notice to the property owner. At the time of each such summary abatement the municipality shall notify the property owner of the abatement and the costs thereof. The notice shall state that the property owner may request a hearing within ten days after the date of mailing the notice. The notice and hearing shall be as provided for in section 34-63. Unless otherwise determined at the hearing the cost of such abatement shall be determined and collected as provided for in subsections (a)(5) and (6) of this section; provided, however, that this subsection shall not apply if the records of the county clerk show that the property was transferred after notice was given pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section.

(1)  The average adult person applying contemporary community standards would find that the material or performance has a predominant tendency to appeal to a prurient interest in sex to minors; 
(2)  The average adult person applying contemporary community standards would find that the material or performance depicts or describes nudity, sexual conduct, sexual excitement or sadomasochistic abuse in a manner that is patently offensive to prevailing standard in the adult community with respect to what is suitable for minors; and

(1)  Display material, that is harmful to minors in such a way that minors, as a part of the invited general public, will be exposed to view such material.

DIVISION 2. - CURFEW 
 
Sec. 36-216. - Curfew of minors. 
(a)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this division, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
Minor means any person under the age of 18 years. 
Parent means any person having legal custody of a minor: 
(1)  As a natural or adoptive parent; 
(2)  As a legal guardian; 
(3)  As a person who stands in loco parentis; or 
(4)  As a person to whom legal custody has been given by order of the court. 
Public place means any street, alley, highway, sidewalk, park, playground, or place to which the general public has access and a right to resort for business, entertainment, or other lawful purpose. A public place shall include, but not be limited to, any store, shop, restaurant, tavern, bowling alley, cafe, theater, drug store, pool room, shopping center, and any other place devoted to amusement or entertainment of the general public. A public place shall also include the front or immediate area of the above. 
Remain means to stay behind, to tarry and to stay unnecessarily upon the streets, including the congregating of groups (or of interacting minors) totaling four or more persons in which any minor involved would not be using the streets for ordinary or serious purposes such as mere passage or going home. 
Street is a way or place, of whatsoever nature, open to the use of the public as a matter of right for purposes of vehicular travel or in the case of a sidewalk thereof for pedestrian travel. The term "street" includes the legal right-of-way, including, but not limited to, the cartway or traffic lanes, the curb, the sidewalks whether paved or unpaved, and any grass plots or other grounds found within the legal right-of-way of a street. 
Time of night is based upon the prevailing standard time, whether central standard time or central daylight savings time, generally observed at that hour by the public. 
Year of age continues from one birthday, such as the 17th to (but not including the day of) the next, such as the 18th birthday, making it clear that 17 or less years of age is herein treated as equivalent to the phrase "under 18 years of age." 
(b)  Curfew hours. It is unlawful for any person 17 or less years of age (under 18 years of age) to be or remain in or upon the streets or public places within the city at night during the period ending 6:00 a.m. and beginning at: 
(1)  10:00 p.m. for minors 15 years of age or younger. 
(2)  12:00 midnight for minors over 15 years of age on Sunday through Thursday. 
(3)  1:00 a.m. on Saturday morning and Sunday morning for minors more than 15 years of age. 
(c)  Exceptions. In the following exceptional cases, a minor on a city street or in a public place during the nocturnal hours for which subsection (b) of this section is intended to provide the maximum limits of regulation shall not, however, be considered a violation of the curfew ordinance: 
(1)  When accompanied by a parent of such minor. 
(2)  When accompanied by an adult authorized by a parent of such minor to take the parent's place accompanying the minor for a designated period of time, date, and purpose within a specified area. 
(3)  When exercising First Amendment rights protected by the United States Constitution, such as the free exercise of religion, freedom of speech and the right of assembly, such minor shall evidence the bona fides of such exercise by possessing a written communication, signed by such minor and countersigned, by a parent or legal guardian of such minor with their home address and telephone number, specifying when, and where and in what manner the minor will be on the streets and other public places at night (during hours when the curfew ordinance is otherwise applicable to the minor) in the exercise of a First Amendment right specified in such communication. 
(4)  In case of reasonable necessity, but only if the minor has in the minor's possession a written communication signed by the minor, countersigned by a parent of such minor evidencing their home address and telephone number, and establishing such reasonable necessity relating to specified streets at a designated time for a described purpose including points of origin and destination. 
(5)  When the minor is on the sidewalk of the place where such minor resides, or on the sidewalk of either next-door neighbor not communicating an objection to the police officer. 
(6)  When returning home, by a direct route, from (and within 30 minutes of the termination of) a school activity, or an activity of a religious or voluntary association, provided the minor has a written communication in the minor's possession, countersigned by a parent indicating the home address and telephone number, the purpose for the event, when, where and in what manner the minor will be on the streets at night. 
(7)  When authorized by regulation issued by the city council, in other similar cases of reasonable necessity, similarly handled but adopted to necessary nighttime activities of more minors than can readily be dealt with on an individual special permit basis. Normally, such regulation by the city council permitting use of the streets or public places should be issued sufficiently in advance to permit appropriate publicity through news media and through other agencies such as the schools, and shall define the activity, the scope of the use of the streets or public places permitted, the period of time involved, not to extend more than 30 minutes beyond the time for termination of such activity, and the reason for finding that such regulation is reasonably necessary and is consistent with the public interest and the purposes of this division. 
(8)  When the minor carries a certified card of employment briefly identifying the minor, the addresses of his home and his place of employment and his hours of employment or carries a valid proof of employment, which may include the latest payroll receipt not over 30 days old. 
(9)  Whenever the minor is, with parental consent in a motor vehicle. This contemplates normal travel and clearly exempts bona fide interstate movement through the city, particularly on normal routes. 
(d)  Parental responsibility. It is unlawful for a parent, or other person, having legal custody of a minor knowingly to permit, or by inefficient control to allow, such a minor to be or remain upon any city street under circumstances not constituting an exception to, or otherwise beyond the scope of the curfew ordinance. The term "knowingly" includes knowledge which a parent, or legal guardian, should reasonably be expected to have concerning the whereabouts of a minor in that parent's legal custody. It is intended to keep neglectful or careless parents up to a reasonable community standard of parental responsibility through an objective test. It shall a fortiori, be no defense that a parent was completely indifferent to the activities or conduct or whereabouts of such minor. 
(e)  Responsibility of owners of public places. It is unlawful for any person operating or having charge of any public place to knowingly allow, permit, or suffer the presence of minors in violation of the curfew established by this article. 
(Code 2012, § 14-2-6)  
Sec. 36-217. - Police procedures and penalty. 
(a)  Upon finding or having attention called to any minor on the streets in a prima facie violation of the curfew ordinance, a police officer of the city shall normally take the minor to the city police station, or other place designated by the chief of police, where a parent shall immediately be notified to come for such minor, whereupon they shall be interviewed. This is intended to permit ascertainment, under constitutional safeguards, of relevant facts, and to centralize responsibility in the personnel then on duty for accurate, effective, fair, impartial and uniform enforcement, and recording, thus making available experienced supervisory personnel, the best facilities and access to information and records. In the absence of convincing evidence such as a birth certificate, a police officer on the street shall in the first instance use his best judgment in determining age. 
(1)  Police procedures shall constantly be refined in light of experience and may provide, inter alia, that the police officer may deliver to a parent thereof a minor under appropriate circumstances. For example, a minor of tender age near home whose identity may readily be ascertained or is known. 
(2)  In any event such police officer shall, within 12 hours, file a written report with the chief of police. The report shall be treated for purposes of juvenile records in accordance with state law. 
(3)  When a parent, immediately called, has come to take charge of the minor, and the appropriate information has been recorded, the minor shall be released to the custody of such parent. If the parent cannot be located, or fails to take charge of the minor, then the minor shall be released to the juvenile authorities, except to the extent that in accordance with police regulations, approved in advance by juvenile authorities, the minor may temporarily be entrusted to a relative, neighbor or other person who will on behalf of a parent assume the responsibility of caring for the minor pending the availability or arrival of a parent. 
(4)  In the case of a first violation by a minor, the chief of police shall cause to be personally delivered or by certified mail, sent to a parent, or legal guardian, written notice of the violation with a warning that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of the curfew ordinance, including enforcement of parental responsibility and of applicable penalties. 
(b)  If, after the warning notice pursuant to subsection (a)(4) of this section of a first violation by a minor, a parent violates section 36-216(d) (in connection with a second violation by the minor), this shall be treated as an offense by the parent and the minor. The penalty upon a plea of guilty, nolo contendere, or finding of guilt shall be a fine of $200.00 plus costs.

DIVISION 3. - TOBACCO 
 
Sec. 36-243. - Findings and intent. 
The city council finds that youth addiction to tobacco products is a public health problem with grave health consequences. In recognition that almost 90 percent of all smokers begin smoking by the age of 18 years, action is needed to curtail the easy access of minors to cigarettes and other addictive tobacco products. Furthermore, the city council finds that the state legislature has limited the powers granted to local governments to address the problem of youth access to tobacco. Therefore, the intent of this division is to: 
(1)  Implement the strictest and most enforceable system allowed under state law to prevent the illegal sale of cigarettes and other tobacco products to minors; 
(2)  Periodically amend and update this division as necessary to best utilize any applicable powers, which may be returned to state municipalities in the future; and 
(3)  Educate, encourage and assist underage tobacco users in ceasing all use of addictive tobacco products, preferably before daily use of such products is initiated.

(f)  Proof that the defendant demanded, was shown, and reasonably relied upon proof of age shall be a defense to any action brought pursuant to this section.

He shall prevent or remove the accumulations of sand, debris and other substance in any storm sewer and keep the same open and in good condition of use at all times. 
(Code 1972, § 19-1; Code 2012, § 19-1-1)  
Sec. 44-3. - Permit and public works director approval required for repair of public ways. 
Except as may be otherwise provided by law or ordinance, no improvements to streets, curbs and gutters or sidewalks shall be made by any person except under the supervision and approval of the public works director of the city and must first obtain a permit from the city for such purposes, and for the same fees as building permits. 
(Code 1972, § 19-38; Code 2012, § 19-4-14)  
Sec. 44-4. - Sidewalk inspector. 
The city manager may appoint an appropriate city official to act as sidewalk inspector. It shall be his duty to enforce all provisions of this chapter relating to the construction, maintenance, repair, and use of sidewalks within the city. 
(Code 1972, § 19-39; Code 2012, § 19-5-1)

(b)  It shall be the duty of the public works director to establish street markings at the places and in the manner designated by the council, and he shall maintain the same in good condition to serve the purpose of their establishment. It shall be unlawful and an offense for any person to cover over, obstruct, injure, damage or otherwise mutilate any street marking established and authorized by the city council for the purpose of designating or identifying any street, avenue or alley within the city. 
(Code 1972, § 19-56; Code 2012, §§ 19-7-1, 19-7-2)  
Sec. 44-6. - Alley maintenance. 
The street department of the city will have limited maintenance responsibilities in alleys and will provide minimal maintenance on both paved and unpaved alleys, as long as certain criteria are met as indicated below. 
(1)  Alleys. The city will only provide alley maintenance service in those alleyways that have been opened and set to established grades. Alleyways in the city which have been maintained historically by the city as alleys are also eligible for the maintenance service but shall not be prioritized over established grade alleys or named and dedicated city streets which will receive priority funding. The city council may approve special or joint projects that emphasize the reconstruction or major repair of any alley as a result of a project plan. 
(2)  Alley entrances. The street department of the city does not assume responsibility for potholes in alley entrances, however, exceptions may be made with authorization of the city manager in situations that in the opinion of the city manager's office pose a threat to public health and safety. 
(3)  Gravel alley surfaces. Upon request by the property owners, the street department of the city will grade and shape gravel alleys. If the public works director determines that additional gravel is needed, the property owners shall pay for the additional gravel in the tonnage amounts determined by the public works director in charge of alley maintenance. The street department of the city will invoice the property owners adjacent to the alley for the material and delivery. Upon full and complete payment of the invoices the maintenance will be scheduled. Equipment and labor costs for the cutting, compacting, and grading will be the responsibility of the city. 
(4)  Dirt alley surfaces. The street department of the city seldom blades dirt alleys because this disturbs the existing base and results in erosion problems. In order to gravel a dirt alley, property owners must first receive approval from the director of public works. A supervisor within the public works department will then survey the alley and estimate the amount of rock that must be purchased by property owners. Property owners shall pay for the gravel in the tonnage amounts determined by the public works director in charge of alley maintenance. The street department of the city will invoice the property owners adjacent to the alley for the material and delivery. Upon full and complete payment of the invoices the maintenance will be scheduled. Equipment and labor costs for the cutting, compaction, and grading will be the responsibility of the city. 
(5)  Concrete and asphalt alleys. The street department of the city does provide the service of patching concrete and asphalt alleys using city staff and equipment if the following criteria are met: 
a.  Property owner(s) living adjacent to the alley must purchase the necessary material, as determined by the public works director, needed to make the repairs; 
b.  The minimum tonnage the street department of the city will haul is one ton of hot asphalt mix; 
c.  The maximum amount for total repairs is 16 tons.; and 
d.  The area of repairs needed over the entire alley surface, as determined by the public works director, cannot exceed 20 percent of the total alley pavement area.

(1)  Comply forthwith; or 
(2)  Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations or terminating the discharge or both.

(2)  November 21, 2020. 
(b)  Provided, however, such apportionment shall be subject to the following limitations: 
(1)  On the ad valorem tax increment generated from any increase in assessed valuation over the baseline valuation as determined pursuant to 62 O.S. § 850 et seq., three-fourths of the ad valorem tax increment is hereby apportioned to the authority, with the balance to be retained by the applicable taxing jurisdictions; provided, however, such increment of ad valorem tax revenue shall only include ad valorem tax revenue generated by new businesses (not located on the date hereof within the city) locating within the increment district and shall specifically exclude ad valorem tax revenue generated by: 
a.  Existing businesses located within the increment district; and 
b.  Existing businesses (located on the date hereof within the city but outside the boundaries of the increment district) that may ultimately relocate to within the increment district; 
(2)  For purposes of calculating the increment of ad valorem taxes if a new building within the increment district contains more than one business entity, and at least one of the business entities is an existing city business that is excluded from the increment pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, the portion of the ad valorem tax revenue excluded from the increment shall be a pro rata portion of the ad valorem tax on the building based on the aggregate square footage occupied by any existing city business entities as compared to the total square footage of the building; 
(3)  The apportionment of all ad valorem tax increments shall expire the earlier of November 21, 2020, or the time when all project costs have been paid pursuant to the project plan; 
(4)  Ad valorem tax increments generated during the period of apportionment (prior to November 21, 2020) may be used to reimburse authorized project costs even to the extent that such tax increments are not received until after the period of apportionment expires. For example, ad valorem tax increments allocable to the final year (or pro rata portion thereof) of the increment district, but not paid to and received from the county until after the expiration date of the increment district, may still be utilized for reimbursement of project costs. No ad valorem tax increments generated after the expiration of the period of apportionment may be used to reimburse any project costs; and

(1)  Full reimbursement of authorized project costs in an amount not to exceed $5,300,000.00; or 
(2)  November 21, 2020.

(1)  On the sales tax increment generated from any increase in sales tax revenue generated within the increment district by virtue of the levy of a total of three percent sales tax pursuant to Ordinance Nos. 827, 1137, and 1671 of the city as such ordinances may be amended from time to time, one-half of the sales tax increment is hereby apportioned to the authority, with the balance to be retained by the city; provided, however, such increment of sales tax revenue shall only include sales tax revenues generated by new businesses (not located on the date hereof within the city) locating within the increment district and shall specifically exclude sales tax revenues generated by: 
a.  Existing businesses located within the increment district; and 
b.  Existing businesses (located on the date hereof within the city, but outside the boundaries of the increment district) that may ultimately relocate to within the increment district; 
(2)  The sales tax increment shall not include any of the three-fourths percent sales tax levied pursuant to Ordinance No. 2001-07 of the city, the one-fourth percent sales tax levied pursuant to Ordinance No. 2005-16 of the city, the one-fourth percent sales tax levied by the county or any other sales tax levied within the increment district; 
(3)  The apportionment of all sales tax increments shall expire the earlier of November 21, 2020, or the time when all project costs have been paid pursuant to the project plan; 
(4)  Sales tax increments generated during the period of apportionment (prior to November 21, 2020) may be used to reimburse authorized project costs even to the extent that such tax increments are not received until after the period of apportionment expires. For example, sales tax increments generated during the final month (or pro rata portion thereof) of the increment district, but not received from the state tax commission until after the expiration date of the increment district, may still be utilized for reimbursement of project costs. No sales tax increments generated after the expiration of the period of apportionment may be used to reimburse any project costs; and

No statement in this article is intended or may be construed to prohibit the city manager from establishing specific wastewater discharge criteria more restrictive where wastes are determined to be harmful or destructive to the facilities of the POTW or to create a public nuisance or to cause the discharge of the POTW to violate effluent or stream water quality standards, or to interfere with the use or handling of sludge, or to pass through the POTW resulting in a violation of the NPDES permit, or to exceed industrial pretreatment standards for discharge to municipal wastewater treatment systems as imposed by the state department of public health and/or the United States Environmental Protection Agency. 
(Code 2012, § 18-2-11)  
Sec. 52-88. - Excessive discharge. 
No user shall ever increase the use of process water or, in any way; attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the limitations contained in the federal categorical pretreatment standards, or in any other pollutant-specific limitation developed by the city or state. 
(Code 2012, § 18-2-12)  
Sec. 52-89. - Accidental discharges. 
(a)  Protection measures. All industrial users shall provide such facilities and institute such procedures as are reasonably necessary to prevent or minimize the potential for accidental discharge into the inplant transfer or processing and materials-handling areas, and from diked areas or holding ponds of any waste regulated by this article. The wastewater discharge permit of any user who has a history of significant leaks, spills or other accidental discharge of waste regulated by this article shall be subject on a case-by-case basis to a special permit condition or the requirement for the construction of facilities and establishment of procedures which will prevent or minimize the potential for such accidental discharge. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the city manager before the facility is constructed. The review and approval of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the facility to provide the protection necessary to meet the requirements of this article. 
(b)  Notification discharge. Any person causing or suffering from any accidental discharge shall immediately notify the POTW treatment plant by telephone to enable countermeasures to be taken by the city manager to minimize damage to the POTW, the health and welfare of the public, and the environment. This notification shall be followed, within five days of the date of the occurrence, by a detailed written statement describing the cause of the accidental discharge and measures being taken to prevent future occurrence. Such notification will not relieve the user of liability for any expense, loss, or damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this article or state or federal law. 
(c)  Notice to employees. Employers shall ensure that all employees who may cause or suffer such a dangerous discharge to occur are advised of the emergency notification procedure. 
(d)  Slug control and spill prevention plans. At least, once every two years all significant industrial users will be evaluated to determine if there is a need for plan to control slug discharges. If such plan is required, it will contain, at a minimum, the following elements: 
(1)  Description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch discharges. 
(2)  Description of stored chemicals. 
(3)  Procedures for immediately notifying the POTW of slug discharges, including any discharge that would violate a discharge a prohibition under 40 CFR 403.5(b) with procedures for follow-up, written notification within five days. 
(4)  If necessary, procedures to prevent adverse impact from accidental spills, including inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutant (including solvents), and/or measures and equipment for emergency response. 
(Code 2012, § 18-2-13)  
Sec. 52-90. - Wastewater discharge administration. 
(a)  It shall be unlawful to discharge without a city permit to any natural outlet within the city, or in any area under the jurisdiction of said city, and/or to the POTW any wastewater except as authorized by the city manager in accordance with the provisions of this article. 
(b)  All users or prospective users, which generate domestic or non-domestic wastewater, shall make application to the city manager for written authorization to discharge to the municipal wastewater treatment system. The application shall be in a form and require such information about the user as the city manager may prescribe. Applications shall be required from all new dischargers as well as for any existing discharger desiring additional service. Connection to the municipal sewer shall not be made until the application is received and approved by the city manager and the building sewer is installed in accordance with applicable codes and an inspection has been performed by the proper city official 
(c)  The receipt by the city of a prospective customer's application for service shall not obligate the city to render the service. If the service applied for cannot be supplied in accordance with this article and the city's rules and regulations and general practice, the application shall be rejected, and there shall be no liability of the city to the applicant for such service, except that conditional waivers for additional services may be granted by the city manager for interim periods if compliance may be assured within a reasonable period of time. 
(Code 2012, § 18-2-14)  
Sec. 52-91. - Wastewater contribution permits. 
(a)  Determination of significant industrial users. 
(1)  All users or prospective users which generate nondomestic wastewater shall, when making application for discharge pursuant to section 52-90, provide the following information: 
a.  Name (owners and operators). 
b.  Address, and location (if different from the mailing address). 
c.  The Standard Industrial Classification SIC of the operation carried out by the applicant. 
d.  Wastewater volume. 
e.  Wastewater constituents and characteristics. 
f.  Discharge variations. 
g.  A description of all toxic materials handled on the premises. 
h.  Any other information deemed necessary by the city manager, including but not limited to, site plans, floor plans, mechanical and plumbing plans and details of existing and proposed pretreatment and/or equalization facilities. 
(2)  If the city manager determines that the applicant constitutes a significant industrial user, then the conditions of subsection (b) of this section shall apply. 
(b)  Significant industrial users. 
(1)  All significant industrial users proposing to connect to or to contribute to the POTW shall obtain a wastewater discharge permit before connecting to or contributing to the POTW. All existing unpermitted significant industrial users shall apply for a wastewater discharge permit within 30 days after the effective date of this article and shall be required to qualify for granting of the wastewater discharge permit within 180 days after the effective date of this article. Proposed new users shall apply at least 90 days prior to connecting to or contributing to the POTW. 
(2)  The following additional information shall be required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit: 
a.  A list of any environmental control permits held by or for the facility. 
b.  A brief description of the nature and average rate of production of the facility. This description should include a schematic process diagram, which indicates points of discharge to the POTW from the regulated processes. 
c.  The user shall submit information showing the measured average daily flow and maximum daily flow, in gallons per day, to the POTW from each regulated process stream and other streams as necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream formula of 40 CFR 403.6(3). The city may allow for verifiable estimates of these flows where justified by cost or feasibility considerations. 
d.  The user shall identify the pretreatment standards applicable to each regulated process. 
e.  The user shall submit the results of sampling and analysis identifying the nature and concentration (or mass, where required by the city or pretreatment standards) of regulated pollutants in the discharge from each regulated process. Both daily maximum and average concentration (or mass, where required) shall be reported. The sample shall be representative of daily operations. 
f.  A minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organics. For all other pollutants, 24-hour composite samples must be obtained through flow-proportional composite sampling techniques where feasible. The city may waive flow-proportional composite sampling for any industrial user that demonstrates that flow-proportional sampling is infeasible. In such cases, samples may be obtained through time-proportional composite sampling techniques or through a minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. 
g.  The user shall take a minimum of one representative sample to compile that data necessary to comply with the requirements of this section. 
h.  For categorical industrial users, samples should be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the regulated process if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment the user should measure the flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream formula of 40 CFR 403.6(e) in order to evaluate compliance with the pretreatment standards. Where an alternate concentration or mass limit has been calculated in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(e) this adjusted limit, along with supporting data, shall be submitted to the city. 
i.  For non-categorical industrial users, samples should be taken just prior to connection with the POTW. Where an alternate concentration or mass limit has been calculated in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(e), this adjusted limit along with supporting data shall be submitted to the city. 
j.  Sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR 136 and amendments thereto. Where 40 CFR 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the administrator determines that the part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the POTW or other parties, approved by the administrator. 
k.  The city may allow the submission of a baseline report, which utilizes only historical data so long as the data is sufficient to determine the need for industrial pretreatment measures. 
l.  The baseline report shall indicate the time, date and place of sampling, and methods of analysis, and shall certify that such sampling and analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant discharges to the POTW. 
m.  This report will contain a statement, reviewed by an authorized representative of the industrial user (as defined in section 52-79 and certified to by a qualified professional, indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not, whether additional operation and maintenance (O & M) and/or additional pretreatment is required for the industrial user to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements. 
n.  Any user who elects or is required to construct new or additional facilities for pretreatment shall as a part of the application for wastewater discharge permit submit plans, specifications and other pertinent information relative to the proposed construction to the city manager for approval. Plans and specifications submitted for approval must bear the seal of a professional engineer registered to practice engineering in the state. A wastewater discharge permit shall not be issued until such plans and specifications are approved. Approval of such plans and specifications shall in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to the city under the provisions of this article. 
o.  If additional pretreatment and/or operation and maintenance will be required to meet the pretreatment standards; the application shall include the shortest schedule by which the user will provide such additional pretreatment. The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment standard. for the purpose of this section, "pretreatment standards" shall include either a national pretreatment standard or a pretreatment standard imposed by this article. The following conditions shall apply to this schedule: 
1.  The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the applicable pretreatment standards (e.g., hiring an engineer, completing preliminary plans, completing final plans, executing contract for major components, commencing construction, completing construction, etc.). 
2.  No increment referred to in subsection (b)(2)o.1 of this section shall exceed nine months. 
3.  Not later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the final date for compliance, the user shall submit a progress report to the city manager including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of progress to be met on such date and, if not, the date on which it expects to comply with this increment of progress, the reason for the delay, and the steps being taken by the user to return the construction to the schedule established. In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such progress reports to the city manager. 
p.  Where the industrial user's categorical pretreatment standard has been modified by a removal allowance (40 CFR 403.7), the combined wastestream formula (40 CFR 403.6(e)), and/or fundamentally different factors variance (40 CFR 403.13) at the time the user submits the report required by subsection (b)(2)b of this section, the information required by subsections (b)(2)l and (b)(2)n of this section shall pertain to the modified limits. 
q.  If the categorical pretreatment standard is modified by a removal of allowance (40 CFR 403.7), the combined wastestream formula (40 CFR 403.6(e)), and/or fundamentally different factors variance (40 CFR 403.13) after the user submits the report required by subsection (b)(2)b of this section, any necessary amendments to the information requested by subsections (b)(2)l and (b)(2)n of this section shall be submitted by the user to the city within 60 days after the modified limit is approved. 
r.  The city will evaluate the data furnished by the user and may require additional information. After evaluation and acceptance of the data furnished, the city may issue a wastewater discharge permit subject to terms and conditions provided herein. 
s.  The city manger will act only on applications containing all the information required in this section. Persons who have filed incomplete applications will be notified by the city manger that the application is deficient and the nature of such deficiency and will be given 30 days to correct the deficiency. If the deficiency is not corrected within such extended period as allowed by the city manager, the city manager shall submit the application to the city council with a recommendation that it be denied and notify the applicant in writing of such action. 
The city will evaluate the data furnished by the user and may require additional information. After evaluation and acceptance of the data furnished, the city may issue a wastewater contribution permit subject to the terms and conditions provided herein. 
(c)  Permit modifications. Within nine months of the promulgation of the national categorical pretreatment standard, the wastewater contribution permit of users subject to such standards shall be revised to require compliance with such standard within the time frame prescribed by such standard. Where a user, subject to a national categorical pretreatment standard, has not previously submitted an application for a wastewater contribution permit as required by this article, the user shall apply for a wastewater contribution permit within 180 days after the promulgation of the applicable federal categorical pretreatment standard. In addition, the user with an existing wastewater contribution permit shall submit to the city manager within 180 days after the promulgation of an applicable federal categorical pretreatment standard the information required by section 52-91(b)(2)n.

(Code 2012, § 18-2-17)  
Sec. 52-94. - Inspection and sampling. 
All users generating wastewater classified as a nondomestic source (as defined in section 52-79) shall allow the city manager and/or his authorized representative, the approval authority, state and EPA upon presentation of proper credentials: 
(1)  To enter upon the user's premises where a discharge source to the POTW is located or where records are required to be kept under the terms and conditions of this article, and at reasonable times to copy these records. 
(2)  To inspect at reasonable times any monitoring equipment or method or any collection, treatment, pollution management, or discharge facilities required under this article. 
(3)  To sample at reasonable times any discharge of pollutants to the POTW. 
(4)  At least annually, the city shall sample and inspect the facilities of all significant industrial users to ascertain whether the purpose of this article is being met and all requirements are being complied with. The city, state, approval authority, and EPA shall have the right to set up on the user's property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling, inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering operations. Where a user has security measures in force which would require proper identification and clearance before entry into their premises, the user shall make the necessary arrangements with their security guards so that upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the city, approval authority and EPA will be permitted to enter, without delay, for the purposes of performing their specific responsibilities. 
(5)  All expenses associated with field activities relating to compliance monitoring activities, including sampling and laboratory expenses, shall be recovered from the user. Such assessments may be added to the user's next scheduled sewer service charge and the city manager shall have such other collection remedies as he has to collect other service charges. 
(6)  The city manager or authorized official and other duly authorized employees of the city, bearing proper credentials and identification, shall be permitted to enter all private properties through which the city holds duly negotiated easement for the purposes of, but not limited to, inspection, observation, measurement, sampling, repair, and maintenance of any portion of the sewage works lying within said easement. All entry and subsequent work, if any, on said easement, shall be done in full accordance with the terms of the duly negotiated easement pertaining to the private property involved. 
(7)  All schedules related to compliance monitoring are considered on-going investigations and are not available to the public. 
(Code 2012, § 18-2-18)  
Sec. 52-95. - Pretreatment. 
(a)  Proper operation and maintenance. The industrial user shall, at all times, properly operate and maintain all facilities and systems of treatment and control (and related appurtenances) which are installed or used by the permittee to achieve compliance with the conditions of this permit. Proper operation and maintenance includes but is not limited to: effective performance, adequate funding, adequate operator staffing and training, and adequate laboratory and process controls, including appropriate quality assurance procedures. This provision requires the operation of back up or auxiliary or similar system only when necessary to achieve compliance with the conditions of this permit. 
(b)  Duty to comply. Upon reduction, loss, or failure of the pretreatment facility, the industrial user shall, to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with its permit, control production or all discharges or both until the operation of the treatment facility is restored or an alternate method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies, for example, when the primary source of power of the treatment facility fails or is reduced. It shall not be a defense for the permittee in an enforcement action that it would have been necessary to halt or reduce the permitted activity in order to maintain compliance with the conditions of this permit. 
(c)  Bypass of treatment facilities. 
(1)  An industrial user may allow a bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the reporting requirements of this section. 
(2)  If an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the city, if possible, at least ten days before the date of the bypass. 
(3)  An industrial user shall submit oral notice of an anticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards to the city within 24 hours when the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The city may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours. 
(4)  Bypass is prohibited unless: 
a.  It was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury or severe property damage; 
b.  There was no feasible alternative, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance; and 
c.  The industrial user submitted the notices as required by subsection (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this section. 
(5)  The city may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the city determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsection (c)(4) of this section. 
(Code 2012, § 18-2-19)  
Sec. 52-96. - Confidential information. 
(a)  Information and data on a user obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits and monitoring programs and from inspections shall be made available to the public or other governmental agency without restriction unless the user specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city that the release of such information would divulge information, processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets of the user. 
(b)  All confidential business information will be available for review for the state and USEPA officials that are in direct control of the industrial pretreatment program upon request, provided the requesting agency cites the authority under which it is making the request and adequate arrangements are made to safeguard this material. Such release of information will require a signature of an authorized representative of the appropriate agency. If such information is released to a regulatory agency, the affected business will be notified in writing of such release within ten days of such release. The information released will be clearly marked as confidential business information. Rules governing handling of confidential business information requested by the USEPA will be according to 40 CFR 2.215(b). 
(c)  No employee or officer of the city or the city municipal authority may disclose or use for his private advantage, any business information which came into his possession, or to which he gained access, by virtue of his official position or employment, except in relation to activities of the industrial pretreatment program. 
(Code 2012, § 18-2-20)

Sec. 54-45. - Planned Unit Development Supplemental District. 
(a)  Generally. A planned unit development, herein referred to as PUD, is a special zoning district category that provides an alternate approach to conventional land use controls. The PUD may be used for particular tracts or parcels of land that are under common ownership and are to be developed as one unit according to a master development plan. The PUD is subject to special review procedures. Once approved by the city council, it becomes a special zoning classification for the property it represents. 
(b)  Intent and purpose. 
(1)  It is the intent of this section to encourage unified design of residential, commercial, industrial, or institutional areas and facilities, or combinations thereof, and to provide for integrated development having harmony of design and variety of function. It is also the intent of this section to encourage the development of planned commercial and industrial sites to eliminate the adverse impacts of traditional strip zoning. 
(2)  The purpose of the PUD provision is to: 
a.  Encourage innovative land development while maintaining appropriate limitations on the character and intensity of use, ensuring compatibility with adjoining and proximate properties, and following the guidelines of the comprehensive plan; 
b.  Permit flexibility within the development to maximize the unique physical features of the particular site; 
c.  Encourage efficient use of land, facilitate economic arrangement of buildings and circulation systems, and encourage diversified living environments and land uses; 
d.  Achieve a continuity of function, and design within the development; 
e.  Encourage innovative development of smaller parcels and land that have been passed over; and 
f.  Provide a vehicle for negotiating modifications in standard development requirements in order to both encourage innovative development and protect the health, safety, and welfare of the community. 
(c)  Planned unit development authorized. 
(1)  A PUD may be authorized by an amendment to the official zoning districts map after public hearing by the planning commission and city council. A PUD shall be considered a special zoning district, and it may be authorized for any use or a combination of uses permitted in this chapter. 
(2)  A PUD must comply with the following requirements: 
a.  A PUD zoning district shall have a minimum area of not less than one acre or the minimum area requirement of the zoning district, which the PUD is based upon, whichever is greater. 
b.  A PUD master plan is required as the basis for review and approval of a PUD application. The PUD master plan shall be adopted as a part of the ordinance of rezoning and shall be in conformance with the requirements of these regulations and the following: 
1.  The PUD master plan shall consist of two elements, the design statement and the master development plan map; 
2.  The PUD master plan shall establish residential densities, as well as amounts, type, and general location of all land uses; and 
3.  The PUD master plan shall serve as the basis for review and approval of all subdivision plats and building permits within the PUD. 
(d)  Effect of planned unit development approval. 
(1)  Approval of a zoning change to PUD adopts the master plan prepared by the applicant and reviewed as part of the application. The master plan establishes new and specific requirements for amount and type of land use, residential densities, development regulations, and location of specific elements of the development, such as open space, landscaping, and screening. 
(2)  The PUD classification replaces any previous zoning district classification on a parcel. 
(3)  Where there is no provision in the PUD master plan for special development regulations, the requirements of the most restrictive conventional zoning district in which a proposed use or a structure is permitted shall be applied to the development. 
(e)  Criteria for planned unit development review and approval. Because the PUD provides the opportunity for higher densities, greater design flexibility, mixed land uses, and improved marketability, the applicant should be prepared to provide amenities and services that might not be required or possible in a conventional development. Review and approval of a PUD is, therefore, a process of negotiation between the city government and the applicant to achieve the intents and purposes of these regulations and the comprehensive plan. The following factors should be specifically included as review criteria for the evaluation of a PUD application. Other factors not listed herein may also be considered in the review process in order to respond to specific design and land use proposals. The following design standards shall be specifically included as review criteria for the evaluation of a PUD application: 
(1)  Intent. The proposed PUD shall be designed to provide for the unified development of the area in accordance with the spirit and purpose of the comprehensive plan and the land uses and zoning districts adjacent to it. 
(2)  Design. Design of the PUD may provide for modification of conventional zoning ordinance requirements for such elements as yard areas, densities, setback and height on individual lots in accordance with the PUD master plan. 
(3)  Use requirements. Density, land use, and intensity of use requirements shall be based on the PUD master plan and shall be reviewed carefully for conformance to the comprehensive plan. 
(4)  Modification of building code requirements. Building code requirements shall not be reduced or modified in the design of a PUD. 
(5)  Maximum dwelling units. The maximum number of dwelling units within a PUD shall be based on calculation of gross density. Gross density shall be established in the PUD master plan and shall be calculated by dividing the total land area to be developed for residential uses (exclusive of arterial streets) by the number of the dwelling units. 
(6)  Housing. Location and type of housing shall be established in a general pattern and shown on the master development plan map. 
(7)  Reduction of existing requirements. Open space requirements, parking requirements and landscaping requirements, if applicable, shall not be reduced in the design of a PUD. 
(8)  Amenities. Amenities should be considered as an important justification for development and city approval of a PUD. Where gross or net densities are to be increased to promote economy of development, or where other methods of land use intensification are proposed, useable open space should be furnished along with provisions for its permanent retention and continued maintenance. Sidewalks and pedestrian ways shall be planned where it is necessary to provide for amenity and public safety. 
(9)  Minimum land area and frontage. The minimum area and frontage for a PUD request involving office, commercial and industrial land uses should generally be at least the minimum required by the conventional zoning associated with the proposal. 
(10)  Streets. The following are general design standards for streets: 
a.  Street design should be innovative and should restrict through traffic from residential areas as much as possible. 
b.  Encouragement should be given to design of short local streets serving limited areas, such as the residential cul-de-sac. 
c.  Development of a private street system should be considered appropriate under certain conditions where there is no through traffic. However, a private street system shall not serve as a reason for reduction in minimum design and paving standards in urban areas. 
d.  On-street parking bays or other similar areas shall not be approved on public streets. 
(11)  Adjacent land uses. The following general guidelines shall be used to establish the relationship of the PUD to abutting land uses: The master development plan map shall show graphically the treatments that will be employed to separate the PUD from abutting properties, including commitments to landscaping, screening earth berms, or similar techniques. It is appropriate to specifically establish areas with height limitations where a transition to more intense uses is proposed or where a higher intensity development is proposed to abut a lower intensity area. 
(12)  Mixed land use development. Where a PUD proposes a mix of uses which would generally be incompatible with a conventional development, the PUD master plan should specifically establish appropriate guidelines to ensure a harmonious development.

(1)  A-1 zoning district. There shall be no restriction on fencing type or material in an A-1 zoning district. All fences must be constructed entirely on private property i.e., off the public right-of-way. All fences must conform to city requirements for visibility at intersections where applicable. Perimeter fences located more than 50 feet from a residential structure shall have a gate capable of opening a minimum of 16 feet clear space. The fire department must approve gates and locking devices. 
(2)  R-1, R-2, R-3, and R-4 zoning districts. No fence may be erected without first having obtained a permit from the community development office of the city. 
a.  Rear yard fences may be erected to comply with the following regulations: 
1.  Rear yard fences may be erected on private property and may not encroach into alley right-of-way. It is the property owner's responsibility to determine the location of all property lines for fence placement through a survey or through mutual agreement with adjoining property owners. Disputes over property boundaries may be handled through existing legal remedies. The city does not assume responsibility for property boundary locations. 
2.  Any fencing constructed over dedicated utility easements may be required to be removed at the property owner's expense should utility provider need to access systems in those areas. It should be understood that property owners who do not enclose utility easements should provide a means of access so those areas can be mowed and maintained. Maintenance of the easement area is the responsibility of the property owners upon whose property the easement is located. 
3.  Rear yard fences must be located at least 12 feet from the pavement edge on all corner lots so as not to obscure visibility. Rear yard fencing material may consist of the following: 
(i)  Wire such as chain link and wire mesh but not barbed wire.

(iv)  Sheet metal may be used in the rear yard only, provided surfaces are painted or treated. The fence must be constructed so as to be visually appropriate to residential neighborhoods. 
(v)  Other materials upon review and approval by the community development department. 
(vi)  No electric wire fences will be permitted on residential zoned property of less than one acre tracts. The city inspector, at his discretion, may determine an electric fence to be a public safety hazard on any property and may require such devices be discontinued. 
(vii)  Height of fences for rear and side yard may not exceed eight feet in height. The city inspector may provide exceptions to this requirement where surrounding terrain justify such exception. Any exceptions made will be to substantially carry out the intent of these requirements. 
b.  Front yard fences may be erected to comply with the following regulations: 
1.  Front yard fences must be constructed of masonry, wire, or wood products in such a way that they may be seen through. It is the intent of these regulations to restrict fencing material in residential areas to those visually appropriate to the neighborhood. For that reason, front yard fences should be of a decorative type only. 
2.  Approval for front yard fencing material other than that listed previously shall be at the discretion of the city community development department. 
3.  Front yard fences shall not obstruct public walkways and shall be located a minimum of 12 feet from the pavement edge of any street. All fences on corner lots must comply with visibility requirements found elsewhere in this Code. 
4.  Front yard and perimeter fences located more than 50 feet from a residential structure shall have a gateway capable of a minimum 16 feet clear width opening. The fire department must approve gates and locking devices. 
5.  Height of front yard fences may not exceed four feet in height.
