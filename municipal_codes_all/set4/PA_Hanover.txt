equal to 1/2 his average monthly salary for the last 36 months prior to
his retirement. Such pension benefit for any month shall be computed
as the sum of:
(1) Any pension benefits due from the Hanover Borough Police Pension
Plan (established by Ordinance No. 1547, enacted May 17, 197224).
(2) Benefits from this pension fund to the extent necessary to bring the
total benefits in any month up to 1/2 the aforesaid monthly average
salary.
(3) Cost-of-living adjustments shall be applied to the normal retirement
benefit placed into effect as of the date of retirement. Such cost-ofliving
benefit shall be the lesser of either 6% of the normal
retirement benefit or the percent of the actual cost-of-living
increase based on the consumer price index, all urban consumers,
as published by the United States Department of Labor and
Industry, 1967, base equals 100 for the preceding calendar year.
Because of the time lag in publishing the consumer price index
reports, such adjustments shall start on April 1 of the first calendar
year following retirement and shall continue on an annual basis
with April 1 of each calendar year being the anniversary date for
starting such readjustment, and same shall continue to be figured
on each April 1 following retirement until the aggregate of all costof-
living adjustments equals 30% of the normal retirement benefit
based on Subsection B(1) above. The adjustment for cost of living
made on the April 1 date first following retirement shall be
prorated on number of full months following retirement date to the
April 1 date applied to a twelve-month period times the maximum
annual adjustment set forth above in this subsection.
C. Such monthly retirement benefits shall be payable during the lifetime of
the retiring Chief of Police.

§ 105-4. Accounts.
B. The Borough Office is responsible for tax accounting procedures and

serves as trustee of the funds; any interest earned on the tax moneys
belongs to the taxing district, not to the Tax Collector. All interest
earned should be credited to the proper taxing district and paid over
monthly or sooner as the taxing district requires. . ."
(1) Interest is to be remitted on a monthly basis using the "Tax
Collector's Interest Remittance Form" (Exhibit A).43

required to make periodic reports to the taxing district. These reports
are due by the 10th day of each month for the previous month's activity,
but can be required more frequently by the taxing district by ordinance
or resolution."

states: "If the amount of tax listed on the duplicate is incorrect, the Tax
Collector has no authority to correct the error. The Tax Collector must
accept in payment the exact amount shown on the duplicate. Refunds of
taxes paid in error may be made only by the taxing district. Checks for the
amount of refund must be issued directly by the treasurer of the taxing
second paragraph, states: "The report is to list all taxes collected
for the taxing district for the reporting period. It is to list the
names of taxpayers and amounts collected from each, including
discounts and penalties. It must carry a total of all taxes collected
with discounts and penalties for the reporting period."
(3) If refunds are applicable in order to appropriately record the same,
the gross amount of taxes collected must be reflected on a
remittance report. Total refunds issued must be reflected on a
separate remittance report with appropriate documentation. The
refund total(s) in each column must be indicated with a minus (-)
sign. The difference between the two reports should equal the
check amount being forwarded.

paragraph, states: "Settlement must be made before the last day of
April of the year following the issuance of the duplicate so the Tax

CURFEW
GENERAL REFERENCES
Police Department  See Ch. 75. Disorderly conduct  See Ch. 186.
§ 175-1. Short title.
This chapter shall be known and may be referred to as the "Curfew
Ordinance."
§ 175-2. Purposes and findings.
A. Purposes. This chapter is an updating of the Borough Curfew Ordinance
of 1943 prescribing, in accordance with prevailing community
standards, regulations for the conduct of minors on streets at night,
effectively enforced, taught in the homes, internalized and adhered to
for generations, all for the good of minors, for the furtherance of family
responsibility and for the public good, safety and welfare.
B. Findings.
(1) The Council finds that the curfew meets a very real local need, has
been over the years a significant factor in minimizing juvenile
delinquency and should be updated and amplified in light of
Hanover's local situation and facts, including but not limited to the
following:
(a) Hanover is one of the oldest communities in (and antedating)
York County, with clearly defined boundaries along the
intersection of State Routes 94, 194 and 116 in the Hanover-
York Valley in southwest York County. Hanover has a compact
built-up area largely within an area of 4.5 square miles, with its
Police Department office in the center of the municipal area at
44 Frederick Street. The Police Department office is located
within the central business district which includes retail,
professional office, utility office, governmental, service,
financial and manufacturing land uses. Still Hanover remains
primarily a residential community; a good place to raise
children, it is said; an area traditionally Pennsylvania Dutch in
background, where after 9:00 p.m., as people say, the
§ 170-6 HANOVER CODE § 175-2
1:148
§ 175-3. Definitions; word usage.
sidewalks are rolled up. This community's sense of the proper
time for cessation of outdoor activities by minors on the streets
is reflected in the curfew hours declared by this chapter, which
takes into consideration, also, the danger hours for nocturnal
crime and for accumulations of minors with potential risks
incident to immaturity.
(2) The Council finds that compact Hanover is not overcrowded.
Population density, as reflected in the Borough Comprehensive Plan
of 1980, is 3,891 per square mile. The total area is 2,370 acres, of
which streets occupy 453 acres [19%]; 164 acres are devoted to
public/semipublic uses [6.9%]; 715 acres are in residential use
[30.1%], where single-family dwellings occupy the largest portion
of the residential area. Adequate indoor living space permits
minors in Hanover to healthfully occupy their time. Commercial
recreation facilities are limited, and there is little or nothing for
minors to do outdoors after the curfew hours herein declared but to
roam the streets.
(3) The Council finds that there are 3,336 minors, the 1990 Census
figure for persons under 18 years of age, residing in Hanover.
There are fewer than 3,078 minors for each school grade. Hanover
has three elementary schools, one middle school for grades five
through eight and one high school.
(4) The Council further finds that the Hanover population (1990
Census) is 14,399. There are 6,316 households (averaging 2.22
persons per household) and 3,930 heads of family households. In
3,197 (81%) households, there are husbands and wives. Of the
2,831 minors, 2,831 are classified in the 1990 Census as "own
child" of the head of household in which they reside. Hanover is a
stable family community. Parental responsibility for the
whereabouts of children is the norm. Legal sanctions to enforce
such responsibility have had a demonstrated effectiveness over the
years. As parental control increases, the likelihood of juvenile
delinquency decreases, and there is, therefore, continuing need for
the nocturnal curfew for minors which has achieved and will
continue to achieve under local conditions the purposes
hereinbefore stated.
A. For the purposes of this chapter, the following terms, phrases and
words and their derivations shall have the meanings given herein.
When not inconsistent with the context, words used in the present tense
include the future, words in the plural number include the singular, and
words in the singular number include the plural. The word "shall" is
always mandatory and not merely directory.
§ 175-2 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 175-3
1:149
§ 175-4. Minors.
It shall be unlawful for any person 17 or less years of age (under 18) to be or
remain in or upon the streets within the Borough of Hanover at night during
the period ending at 6:00 a.m. and beginning:
BOROUGH  The Borough of Hanover, York County, Pennsylvania, with
administrative offices at 44 Frederick Street, Hanover, Pennsylvania
17331.
MINOR  Any person under the age of 18 or, in equivalent phrasing
herein employed, any person 17 or less years of age.
PARENT  Any person having legal custody of a minor as a natural or
adoptive parent, as a legal guardian, as a person who stands in loco
parent is or as a person to whom legal custody has been given by order
of court.
REMAIN  To stay behind, to tarry and to stay unnecessarily upon the
streets, including the congregating of groups (or of interacting minors)
totaling four or more persons in which any minor involved would not
be using the streets for ordinary or serious purposes such as mere
passage or going home. To implement that thought with additional
precision and precaution, numerous exceptions are expressly defined
in § 175-3. More and more exceptions become available with increasing
years and as appropriate in the interest of reasonable regulation which
is intended by use of the meaningful phrase "be or remain" found
constitutional in Baker vs. Borough of Steelton, 17 Dauphin 17 (1912).
STREET  A way or place, of whatsoever nature, open to the use of
the public as a matter of right for purposes of vehicular travel or, in
the case of a sidewalk thereof, for pedestrian travel. The term "street"
includes the legal right-of-way, including but not limited to the cartway
of traffic lanes, the curb, the sidewalks, whether paved or unpaved, and
any grass plots or the grounds found within the legal right-of-way of a
"street." The term "street" applies irrespective of what it is called or
formally named, whether alley, avenue, court, road or otherwise.
B. "Time of night" referred to herein is based upon the prevailing standard
of time, whether Eastern standard time or Eastern daylight saving time,
generally observed at that hour by the public in the Borough, prima
facie the time then observed in the Borough Administrative Offices and
the Police Department.
C. Year of age continues from one birthday, such as the 17th, to (but not
including the day of) the next, such as the 18th birthday, making it clear
that 17 or less years of age is herein treated as equivalent to the phrase
"under 18 years of age," the latter phrase in practice, unfortunately,
having confused a number of persons into the mistaken thought that
eighteen-year-olds might be involved. Similarly, for example, "11 or less
years of age" means under 12 years of age.
A. At 10:00 p.m. for minors 11 or less years of age.
§ 175-3 HANOVER CODE § 175-4
1:150
§ 175-5. Exceptions.
B. At 10:30 p.m. for minors 12 or 13 years of age.
C. At 11:00 p.m. for minors 14 or more years of age.
A. In the following exceptional cases, a minor on a Borough street during
the nocturnal hours for which § 175-4 is intended to provide the
maximum limits of regulation (and a clear general guide for minors,
their parents and their fellow citizens) shall not, however, be
considered in violation of this chapter:
(1) When accompanied by a parent of such minor.
(2) When accompanied by an adult authorized by a parent of such
minor to take said parent's place in accompanying said minor for a
designated period of time and purpose within specified areas.
(3) When exercising First Amendment rights protected by the United
States Constitution, such as the free exercise of religion, freedom
of speech and the right of assembly. Such minor shall evidence the
bona fides of such exercise by first delivering, to Municipal
Building (Police Department) personnel at the Borough Municipal
Building at 44 Frederick Street, where and to whom high priority
messages to the Mayor are regularly received, written
communications signed by such minor and countersigned as
practicable by a parent of such minor with their home address and
telephone number, addressed to the Mayor of the Borough,
specifying where and in what manner said minor will be on the
streets at night (during hours when this chapter is otherwise
applicable to said minor) in the exercise of a First Amendment right
specified in such communications.
(4) In the case of reasonable necessity but only after such minor's
parent has communicated to the Borough Police Department
personnel the facts establishing such reasonable necessity, relating
specified streets at a designated time for a described purpose,
including points of origin and destination. A copy of such
communication or of the police record thereof, duly certified by the
Chief of Police to be correct, with an appropriate notation of the
time it was received and of the names and address of such parent
and minor, shall be admissible evidence.
(5) When the minor is on the sidewalk of the place where such minor
resides or on the sidewalk of either next-door neighbor not
communicating an objection to the police officer.
(6) When returning home by a direct route from (and within 30
minutes of the termination of) a school activity or an activity of
religious or other voluntary association, of which prior notice
indicating the place and probable time of termination has been
given, in writing, to and duly filed for immediate reference by the
§ 175-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 175-5
1:151
Chief of Police or the officer assigned by him on duty for the
police Department, thus encouraging (here as in other exceptional
situations) conduct on the part of minors involved in such activities
and striking a fair balance for any somewhat conflicting interests.
(7) When authorized by special permit from the Mayor carried on the
person of the minor thus authorized, as follows: when necessary
nighttime activities of a minor may be inadequately provided for by
other provisions of this chapter, then recourse may be had to the
Mayor of the Borough, either for a regulation as provided in
Subsection A(8) or for a special permit as the circumstances
warrant.
(8) When authorized by regulation issued by the Mayor in other similar
cases of reasonable necessity, similarly handled but adapted to
necessary nighttime activities of more minors than can readily be
dealt with on an individual special permit basis. Normally such
regulation by the Mayor permitting use of the streets should be
issued sufficiently in advance to permit appropriate publicity
through news media and through other agencies such as the
schools and shall define the activity, the scope of the use of the
streets permitted, the period of time involved, not to extend more
than 30 minutes beyond the time for termination of such activity,
and the reason for finding that such regulation is reasonably
necessary and is consistent with the purposes of this chapter.
(9) When the minor carries a certified card of employment, renewable
each calendar month when the current facts so warrant, dated or
reissued not more than 45 days previously, signed by the Chief of
Police and briefly identifying the minor, the address of his home
and of his place of employment and his hours of employment.
(10) When the minor is, with parental consent, in a motor vehicle. This
contemplates normal travel. From excess of caution, this clearly
exempts bona fide interstate movement through Hanover,
particularly on normal routes such as State Routes 116, 194 and
94, this beginning or ending in Hanover.
(11) When the minor is 17 years of age, if and when the Mayor shall
have determined, by formal rule first reported to Borough Council,
spread upon the minutes and so reported in the press, finding facts
as to the extent (minimal) of juvenile delinquency in such age group
permitting such rule, currently, in the best interest of said minors
and of the Borough, then the Mayor by such formal rule, covering a
period of time designated therein or until recision thereof not
exceeding one year from the date thereof, may take appropriate
action excepting designated minors, minors in a defined group or
area or all minors (as the current facts may warrant) 17 years of
age at the date or attaining 17 years of age during the period that
such formal rule is and remains in effect.
§ 175-5 HANOVER CODE § 175-5
1:152
§ 175-6. Parental responsibility.
It shall be unlawful for a parent having legal custody of a minor knowingly
to permit or by inefficient control to allow such minor to be or remain
upon any Borough street under circumstances not constituting an exception
to or otherwise beyond the scope of this chapter. The term "knowingly"
includes knowledge which a parent should reasonably be expected to have
concerning the whereabouts of a minor in that parent's legal custody;
it is intended to continue to keep neglectful or careless parents up to
a reasonable community standard of parental responsibility through an
objective test. It shall, a priori, be a defense that a parent was completely
indifferent to the activities or conduct or whereabouts of such minor.
§ 175-7. Police procedures.
B. Each of the foregoing exceptions, and their several limitations such as
provisions for notification, are severable, as hereinafter provided but
here reemphasized; and additional, also severable, exceptions,
broadening with the progress toward maturity of minors enrolled
respectively in elementary, middle school and high schools, will be
considered by the Council as warranted by future experience
illuminated by the views of student associations, school personnel,
citizens, associations, ward, precinct and neighborhood spokesmen,
parents, offices and persons in authority concerned positively with
minors as well as with juvenile delinquency.
A. A policeman of the Borough, upon finding or having attention called to
any minor on the streets in prima facie violation of this chapter,
normally shall take the minor to the Borough Police Department Office,
where a parent shall immediately be notified to come for such minor,
whereupon they shall be interrogated. This is intended to permit
ascertainment, under constitutional safeguards, of relevant facts and to
centralize responsibility in the Sergeant there and then on duty for
accurate, effective, fair, impartial and uniform enforcement and
recording, thus making available experienced supervisory personnel,
the best of facilities and access to information and records. In the
absence of convincing evidence, such as a birth certificate, a policeman
on the street shall in the first instance use his best judgment in
determining age.
B. Police procedures shall constantly be refined in the light of experience
and may provide, inter alia, that the policemen may deliver to a parent
thereof a minor under appropriate circumstances, for example a minor
of tender age near home, whose identity and address may readily be
ascertained or are known.
C. In any event, such policeman shall within 24 hours file a written report
with the Chief of Police or shall participate to the extent of the
information for which he is responsible in the filing of such report
within 24 hours.
§ 175-5 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 175-7
1:153
§ 175-8. Violations and penalties.
Prevailing community standards and the real internalization thereof or
interpersonal sanctions therefor, that in practice count for much as to
when minors should be off the streets, reflected in this chapter are hereby
undergirded with the following legal sanction:
D. When a parent, immediately called, has come to take charge of the
minor and the appropriate information has been recorded, the minor
shall be released to the custody of such parent. If the parent cannot be
located or fails to take charge of the minor, then the minor shall be
released to the juvenile authorities, except to the extent that in
accordance with police regulations approved in advance by juvenile
authorities, the minor may temporarily be entrusted to a relative,
neighbor or other person who will on behalf of a parent assume the
responsibility of caring for the minor pending the availability or arrival
of a parent.
E. In the case of a first violation by a minor, the Chief of Police shall, by
certified mail, send to a parent written notice of said violation with a
warning that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of
this chapter, including enforcement of parental responsibility and of
applicable penalties.
A. If, after the warning notice pursuant to § 175-7 of a first violation by a
minor, a parent violates § 175-6 (in connection with a second violation
by said minor), this shall be treated as a first offense by the parent. For
such first parental offense, the parent shall be fined $25; and for each
subsequent offense by a parent, the fine shall be increased by an
additional $25, e.g., $50 for the second and $75 for the third offense.
The Magisterial District Judge, upon finding a parent guilty, shall
sentence the parent to pay such fine and the costs of prosecution and,
upon refusal to pay such fines and costs, to be imprisoned in the jail of
York County for a period not exceeding 10 days.
B. Any minor who shall violate any of the provisions of this chapter more
than three times shall be reported by the Mayor to a society or
organization whose purpose it is to take charge of incorrigibles and
delinquents, and proceedings shall then be taken under the Juvenile
Act, 11 P.S. § 50-101 et seq.,55 before the Juvenile Court for treatment,
supervision and rehabilitation of such minor.
C. A like procedure before the juvenile authorities shall be followed in any
case where the imposing of a fine or fines upon a parent shall not be
effective or where for any other reason the provisions of this chapter
cannot be made effective by the imposing of penalties under this
§ 175-8.
55.Editor's Note: See now 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 6301 et seq.
§ 175-7 HANOVER CODE § 175-9
1:154
§ 175-9. Severability.
Severability is intended throughout and within the provisions of this
chapter. If any provision, including inter alia any exception, part, phrase or
term, or application thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid,
the application to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected
thereby and the validity of this chapter in any and all other respects shall
not be affected thereby. From excess of caution, the Mayor is authorized
to give advisory opinions, in writing or immediately reduced to writing,
which shall be binding and shall be adhered to by the police, until the
chapter is amended in such respect, interpreting terms, phrases, parts or
any provisions. Normally, such advisory opinion shall be in response to
good faith, signed letters addressed to him at the Borough administration
building, questioning as ambiguous, as having a potentially chilling effect
on constitutional rights specifically invoked or as otherwise invalid, in all
three categories with respect to proposed conduct definitely described. This
administrative remedy must be exhausted prior to presenting to any court
a question in any of said three categories; the Borough Council does not
intend a result that is absurd, impossible of execution or unreasonable. It is
intended that this chapter be held inapplicable in such cases, if any, where
its application would be unconstitutional. A constitutional construction is
intended and shall be given. The Council does not intend to violate the
Constitution of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or the Constitution of
the United States of America.
§ 175-10. Continuing evaluation.
A. The Borough Council will continue its evaluation and updating of this
chapter.
B. Accordingly, there shall be compiled and informally reported to the
Borough Council through effective channels (such as the normal
monthly distribution by the Borough Manager and Borough Secretary,
each Councilman, the Mayor and the Borough Solicitor or noteworthy
material) all exceptional cases hereunder of reasonable necessity, the
notices of school and other activities, the Mayor's special form and the
Mayor's regulations hereinbefore authorized and the Mayor's advisory
opinions for consideration by the appropriate committee and by the
Borough Council in further updating and continuing evaluation of this
chapter.
C. For the same reasons, as well as for the implementation beyond these
legal aspects of the basic purposes hereof, the Mayor and relevant
committees of the Borough Council through their respective chairmen
in coordinated efforts shall work with existing, and may organize,
voluntary groups and shall stimulate volunteer leadership in programs
of research and of action, dealing constructively on neighborhood and
local bases with juvenile delinquency and the prevention, control or
containment thereof in all its ramifications and with practicable steps
toward the good life and a better life for minors 17 or less years of age
and with the working of this chapter, community-wise and in individual

General Provisions
§ 215-2. Intent.
The intent of this chapter is to:
§ 215-3. Applicability.
§ 215-4. Abrogation and greater restrictions.
This chapter supersedes any other conflicting provisions which may be
in effect in identified floodplain areas. However, any other ordinance
provisions shall remain in full force and effect to the extent that those
provisions are more restrictive. If there is any conflict between any of the
provisions of this chapter, the more restrictive shall apply.
§ 215-5. Warning and disclaimer of liability.
A. Promote the general health, welfare, and safety of the community.
B. Encourage the utilization of appropriate construction practices in order
to prevent or minimize flood damage in the future.
C. Minimize danger to public health by protecting water supply and
natural drainage.
D. Reduce financial burdens imposed on the community, its governmental
units, and its residents by preventing excessive development in areas
subject to flooding.
E. Comply with federal and state floodplain management requirements.
A. It shall be unlawful for any person, partnership, business or corporation
to undertake, or cause to be undertaken, any construction or
development anywhere within the Borough of Hanover unless a permit
has been obtained from the Floodplain Administrator.
B. A permit shall not be required for minor repairs to existing buildings or
structures.
A. The degree of flood protection sought by the provisions of this chapter
is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on
accepted engineering methods of study. Larger floods may occur or
flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes, such as
ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris. This chapter does not
imply that areas outside any identified floodplain areas or that land uses
permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood
damages.
B. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the Borough of
Hanover or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that
§ 215-2 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 215-5

180 days after the date of issuance of the development permit. Work
shall also be completed within 12 months after the date of issuance of
the permit or the permit shall expire unless a time extension is granted,
in writing, by the Floodplain Administrator. The issuance of
development permit does not refer to the zoning approval. The "actual
start of construction" means either the first placement of permanent
construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any
work beyond the stage of excavation, or the placement of a
manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not
include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor
does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it
include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the
erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the
property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied
as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial
improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration
of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether
or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
B. Time extensions shall be granted only if a written request is submitted
by the applicant, who sets forth sufficient and reasonable cause for the
Floodplain Administrator to approve such a request, and the original
permit is compliant with the ordinance and FIRM/FIS in effect at the
time the extension is granted.
A. Notices. Whenever the Floodplain Administrator or other authorized
municipal representative determines that there are reasonable grounds
to believe that there has been a violation of any provisions of this
chapter, or of any regulations adopted pursuant thereto, the Floodplain
Administrator shall give notice of such alleged violation as hereinafter
provided. Such notice shall:
(1) Be in writing.
(2) Include a statement of the reasons for its issuance.
(3) Allow a reasonable time not to exceed a period of 30 days for the
performance of any act it requires.
(4) Be served upon the property owner or his agent as the case may
require; provided, however, that such notice or order shall be
deemed to have been properly served upon such owner or agent
when a copy thereof has been served with such notice by any other
method authorized or required by the laws of this state.
§ 215-14 HANOVER CODE § 215-15
1:174
§ 215-16. Appeals.
(5) Contain an outline of remedial actions which, if taken, will effect
compliance with the provisions of this chapter.
B. Penalties. Any person who fails to comply with any or all of the
requirements or provisions of this chapter or who fails or refuses to
comply with any notice, order or direction of the Floodplain
Administrator or any other authorized employee of the municipality
shall be guilty of a summary offense and, upon conviction, shall pay a
fine to Borough of Hanover of not less than $100 nor more than $600,
plus costs of prosecution. In addition to the above penalties, all other
actions are hereby reserved, including an action in equity for the proper
enforcement of this chapter. The imposition of a fine or penalty for any
violation of or noncompliance with this chapter shall not excuse the
violation or noncompliance or permit it to continue. All such persons
shall be required to correct or remedy such violations and
noncompliance within a reasonable time. Any development initiated or
any structure or building constructed, reconstructed, enlarged, altered,
or relocated in noncompliance with this chapter may be declared by the
Borough Council to be a public nuisance and abatable as such.
A. Any person aggrieved by any action or decision of the Floodplain
Administrator concerning the administration of the provisions of this
chapter may appeal to the Zoning Hearing Board. Such appeal must be
filed, in writing, within 30 days after the decision, determination or
action of the Floodplain Administrator.
B. Upon receipt of such appeal, the Zoning Hearing Board shall consider
the appeal in accordance with the Municipal Planning Code and any
other local ordinance.
C. Any person aggrieved by any decision of the Zoning Hearing Board may
seek relief therefrom by appeal to court, as provided by the laws of this
state, including the Pennsylvania Flood Plain Management Act.

ARTICLE IV
Floodplain Areas
§ 215-17. Identification.
§ 215-18. Description.
The identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific areas:
A. The identified floodplain area shall be:
(1) Any areas of the Borough of Hanover classified as special flood
hazard areas (SFHAs) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and the
accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) dated
December 16, 2015, and issued by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) or the most recent revision thereof,
including all digital data developed as part of the Flood Insurance
Study; and
(2) Any community-identified flood hazard areas.
B. The above-referenced FIS and FIRMs and any subsequent revisions and
amendments are hereby adopted by the Borough of Hanover and
declared to be a part of this chapter.
A. The Floodway Area shall be those areas identified in the FIS and the
FIRM as floodway and which represent the channel of a watercourse
and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge
the base flood without increasing the water surface elevation by more
than one foot at any point. This term shall also include floodway areas
which have been identified in other available studies or sources of
information for those special flood hazard areas where no floodway has
been identified in the FIS and FIRM.
(1) Within any floodway area, no encroachments, including fill, new
construction, substantial improvements, or other development,
shall be permitted unless it has been demonstrated through
hydrologic and hydraulic analysis performed in accordance with
standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment
would not result in any increase in flood levels within the
community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
(2) Within any floodway area, no new construction or development
shall be allowed, unless the appropriate permit is obtained from the
Department of Environmental Protection Regional Office.
B. The AE Area/District shall be those areas identified as an AE Zone on
the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base flood
elevations have been provided.
(1) The AE Area adjacent to the floodway shall be those areas
identified as an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared
§ 215-17 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 215-18
1:177
§ 215-19. Changes in identification of area.
The identified floodplain area may be revised or modified by the Borough
Council where studies or information provided by a qualified agency or
person documents the need for such revision. However, prior to any such
change to the special flood hazard area, approval must be obtained from
FEMA. Additionally, as soon as practicable, but not later than six months
after the date such information becomes available, a community shall notify
FEMA of the changes to the special flood hazard area by submitting
technical or scientific data. See § 215-22B for situations where FEMA
notification is required.
§ 215-20. Boundary disputes.
Should a dispute concerning any identified floodplain boundary arise, an
initial determination shall be made by the Borough of Hanover and any
party aggrieved by this decision or determination may appeal to the
Borough Council. The burden of proof shall be on the appellant.
§ 215-21. Jurisdictional boundary changes.
Prior to development occurring in areas where annexation or other
corporate boundary changes are proposed or have occurred, the community
shall review flood hazard data affecting the lands subject to boundary
by FEMA for which base flood elevations have been provided and a
floodway has been delineated.
C. The A Area/District shall be those areas identified as an A Zone on the
FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no base
flood elevations have been provided. For these areas, elevation and
floodway information from other federal, state, or other acceptable
sources shall be used when available. Where other acceptable
information is not available, the base flood elevation shall be
determined by using the elevation of a point on the boundary of the
identified floodplain area which is nearest the construction site. In lieu
of the above, the municipality may require the applicant to determine
the elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering techniques.
Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by
professional engineers or others of demonstrated qualifications, who
shall certify that the technical methods used correctly reflect currently
accepted technical concepts. Studies, analyses, computations, etc.,
shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical
review by the municipality.
D. Community-identified flood hazard areas shall be those areas where
Borough of Hanover has identified local flood hazard or ponding areas,
as delineated and adopted on a Local Flood Hazard Map using best
available topographic data and locally derived information such as flood
of record, historic high water marks, soils or approximate study
methodologies.
§ 215-18 HANOVER CODE § 215-21

ARTICLE V
Technical Provisions
§ 215-22. General requirements.
A. Alteration or relocation of watercourse.
(1) No encroachment, alteration, or improvement of any kind shall be
made to any watercourse until all adjacent municipalities which
may be affected by such action have been notified by the
municipality and until all required permits or approvals have first
been obtained from the Department of Environmental Protection
Regional Office.
(2) No encroachment, alteration, or improvement of any kind shall be
made to any watercourse unless it can be shown that the activity
will not reduce or impede the flood-carrying capacity of the
watercourse in any way.
(3) In addition, FEMA and the Pennsylvania Department of Community
and Economic Development shall be notified prior to any alteration
or relocation of any watercourse.
B. When a community proposes to permit the following encroachments:
any development that causes a rise in the base flood elevations within
the floodway; or any development occurring in Zones A1-30 and Zone
AE without a designated floodway which will cause a rise of more than
one foot in the base flood elevation; or alteration or relocation of a
stream (including but not limited to installing culverts and bridges), the
applicant shall (as per 44 CFR Part 65.12):
(1) Apply to FEMA for conditional approval of such action prior to
permitting the encroachments to occur.
(2) Upon receipt of the Administrator's conditional approval of map
change and prior to approving the proposed encroachments, a
community shall provide evidence to FEMA of the adoption of
floodplain management ordinances incorporating the increased
base flood elevations and/or revised floodway reflecting the postproject
condition.
(3) Upon completion of the proposed encroachments, a community
shall provide as-built certifications. FEMA will initiate a final map
revision upon receipt of such certifications in accordance with 44
CFR Part 67.
C. Any new construction, development, uses or activities allowed within
any identified floodplain area shall be undertaken in strict compliance
with the provisions contained in this chapter and any other applicable
codes, ordinances and regulations.
§ 215-22 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 215-22
1:181
§ 215-23. Elevation and floodproofing requirements.
Within any identified floodplain area, any new construction or substantial
improvements shall be prohibited. If a variance is obtained for new
construction or substantial improvements in the identified floodplain area
in accordance with the criteria in Article VIII, then the following provisions
apply:

development shall be located within the area measured 50 feet
landward from the top-of-bank of any watercourse.
A. Residential structures.
(1) In AE, A1-30, and AH Zones, any new construction or substantial
improvement shall have the lowest floor (including basement)
elevated up to or above the regulatory flood elevation.
(2) In A Zones, where there are no base flood elevations specified on
the FIRM, any new construction or substantial improvement shall
have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated up to or above
the regulatory flood elevation determined in accordance with

the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such
as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction

of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does
not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor
does it include the installation of streets and walkways; nor does it include
excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection
of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property
of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling
units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the
"actual start of construction" means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling,
floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration
affects the external dimensions of the building.

or devisees, transfer of ownership or building or lot development; provided,
however, that the subdivision by lease of land for agricultural purposes into
parcels of more than 10 acres, not involving any new street or easement of
access or any residential dwelling, shall be exempted.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE  Damage from any cause sustained by a
structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged
condition would equal or exceed 50% or more of the market value of the
structure before the damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT  Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, of which the cost equals
or exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure before the start of
construction of the improvement. This term includes structures which have
incurred substantial damage or repetitive loss, regardless of the actual
repair work performed. The term does not, however, include any project for
improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local
health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary
to assure safe living conditions.
UNIFORM CONSTRUCTION CODE (UCC)  The statewide building code
adopted by the Pennsylvania General Assembly in 1999 applicable to new

perform his duty of safeguarding the health and safety of the occupants
of dwellings and of the general public. For the purpose of making such
inspections, the Health Officer is hereby authorized to enter, examine and
survey, between the hours of 8:00 a.m. to 6.00 p.m., any day except Sunday,
all dwellings, dwelling units, rooming units and premises. The Health
Officer, provided public health and welfare are not in jeopardy, shall in
all cases of scheduled or routine inspection give not less than seven days'
written notice to the owner of the property, of the time such inspection is to
be made, so that the owner may be present. The owner or occupant of every
dwelling, dwelling unit and rooming unit, or the person in charge thereof,
shall give the Health Officer free access to such dwelling, dwelling unit or
rooming unit and its premises at all reasonable times, for the purpose of
such inspection, examination and survey. Every occupant of a dwelling or

to any part of such dwelling or dwelling unit or its premises at all reasonable
times, for the purpose of making inspections and such repairs or alterations
as are necessary to effect compliance with the provisions of this chapter

pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.
§ 230-3. Enforcement; service of notices and orders; hearings.

if a copy thereof is served upon him personally; or if a copy thereof
is sent by registered mail to his last known address; or if a copy
thereof is posted in a conspicuous place in or about the dwelling
affected by the notice; or if he is served with such notice by any
other method authorized or required under the laws of this state.
§ 230-2 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 230-3

requesting such hearing and setting forth a brief statement of the
grounds therefor within 10 days after the day the notice was served.
Upon receipt of such petition, the Health Officer shall set a time and
place within five days for such hearing and shall give the petitioner
written notice thereof. The time and place set by the Health Officer
shall be set far enough in advance to allow the petitioner at least five
days to prepare rebuttal. At such hearing, the petitioner shall be given
an opportunity to be heard and to show why such notice should be
modified or withdrawn. The hearing shall be commenced not later than
30 days after the day on which the petition was filed; provided, that
upon application of the petitioner, the Board of Health may postpone
the date of the hearing for a reasonable time beyond such thirty-day
period, if in its judgment the petitioner has submitted a good and
sufficient reason for such postponement.
C. Within five days after such hearing, the Board of Health shall sustain,
modify or withdraw the notice, depending upon its finding as to
whether the provisions of this chapter and of the rules and regulations
adopted pursuant thereto have been complied with. If the Board of
Health sustains or modifies such notice, it shall be deemed to be an
order. Any notice served pursuant to § 230-3A of this chapter shall
automatically become an order if a written petition for a hearing is not
filed in the office of the Health Officer within 10 days after such notice
is served. After a hearing in the case of any notice suspending any
permit required by this chapter or by any rule or regulation adopted
pursuant thereto, when such notice has been sustained by the Board of
Health, the permit shall be deemed to have been revoked. Any such

The ordinance enacted the 20th day of December 1924, entitled "An
ordinance regulating, licensing and prohibiting certain usages of highways
and commercial enterprises in the Borough of Hanover," and all other
ordinances, amendments or parts of ordinances inconsistent or conflicting
herewith, be and the same are hereby repealed.
E. To sell or offer for sale to the consuming public, on any public highway
or from house to house, within the said Borough, as a huckster, peddler,
hawker, street vendor, traveling merchant or agent, any goods, wares or
merchandise, without having first procured from the proper officer of
the said Borough a license so to do. The amount of the fee to be paid to
the proper officer of said Borough for such license shall be as follows:
(1) For the first automobile, truck, trailer, wagon or other vehicle used
by any person or persons, firm or corporation, in connection with
the business aforesaid, $50 for each calendar year or fractional
part thereof; and for each additional automobile, truck, trailer,
wagon or other vehicle used in the business aforesaid, $25 for each
calendar year or fractional part thereof. [Amended 3-26-2003 by
Ord. No. 2067]
(2) For each person engaged in the business aforesaid, other than by
use or employment of any vehicle as mentioned in § 240-1E(1)
hereof, $10 for each calendar year or fractional part thereof.
(3) Provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall apply to any
persons, goods or wares at any time exempted from such
requirements by the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
A. This chapter does not authorize the use of highways for the purposes
mentioned in § 240-1 hereof, in any cases where such uses are
prohibited or restricted by any other ordinance of the Borough, the
intention hereof being to charge a license fee for a use which is
permitted and not restricted or prohibited. The payment of a license fee
does not permit the holder to create a nuisance, to do anything
dangerous in itself or that may attract children to a danger. Anything
done contrary to this chapter is a nuisance and shall be abated as such,
in addition to the fine imposed.
B. Nothing may be licensed under this chapter which is prohibited by state
law or other Borough ordinances. Licenses granted to individuals are
not transferable. Licenses which are personal do not permit the
employment of unlicensed agents. Every vehicle is required to have a
license tag conspicuously placed as designated by the Chief of Police.
Licenses are to be issued for a period of one year, beginning January 1.
Any fractional part of any unit of time or space or number requires the
same license fee as the whole unit.

described in § 254-2 of this chapter and in such other zones as may
hereafter be established, said parking spaces to be designated by lines
painted or durably marked on the curbing or surface of the street. At each
space so marked off, it shall be unlawful to park any vehicle in such a
way that said vehicle shall not be entirely within the limits of the space
so designated. In any parking meter zone where vehicles are now required
to be parked parallel to the curbline, parking spaces shall be designated
adjacent to the curblines, each of which spaces shall be approximately 22
feet in length. In any parking meter zone where vehicles are now or may
hereafter be required to park at right angles to the curbline, parking spaces
shall be designated adjacent to the curbline, each of which spaces shall be
approximately eight feet in width.
§ 254-4. Installation of parking meters. [Amended 2-16-1983 by

to the parking spaces provided in § 254-3 of this chapter, as close to the
curbline as practical, and the Borough Manager and Chief of Police shall
be responsible for the regulation, control, operation, maintenance and use
of such parking meters. Each device shall be so set as to display a signal
showing legal parking upon the deposit of the appropriate coin or coins,
lawful money of the United States of America for the period of time
prescribed by this chapter. Each device shall be so arranged that, upon the
expiration of the lawful time limit, it will indicate by a proper visible signal
that the lawful parking period has expired, and in such cases, the right
of such vehicle to occupy such space shall cease and the operator, owner,
possessor or manager thereof shall be subject to the penalties prescribed
by law.
§ 254-5. Operation of parking meters.
Except in a period of emergency determined by an officer of the Fire or
Police Department, or in compliance with the directions of a police officer
or traffic control sign or signal, when any vehicle shall be parked in any
parking space alongside or next to which a parking meter is located, the
operator of such vehicles shall, upon entering the said parking meter space,
immediately deposit or cause to be deposited in said meter such proper
coin of the United States as is required for such parking meter and as is
designated by proper directions on the meter, and when required by the
directions on the meter, the operator of such vehicle, after the deposit of
the proper coin or coins, shall also set in operation the timing mechanism

on such meter in accordance with directions properly appearing thereon,
and failure to deposit such proper coin and to set the timing mechanism
in operation when so required shall constitute a violation of this chapter.
Upon the deposit of such coin (and the setting of the timing mechanism in
operation when so required), the parking space may be lawfully occupied
by such vehicle during the period of time which has been prescribed for the
part of the street in which said parking space is located. If said vehicle shall
remain parked in any such parking space beyond the parking time limit set
for such parking space, or if the meter shall indicate such illegal parking,
then in either event such vehicle shall be considered as parking overtime
and beyond the period of legal parking time, and such parking shall be
deemed a violation of this chapter.
§ 254-6. Unlawful conduct; fines.
A. It shall be unlawful and a violation of the provisions of this chapter for
any person:
(1) To cause, allow, permit or suffer any vehicle registered in the name
of or operated by such person to be parked overtime or beyond the
period of legal parking time established for any parking meter zone
as herein described or to deposit in any parking meter a coin for
the purpose of parking beyond the maximum legal parking time for
the particular parking meter zone.
(2) To permit any vehicle to remain or be placed in any parking space
adjacent to any parking meter while said meter is displaying a
signal indicating that the vehicle occupying such parking space has
already been parked beyond the period prescribed for such parking
space.

in such position that the vehicle shall not be entirely within the
area designated by such lines or markings.

impair the usefulness of any parking meter installed under the
provisions of this chapter.
(5) To deposit or cause to be deposited in any parking meter any slug,
device or metal substance or other substitute for lawful coins.

provided in a zone in which such meter is located.

provided by law, the payment of such meters and the installation thereof to
be provided for solely from the receipts, funds and revenues obtained by the

parking meters as may be necessary to maintain the same in good operating
condition and to pay for such parts and maintenance exclusively from the
receipts, funds and revenues received from the operation of said parking
meters.

Anything to the contrary in this chapter notwithstanding, any person who is
in the business of repairing or constructing any property in a parking meter
zone, and which requires a vehicle for such work, may obtain from the
Police Department a cover or marker, in such form, at such time and for the
use of such length of time as the Police Department may determine, which
cover or marker, when placed upon or over any parking meter, will allow the
vehicle of such person to occupy the parking space at such parking meter
without such person depositing any coin therein, provided that such person
pay to the Borough of Hanover a sum of money equal to $0.05 for each hour
or fraction thereof such space is to be used.

or floors below grade. Such subsoil drains may be positioned inside or

or less. If the drain is over five feet, its entire length shall be three

receive little use and sewer gas backflow could be a problem.
"Sump pumps may be allowed and flow meters may be required, at
the discretion of the Plumbing Inspector, where the physical layout of
the property and the need to provide sewer hookup without unusual
hardship is necessary, but he shall safeguard such to prohibit
groundwater infiltration as is practical, given the physical layout."

least four members of the Board, and provided further that such variation,
to be effective, must be ratified by the Hanover Borough Council.

hereinafter provided, for the use, whether direct or indirect, of the sewer
system, based on the rates hereinafter set forth.
§ 286-13. Rent and charges for sanitary sewage.
A. For collection and treatment of sanitary sewage discharged into the
sewer system from single family dwelling units the rates shall be a
quarterly charge, payable upon receipt of the bill therefore, and based
upon the water used by the property in accordance with the following
rate schedule: [Last amended 12-28-2011 by Res. No. 986]
Gallons Per Quarter Charge
First 7,000 or less $54 (minimum)
Next 18,000 $6.75 per 1,000 gallons
Next 25,000 $6.65 per 1,000 gallons
B. Multiple occupancy or use.
(1) In case two or more dwellings, flats, apartments, stores or offices
or two or more families in one dwelling unit have the use of the
§ 286-11 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 286-13
1:291
sewer system through one sewer connection, each and every such
dwelling, flat, apartment, store or office shall be charged the
minimum charge set forth in § 286-13A above, the same as if each
such unit or family had a direct and separate connection to the
sewer system. The charge in excess of such minimum shall be
determined by dividing the total quantity of water used, as shown

the current billing period. The number of such bedroom units, plus
the number of each separate public dining room, office, store, shop,

less than 75% of the highest quarterly bill in the twelve-month period
immediately preceding the then current billing period, whichever
minimum is higher. The charges in excess of such minimum shall be

collection and treatment of sanitary sewage discharged into the sewer
system from single-family dwelling units or from property used for a
single purpose shall be a quarterly charge, payable as hereinafter
provided, based upon the water used by the property first and shall be
computed from the following rate schedule, until such time as flow
exchange meters shall allow implementation of the Service Agreement
billing existing between the two municipalities dated August 3, 1983:
Gallons Per Quarter Charge
First 7,000 or less $32 (minimum)

quarterly charge, as set forth in Subsection A above, of $32, or a
minimum of not less than 75% of the highest quarterly bill in the twelvemonth
period immediately preceding the then-current billing period,
whichever minimum is higher. The charges in excess of such minimum
shall be determined by the total quantity of water used, as shown by the
meter readings, and applying the rate schedules set forth in Subsection
A above to the quantity so determined.
A. Methods of measuring volume.
(1) Whenever a person purchasing all water used from the Borough
municipal waterworks discharges sanitary sewage into the sewer
§ 286-13 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 286-15
1:293
system, the volume of water used, as determined from meter
readings of the Borough, shall be used in computing the sewer
rental.
(2) In cases where dwellings and establishments have sources of water
supply in addition to or other than Borough water and discharge
sanitary sewage into the sewer system, those dwellings and
establishments shall provide a meter on such additional or other
source of supply. The total amount of water consumed, as shown by
these meter readings, will be used in computing the sewer rental.
(3) In cases where establishments use water from the Borough and/or
from an independent supply for industrial purposes and/or for
cooling or air-conditioning purposes, such that all or part of the
water so used is not discharged into the sewer system, the quantity
of water used to determine the sewer rental shall be computed by
one of the following methods:
(a) Method No. 1. By placing a meter or measuring device on the
sewer connection. The readings from this meter or measuring
device shall be used in computing the sewer rental.
(b) Method No. 2. By placing a meter or measuring device on the
effluent not discharging into the sewer system, the readings
from this meter or measuring device will then be deducted
from the total water meter readings and the remainder will be
used in computing the sewer rental.
(c) Method No. 3. When, in the opinion of the Borough Manager, it
is not practical to install measuring devices to continuously
determine the quantity of water not discharged to the sewer
system, the Borough Manager will determine, in such manner
and by such method as he may prescribe, the percentage of
metered water discharged into the sewer system, and the
quantity of water used to compute the sewer rental shall be the
percentage so determined of the quantity measured by the
water meter or meters. Any dispute as to the estimated amount
shall be submitted to the Borough Council after notice of the
estimate, whose decision on the matter shall be final for the
current calendar year.
B. Measuring devices. All meters or measuring devices not provided by
the Hanover municipal waterworks but required to be used under the
provisions of this article shall be furnished and installed by the property
owner and shall be under the control of the Borough, and may be
tested, inspected or repaired by the Borough employees whenever
Council deems necessary. The owner of the property upon which the
measuring device is installed shall be responsible for its maintenance
and safekeeping, and all repairs thereto shall be made at the property
owner's expense, whether such repairs are made necessary by ordinary
wear and tear or other causes. Bills for such repairs, if made by the

Borough, shall be due and payable at the same time and collected in
the same manner as are the bills for sewer services; such bills from and
after their due date shall constitute a lien upon the property upon which
such measuring device is installed.
C. Meter reading. Borough shall be responsible for the reading of all
meters or measuring devices, and they shall be made available to
Borough employees for meter reading at any reasonable time.
A. The sewer rent for collection and treatment of industrial wastes
discharged into the sewer system shall be made in accordance with
§ 286-13 above. In addition thereto, further charges shall be made for
all industrial waste or sewage discharged into the sewer system having
suspended solids and biochemical oxygen demand in excess of the
following concentrations:
(1) Suspended solids, 350 parts per million.
(2) Biochemical oxygen demand, 300 parts per million.
B. The additional charge for industrial waste or sewage having
concentration in excess of the foregoing shall be based on the strength
factor determined according to the following formula:
* Where these figures are less than 300 parts per million in
biochemical oxygen demand or 350 parts per million in suspended
solids, the value in the parenthesis shall be equal to one.
C. In cases where the suspended solids, in the opinion of the Borough, do
not represent the true characteristics of the solids leaving, the Borough
reserves the right to use total solids instead of suspended solids.

Pretreatment of Wastewater
§ 290-13. Pretreatment facilities.
Users shall provide wastewater treatment as required to comply with this
part and shall achieve compliance with all National Categorical
Pretreatment Standards, local limits, and the prohibitions set out in § 290-5
of this part within the time limitations specified by EPA, the state, or the
Borough, whichever is more stringent. Any facilities required to pretreat
wastewater to a level acceptable to the Borough shall be provided,
operated, and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans showing the
pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the
Pretreatment Officer for review, and shall be acceptable to the Pretreatment
Officer before such facilities are constructed. The review of such plans and
operating procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility
of modifying such facilities as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable
to the Borough under the provisions of this part. Any subsequent changes in
the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported to and
be accepted by the Borough prior to the user's initiation of the changes.
§ 290-14. Additional pretreatment measures.
A. Whenever deemed necessary, the Borough may require users to restrict
their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain
wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or
consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage waste streams from
industrial waste streams, and such other conditions as may be
necessary to protect the POTW and to determine the user's compliance
with the requirements of this part.
B. The Borough may require any person discharging into the POTW to
install and maintain, on their property and at their expense, a suitable
storage and flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow. A
wastewater discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization.
C. Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the
opinion of the Borough, they are necessary for the proper handling of
liquid wastes containing grease, oil or sand in such amounts as to cause
obstruction to the flow in a sewer or other interference with the
operation of the wastewater treatment facilities; except such
interceptors may not be required for residential users. All interceptors
shall be of a type and capacity approved by the Borough and shall be
located to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection.
In the maintaining of these interceptors, the owner(s) shall be
responsible for the proper removal and disposal by appropriate means
of the captured material and shall maintain records of the dates and
means of disposal which are subject to review by the Pretreatment
Officer. Any removal and hauling of the collected materials not
performed by owner's (owners') personnel must be performed by
§ 290-13 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 290-14
1:329
§ 290-15. Accidental discharge/slug discharge control plans.
All industrial users will be evaluated by the Pretreatment Officer to
determine whether they will be required to develop a spill and slug loading
control plan or other action to control slug discharges. All industrial users
are required to notify the POTW immediately of any changes at its facility
affecting potential for a slug discharge. In addition, any user may be
required to develop a plan. A plan must address the facilities to be provided
and maintained at the user's expense to prevent spills or slug discharges of
prohibited materials. Detailed plans showing these facilities and operating
procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the
Pretreatment Officer for review and approval by the Borough before

part, and include the certification statement in § 290-44 of this part
for each waiver request and each self-monitoring report.
(5) Nondetectable sample results may be used only as a demonstration
that a pollutant is not present if the EPA approved method from 40
CFR § 136 with the lowest minimum detection level for that
pollutant is used in the analysis.
(6) Any grant of the monitoring waiver by the Borough must be
included as a condition in the user's wastewater discharge permit.
The reasons supporting the waiver and any information submitted
by the user in its request for the waiver must be maintained by the
Borough for three years after expiration of the waiver.
(7) In the event that a waived pollutant is found to be present or is
expected to be present because of changes that occur with the
user's operations, the user must immediately comply with the
monitoring requirements of § 290-34A of this part, or more
frequent monitoring requirements imposed by the Borough.
(8) This provision does not supersede certification processes and
requirements established in categorical pretreatment standards,
except as otherwise specified in the categorical pretreatment
standard.
C. All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in
accordance with § 290-44A of this part.
D. All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's discharge.

§ 290-35. Reports of changed conditions.
Each user, whether permitted or not, must notify the Pretreatment Officer
of any planned significant changes to the user's operations or system which
might alter the nature, quality, or volume of its wastewater at least 30 days
before the change occurs.
§ 290-36. Reports of potential problems.
properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order
at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good
working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample
results are unrepresentative of its discharge.
E. If the user monitors any regulated pollutant at the appropriate
sampling location more frequently than required by the Borough, using
the procedures prescribed in § 290-41 of this part, the results of this
monitoring shall be included in the report. At the discretion of the
Pretreatment Officer and in consideration of such factors as local high
and low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, etc., the Pretreatment
Officer may agree to alter the months during which the above reports
are to submitted. This report shall be signed and certified in accordance
with § 290-44A of this part.
A. The Borough may require the user to submit such information as may
be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including a
BMR and/or the submission of a wastewater discharge permit
application under § 290-21 of this part.
B. The Pretreatment Officer may issue a wastewater discharge permit
under § 290-30 of this part or modify an existing wastewater discharge
permit under § 290-27 of this part in response to changed conditions or
anticipated changed conditions.
A. In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental
discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a
noncustomary batch discharge, a slug discharge or slug load, that
might cause potential problems for the POTW, the user shall
immediately telephone and notify the Pretreatment Officer of the
incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge,
type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective
actions taken by the user.
B. Within five days following such discharge, the user shall, unless waived
by the Borough, submit a detailed written report describing the
cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to
mitigate and prevent any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which
may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW or aquatic life or
any other damages to person or property. Such notification shall not
relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may

§ 290-37. Reports from unpermitted users.
All users not required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall provide
appropriate reports to the Borough as the Borough may require.
§ 290-38. Notice of violation/repeat sampling and reporting.
If sampling by the user indicates a violation, the user shall notify the
Pretreatment Officer within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation.
The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results
of the repeat analysis to the Pretreatment Officer within 30 days after
becoming aware of the violation. The user is not required to resample if the
Borough performs sampling at least once per month for the parameter in
violation at the user's facility, or if the Borough performs sampling at the
user's facility between the time when the user performs its initial sampling
and the time the user or the Borough receives the results of this sampling.
§ 290-39. Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste.
be imposed by this article or other applicable law. This written report
shall be signed by an authorized representative of the user.
C. A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or
other prominent place advising employees who to call in the event of a
discharge described in Subsection A, above. Employers shall ensure
that all employees, who could cause such a discharge to occur, are
advised of the emergency notification procedure.
D. Industrial users are required to notify the Borough immediately of any
changes at its facility affecting the potential for a slug discharge.
A. Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify
the Pretreatment Officer, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division
Director, and PADEP Waste Management authorities in writing of any
discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of,
would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261.
(1) Such notification must include:
(a) The name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part
261;
(b) The EPA hazardous waste number; and
(c) The type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other).
(2) If the user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per
calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the
following information to the extent such information is known and
readily available to the user:
(a) An identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the
wastes;
§ 290-36 HANOVER CODE § 290-39
1:348
§ 290-40. Analytical requirements.
All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as
part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be
performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part
136 and amendments thereto, unless otherwise specified in an applicable
categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain
(b) An estimation of the mass and concentration of such
constituents in the waste stream discharged during that
calendar month; and
(c) An estimation of the mass of constituents in the waste stream
expected to be discharged during the following 12 months.
(3) All notifications shall take place no later than 180 days after the
discharge commences. Any notification under this paragraph need
be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged.
However, notifications of changed discharges shall be submitted
per § 290-35 of this part. This notification requirement does not
apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical
standards under the monitoring requirements of §§ 290-31, 290-33
and 290-34 of this part.
B. Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of Subsection A, above,
during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15
kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous
wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of
more than 15 kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar
month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40
CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification.
Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such
quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification.
C. In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA
identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any
additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user shall notify the
Pretreatment Officer, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste
Division Director, and PADEP Waste Management authorities of the
discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such
regulations.
D. In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall
certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity
of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be
economically practical.
E. This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not
otherwise permitted to be discharged by this part, a wastewater
discharge permit issued hereunder, or any applicable federal or state
law.

1:349
sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where
the EPA determines that the Part 136 sampling and analytical techniques
are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall
be performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable
sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the
Borough or other parties approved by EPA.
§ 290-41. Sample collection.
Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based on
data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during
the period covered by the report, based on data that is representative of
conditions occurring during the reporting period.
A. Except as indicated in Subsections B and C below, the user must collect
wastewater samples using twenty-four-hour flow-proportional
composite sampling techniques. The Pretreatment Officer may
authorize the use of time proportional sampling, or grab samples where
the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of
the effluent being discharged. The decision to allow the alternative
sampling must be documented in the user's wastewater discharge
permit and/or in the user's file for the facility or facilities. Using
protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part
136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected
during a twenty-four-hour period may be composited prior to the
analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples
may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics
and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory.
Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing
procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be
authorized by the Borough, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples
may be required to show compliance with instantaneous limits.
B. Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols,
sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab
collection techniques.
C. For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and ninety-day
compliance reports required in §§ 290-31 and 290-33 [40 CFR 403.12(b)
and (d)], a minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide,
total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for
facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist. For facilities
for which historical sampling data are available, the Borough may
authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by § 290-34 [40
CFR 403.12(e) and 403.12(h)], the Borough shall require the number of
grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance by industrial
users with applicable pretreatment standards and Requirements.
§ 290-40 HANOVER CODE § 290-42
1:350
§ 290-42. Date of receipt of reports.
Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date
postmarked. For reports, which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail
facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of
the report shall govern.
§ 290-43. Recordkeeping.
Users subject to the reporting requirements of this part shall retain, and
make available for inspection and copying, all records of information
obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this part, any
additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities
undertaken by the user independent of such requirements, and
documentation associated with best management practices established.
Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling,
and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses
were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or
methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain
available for a period of at least three years or longer as specified by the
Borough, and affording the Borough access thereto. This period shall be
automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the
user or the Borough.
§ 290-44. Certification statements.
A. Certification of permit applications, user reports and initial monitoring
waiver. The following certification statement is required to be signed
and submitted by users submitting permit applications in accordance
with § 290-23; users submitting baseline monitoring reports under
§ 290-31B(8); users submitting reports on compliance with the
categorical pretreatment standard deadlines under § 290-33; users
submitting periodic compliance reports required by § 290-34A through
E, and users submitting an initial request to forego sampling of a
pollutant on the basis of § 290-34B(4). The following certification
statement must be signed by an authorized representative as defined in
§ 290-4:
I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments
were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with
a system designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather
and evaluate the information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the
person or persons who manage the system, or those persons directly
responsible for gathering the information, the information submitted
is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true, accurate, and
complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for
submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and
imprisonment for knowing violations.
B. Annual certification for nonsignificant categorical industrial users. A
facility determined to be a nonsignificant categorical industrial user
§ 290-42 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 290-44
1:351
pursuant to 40 CFR 403.3(v)(2) must annually submit the following
certification statement signed in accordance with the signatory
requirements in 40 CFR 403.12(1). This certification must accompany
an alternative report required by the Borough:
Based on my inquiry of the person or persons directly responsible
for managing compliance with the categorical pretreatment standards
under 40 CFR _____, I certify that, to the best of my knowledge and
belief that during the period from _____, _____ to _____, _____ [months,
days, year]:
(a) The facility described as __________ [facility name] met the
definition of a nonsignificant categorical industrial user as
described in 403.3(v)(2);
(b) The facility complied with all applicable pretreatment standards
and requirements during this reporting period; and
(c) The facility never discharged more than 100 gallons of total
categorical wastewater on any given day during this reporting
period.
This compliance certification is based on the following information.
C. Certification of pollutants not present. Users that have an approved
monitoring waiver based on § 290-34B must certify on each report with
the following statement that there has been no increase in the pollutant
in its waste stream due to activities of the user.
Based on my inquiry of the person or persons directly responsible
for managing compliance with the pretreatment standard for 40 CFR
_____, I certify that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, there
has been no increase in the level of _____ [list pollutant(s)] in the
wastewaters due to the activities at the facility since filing of the last
periodic report under § 290-34A.

Compliance Monitoring
§ 290-45. Right of entry: inspection and sampling.
The Borough shall have the right to enter the premises of any user to
determine compliance with this part, the discharge permit, compliance
orders and pretreatment standards and requirements. Persons or occupants
of premises where wastewater is generated or discharged shall allow the
Borough or its representative ready access at all reasonable times to all
parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection sampling, records
examination and copying, and the performance of any of their duties.
A. Where a user has security measures in force which require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user
shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that,
upon presentation of suitable identification, the Borough shall be
permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing specific
responsibilities.
B. The Borough, state, and EPA shall have the right to set up on the user's
property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to
conduct sampling, compliance monitoring, and/or metering of the
user's operations.
C. The Borough may require the user to install monitoring equipment as
necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be
maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the
user at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow
and quality shall be calibrated as designated by the Borough to ensure
their accuracy.
D. Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the
facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by
the user at the written or verbal request of the Borough and shall not be
replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be born by the user.
E. Unreasonable delays in allowing the Borough access to the user's
premises shall be a violation of this part.
F. If the Borough has been refused access to a building, structure, or
property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause
to believe that there may be a violation of this part at the facility, or that
there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection
and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this part or
any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public
health, safety and welfare of the community, the Borough may seek
issuance of a temporary restraining order or a preliminary injunction
granting relief for entry.

Confidential Information
§ 290-46. Requests for confidentiality.
Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater
discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge permits, and
monitoring programs, and from the Borough's inspection and sampling
activities, shall be available to the public without restriction, unless the user
specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the
Borough, that the release of such information would divulge information,
processes, or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets
under applicable state law. Any such request must be asserted at the time of
submission of the information or data. When requested and demonstrated
by the user furnishing a report that such information should be held
confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or
secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public,
but shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental
agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment program,
and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report.
Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other effluent data, as
defined at 40 CFR 2.302 shall not be recognized as confidential information
and shall be available to the public without restriction.

ARTICLE IX
Publication of Users in Significant Noncompliance
§ 290-47. Publication of noncompliance list.
A. The Borough shall publish at least annually, in a newspaper of general
circulation that provides meaningful public notice within the
jurisdictions served by the POTW, a list of the users which, at any time
during the previous 12 months, were in significant noncompliance with
applicable pretreatment standards and/or requirements. The
notification also shall summarize any enforcement actions taken by the
Borough against the users during the same 12 months. For the
purposes of this provision, a significant industrial user is in SNC (or any
other industrial user that violates Subsection A(3), (4) or (8) of this
section) if its violation meets one or more of the following criteria:
(1) Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as
those in which 66% or more of all the measurements taken for the
same pollutant parameter taken during a six-month period exceed
(by any magnitude) a numeric pretreatment standard or
requirement, including instantaneous limits as defined by 40 CFR
403.3(1) and Article II of this part;
(2) Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in
which 33% or more of wastewater measurements taken for each
pollutant parameter during a six-month period equals or exceeds
the product of the numeric pretreatment standard or requirement,
including instantaneous limits, as defined by 40 CFR 403.3(1) and
Article II of this part, multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4 for
BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants
except pH);
(3) Any other violation of a pretreatment standard or requirement as
defined by 40 CFR 403.3(1) and Article II of this part (daily
maximum, long-term average, instantaneous limit, or narrative
standard) that the Borough determines has caused, alone or in
combination with other discharges, interference or pass through,
including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the
general public;
(4) Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent
endangerment to the public or to the environment, or has resulted
in the Borough's exercise of its emergency authority under 40 CFR
§ 403.8(f)(1)(vi)(B) to halt or prevent such a discharge;
(5) Failure to meet, within 90 days of the scheduled date, a compliance
schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or
enforcement order for starting construction, completing
construction, or attaining final compliance;
§ 290-47 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 290-47
1:357
(6) Failure to provide, within 45 days after the due date, any required
reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on
compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines,
periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with
compliance schedules;
(7) Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or
(8) Any other violation(s), which may include a violation of best
management practices, which the Borough determines will
adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local
pretreatment program.
B. For the first two criteria [Subsection A(1) and (2)], SNC must be
evaluated through the "rolling quarters" method using the six-month
periods of October through March, January through June, April through
September, and July through December.

Administrative Enforcement Remedies
§ 290-48. Notification of violation.
When the Pretreatment Officer finds that a user has violated, or continues
to violate, any provision of this part, a wastewater discharge permit, or
any order, prohibition, limitation or requirement contained herein, the
Pretreatment Officer may serve upon such person a written notice stating
the nature of the violation. Within 30 days of the receipt of this notice, an
explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and
prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted
to the Pretreatment Officer by the user. Submission of such a plan in no
way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after
receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the
authority of the Borough to take any action, including emergency actions or
any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation.
§ 290-49. Consent orders.
The Borough is hereby empowered to enter into consent orders, assurances
of compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with
the user responsible for the noncompliance. Such orders will include
specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a
time period also specified by the order. Consent orders shall have the same
force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to §§ 290-51
and 290-52 of this part and shall be judicially enforceable.
§ 290-50. Show cause hearing.
Notwithstanding the aforesaid enforcement provisions, the Pretreatment
Officer may order any user who causes or allows an unauthorized discharge
to enter the POTW to show cause before the Borough why the proposed
enforcement action should not be taken. A notice shall be served on the
user specifying the time and place of a hearing to be held by the Borough
regarding the violation, the reasons why the action is to be taken, the
proposed enforcement action, and directing the user to show cause before
the Borough why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken.
The notice of the hearing shall be served personally or by registered or
certified mail (return receipt requested) at least 10 days before the hearing.
Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user as
defined in § 290-4 and required by § 290-23A. A show cause hearing shall
not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the
user.
§ 290-51. Compliance orders.
When the Pretreatment Officer finds that a user has violated, or continues
to violate this part, the wastewater discharge permit, or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
§ 290-48 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 290-51
1:359
Pretreatment Officer may issue a compliance order to the user responsible
for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a
specified time period. If the user does not come into compliance within
the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate
treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed
and properly operated. Compliance orders may also contain other
requirements as might be reasonably necessary and appropriate to address
the noncompliance, including the installation of pretreatment technology,
additional self-monitoring and management practices. A compliance order
may not extend the deadline for compliance established for National
Categorical Pretreatment Standards or requirements, nor does a
compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including
any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar
against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
§ 290-52. Cease and desist orders.
When the Borough finds that a user has violated or continues to violate this
part, the wastewater discharge permit, or any other order issued hereunder,
the Pretreatment Officer may issue an order to cease and desist all such
violations and direct the user in noncompliance to:
§ 290-53. Administrative fines.
A. Immediately comply with all requirements; and
B. Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed
to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including
halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. Issuance of a
cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for,
taking any other action against the user.
A. When the Borough finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate,
any pretreatment standard or requirement, any provision of this part,
and the orders, rules, regulations, and permits issued hereunder, may
be fined by the Pretreatment Officer an amount not to exceed $25,000
for each violation. The minimum fine to be issued shall be $1,000. The
fine or penalty fee must be received by the Borough within 30 days of
notification. Each day on which a violation shall occur or continue shall
be deemed a separate and distinct offense. In the case of monthly or
other long-term average discharge limit violation, fines shall be
assessed for each day during the period of violation.
B. Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after 30 calendar days, be
assessed an additional penalty of 15% of the unpaid balance. The
Borough may also file suit against the user for the amount of the fee if
deemed necessary. Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall constitute
a lien against an individual user's property.
C. Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request, along
with full payment of the fine amount, for the Borough to reconsider the

§ 290-55. Termination of discharge.
fine, within 10 days of being notified of the fine or penalty. Failure to
appeal within this period shall result in a waiver of all legal rights to
contest the violation or the amount of the penalty. Where the Borough
believes a request has merit, the Borough may convene a hearing on
the matter. In the event the user's appeal is successful, the fine or
penalty may be returned to the user. The Borough may add the costs
of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and
orders, to the fine.
D. Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
A. The Borough may immediately suspend wastewater treatment service
and/or the wastewater discharge permit when such suspension is
necessary, in the opinion of the Pretreatment Officer, in order to stop
any discharge which presents, or may present, an imminent or
substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons or to the
environment, threatens interference with the operation of the POTW, or
threatens to cause the Borough to violate any condition of its NPDES
permit.
(1) Any user notified of a suspension of wastewater treatment service
and/or the wastewater discharge permit shall immediately stop or
eliminate the discharge to the POTW. In the event of a failure by the
user to comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the
Pretreatment Officer may take steps as deemed necessary,
including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent
or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or
endangerment to any individuals. The Pretreatment Officer may
reinstate the wastewater discharge permit upon proof of the
elimination of the noncomplying discharge by the user, and
payment of any damages, fines, penalties or cost associated with
the discharge.
(2) A user which is responsible, in whole or in part, for imminent
endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement,
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures
taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the Borough within 15
days of the date of occurrence.
B. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior
to any emergency suspension under this section.
A. Any user who violates the following conditions of this part, or applicable
state and federal regulations, is subject to having their wastewater
discharge permit revoked for:
§ 290-53 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 290-55
1:361
(1) Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions;
(2) Failure of the user to factually report the wastewater constituents

order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, the Borough may petition the Court of Common Pleas of
York County through the Solicitor for the issuance of a temporary or
permanent injunction or both (as may be appropriate) which restrains
or compels the activities on the part of the user. The Borough shall have
such remedies to collect these fees as it has to collect other sewer
service charges. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar
against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.
B. If any user or other person discharges wastewater, industrial wastes, or

pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to the Borough for
a civil penalty of not more than $25,000 (but not less than $1,000) plus
actual damages incurred by the Borough per violation per day as the
violation continues. In the case of a monthly or other long-term average
discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of
the violation.
B. The Borough may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, and
other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including
sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages
incurred by the Borough.
C. In determining the amount of civil liability, the Court shall take into
account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the
extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of
the violation, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation,
corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and

noncompliance. The guidelines and details of the ERP may be amended
from time to time by action of Borough Council. None of the following
enforcement remedies are exclusive. The Borough may impose any, all
or any combination of these enforcement responses if the violation or
circumstance warrants. The Borough may impose penalties for violations
under this part before the expiration of compliance deadlines. Issuance of
any administrative response, judicial remedy or other enforcement remedy,
or filing a suit for civil penalties shall not bar against, or be a prerequisite
for, taking any other enforcement action against the user.

ARTICLE XII
Supplemental Enforcement Action
§ 290-60. Performance bonds and liability insurance.
The Borough may decline to reissue a permit to any industrial user which

ARTICLE XIII
Affirmative Defenses to Discharge Violations
§ 290-63. Upset.
A. For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional incident
in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with
categorical standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control
of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent
caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities,
inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or
careless or improper operation.
B. An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for
noncompliance with Categorical Standards if the requirements of
Subsection C, below, are met.
C. A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall
demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating
logs, or other relevant evidence that:
(1) An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
(2) The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
professional manner and in compliance with applicable operation
and maintenance procedures; and
(3) The user has submitted the following information to the
Pretreatment Officer within 24 hours of becoming aware of the
upset (if this information is provided orally, a written submission
must be provided within five days):
(a) Description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
(b) The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times
or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is
expected to continue; and
(c) Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
D. In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
E. A user will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any
claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance
with categorical standards.
F. The user shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with categorical standards upon
reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
§ 290-63 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 290-63
1:367
§ 290-64. Bypass.
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This
requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the
primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or
fails.
A. For the purposes of this section:
(1) "Bypass" means the intentional diversion of waste streams from
any portion of a user's treatment facility.
(2) "Severe property damage" means substantial physical damage to
property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to
become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural
resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the
absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean
economic loss caused by delays in production.
B. A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause
pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it
also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These
bypasses are not subject to the provision of Subsections C and D of this
section.
C. Bypass notifications.
(1) If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit
prior notice to the Pretreatment Officer, at least 10 days before the
date of the bypass, if possible.
(2) A user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated bypass that
exceeds applicable pretreatment standards to the Pretreatment
Officer within 24 hours from the time the industrial user becomes
aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided
within five days of the time the industrial user becomes aware of
the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of
the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including
exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected,
the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or
planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the
bypass. The Borough may waive the written report on a case-bycase
basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours.
D. Bypass.
(1) Bypass is prohibited, and the Borough may take an enforcement
action against a user for a bypass, unless all of the following
conditions are met:
(a) The bypass is unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal
injury, or severe property damage;
§ 290-63 HANOVER CODE § 290-64
1:368
(b) There is no feasible alternative to the bypass, including the use
of auxiliary treatment, retention of the wastewater, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime.
This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment
should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable
engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive
maintenance; and
(c) The user properly notifies the Pretreatment Officer as
described in this section.
(2) The Borough may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering
its adverse effects, if the Borough determines that it will meet the
three conditions listed in Subsection D(1) of this section.

prevent such conditions. The methods, nature and extent of such work
shall be in keeping with directives issued by the Shade Tree
Commission governing such work and shall be intended to preserve the
health, natural beauty and symmetry of trees so involved. Due regard

replacement of shade trees, where appropriate; and whenever such person
shall have been notified by the Shade Tree Commission or service of
summons in prosecution, or in any other way, that he is committing such
violation, each day in which he shall continue in such violation after any
such notification shall constitute a separate offense, punishable by like fine
or penalty. Such fines or penalty shall be collected as prescribed by law.

The foregoing regulations of the Shade Tree Commission of Hanover
Borough shall become effective 10 days after publication hereof as

General Provisions
§ 310-1. Short title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Hanover Borough
Stormwater Management Ordinance."
§ 310-2. Statement of findings.
The governing body of the Borough of Hanover, York County, Pennsylvania
(hereinafter referred to as "Borough"), finds that:
§ 310-3. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to promote health, safety, and welfare within
the Borough and its watersheds by minimizing the harm and maximizing the
benefits described in § 310-2 of this chapter, through provisions designed
to:
A. Inadequate management of accelerated runoff of stormwater resulting
from development throughout a watershed increases flows and
velocities, contributes to erosion and sedimentation, overtaxes the
carrying capacity of streams and storm sewers, greatly increases the
cost of public facilities to carry and control stormwater, undermines
floodplain management and flood-control efforts in downstream
communities, reduces groundwater recharge, threatens public health
and safety, and increases non-point source pollution of water resources.
B. A comprehensive program of stormwater management, including
reasonable regulation of development and activities causing
accelerated runoff, is fundamental to the public health, safety, and
welfare and the protection of people of the commonwealth, their
resources, and the environment.
C. Stormwater is an important water resource, which provides
groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams,
which also protects and maintains surface water quality.
D. Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to
implement a program of stormwater controls. These municipalities are
required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their
separate storm sewer systems under the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES).
A. Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including
regulations at 25 Pa. Code 93 to protect, maintain, reclaim, and restore
the existing and designated uses of the waters of this commonwealth.
B. Preserve the natural drainage systems as much as possible.
C. Manage stormwater runoff close to the source.
§ 310-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 310-3
1:435

No. 2212, known as the Hanover Borough Stormwater Management
Ordinance, of December 23, 2014. Furthermore, any other ordinance
provision or regulation of the Borough inconsistent with any of the
provisions of this chapter is hereby repealed to give this chapter full force
and effect to the extent of the inconsistency only.
§ 310-7. Severability.
In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction declares any section,
clause or provision of this chapter invalid, such decision shall not affect
the validity of any of the remaining sections, clauses or provisions of this
chapter.
D. Provide procedures and performance standards for stormwater
planning and management.
E. Maintain groundwater recharge to prevent degradation of surface
water and groundwater quality and to otherwise protect water
resources.
F. Prevent scour and erosion of stream banks and streambeds.
G. Provide proper operation and maintenance of all SWM BMPs that are
implemented within the Borough.
H. Provide standards to meet NPDES permit requirements.

§ 310-14 or exempted by an approved modification request as specified
in § 310-21B of this chapter.
F. Impervious areas: [Amended 8-22-2018 by Ord. No. 2273]
(1) For the purposes of this chapter, the term "new impervious area"
shall refer to any amount of impervious area that is in excess of the
pre-development impervious coverage.
(2) The term "altered impervious area" shall refer to any predevelopment
impervious areas that are demolished or significantly
altered through the course of development and are replaced or
rebuilt and remain impervious areas post-development.
§ 310-13 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 310-13
1:447
(3) The measurement of impervious areas shall include all of the
impervious areas in the total proposed development even if
development is to take place in phases.
(4) For development taking place in phases, the entire development
plan must be used in determining conformance with this chapter.
(5) For projects that add impervious area to a parcel or alter any
existing impervious area, the total impervious area on the parcel is
subject to the requirements of this chapter; except that the volume
controls in § 310-15 and the peak rate controls of § 310-16 do not
need to be retrofitted to impervious areas existing before
December 23, 2014 that are not being altered by the proposed
regulated activity.
G. Stormwater flows onto adjacent property shall not be created,
increased, decreased, relocated, or otherwise altered without written
notification of the adjacent property owner(s). Such stormwater flows
shall be subject to the requirements of this chapter.
H. All regulated activities shall include such measures as necessary to:
(1) Protect health, safety, and property.
(2) Meet the water quality goals of this chapter, as stated in § 310-3,
Purpose, by implementing measures to:
(a) Minimize disturbance to floodplains, wetlands, wooded areas,
and existing vegetation.
(b) Maintain or extend riparian buffers.
(c) Avoid erosive flow conditions in natural flow pathways.
(d) Minimize thermal impacts to waters of this commonwealth.
(e) Disconnect impervious surfaces by directing runoff to pervious
areas, wherever possible.
(f) Minimize soil disturbance and compaction. Topsoil, if removed,
shall be replaced to a minimum depth equal to its depth prior

topsoil may be needed for vegetation other than sod.)
(3) To the maximum extent practicable, incorporate the techniques for
low-impact development practices described in the Pennsylvania
Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual (BMP Manual).
I. The design of all facilities in areas of carbonate geology or karst
topography shall include an evaluation of measures to minimize
adverse effects, including hydrogeologic studies if required by the
Borough.
§ 310-13 HANOVER CODE § 310-13
1:448
J. Infiltration BMPs shall be spread out, made as shallow as practicable,
and located to maximize use of natural on-site infiltration features while
still meeting the other requirements of this chapter. In addition,
infiltration BMPs shall include pretreatment BMPs where appropriate.
The BMPs intended to receive runoff shall provide field test to
determine appropriate percolation rate and/or hydraulic conductivity
along with a probe hole excavation to provide a minimum depth of 12
inches between the bottom of the facility and the seasonal high water
table or bedrock limiting zone.
K. All natural streams, channels, swales, drainage systems, and/or areas of
surface water concentration shall be maintained in their existing
condition unless the Borough approves alteration. All encroachment
activities shall comply with the requirements of the PADEP 25 Code
Chapter 105 (Water Obstructions and Encroachments), Rules and
Regulations of PADEP.92 Any approvals or permits issued do not relieve
compliance as referenced in § 310-8, Compatibility with other
requirements.
L. Normally dry, open-top storage facilities, designed as such, shall
completely drain both the volume control and rate control capacities
over a period of time not less than 24 hours and not more than 96 hours
from the end of the design storm unless approved by the Borough
Engineer. However, any designed infiltration at such facilities is exempt
from the minimum twenty-four-hour standard, that is, may infiltrate in a
shorter period of time, so long as none of the stormwater flowing into
the infiltration facility is discharged directly into the surface waters of
the commonwealth. (Inordinately rapid infiltration rates may indicate
the presence of large fractures or other conditions for which an
additional soil buffer may be required.)
M. The design storm volumes and precipitation intensities to be used in the
analysis of discharge or runoff shall be obtained from the Precipitation-
Frequency Atlas of the United States, Atlas 14, Volume 2, Version 3.0,

§ 310-14. Exemptions.
Any regulated activity that meets the following exemption criteria is exempt
from the part(s) of this chapter as specified herein. However, the
requirements of the Ordinance shall otherwise remain in effect. The criteria
for exemption in this section apply to the total development proposed,
including instances in which the development is proposed to take place in
phases. The date of enactment of this chapter shall be the starting point
from which future development and the respective proposed impervious
surface computations shall be cumulatively considered and regulated.
Exemption shall not relieve an applicant from implementing such measures
as necessary to meet the intent of this chapter or compliance with any
NPDES permit requirements.
P. All work shall be in accordance with the Borough's Standard
Construction Details and PennDOT Publications 408 and 72M.
A. Regulated activities that create equal to or less than 500 square feet of
new or altered impervious area are exempt from the volume and peak
rate controls and the SWM site plan preparation requirements of this
chapter. The developer/owner will still be required to provide a basic
property sketch and complete a stormwater management permit
application. [Amended 8-22-2018 by Ord. No. 2273]
B. Regulated activities that create DIAs greater than 500 square feet and
equal to or less than 5,000 square feet are exempt only from the peak
rate control requirement of this chapter. [Amended 8-22-2018 by
Ord. No. 2273]
C. Regulated activities that create DIAs greater than 1,000 square feet
and equal to or less than 5,000 square feet are exempt only from the
peak rate control requirement of this chapter.
D. Agricultural activity is exempt from the rate control and SWM site plan
preparation requirements of this chapter, provided that the activities
are performed according to the requirements of 25 Pa. Code Chapter
102.
E. Forest management and timber operations are exempt from the rate
control and SWM site plan preparation requirements of this chapter,
provided that the activities are performed according to the
requirements of 25 Pa. Code 102.
F. Domestic gardening and landscaping with trees, shrubs, and flowers
are exempt from specific approval and permitting under this chapter so
long as those activities are associated with one, and only one, dwelling
unit and the activities comply with all other applicable ordinances and
statutes.
G. Exemptions from certain provisions of this chapter shall not relieve the
applicant from the requirements in § 310-13D through L of this chapter.
§ 310-13 HANOVER CODE § 310-14
1:450
§ 310-15. Volume controls.
The low-impact development practices provided in the BMP Manual shall be
utilized for all regulated activities to the maximum extent practicable. Water
volume controls shall be implemented using the Design Storm Method in
Subsection A or the Simplified Method in Subsection B below. For regulated
activity areas equal to or less than one acre that do not require hydrologic
routing to design the stormwater facilities, this chapter establishes no
preference for either methodology; therefore, the applicant may select
either methodology on the basis of economic considerations, the intrinsic
limitations on applicability of the analytical procedures associated with
each methodology, and other factors.
H. The Borough may deny or revoke any exemption pursuant to this
section at any time for any project that the Borough determines poses a
threat to public health, safety, property or the environment.
I. For all regulated activities that are exempt from the SWM site plan
preparation, the applicant shall submit a site plan in sufficient detail to
show the existing conditions and proposed improvements as well as
design calculations.
A. The Design Storm Method (CG-1 in the BMP Manual) is applicable to
any size of regulated activity. This method requires detailed modeling
based on site conditions. [Amended 8-22-2018 by Ord. No. 2273]
(1) Do not increase the post-development total runoff volume for all
storms equal to or less than the two-year, twenty-four-hour
duration precipitation or 2.86 inches in 24 hours, whichever is
greater.
(2) For modeling purposes:
(a) Existing (pre-development) nonforested pervious areas must
be considered meadow.
(b) Twenty percent of the existing impervious area of a project
site, when present, shall be considered meadow in the model
for existing conditions.
B. The Simplified Method (CG-2 in the BMP Manual) provided below is
independent of site conditions and should be used if the Design Storm
Method is not followed. This method is not applicable to regulated
activities greater than one acre or for projects that require design of
stormwater storage facilities. For new or altered impervious surfaces:
[Amended 8-22-2018 by Ord. No. 2273]
(1) Stormwater facilities shall capture at least the first two inches of
runoff from all new or altered impervious surfaces.
(2) At least the first one inch of runoff from new or altered impervious
surfaces shall be permanently removed from the runoff flow, i.e., it
§ 310-14 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 310-15
1:451
shall not be released into the surface waters of this commonwealth.
Removal options for the first one inch of runoff include reuse,
evaporation, transpiration, and infiltration.
(3) Wherever possible, infiltration facilities should be designed to
accommodate infiltration of the entire permanently removed
runoff; however, in all cases at least the first 0.5 inch of the
permanently removed stormwater runoff shall be infiltrated.
(4) This method is exempt from the requirements of § 310-16, Rate
controls.
C. Infiltration alternative. Where infiltration is not possible due to soil
characteristics or is not desirable given other characteristics, water
quality control may be proposed as an alternative to strict adherence to
the volume control standards of § 310-15 of this chapter. Where water
quality control is proposed, the following standards shall be achieved:
(1) At a minimum, the following documentation shall be provided to
justify the proposal to reduce the infiltration requirements:
(a) Description of and justification for field infiltration/
permeability testing with respect to the type of test and test
locations.
(b) An interpretive narrative describing existing soils of the site
and their structure as these relate to the interaction between
soils and water characteristics of the site. In addition to
providing soil and soil profile descriptions, this narrative shall
identify depth to seasonal water tables and depth to bedrock
and provide a description of all subsurface elements
(restrictive layers, geology, etc.) that influence the direction
and rate of subsurface water movement.
(c) A qualitative assessment of the site's contribution to annual
aquifer recharge shall be made, along with the identification of
any restrictions or limitations associated with the use of
designed infiltration facilities.
(d) The provided documentation must be signed and sealed by a
qualified professional.
(2) Water quality BMPs shall be implemented on all permanent
stormwater discharges from the proposed project site to achieve
pollutant removal efficiencies in accordance with the following
table. (Efficiency removal rating shall be based on a testing
specification for particle size distribution as required per TARP Tier
1 and 2 protocol testing [should define where this can be obtained].
The minimum design flow shall be based on the peak flow produced
from one inch of rain as calculated.)

(3) Design guidance from the most current version of the BMP Manual,
or equivalent resource as precoordinated with Hanover Borough,
shall be consulted when choosing design criteria for water quality
BMPs.
A. For computation of pre-development peak discharge rates, 20% of the
existing impervious area of a project site, when present, shall be
considered meadow.
B. Post-development discharge rates shall not exceed the pre-development
discharge rates for the one-, two-, five-, ten-, twenty-five-, fifty-, and
one-hundred-year, twenty-four-hour storms. If it is shown that the peak
rates of discharge indicated by the post-development analysis are less
than or equal to the peak rates of discharge indicated by the predevelopment
analysis for one-, two-, five-, ten-, twenty-five-, fifty-, and
one-hundred-year, twenty-four-hour storms, then the requirements of
this section have been met. Otherwise, the applicant shall provide
additional controls as necessary to satisfy the peak rate of discharge
requirement.
A. For the purposes of the Act 167 stormwater management (plan)
elements, contained within the York County Integrated Water
Resources Plan, and this chapter, design policy pertaining to
stormwater management facilities for Pennsylvania Department of
Transportation (PennDOT) and Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission
(PTC) roadways and associated facilities is provided in Section 13.7
(Antidegradation and Post Construction Stormwater Management
Policy) of PennDOT Publication No. 13M, Design Manual Part 2 (August
2009), as developed, updated, and amended in consultation with the
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources (DEP). As stated
in DM-2.13.7.D (Act 167 and Municipal Ordinances), PennDOT and PTC
roadways and associated facilities shall be consistent with Act 167
plans. Dm-2.13.7.B (Policy on Antidegradation and Post Construction
§ 310-15 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 310-17

Stormwater Management) was developed as a cooperative effort
between PennDOT and DEP. DM-2.13.7.C (Project Categories)
discusses the anticipated impact on the quality, volume, and rate of
stormwater runoff.
B. Where standards in the Act 167 elements of the IWRP and this chapter
are impractical, PennDOT or the PTC may request assistance from DEP,
in consultation with the county, to develop an alternative strategy for
meeting state water quality requirements and the goals and objectives
of the Act 167 elements within the IWRP.
C. For the purposes of the Act 167 elements in the IWRP and this chapter,
road maintenance activities are regulated under 25 Pa. Code Chapter
102.
A. General SWM site plan requirements and standards.
(1) SWM site plan requirements shall comply with the guidance,
procedures and policies provided in the latest version of the BMP
Manual and PennDOT Publication No. 13M, Part 2, Chapter 10.

1:454
keeping the gate or door securely closed at all times when not
in actual use.
C. Stormwater collection and conveyance facilities and/or systems.
(1) All stormwater pipes, other than those for existing channels, which
discharge from residential lots to a street or from a street to
residential lots, shall extend from the street right-of-way a
minimum distance of 67% of the length of the longest adjacent lot
dimension.
(2) SWM collection and conveyance facilities not located within a
public right-of-way shall be centered in an easement. Said
easement shall be a minimum of 20 feet wide for subsurface
facilities or shall be of sufficient size to encompass the entire
facility and provide for 10 feet of easement on either side for open

§ 310-22. Revision of plans.
A revision to a previously submitted SWM site plan that involves a change
in SWM BMPs, stormwater management facilities, or changes in analytical
techniques, or that involves the relocation or redesign of SWM BMPs, or
that is necessary because soil or other conditions are not as stated on the
SWM site plan, as determined by the Borough, shall require a resubmission
of the revised SWM site plan in accordance with this article, including
applicable fees. For NPDES permitted sites, any revised SWM site plan shall
also be resubmitted to the York County Conservation District for review. In
the case of a SWM site plan which contains minor deficiencies, such as a
missing label, omission of a required note or minor construction detail, as
determined by the Borough, the Borough may accept a resubmission of such
SWM site plan without the requirement of a review fee or for a lesser fee as
provided for in the Borough's fee schedule.
§ 310-23. Resubmission of disapproved SWM site plans.
A disapproved SWM site plan may be resubmitted, with the revisions
addressing the Borough's concerns as stated regarding the original
submission, to the Borough in accordance with this article. The applicable
review fee must accompany the submission of a revised SWM site plan,
unless such fee is waived by the Borough. (See § 310-22.)
§ 310-24. Authorization to construct; term of validity.
D. Decision notification procedure. In all cases, the decision of the
Borough to approve or disapprove the SWM site plan shall be in writing
and shall be delivered to the applicant no later than 15 days following
the decision. If the SWM site plan is disapproved, the written decision
by the Borough shall specify the defects in the application, describe the
requirements which were not met, and cite the provisions of the
ordinance relied upon. If the SWM site plan is approved with
conditions, the notification to the applicant shall state the acceptable
conditions for approval and the time limit for satisfying such conditions.
The time limit for satisfying conditions of approval shall be the time
limit prescribed for conditional approval of subdivision and land
development plans as stated in the Borough's Subdivision and Land
Development Ordinance.97
A. SWM site plans independent of subdivision and land development
plans. The Borough's approval of a SWM site plan, when such plan is
submitted independent of a subdivision and/or land development plan,
authorizes the regulated activities contained in the SWM site plan for a
maximum term of validity of five years following the date of approval.
The Borough may, in its sole discretion, specify a term of validity
shorter than five years in the approval for any specific SWM site plan,

particularly if the nature of the proposed SWM facilities requires more
frequent maintenance and/or short-term replacement of certain
components. Terms of validity shall commence on the date the Borough
signs the approval for an SWM site plan. If an approved SWM site
plan is not completed according to § 310-25 within the term of validity,
then the Borough may consider the SWM site plan disapproved and
may revoke any and all permits. SWM site plans that are considered
disapproved by the Borough may be resubmitted in accordance with
§ 310-23 of this chapter.
B. SWM site plans included in a subdivision and/or land development plan.
The Borough's approval of a SWM site plan which is a part of a
subdivision and/or land development plan authorizes that plan and the
regulated activities therein so that no subsequent change or
amendment in this chapter or other governing ordinances or plans shall
be applied to affect adversely the right of the applicant to commence
and to complete any aspect of the approved development in accordance
with the terms of such approval within five years from such approval, as
specified in Section 508(4)(ii) through (vii) of the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code.98
A. The developer shall be responsible for providing as-built plans of all
SWM BMPs included in the approved SWM site plan. The as-built plans
and an explanation of any discrepancies with the construction plans
shall be submitted to the Borough.
B. The as-built submission shall include a certification of completion
signed by a qualified person verifying that all permanent SWM BMPs
have been constructed according to the approved plans and
specifications. If any licensed qualified person contributed to the
construction plans, then a licensed qualified person must sign the
completion certificate.
C. After receipt of the completion certification by the Borough, the
Borough may conduct a final inspection to verify compliance with, and
accuracy of, the as-built plans.
D. The financial guarantee, as discussed under § 310-28, shall not be
released by the Borough until the items of this section are completed,
unless fees otherwise are waived.

ARTICLE IV
Street Opening and Excavation Regulations
§ 313-11. Opening and excavation restrictions.
A. No openings or excavations in any street shall extend beyond the center
line of the street until the surface of the street is restored to a condition
safe and convenient for travel.
B. Unless authorized by the Manager, no more than 250 feet measured
longitudinally shall be opened in any street at any one time until the
surface of the street is restored to a condition safe and convenient for
travel.
C. The work of excavation shall be so conducted as not to interfere with
any utility lines or connections or other underground facilities, unless
permission of the proper authorities in connection with such facilities
shall have been obtained.
D. The permittee shall expose all utility facilities, including sewers, storm
drains, gas mains, water mains, telephone and electrical conduits and
other utility obstructions, sufficiently ahead of trench excavation work
to avoid damage to those facilities and to permit their relocation, if
necessary.
E. Where a pipe drain, pipe culvert or other structure or facility is
encountered, it shall be replaced, restored, straightened or protected
by the permittee.
F. If, in the process of his work, the permittee damages any public or
private utility property, the utility may make the necessary repairs and
file a claim against the permittee, with the Borough, for the cost
thereof. If the claim is not paid promptly by the permittee, the amount
may be withheld by the Manager from the deposit, or charged against
the permittee's performance bond.
G. Any monument of granite, concrete, iron, steel, brass or other lasting
material set for the purpose of locating or preserving the lines of any
street or property subdivision or a precise survey reference point or a
permanent survey bench mark within the Borough shall not be removed
or disturbed or caused to be removed or disturbed without first
obtaining permission in writing from the Manager to do so. Permission
shall be granted only upon condition that the permittee shall pay all
expenses incidental to its proper replacement.
H. If any work performed under the permit interferes with the established
drainage system of any street, provision shall be made by the permittee
to provide proper drainage to the satisfaction of the Manager.
I. When any earth, sand, gravel, rock, stone or other excavated material is
caused to be deposited upon, or to roll, flow or wash upon, any street,
so as to create a nuisance or endanger life or property, the person
§ 313-11 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 313-11
1:483
responsible therefor shall cause the same to be removed immediately
from the street upon notification to do so by the Manager. In the event it
is not removed within eight hours after notification, the Manager shall
cause such removal, and the cost of such removal shall be paid by the
permittee or deducted from his deposit.
J. To protect the public, every permittee shall place around the project
such barriers, barricades, lights, warning flags and danger signs as
shall be determined by the Manager. All safety requirements and
precautionary measures prescribed by the Manager shall be based
upon and in conformance with, where applicable, the requirements set
forth in the United States Department of Army Corps of Engineers,
United States Army, publication: Safety Requirements (latest edition).
Copies of this publication are available in the office of the Manager for
inspection by any permittee. Whenever any person fails to provide or
maintain the safety devices required by the Manager, such device shall
be installed and maintained by the Borough. The amount of the cost
incurred shall be paid by the permittee or deducted from his deposit.
No unauthorized person shall willfully move, remove, injure, destroy or
extinguish any barrier, warning light, sign or notice erected, placed or
posted in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
K. Every permittee shall maintain safe crossings for vehicle traffic at all
street intersections and safe crossings for pedestrians at intervals of
not more than 300 feet. Two lanes of traffic shall be held open at all
intersections, where possible, by the removal of dirt and the use of
covering plates. All plates must be firmly secured and the installation
must be inspected and approved by the Manager.
L. Access to the private driveways shall be provided except during
working hours when construction operations prohibit provision of such
access. Free access must be provided at all times to fire hydrants.
M. All materials excavated shall be laid compactly along the side of the
trench and kept trimmed up so as to cause as little inconvenience as
possible to public travel. Wherever necessary, in the opinion of the
Manager, in order to expedite the flow of traffic or to abate a dirt or
dust nuisance, toe boards or bins will be required to prevent the
spreading of dirt into traffic lanes; temporary wooden plank walks shall
be installed where the excavated area is muddy and causes
inconvenience to pedestrians. If the street is not wide enough to hold
the excavated material without using part of the adjacent sidewalk, the
permittee or his agent shall keep a passageway at least 1/2 the sidewalk
width open along such sidewalk line.
N. Work authorized to be done pursuant to a permit granted by this
chapter shall be performed between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 7:00
p.m., Monday through Friday only, unless the permittee obtains written
consent from the Manager to do the work at other times.
§ 313-11 HANOVER CODE § 313-11
1:484
§ 313-12. Pavement cuts and backfilling and restoring openings.
O. In the ease of any leak, explosion or other accident in any subsurface
pipe, line or other facility, it shall be lawful for the person owning or
responsible for such facility to commence an excavation to remedy such
condition before securing a permit, provided that application for a
permit shall be made immediately and not later than the next business
day thereafter, and that all other provisions of this chapter are fully
complied with. If any such emergency condition shall not be
immediately attended to by the owner or person responsible for such
facility, the Manager, after such notice as he shall deem necessary
under the circumstances of the particular case, shall proceed to do the
work necessary and required by such emergency, and charge the same
on the basis of cost plus 15% to such person.
P. In granting any permit under this chapter, the Manager may attach
such other conditions thereto as may be reasonably necessary to
prevent danger to public or private property or to prevent the operation
from being conducted in a manner hazardous to life or property or in a
manner likely to create a nuisance. Such conditions may include but
shall not be limited to:
(1) Limitations on the period of the year in which the work may be
performed;
(2) Restrictions as to the size and type of equipment;
(3) Designation of routes upon which material may be transported;
(4) The place and manner of disposal of excavated materials;
(5) Requirements as to the laying of dust, cleaning of streets, the
prevention of noises, and other results offensive or injurious to the
neighborhood, the general public or any portion thereof; and
(6) Regulations as to the use of streets in the course of the work.
A. All pavement cuts, openings and excavations shall be properly made
and backfilled according to Borough specifications.
B. Unless otherwise determined by the Manager, all restorations of street
pavements shall be made by the Borough. Furthermore, at the option of
the Manager, the Borough may make the pavement cut. In all such
instances, the actual cost to the Borough, plus 15%, shall be charged to
the permittee, if necessary, being withheld from the deposit or charged
against the permittee's performance bond.
C. The Manager must be notified by the permittee, not more than 48 hours
prior to the beginning of work, of the date and approximate time at
which work will be begun.
§ 313-11 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 313-12
1:485
D. No work shall be performed by the permittee unless or until the
Manager shall be present or permission has been given by the Manager
to proceed in his absence.
E. Whenever it is necessary to break through existing pavement for
excavation purposes and where trenches are to be four feet or over in
depth, the pavement in the base shall be removed to at least six inches
beyond the outer limits of the subgrade that is to be disturbed in order
to prevent settlement, and a six-inch shoulder of undisturbed material
shall be provided in each side of the excavated trench. The face of the
remaining pavement shall be approximately vertical. A power-driven
concrete saw shall be used so as to permit complete breakage of
concrete pavement or base without ragged edges. Asphalt paving shall
be scored or otherwise cut in a straight line. No pile driver may be used
in breaking up the pavement.
F. No tunneling shall be allowed without the express approval of the
Manager and permission therefor endorsed upon the permit. The
backfilling of a tunnel excavation shall be made only in the presence of
the Borough Manager, and shall be done only in a method approved by
him.
G. The work of restoration when carried out by the permittee, including
both paving surface and paving base, shall be performed as follows:
(1) Every person who opens or excavates any street in the Borough
shall thoroughly and completely refill the opening or excavation;
the surface shall be restored to the same condition as it was before
the opening and such restoration shall be in accordance with the
requirements of the Borough or specifications of the Department of
Transportation of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, which
specifications are hereby adopted as specifications of the Borough
for restoration of surfaces of public streets in the Borough; as
restored, the surface shall conform to the proper grade and be of
the same surface covering as the part of the street immediately
adjoining the opening. If, within two years after the restoration of
the surface as herein provided, defects shall appear therein
resulting from defective workmanship by the permittee, he shall
reimburse the Borough for the cost of all necessary repairs to the
permanent paving.
(2) Backfilling in any street opened or excavated pursuant to an
excavation permit issued hereunder shall be compacted to a degree
equivalent to that of the undisturbed ground in which the trench
was dug. Compacting shall be done by mechanical tappers or
vibrators, by rolling in layers, or by water settling, as required by
the soil in question, and sound engineering practices generally
recognized in the construction industry. The decision as to whether
a trench shall be backfilled by water settling shall be based upon
such engineering practices and shall be made by the Manager.
When water is taken from a fire hydrant, the permittee shall assign
§ 313-12 HANOVER CODE § 313-12
1:486
one man to operate the hydrant and shall make certain that said
man had been instructed by the municipal waterworks in the
operation of the hydrant. The waterworks shall likewise be notified
at both the beginning and end of the job so that the condition of the
fire hydrants can be checked on both occasions Any damage done
to the hydrant during the excavation shall be the responsibility of
the permittee. Water shall be paid for by the permittee on the terms
agreed upon with the waterworks.
(3) When backfilling is done by water settling, excavated materials
above utility installations shall be deposited uniformly in layers of
not more than five feet in thickness, and shall be thoroughly
flooded. During the flooding, the water shall be allowed to flow
slowly to the trench from high points and shall be worked down to
the full depth of the layer of backfill, with bars. All bars used shall
be long enough to extend entirely through the layer being filled and
shall be forced down through the loose backfill material. As the
bars are withdrawn, the water shall be allowed to flow downward
around the bar. The channel or hole formed by the bar shall be kept
open and the water kept running into it until the fill has settled. All
work shall be done in such manner as to obtain a relative
compaction through the entire depth of the backfill, of not less than
that existing adjacent to the excavation.
(4) Backfilling up to the first 18 inches above the top of the utility pipes
or similar installations shall be done with thin layers. Each layer is
to be tamped by manual or mechanical means. Layers that are hand
tamped shall not exceed two inches in thickness. Layers that are
power tamped shall not exceed four inches in thickness. The same
requirements shall apply to the remainder of the backfilling if
tamping is the method used for backfilling. Backfilling of all pipes
of over 24 inches in diameter shall be carried up to the spring line
of the pipe in three-inch layers, with each layer moistened and
thoroughly tamped with suitable mechanical equipment. The
backfill around all pipes 24 inches or less in diameter shall be
flooded or tamped as specified above to a depth of 18 inches above
the top of the pipe before any additional backfilling is placed
thereon.
(5) Whenever any excavation for the laying of pipe is made through
rock, the pipe shall be laid six inches above the rock bottom of the
trench, and the space under, around and six inches above the pipe
shall be backfilled with clean river sand, noncorrosive soil or onefourth
inch minus gravel. Broken pavement, large stones and
debris shall not be used in the backfill.
(6) Backfilling shall be completed by placing the backfill material well
up over the top of the trench. For dry backfilling, the material shall
be compacted with a roller of an approved type or with the rear of a
truck carrying at least five tons, until the surface is unyielding. The
surface shall then be graded as required.
§ 313-12 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 313-12
1:487
(7) On improved streets, a temporary paving of suitable materials,
thorough bound and compacted, shall be installed flush with the
surface of the adjoining paving.
H. In the event that any work performed by or for a permittee shall, in the
opinion of the Manager, be unsatisfactory and the same shall not be
corrected in accordance with his instructions within the time fixed by
him, or in the event that the work for which the permit was granted is
not completed within the time fixed by the Manager, the Borough may
proceed to correct such unsatisfactory work or complete any work not
completed, and charge the cost thereof, plus 15%, to the permittee or
his surety.
I. Where trenches are parallel to the street or where a number of cross
trenches are laid in close proximity to one another by the permittee, or
where the equipment used may damage adjacent paved surfaces, it
shall be the prerogative of the Manager to require a negotiated
contribution from the permittee for the resurfacing, in place of
patching, of such streets, if the total area of the proposed patch or
probable damaged area exceeds 15% of the total pavement surfacing
between curb faces or between concrete gutter edges in any block.
Such negotiations shall be carried on and contributions agreed upon
prior to issuance of a permit. The maximum contribution under this
section shall not exceed the cost of trench restoration, plus 15%.
J. After such excavation or opening is commenced, the work of making
and backfilling the same shall be prosecuted with due diligence and so
as not to obstruct the street more than is actually necessary. If the work
is not so prosecuted or if the work does not, in the judgment of the
Manager, comply with the terms of this chapter, he shall so notify the
person named in the permit and shall require such person, within three
days after the service of such notice, to proceed with the diligent
prosecution of such work or properly to complete the same, as the case
may be. If such notice is not complied with, the Borough shall do such
work as may be necessary to backfill such excavation, and to restore the
street or part thereof excavated to the same condition as before such
excavation was made. All expenses incurred by the Borough shall be
recovered from the permittee's deposit or surety. No further permit
shall be granted any person unless and until any opening or excavation
already made by him has met all requirements of this chapter. The
Manager shall be the sole judge of proper performance and his opinion
shall be final.
K. The Manager or his authorized agents shall make daily inspections of
all work authorized by permits issued pursuant to this chapter. The
Manager is empowered to employ an inspector if the Manager is of the
opinion that the work to be performed pursuant to a permit authorized
by this chapter is such that an inspector is necessary to insure
compliance with the various provisions of this chapter.
§ 313-12 HANOVER CODE § 313-12
1:488
L. Upon completion of all work accomplished under the provisions of the
permit, the permittee shall notify the Manager in writing, on a form
prescribed by him. A certificate of final inspection shall be issued by the
Manager to the permittee no sooner than two years after the permanent
restoration of the opening or excavation has been made, provided the
work authorized by the permit has been performed according to
Borough specifications. Prior to the issuance of a certificate, the
Manager shall make a final inspection of the restoration to determine
whether Borough specifications have been adhered to.
M. If any settlement in a restored area occurs within a period of two years
from the date of completion of the permanent restoration, it shall in
general be considered as conclusive evidence of defective backfilling.
Any expense which may be incurred by the Borough in correcting such
settlement shall be paid by the permittee or recovered from his bond.
N. Unless part of the work is being performed by the Borough, no opening
or excavation made by a permittee shall be considered in the charge or
care of the Borough, or of any office or person employed by the
Borough, and no officer or employee is authorized in any way to take or
assume any jurisdiction over any such opening or excavation, except in
the exercise of police power where and when it is necessary to protect
life and property.
O. If, in his judgment, traffic conditions, the safety or convenience of the
traveling public or the public interest require that the excavation work
be performed as an emergency work, the Manager shall have full power
to order, at the time the permit is granted, that a crew of men and
adequate facilities be employed by the permittee 24 hours a day, to the
end that such excavation work may be completed as soon as possible.
§ 313-12 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 313-12
1:489

ARTICLE V
Deposits
§ 313-13. Computation of deposit.
The Manager, upon receipt of the properly completed application, shall
determine the amount of the deposit to be made by the permittee; provided,
however, that it shall never be less than $10. Such deposits shall be
submitted to the Borough at the time the permit is granted. The purpose
of the deposit is to reimburse the Borough for the cost of any work and
materials furnished by it in connection with the work authorized by the
permit and to cover all necessary inspections of said work.
§ 313-14. Form of deposit.
The deposit may be in the form of cash, certified, treasurer's or cashier's
check or surety bond made payable to the Borough and meeting the
approval of the Manager. The surety bond must be written by a reputable
surety company licensed to do business in the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania, and the bond shall be conditioned upon the payment of all
charges required by this chapter. Such bond must be approved by the
Borough Solicitor as to form. The Manager shall have the right to require
the submission of the deposit in any of the above specified forms.
§ 313-15. Insufficient deposit.
If any deposit made is less than sufficient to pay all fees and costs, the
permittee shall, upon demand, pay to the Borough an amount equal to
the deficiency. If the permittee fails or refuses to pay such deficiency
upon demand, the Borough may recover the same by action in any court
of competent jurisdiction. Until such deficiency is paid in full, additional
permits shall not be issued to such permittee.
§ 313-16. Yearly deposit.
Whenever any public utility or municipal authority maintaining
underground facilities shall contemplate more than one street opening or
excavation per calendar year, it may post a surety bond for the calendar
year or part thereof to cover the estimated fees and cost of any and all
work. Said bond must be written by a reputable surety company licensed to
do business in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and the bond shall be
conditioned upon the payment of all charges estimated to be required by
this chapter during the term of the bond. Such bond must be approved by
the Borough Solicitor as to form.
§ 313-17. Deposit schedules.
The Manager is authorized to establish a schedule of charges for
inspections, labor, materials and such other expenses as may be incurred
by the Borough in meeting the objectives and requirements of this chapter.
§ 313-13 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 313-17
1:491
The schedule shall be open to public inspection in the office of the Manager,
upon demand.
§ 313-18. Decision on costs final.
The decision of the Manager as to the cost of any work done or repairs made
by him or under his direction, pursuant to the provisions of this chapter,
shall be final and conclusive.
§ 313-19. Refund of deposit.
Upon notification by the permittee that all work authorized by the permit
has been completed and after inspection by the Manager, the Manager shall
refund to the permittee his deposit less all costs incurred by the Borough
in connection with the permit. However, in no event is the permit fee or
inspection fee to be refunded.
§ 313-17 HANOVER CODE § 313-19
1:492
ARTICLE VI
Liability Insurance
§ 313-20. Insurance requirements.
The certificate of insurance required of the applicant under § 313-10D of
this chapter shall indicate that he is insured against claims for damages for
personal injury as well as against claims for property damages which may
arise from or out of the performance of the work, whether such performance
be by himself, his subcontractor or anyone directly or indirectly employed
by him. Such insurance shall include protection against liability arising
from completed operations. Such insurance shall provide complete thirdparty
coverage for the Borough of Hanover. The amount of such insurance
shall be prescribed by the Manager in accordance with the nature of the
risks involved; provided, however, that the liability insurance for bodily
injury in effect shall be in an amount not less than $100,000 for each
person and $300,000 for each accident, and for property damages, an
amount not less than $50,000. Failure of applicant to file such certificate
shall be grounds for denying a permit. Provided, however, that Borough
departments, franchised public utilities and other governmental agencies
may be relieved of the obligation of submitting such a certificate if they do
the work contemplated under the permit with their own personnel or with
a contractor insured as required; however, such waiver shall not release
any such organization from any and all liability under any of the obligations
provided herein.
§ 313-20 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 313-20
1:493

ARTICLE VII
Faithful Performance Bond
§ 313-21. Requirements.
Each applicant, upon the receipt of a permit, shall provide the Borough with
a surety bond to guarantee the faithful performance of work authorized by
a permit granted pursuant to this chapter. The amount of the bond shall be
100% of the estimated cost of restoring the opening. However, in no event
shall the bond furnished be in an amount less than $1,000. If the permittee
contemplates requesting more than one permit per year as required by this
chapter, the Manager may require the permittee to furnish one bond, as
above, in such amount as the Manager deems necessary. Said bond must
be written by a reputable surety company licensed to do business in the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and must be approved by the Borough
Solicitor as to form.
§ 313-22. Default in performance.
Whenever the Manager shall find that a default has occurred in the
performance of any term or condition of any permit, written notice thereof
shall be given to the principal and to the surety of the bond. Such notice
shall state the work to be done, the estimated cost thereof and the period of
time deemed by the Manager to be reasonably necessary for the completion
of such work.
§ 313-23. Completion of work.
A. After receipt of such notice, the surety must, within the time therein
specified, either cause the required work to be performed or, failing
therein, pay over to the Manager the estimated cost of doing the work
as set forth in the notice. Upon the receipt of such moneys, the Manager
shall proceed by such mode as he deems convenient to cause the
required work to be performed and completed, but no liability shall be
incurred therein other than for the expenditure of the said sum in hand
therefor.
B. In the event of any default in the performance of any term or condition
of the permit for the work, the surety or any person employed or
engaged on its behalf, or the Manager or any person employed or
engaged on his behalf, shall have the right to go upon the premises to
complete the required work or make it safe.
C. No person shall interfere with or obstruct the ingress or egress to or
from any such premises by any authorized representative or agent of
any surety or of the Borough engaged in completing the work required
to be performed under the permit, or in complying with the terms of
conditions thereof.
§ 313-21 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 313-24
1:495

ARTICLE VIII
Openings in New Streets
§ 313-25. Notices of improvements.
When the Borough shall improve or pave any street, the Manager shall first
give notice to all persons owning property abutting on the street about to
be paved or improved, and to all public utility companies operating in the
Borough, and all such persons and utility companies shall do all work which
would necessitate excavation of the street, within 30 days from the giving
of such notice. The time may be extended if permission has been requested
in writing and has been approved by the Manager.
§ 313-26. Restrictions upon opening new streets.
Except in the case of emergencies as defined by this chapter, the Manager
shall have the right to refuse to grant a permit which would allow an
excavation or opening to be cut into a street pavement less than five years
old. Any person so refused by the Manager shall have the right to appeal
to the Hanover Borough Council, and Council's decision shall be final. It
shall be the duty of any person requesting such opening to submit a formal
request in such form as the Manager shall prescribe. If the opening is
authorized by the Manager or Borough Council, such person shall pay to
the Borough of Hanover the fee as specified in § 313-10A(1) through (5),
inclusive. The Manager shall then issue in triplicate, formal authorization to
secure a street opening permit. One copy shall be retained by the person
requesting such authorization, one copy shall be given to the person making
the actual opening and one copy shall be retained by the Borough. It shall be
the duty of the person making the actual opening to then secure the street
opening permit and comply with all other requirements of this chapter. Such
fees as have been paid to secure such authorization shall be credited to
the minimum excavation permit fee as specified in § 313-10A(1) through (5),
inclusive.

street, used for the purpose of supplying or conveying gas, electricity,
communication impulses, water, sewage, steam, oil or any other
material to or from the Borough or to or from its inhabitants, or for any
other purposes, shall file with the Manager, within one year after the
adoption of this chapter, a map or set of maps showing the location, size
and description of all such installations. Maps or sets of maps in
existence at the time of passage of this chapter may be submitted for
record purposes. All installations subsequent to the passage of this
chapter shall be drawn to a scale of not less than one inch to 200 feet.
Map size shall be in some multiple of 8 1/2 by 11 inches, but in no case
shall be larger than 34 inches by 44 inches.
B. Within 30 days after the first day of January of each and every year,
such person shall file with the Manager a corrected map or set of maps,
each drawn to scale as above, showing such installations, including all
those made during the previous year, to and including the last day of
such year. Provided, however, that a person may at his own option elect
to provide corrected atlas sheets throughout the year, as they are
available, rather than proceed as above noted.
C. Each map herein required shall be accompanied by an affidavit
endorsed thereon, to the effect that the same correctly exhibits the
details required to be shown by this section.
A. Whenever any pipe, conduit, duct, tunnel or other structure located
under the surface of any street, or the use thereof, is abandoned, the
person owning, using, controlling or having any interest therein shall,
within 30 days after such abandonment, file with the Manager a
statement in writing, giving in detail the location of the structure so
abandoned.
B. Each map or set of maps filed pursuant to the provisions of this article
shall show in detail the location of all such structures abandoned
subsequent to the filing of the last preceding map or set of maps.
C. When the Borough plans to pave or improve such streets with
abandoned facilities, the owner of such facilities shall be notified to
remove them. If the owner shall refuse to remove such facilities, the
Borough shall remove the abandoned facilities at the owner's expense.
When the owner removes such facilities, the only fee charged by the
Borough shall be for the cost of inspection, plus 15% as provided by
§ 313-10B of this chapter.

1:499
§ 313-29. Notices to property owners and tenants.
If, in the opinion of the Manager, the work to be undertaken by the
permittee is such that it will affect the use of properties abutting or
adjoining the project, he shall require the permittee to submit a list of the
names and addresses of the owners and/or tenants of such properties. Upon
receipt of such list, the Borough shall notify the affected property owners or
tenants of the proposed work to be done.
§ 313-30. Notices to Police and Fire Departments.
The Manager shall notify, in writing, the Borough Police and Fire

(2) Air-entraining agents. Air-entraining agents which are added to
concrete mixtures shall conform to the American Society of Testing
Material Specifications for Air-Entraining Admixtures for Concrete;
Designation C-260. This is already found in Type 1A cement.
(3) Aggregates. Fine and coarse aggregates shall conform to the
American Society of Testing Material Specifications for Concrete
Aggregates; Designation C-33.
(4) Subbase material. Durable material such as crushed stone, bankrun
gravel or slag shall be used in the preparation of unsuitable
subbases, as may be required by the Borough Engineer.
(5) Water. The water used in mixing concrete shall be clean, free from
acid, alkali, vegetable or other organic matter.
(6) Joint filler. The joint filler shall be of a nonextruding joint material
conforming to the American Society of Testing Material
Specification for preformed Expansion Joint fillers for Concrete
(nonextruding and resilient types); Designation D-544.
B. Specifications.
(1) Concrete proportions and consistency.
(a) The proportions of aggregate to cement for any concrete shall
be such as to produce a mixture which will work readily into
the corners and angles of the forms and around reinforcement,
with the method of placing employed on the work, but without
permitting the materials to segregate or excess free water to
collect on the surface. The combined aggregates shall be of
such composition of sizes that, when separated on the No. 4
standard sieve, the weight passing the sieve (fine aggregate),
shall not be less than 30% nor greater than 50% of the total,
unless otherwise required by the architect or engineer, and
with the exception that these proportions do not necessarily
apply to lightweight aggregates.
(b) The methods of measuring concrete materials shall be such
that the proportions can be accurately controlled and easily
checked at any time during the work. Measurement of
materials for ready-mixed concrete shall conform to Tentative
Specifications for Ready-Mixed Concrete (ASTM C94).
(c) The concrete shall be mixed in the proportions which, when the
proper amount of water is added, will produce a minimum
compressive strength of 1,800 pounds per square inch after
seven days, and a minimum compressive strength of 3,000
§ 316-18 HANOVER CODE § 316-18
1:512
pounds per square inch after 28 days, when cured under field
conditions.
(d) The amount of water used per bag of cement shall be the
minimum to obtain a satisfactory workable concrete, but in no
case shall it exceed six gallons, including the free water in the
aggregate. The maximum allowable slump shall be four inches.
(2) Air-entrained concrete. All concrete shall be air-entrained. The air
content shall not be less than 3% nor more than 6%.
(3) Methods.
(a) Curing. As soon as the final finishing has been completed, a
membrane curing agent of the resinwax base or its approved
equal, as approved by the Borough Engineer, must be applied
in accordance with the manufacturer's specifications. The
membrane curing agent must in all cases contain a fugitive
dye.
(b) The forms used shall preferably be of metal, but wood forms
may be used. All forms shall be smooth, straight, free from
warp, and of sufficient strength to resist the pressure of
concrete without springing. Sufficient stakes shall be used to
hold the forms firmly to line and grade. Satisfactory devices
shall be used to insure the proper spacing of the forms. Forms
shall extend the full depth of the sidewalks and gutters, and at
least 18 inches below the top of curbs. Forms may be required
to the full depth of the curb when uniform density of concrete
and proper cross section cannot otherwise be obtained. All
wood forms shall be thoroughly wetted and metal form soiled
or coated with soft soap before depositing any material against
them. All mortar or dirt shall be removed from forms
previously used.
(c) Excavation shall be made to the required depth, and the
material on which the sidewalk, curb or gutter is to be placed
shall be compacted to a uniformly firm, even surface.
(d) The concrete shall be placed in the forms in horizontal layers,
and spaded or vibrated sufficiently to eliminate all voids. The
top surface shall be finished true to line and grade, in an even,
neat manner, with sidewalk surfaces slightly roughened. Edges
of face of curb shall be rounded to a radius of 3/4 inch, all other
edges to a radius of 1/4 inch.
(e) Joints. The curb or curb and gutter shall be cut into lengths no
longer than 20 feet, unless otherwise specified by the Borough
Engineer, by the use of a one-fourth-inch preformed expansion
joint held in a true vertical position. A one-fourth-inch
expansion joint shall also be provided between all sidewalks,
and between the intersection of two sidewalks, and between
§ 316-18 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 316-18
1:513
sidewalks and adjoining driveways. Sidewalks shall be
separated from abutting buildings by a similar joint.
Contraction joints shall be provided to separate the sidewalk
and/or gutter slabs, and shall be cut to a depth equal to at
least 1/3 of the total slab thickness. Contraction joints shall be
spaced no more than five feet apart, and shall be so spaced as
to coincide with the expansion joints provided in the curb.
(f) At the end of curved curbs, there shall be imbedded in the
concrete two reinforcement bars 1/2 inch in diameter and 24
inches in length. The bars shall be placed three and nine
inches, respectively, below the top of the curb, and shall extend
12 inches on each side of the joint. One end of the bars shall be
coated with grease, and enclosed in a capped tube at least 1/2
inch longer than the bar.
(g) The forms shall not be removed until 24 hours after the
concrete has been placed. Any irregular surface shall be
corrected by rubbing with a carborundum stone. Brush
finishing or plastering will not be permitted.
(h) The concrete shall be protected from drying or freezing, by the
use of approved methods, for at least 72 hours after placing.
(i) After the concrete has set sufficiently, the spaces adjacent to
the concrete shall be backfilled to the required depth with
acceptable material placed in layers not more than four inches
in depth and thoroughly compacted.
(j) Sidewalks shall be a uniform depth of four inches, except
where crossed by driveways, where the thickness shall be at
least six inches for residential driveways and eight inches for
commercial driveways. The entire sidewalk and grass-plot area
shall have a slope of 1/4 inch per foot toward the curb. The
width shall be as established by general or specific ordinance.
(k) Curb construction.
[1] Curbs shall be 24 inches deep, six inches wide for the
lower 17 inches, with a vertical back and the upper seven
inches of the face battered 1/2 inch to a five-and-one-halfinch
top.
[2] Curbs may be constructed 18 inches deep, eight inches
wide for the lower 10 inches, with a vertical back and the
upper eight inches of the face battered one inch to a seveninch
top. This alternate specification may be used for new
curb construction, or, where installed adjacent to an old
curb, it must be blended in joint to joint to the old curb so
as to create no obstruction to pedestrians or cars, with a
minimum length of three feet between contraction joints. A
minimum strength of 3,500 pounds per square inch shall

radius fixed by the Borough Manager or his authorized
representative.
(n) No sidewalk, curb or gutter shall be constructed until the
grade has been given by the Borough Manager or his
authorized representative.
(o) Sidewalks adjacent to trees located in the public right-of-way
may be reduced in width around tree roots as approved by the
Borough Manager. Where tree roots create or could create a
sidewalk offset problem, one-half-inch-by-twelve-inch steel
dowels, each 12 inches center to center, shall be embedded in
the concrete extending six inches on each side of the expansion
joints of the changed section bedded on four inches of stone
and centered in four inches of concrete; one end of the bar
shall be coated with grease and enclosed in a copper tube at
least 1/2 inch longer than the bar. At each interior joint in the
changed section, a one-and-one-half-inch-deep control joint
shall be installed at least every five feet, a six-inch-by-six-inch
10/10 welded wire fabric shall be embedded in a minimum of
2 1/2 inches of concrete throughout the changed sidewalk
sections. [Added 7-6-1988 by Ord. No. 1846]
A. No concrete shall be poured until the forms and preparations have been
approved by the Inspector. The Inspector shall have the right to secure
a sample of the concrete being used to determine by standard tests if
the strength meets the requirements of § 316-18 of this article.
B. When the Inspector finds that any of the work or material is not in
compliance with the requirements of this article, he shall notify the
owner as soon as possible. Any sidewalk, curb or gutter not constructed
in accordance with this article shall be removed and replaced with a
properly constructed sidewalk, curb or gutter. In the event of the failure

constructed, opened or dedicated for public use or travel or for the common
use of occupants of buildings abutting thereon, except in accordance with
the provisions of this chapter. The subdivider/developer shall submit true
copies of his plans as generally required by the Borough Planning
Commission. The subdivider/developer shall also grade, pave and make
other street improvements to his subdivision/land development, including,
when required, the installation of curbs, street signs, fire hydrants, water
mains and laterals, sanitary sewer mains and laterals, gas mains and

§ 320-7. Plan approval; improvements required.
A. No lot in any proposed subdivision/land development may be sold and
no permit to erect or alter any building upon land in a proposed
subdivision/land development may be issued and no building may be
erected or altered in a proposed subdivision/land development unless
and until a subdivision/land development plan has been approved and
properly recorded, and before approving any subdivision/land
development plan the Borough shall require that all the necessary
improvements in connection therewith have either been constructed
and approved by the Borough or the completion thereof has been
assured by means of a written agreement specifying the time of
completion, together with a proper completion guaranty in the form of a
bond or the deposit of funds or securities in escrow sufficient to cover
the cost of the required improvements, as estimated by the Borough
Engineer in accordance with regulations set forth in the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code.111 When requested by the subdivider/
developer, in order to facilitate financing, the governing body shall
furnish the developer with a signed copy of a letter indicating approval
of the final plat/lot contingent upon the subdivider/developer obtaining
a satisfactory financial security. The final plat/lot or record plan shall
not be signed, dated nor recorded until the performance bond is
executed. The letter of contingent approval shall expire and be deemed
to be revoked if the financial security/performance bond is not executed
within 90 days unless a written extension is granted by the governing
body; such extension shall not be unreasonably withheld and shall be
placed in writing at the request of the subdivider/developer.

The recording of an approved final plan shall make the plan a part of
the Borough's official plan of streets, highways, sewers, parks and other
public improvements. However, all such improvements shall be deemed to
be in private ownership, whether or not noted on the plan as dedicated
for public use, until such time as such improvements shall have been
specifically accepted or condemned by the Borough Council according to
law. While under private ownership, said improvements shall not be served,
maintained or improved by the Borough of Hanover.
§ 320-9. Variances.
Where The Planning Commission finds that extraordinary hardships may
result from strict compliance with the regulations of this chapter, or
abnormal conditions exist, it may vary regulations in specific instances
and establish standards for abnormal conditions, provided that such
modifications will not be contrary to the public interest and that the purpose
and intent of this chapter is observed. All requests for such modifications
must be in writing and shall accompany and be a part of the application
for subdivision/land development. The request shall state in full the grounds
and facts of unreasonableness or hardship on which the request is based,
the provisions of this chapter involved and the minimum modification
necessary. Such modifications, to be effective, must be approved at an
official meeting by at least four members of the Planning Commission. The
granting of variations shall be conditional and subject to the approval of the
Hanover Borough Council at an official meeting thereof; the governing body
shall keep a written record of all action on all requests for modifications.
§ 320-10. Approval of final plans; appeals.
B. In those instances where the purchase of a bond or the usual deposit of
funds or securities is not possible or works a financial hardship on the
subdivider/developer, he may request that he be permitted to come
under the following provisions. Upon the written request of the
subdivider/developer and the submission of proof that the purchase of a
bond or the usual deposit of funds or securities is not possible or
feasible, the governing body may permit the subdivider/developer to
pay the costs of the required improvements out of the funds deposited
in escrow. The first 10% of the required deposit shall be left in escrow
until the improvements have been completed and approved by the
Borough and the maintenance bond procured. The remaining funds
held in escrow may then be used to pay construction bills as they come
due. Under no circumstances shall any of these escrow funds be
withdrawn or used without the signed approval of the Borough
Engineer.
A. A subdivider/developer, desiring to subdivide lots abutting upon an
existing improved street of the Borough of Hanover, of sufficient width,

Borough Subdivision Committee shall be noted or stamped on the
face of the plan over the signatures of all members of said Borough
Subdivision Committee. In the event that such plan is disapproved, the

developer to proceed with the preparation of a final plan for submission
to the Borough.
A. The Borough Planning Commission shall review the final plans for
conformity with previously approved preliminary plan as to general
layout and design. If the plan is found to be in conformity with the
preliminary plans, it shall notify the Engineer to proceed with technical

preliminary plan (general subdivision plan), the subdivider/developer
shall submit to the Borough Manager plans and data as specified in
§ 320-20.
C. Within 15 days, the Planning Commission shall inform the subdivider/

Commission finds that the plans and data do not meet the objectives of
these regulations, it shall express its reasons therefor.
D. The subdivider/developer who wishes to subdivide or alter a lot or
several lots within a block shall submit to the Borough Manager plans

final plans which are to be prepared as specified by the Planning
Commission.
A. On reaching conclusions, informally as recommended in § 320-17
above, regarding his general program and objectives, the subdivider/
developer shall cause to be prepared a preliminary plan, together with
improvement plans and other supplementary material as specified in
§ 320-21.
B. Five paper and one Mylar copy of the preliminary plan and
supplementary material specified shall be submitted to the Borough

the preliminary plan, referenced and attached to any conditions
determined. One copy shall be returned to the subdivider/developer
and the other retained by the Planning Commission.

expression of approval to the layout submitted on the preliminary plan
as a guide to the preparation of the final plan which will be submitted
for approval of the Planning Commission and for recording upon
fulfillment of the requirements of these regulations and the conditions
of the conditional approval, if any.
F. When application for approval of a preliminary plan has been approved
without conditions or approved by the applicant's acceptance of
conditions, no subsequent change or amendment in Chapter 370,

applied to affect adversely the right of the applicant to commence and
to complete any aspect of the approved development in accordance
with the terms of such approval within five years from such approval.
A. The final plan shall conform substantially to the preliminary plan as
approved, and, if desired by the subdivider/developer, it may constitute
only that portion of the approved preliminary plan which he proposes to
record and develop at the time; provided, however, that such portion
conforms to all requirements of these regulations.
B. Applications for approval of the final plan shall be submitted in writing
to the Planning Commission at least five working days prior to the

become null and void unless an extension of time is applied for and
granted by the Planning Commission.
D. When an application for approval of a final plan has been approved
without conditions or approved by the applicant's acceptance of any
conditions, no subsequent change or amendment in Chapter 370,
Zoning, this chapter or other governing ordinance or plan shall be
applied to affect adversely the right of the applicant to commence and
to complete any aspect of the approved development in accordance

ARTICLE VII
Design Standards
§ 320-23. General provisions.
In considering the adequacy of subdivision/land development plans, the
Borough government and its agents shall apply the standards contained in
this article.
§ 320-24. Conformance with other standards.
§ 320-25. Blocks and lots.
A. Land. Land shall be suited to the purpose for which it is to be
subdivided, and its proposed use shall be in accordance with the
requirements of Chapter 370, Zoning. Land subject to hazards to life,
health or property shall not be subdivided for residential purposes until
all such hazards have been eliminated or unless adequate safeguards
against such hazards are provided by the subdivision/land development
plan.
B. Development. Proposed subdivision/land developments shall be
coordinated with existing nearby neighborhoods so that the community
as a whole may develop harmoniously in conformance with the
Comprehensive Plan.
A. Blocks.
(1) Block length. Blocks shall generally be not less than 500 feet long
nor more than 1,600 feet long. Where practicable, blocks along
arterial and secondary street shall not be less than 1,200 feet long
and 800 feet long, respectively. Crosswalks at least 12 feet wide
may be required in blocks more than 1,000 feet long or as may be
necessary to facilitate pedestrian circulation and give access to
community facilities.
(2) Block depth. Blocks shall be deep enough for two tiers of lots and
shall not be less than 200 feet deep, except where reverse frontage
lots are used or required.
B. Lots.
(1) Through lots. Double frontage lots are to be avoided and generally
will not be permitted unless the lots are a minimum of 200 feet
deep.
(2) Lot lines. Lot lines shall be at right angles to street lines or radial
thereto wherever practicable, and they shall follow municipal
boundaries rather than cross them.
§ 320-23 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 320-25
1:549
(3) House numbers and street names. House numbers shall be
assigned to each lot by the Borough Engineer and street names
reviewed by Borough Council and Emergency Services.
(4) Exceptions. Blocks in commercial and industrial districts may vary
from the elements of design contained in this section if the nature
of the use requires other treatment.
(5) Lot size. Lot dimensions and areas shall be of the sizes established
and provided in the "Hanover Zoning Ordinance of 1961,"
Ordinance No. 1110, and the amendments thereof, as may from
time to time be enacted and ordained.113
(6) Lot shape. Generally, the depth of lots shall be not less than equal
their width nor more than 2 1/2 times their width.
(7) Driveway access. In general, driveway access to arterial streets will
not be permitted; but where such access is permitted to an arterial
street, adequate turnaround space shall be provided on the lot.
Driveway access shall not be closer than 40 feet from the tangent
point of the curb radius to any street intersection.
(8) Building line. Adequate front and side yard areas shall be provided
as follows:
(a) The final plan shall specify building lines for all lots included
therein.
(b) Front, side and rear building lines shall be not less than the
distance established and provided in the "Hanover Zoning
Ordinance of 1961," Ordinance No. 1110, and the amendments
thereof, as may from time to time be enacted and ordained.114
C. Where not prohibited by this or any other laws or ordinances, land
located in any designated floodplain district may be platted for
development with the provision that the developer construct all
buildings and structures to preclude flood damage in accordance with
this and any other laws and ordinances regulating such development.
D. Building sites for residences or any other type of dwelling or
accommodations shall not be permitted in any designated floodway
district. Sites for these uses may be permitted outside the floodway
district if the sites or dwelling units are elevated up to the regulatory
flood elevation. If fill is used to raise the elevation of a site, the fill area
shall extend out laterally for a distance of at least 15 feet beyond the
limits of the proposed structures.
E. Building sites for structures or buildings other than for residential uses
shall also not be permitted in any designated floodway district. Also,
113. Editor's Note: See Ch. 370, Zoning.
114. Editor's Note: See Ch. 370, Zoning.
§ 320-25 HANOVER CODE § 320-25
1:550
§ 320-26. Streets.
such sites for structures or buildings outside the floodway shall be
protected as provided for in Subsection D above. However, the Borough
Council may allow the subdivision and/or development of areas or sites
for commercial and industrial uses at an elevation below the regulatory
flood elevation if the developer otherwise protects the area to that
height or assures that the buildings or structures will be floodproofed
at least up to that height.
F. If the Borough Council determines that only a part of a proposed plat
can be safely developed, it shall limit development to that part and shall
require that development proceed consistent with this determination.
G. When a developer does not intend to develop the plat himself and the
Borough Council determines that additional controls are required to
ensure safe development, it may require the developer to impose
appropriate deed restrictions on the land. Such deed restrictions shall
be inserted in every deed and noted on every recorded plat.
A. Arrangement. The proposed street pattern shall be integrated with
existing streets and the Borough plan of streets and shall be related to
topography so as to produce usable lots and reasonable street grades
throughout the subdivision. No remnants of land shall be left without
street frontage or access. Residential streets shall be laid out so as to
discourage their use as secondary streets and arterial streets.
B. Grading. The full width of the right-of-way shall be graded to conform to
the established curb elevations, and provisions shall be made for
reasonable slopes beyond the right-of-way.
C. Right-of-way and cartway width.
(1) Street. The minimum widths of the right-of-way and the cartway
shall not be less than those of an existing street of which the new
street is to be a continuation, nor less than the following:
Width
(in feet)
Type of Street Right-of-Way Cartway
Residential 50 34
Secondary 60 40
Arterial 80 40*
*NOTE: The Borough shall be responsible at its own expense or at
the expense of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation for
any additional cartway width.
(2) Culs-de-sac.
§ 320-25 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 320-26
1:551
(a) The minimum widths of the right-of-way and the cartway shall
not be less than the following:
Width
(in feet)
Number of Families
According to
Subdivision Plan Right-of-Way Cartway
5 or more 50 34
Under 5 50 26
(b) A cul-de-sac will not be approved when a through street is
needed to assure traffic circulation and to provide access to an
area or neighborhood. In general, culs-de-sac are desirable
residential streets; however, a cul-de-sac shall not be more
than 400 feet long nor less than 250 feet. A cul-de-sac shall
have a circular turnaround with a minimum right-of-way radius
of 50 feet and an outer paving radius of 40 feet.
D. Intersections.
(1) Right-of-way. Whenever practicable, right-of-way lines shall
intersect at right angles, and intersections of less than 70°
(measured at the center line of the streets) will not be permitted.
(2) Arterial streets. Whenever practicable, intersections with arterial
streets shall be kept to a minimum and shall be located at least
1,200 feet apart.
(3) No more than two streets shall cross at the same point.
(4) Intersecting streets shall not enter into the same side of secondary
traffic streets at intervals of less than 800 feet. Residential streets
which enter secondary traffic streets from opposite sides should be
directly opposite to each other; or, if necessary, they may be
separated by at least 200 feet between center lines measured along
the center line of the secondary traffic street.
(5) Maximum grade, within any intersection, shall not exceed 2%, and
approaches to any intersection shall follow a straight course within
100 feet of the intersection. A leveling area at least 50 feet long
(measured from the nearest right-of-way line of the intersecting
street) shall be provided within which no grade shall exceed 4%.
(6) Intersections should be designed with a corner radius for pavement
that is adequate to accommodate the largest vehicles anticipated.
Usually, a minimum edge radius of 50 feet is acceptable except on
local access roads with few trucks where a radius of 35 feet may be
used. The street right-of-way line shall be parallel to the curbline.
In zones where buildings are permitted to abut the right-of-way
§ 320-26 HANOVER CODE § 320-26
1:552
line, a diagonal cutoff may be employed. The grade lines of the
curbs at intersections shall intersect if the tangents are extended.
The Planning Commission shall have the authority to require a
greater radius in specific cases.
(7) A seventy-five-foot drivers' eye height of 3 1/2 feet shall be
provided, in which no permanent structures, fences, hedges, walls,
plantings or other obstructions shall be placed except for utility
poles, light standards, street signs and fire hydrants at all
intersections.

be more than one foot below the regulatory flood elevation.
E. Alignment.
(1) Sight distance. A sight distance at the center line of at least 900
feet on arterial streets, 200 feet on secondary streets and 100 feet
on residential streets at drivers' eye height of 3 1/2 feet shall be
provided with respect to vertical and horizontal alignment.
(2) Horizontal curves. Changes in street direction shall be made by
horizontal curves. Horizontal curves shall have a minimum radius
on the center line of 1,000 feet on arterial streets, 500 feet on
secondary streets and 100 feet on residential streets. A long radius
curve shall be used rather than a series of curves connected by
short tangents. Reverse curves shall be separated by tangents of 50
feet or more on residential streets and 150 feet on secondary and
arterial streets. Proper superelevation and additional width shall
be provided for curves of less than 600 feet radius on secondary
streets and of less than 300 feet radius on residential streets.
Minimum-radius curves, at the end of long tangents, are to be
avoided.
(3) Vertical curves. Vertical curves are required for changes in grade
greater than 1%. The rate of change of grade on vertical curves
shall be no more than 4% per 100 feet of road, provided that the
clear sight distance specified in these regulations is maintained at
all points along the center line.
(4) Grades. There shall be a minimum center-line grade of 1/2% and a
maximum center line grade of 6% on all streets. For short
distances, grades exceeding the maximum limits may be permitted
on recommendation of the Borough Engineer.
F. Surface drainage. The slope of the crown on proposed streets shall be
more than 1/8 inch per foot and less than 1/2 inch per foot as directed
by the Borough Engineer. Adequate drainage shall be provided for at
low points along streets and where required to intercept runoff.

bituminous concrete base course specified in Publication 408/300.
(4) Subbase. On an approved subgrade there shall be constructed an
eight-inch (residential) or ten-inch (secondary) thickness, when
compacted, conforming to Section 350, 1990 Edition or, at the
request of the Engineer, Section 310, Crushed Aggregate Base
Course, 1976 Edition.
(5) Flexible rigid pavements. This work is the construction of plantmixed
bituminous concrete courses and normal- or high-strength
cement concrete pavement on a prepared surface. All flexible
pavement shall incorporate an aggregate blend to provide a skid
resistance level to match the projected ten-year average daily
traffic with Type G used as a minimum.
(6) Drainage. Subdrains shall be installed as determined by the
Borough Engineer to assure adequate soil-bearing value of the
subgrade of all pavements.
I. Street names and signs. All streets in the proposed subdivision must be
named on the preliminary and on the final plans, and the names
selected will be subject to the approval of the Planning Commission and
the Borough Council. No street name shall be used which will duplicate

H. Lot drainage. Lots or land development shall be laid out and graded to
provide positive drainage away from new and existing buildings. The
rate and quantity of runoff shall not exceed the predevelopment
conditions.
I. Where an area being developed has a high groundwater table or a
continuous flowing spring, the Borough Engineer and the Planning
Commission may establish standards and regulations to properly
handle the problem, or they may require that all contiguous structures
be erected on a reinforced concrete slab approved by the Borough
Engineer and Planning Commission in accordance with Article III,
§ 320-9.
J. In designated floodplains, a primary underground system and a
secondary surface system to accommodate one-hundred-year flood
levels may be required. Such drainage plans shall be consistent with
local and regional plans. The facilities shall be designed to prevent
discharge of excess runoff onto adjacent properties.
A. Connections. All properties shall be connected to the municipal sanitary
sewer system, gas mains and the public water supply system if
accessible and determined by Borough Council. The subdivider/
developer shall install sewer lines and laterals, gas mains and laterals
and water mains and laterals. Where the sewer is not yet accessible but
planned for extension to the subdivision, the subdivider/developer shall
install sewer lines and laterals. The sewer lines shall be suitably capped
at the limits of the subdivision, and the laterals shall be capped at the
street right-of-way line if not extended to the houses. When capped
sewers are required, on-site disposal facilities shall also be provided. A

any time after preliminary engineering and related studies have been
initiated preparatory to the construction of facilities adequate to serve
the area containing the subdivision.
B. Installation. Installation of all sewer, water and other utilities shall be in
strict accordance with the engineering standards and specifications of
the Borough Engineer, municipal authority or other public utility
concerned. Where feasible, utilities shall be installed underground
between the curb and sidewalk or in easements in the rear of the lot
instead of in the street or overhead. All water lines, sanitary sewer
lines, gas lines, electrical lines and all other public and private utilities
and facilities located in any designated floodplain districts, whether
public or private utilities, shall be elevated or floodproofed up the
regulatory flood elevation.
C. Manholes. Manholes for sanitary sewers shall be not more than 300 feet
apart on straight runs, and there shall be a manhole at every point of
substantial change in course or grade and at intersections of sewer
lines. Manhole frames and covers may be obtained from the Borough at

developer shall provide for these easements on the respective deeds for
any lot or tract in his subdivision/land development so restricted.
Electric and telephone lines shall normally be carried along the rear of
lots. They shall coincide with property lines wherever practical. The
location of each underground utility shall be coordinated with the
location of all other underground utilities and subject to the approval of
the Borough Engineer.
F. Underground utilities shall be installed before the streets are
constructed, and streets shall be graded to within six inches of finished
subgrade before work is started on the buildings to be served by them.
G. The finished elevation of proposed streets in flood districts shall not be
more than the one foot below the regulatory flood elevation.
A. Notice. The Borough Manager shall be notified 24 hours in advance of
the commencement of any construction operation, in order that

Fees; Enforcement
§ 320-38. Fees.
At the time that the subdivider/developer submits a preliminary or final plan
to the Borough for review, he shall pay to the Borough of Hanover a fee as
outlined by Borough Council:
§ 320-39. Enforcement.
§ 320-40. Violations and penalties.
A. Such review fees shall be based upon a schedule established by
ordinance or resolution.
B. This fee is to be used to defray the costs of examining and processing
the plan.
C. In cases where a York County Planning Commission review is required,
the fee charged by the county will be collected by the Borough of
Hanover and transmitted with the plans for county review.
A. It shall be the duty of the Zoning Officer, Code Enforcement Officer or
other such duly authorized representative of the Hanover Borough
Council, and who is hereby given the power and authority, to enforce
the provisions of this chapter. The Enforcement Officer shall require
that the application for a building permit contain all information
necessary to enable him to ascertain whether the proposed building,
alteration or use is located in an approved land development. No
building permit shall be issued until the Enforcement Officer has
certified that the site for the proposed building, alteration or use
complies with all the provisions of this chapter and conforms to the site
description as indicated on the approved final plan.
B. Remedies to effect completion of improvements. In the event that any
improvements which may be required have not been installed as
provided in this chapter in accord with the approved final plat, the
Borough Manager is hereby granted the power to enforce any
corporate bond or other security by appropriate legal and equitable
remedies.
A. Any person, partnership or corporation who or which has violated the
provisions of this chapter shall, upon being found liable therefor in a
civil enforcement proceeding commended by Hanover Borough, pay a
judgment of not more than $500, plus all court costs, including
reasonable attorney fees, incurred by the Borough as a result thereof.
No judgment shall commence or be imposed, levied or payable until the
date of the determination of a violation by the Magisterial District
Judge. If the defendant neither pays nor timely appeals to the judgment,
the Borough may enforce the judgment pursuant to the applicable rules
§ 320-38 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 320-40
1:565
of civil procedure. Each day that a violation continues shall constitute
a separate violation, unless the Magisterial District Judge determining
that there has been a violation further determines that there was a
good faith basis for the person, partnership or corporation violating
this chapter to have believed that there was no such violation, in which
event there shall be deemed to have been only one such violation until
the fifth day following the date of the determination of a violation by
the Magisterial District Judge, and thereafter each day that a violation
continues shall constitute a separate violation.
B. The Court of Common Pleas, upon petition, may grant an order to stay,
upon cause shown, tolling the per diem judgment pending final
adjudication of the violation and judgment.

§ 325-16. Exemptions.
The United States, the commonwealth or any of their instrumentalities,
agencies or political subdivisions shall be exempt from payment of the tax
imposed by this article. The exemption of such governmental bodies shall
not, however, relieve any other party to a transaction from liability for the
tax.
§ 325-17. Excluded transactions.
persons existing before the transfer and not removed thereby or
between the grantor, the agent or principle of the grantor of a related
corporation, association or partnership and the grantee existing before
or effective with the transfer.
A. Every person who makes, executes, delivers, accepts or presents for
recording any document or in whose behalf any document is made,
executed, delivered, accepted or presented for recording shall be
subject to pay, for and in respect to the transaction or any part thereof,

subdivision shall impose or hereafter shall impose such tax on the same
person or transfer, then the tax levied by the Borough of Hanover under
the authority of that Act shall, during the time such duplication of the
tax exists, except as hereinafter otherwise provided, be 1/2 of the rate,
and such 1/2 rate shall become effective without any action on the part
of the Borough; provided, however, that the Borough and any other
political subdivision which impose such tax on the same person or
transfer may agree that, instead of limiting their respective rates to 1/2
of the rate herein provided, they will impose respectively different
rates, the total of which shall not exceed the maximum rate permitted
under the Local Tax Enabling Act.
D. If for any reason the tax is not paid when due, interest at the rate in
effect at the time the tax is due shall be added and collected.

§ 325-14 HANOVER CODE § 325-17
1:574
A. The tax imposed by § 325-15 shall not be imposed upon:
(1) A transfer to the commonwealth or to any of its instrumentalities,
agencies or political subdivisions by gift, dedication or deed in lieu
of condemnation or deed of confirmation in connection with
condemnation proceedings, or a reconveyance by the condemning
body of the property condemned to the owner of record at the time
of condemnation, which reconveyance may include property fine
adjustments, provided that said reconveyance is made within one
year from the date of condemnation.
(2) A document which the Borough is prohibited from taxing under the
Constitution or statutes of the United States.
(3) A conveyance to a municipality, township, school district or county
pursuant to acquisition by the municipality, township, school
district or county of a tax-delinquent property at a Sheriff's sale or
Tax Claim Bureau sale.
(4) A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration which corrects or
confirms a transfer previously recorded, but which does not extend
or limit existing record legal title or interest.
(5) A transfer of division in kind for no or nominal actual consideration
of property passed by testate or intestate succession and held by
cotenants; however, if any of the parties take shares greater in
value than their undivided interest, tax is due on the excess.
(6) A transfer between husband and wife, between persons who were
previously husband and wife who have since been divorced,
provided that the property or interest therein subject to such
transfer was acquired by the husband and wife or husband or wife
prior to the granting of the final decree in divorce, between parent
and child or the spouse of such child, between brother or sister or
spouse of a brother or sister and brother or sister or the spouse of a
brother or sister and between a grandparent and grandchild or the
spouse of such grandchild, except that a subsequent transfer by the
grantee within one year shall be subject to tax as if the grantor
were making such transfer.
(7) A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration of property
passing by testate or intestate succession from a personal
representative of a decedent to the decedent's devisee or heir.
(8) A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration to a trustee of an
ordinary trust where the transfer of the same property would be
exempt if the transfer was made directly from the grantor to all of
the possible beneficiaries, whether or not such beneficiaries are
contingent or specifically named. No such exemption shall be
granted unless the recorder of deeds is presented with a copy of
the trust instrument that clearly identifies the grantor and all
possible beneficiaries.

and agent or straw party; or from or to an agent or straw party
where, if the agent or straw party were his principal, no tax would
be imposed under this article. Where the document by which title is
acquired by a grantee or statement of value fails to set forth that
the property was acquired by the grantee from or for the benefit of
his principal, there is a rebuttable presumption that the property is
the property of the grantee in his individual capacity if the grantee
claims an exemption from taxation under this clause.
(12) A transfer made pursuant to the statutory merger or consolidation
of a corporation or statutory division of a nonprofit corporation,
except where the Department reasonably determines that the
primary intent for such merger, consolidation or division is
avoidance of the tax imposed by this article.
(13) A transfer from a corporation or association of real estate held of
record in the name of the corporation or association where the
grantee owns stock of the corporation or an interest in the
association in the same proportion as his interest in or ownership of
the real estate being conveyed and where the stock of the
corporation or the interest in the association has been held by the
grantee for more than two years.

authority to a grantee of property conveyed by the grantee to that
agency or authority as security for a debt or the grantee or a
transfer to a nonprofit industrial development agency or authority.

authority to a grantee purchasing directly from it, but only if:
(a) The grantee shall directly use such real estate for the primary
purpose of manufacturing, fabricating, compounding,
processing, publishing, research and development,
transportation, energy conversion, energy production,
pollution control, warehousing or agriculture; and
(b) The agency or authority has the full ownership interest in the
real estate transferred.
(16) A transfer by a mortgagor to the holder of a bona fide mortgage in
default in lieu of a foreclosure or a transfer pursuant to a judicial
sale in which the successful bidder is the bona fide holder of a
mortgage, unless the holder assigns the bid to another person.

§ 325-18. Taxable documents.
Except as otherwise provided in § 325-17, documents which make, confirm

stockholders thereof are fully taxable. For the purposes of this article,

interest in a real estate company or family farm corporation.
(21) A transaction wherein the tax due is $1 or less.
(22) Leases for the production or extraction of coal, oil, natural gas or
minerals and assignments thereof.
B. In order to exercise any exclusion provided in this section, the true, full
and complete value of the transfer shall be shown on the statement of
value. A copy of the Pennsylvania realty transfer tax statement of value
may be submitted for this purpose. For leases of coal, oil, natural gas or
minerals, the statement of value may be limited to an explanation of the
reason such document is not subject to tax under this article.
A. A real estate company is an acquired company upon a change in the
ownership interest in the company, however effected, if the change
does not affect the continuity of the company and, of itself or together
with prior changes, has the effect of transferring, directly or indirectly,
90% or more of the total ownership interest in the company within a
period of three years.
B. With respect to real estate acquired after February 16, 1986, a family
farm corporation is an acquired company when, because of voluntary or
involuntary dissolution, it ceases to be a family farm corporation or
when, because of issuance or transfer of stock or because of acquisition

to the lessee is fixed or if a method for calculating the rental charge is
established.
§ 325-22. Proceeds of judicial sale.
The tax herein imposed shall be fully paid and have priority out of the
proceeds of any judicial sale of real estate before any other obligation,
or transfer of assets that are devoted to the business of agriculture, it
fails to meet the minimum requirements of a family farm corporation
under this article.
C. Within 30 days after becoming an acquired company, the company shall
present a declaration of acquisition with the recorder of each county in
which it holds real estate for the affixation of value of real estate
holdings of the acquired company in such county. A copy of the
Pennsylvania realty transfer tax declaration of acquisition may be
submitted for this purpose.
A. Where there is a transfer of a residential property by a licensed real
estate broker which property was transferred to him within the
preceding year as consideration for the purchase of other residential
property, a credit for the amount of the tax paid at the time of the
transfer to him shall be given to him toward the amount of the tax due
upon the transfer.
B. Where there is a transfer by a builder of residential property which was
transferred to the builder within the preceding year as consideration
for the purchase of new, previously unoccupied residential property, a
credit for the amount of the tax paid at the time of the transfer to the
builder shall be given to the builder toward the amount of the tax due
upon the transfer.
C. Where there is a transfer of real estate which is leased by the grantor, a
credit for the amount of tax paid at the time of the lease shall be given

this section, the difference shall be paid. If the credit allowed is greater
than the amount of tax due, no refund or carryover credit shall be

Every document lodged with or presented to the Recorder of Deeds for
recording shall set forth therein and as a part of such document the true,

A. Taxpayer obligations.
(1) It is the obligation of all taxpayers to file all tax returns and pay all
taxes to which they are subject. However, when the Borough
determines that a required return has not been filed or that a
liability has not been paid, it has certain rights prescribed by law
that set forth how it may enforce a taxpayer's obligation. In
conjunction with these rights, the Borough must now comply with a
Taxpayers Bill of Rights which provides certain legal rights on
behalf of the taxpayer and creates obligations for the Borough so
that equity and fairness control how these requirements are
enforced.
(2) Eligible taxes include any per capita; occupation privilege; earned
income; deed transfer; mechanical devices; business gross receipt;
amusement; and any other tax authorized by the Local Tax
Enabling Act (Act 511 of 1965127) and levied by the Borough.

(b) Earned income.

respond to a request for information, the Borough shall grant an
extension for good cause.
(3) No action will be taken for the tax year in question until expiration
of the response period, including any extension of time.

the Borough determines that the taxpayer failed to file a return,
under reported income or failed to pay for one or more of the tax
periods covered by the initial request.
D. Federal tax information. A taxpayer may be required to provide copies
of his/her federal individual income tax return when the Borough can
show that the federal tax information is reasonably necessary for the
enforcement or collection of an eligible tax and the information is not
available from other sources or the Department of Revenue of the

three years after the due date for payment of the eligible tax or
within one year after actual payment of the eligible tax, whichever
is later.
(3) A tax return filed with the Borough showing an overpayment of tax
shall be deemed to be a written request for a cash refund unless
otherwise indicated on the tax return.

administrative appeal nor to preclude a taxpayer from filing a
petition for an administrative appeal.
(5) Where a taxpayer has been notified of an overpayment of an
eligible tax, a written request for refund shall be filed with the
Borough within one year of the date of the payment.
(6) This refund process is separate and apart from the petition for
administrative appeal process.

interest from the date of overpayment until the date of resolution.

D. It is the intent of this provision that no person shall pay more than $52
in any calendar year as a local services tax, irrespective of the number
of political subdivisions within which such person may be employed
within any given calendar year. In case of dispute, a tax receipt of the
taxing authority for that calendar year declaring that the taxpayer has
made prior payment constitutes prima facie certification of payment to
all other political subdivisions. [Amended 9-28-2011 by Ord. No.

Revenue, shall provide by regulation for the filing of adjusted
declarations of estimated net profits and for the payments of

declaration required under this subsection anticipates
additional net profits not previously declared or has
overestimated anticipated net profits.

The primary purpose of this article is to conform the local income tax
currently levied on earned income and net profits by the municipality with

prior ordinance levying such tax is hereby amended and restated in its
entirety to read as set forth in this article. To the extent that any previous
ordinance or portion thereof is inconsistent or conflicts with this article,
such ordinance(s) or portion thereof shall be repealed to the extent of such
inconsistency and/or conflict. To the extent that any prior ordinance levying
such tax was in force immediately prior to enactment of this article, this
article is intended as a continuation of such prior ordinance and not as the
enactment of an ordinance imposing a new tax. In the event this article
or any portion thereof is determined to be unconstitutional or otherwise
invalid, the prior ordinance, or portion thereof, levying a similar tax shall
remain in full force and effect and shall not be affected by the adoption
of this article. Nothing contained herein shall affect, impair or otherwise
abrogate any act done or liability incurred, nor shall any provision of this
article affect, impair or preclude any suit or prosecution pending, whether
or not currently initiated, to enforce any right, penalty or violation under
the authority or any previous ordinance in force prior to adoption of this
article.

The effective date of this article and beginning of the initial current year
shall be January 1, 2012.

Collection Schedule,137 attached hereto and made a part hereof, to be
imposed by the designated Tax Officer for the collection of taxes on
earned income and net profits upon any taxpayer whose taxes are or
become delinquent and/or remain due and unpaid; provided, however,
that the TCC may approve amendments to said fee schedule by
resolution from time to time. Amendments to the collection schedule
shall become effective upon adoption by the TCC. The designated Tax
Officer is hereby authorized to retain such costs of collection as set
forth in the attached schedule, as may be amended and supplemented
from time to time, in recovering delinquent taxes and as permitted to be
assessed to delinquent taxpayers pursuant to law.
137. Editor's Note: Said schedule is on file in the Borough offices.

RESIDENT  An individual who occupies real estate within the
Borough where such real estate is used as said individual's principal

B. Application process.
(1) Fees. The application for the erection of a permanent or temporary
handicapped parking space shall be made available to any Borough
resident (or the parent, guardian or legal representative of a
Borough resident) and when submitted shall be accompanied by a
fee of $50. An annual renewal fee of $10 shall apply to all permits
renewed under Subsection D below. Fees may be waived if the
applicant falls within the Federal Housing and Urban Development
Poverty Guidelines.
(2) Application. The application will be designed and developed by the
Parking Review Committee, but shall include, at a minimum, the
identity of the applicant, the address of the applicant's residence,
the make, model and license plate number of the applicant's vehicle
(if any), the applicant's disability, whether the disability is
permanent or temporary, whether off-street parking is available
immediately adjacent to or on the applicant's property, the location
of any current handicapped parking spaces on the same block
where the applicant resides, and a signature section. The
application shall also contain a clause informing the applicant that
the applicant is required to notify the Borough Manager
immediately if and when the applicant moves from the address set
forth on the application or no longer has a disability or no longer
possesses a valid handicapped registration plate or placard. If the
applicant is applying to have the fee waived due to economic
hardship, the applicant must provide documentation that their
§ 346-13.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 346-13.1
1:699
income falls within the Federal Housing and Urban Development
Poverty Guidelines. Upon receipt of an application from a
handicapped or disabled individual (or such person's parent,
guardian or legal representative), the Parking Review Committee
may collect such relevant information as the Committee deems
necessary to evaluate the application, including medical records
evidencing the applicant's disability.
C. Eligibility.
(1) After acquiring a handicapped or disabled veteran's registration
plate or placard from the Department, any Borough resident may
file an application for the creation of a handicapped parking space
upon the block on which the resident resides. The possession of a
handicapped or disabled veteran's registration plate or placard
does not guarantee that the resident's application for a
handicapped parking space will be granted.
(2) Statement of disability. All applications for a handicapped parking
space must be supported by proof of the applicant's asserted
disability from a medical doctor, doctor of osteopathy, or doctor of
podiatry medicine (collectively, "physician"). The application shall
include a statement by a physician, which shall be signed by the
physician and which statement shall not be issued more than six
months prior to the date of the application. Said physician's
statement shall specifically set forth the nature of the applicant's
disability, how the disability limits the applicant's mobility, and the
estimated duration of the applicant's disability. Notwithstanding
the applicant's provision of a physician's statement of disability, the
Parking Review Committee may require the applicant to provide
additional medical records evidencing the applicant's ongoing
disability.
(3) Criteria. In order to provide an adequate number of handicapped
parking spaces in a particular block and to preserve adequate
parking spaces for all Borough residents, before the Borough
creates a handicapped parking space, the Parking Review
Committee must determine that the limitations upon the number
and placement of handicapped parking spaces on a particular block
set forth in Subsection C(4) hereof will not be exceeded if the
requested handicapped parking space is created, that the applicant
has proven that there is no handicapped accessible off-street
parking available to the applicant, and that the applicant meets one
or more of the following criteria:
(a) The applicant is medically required to use portable oxygen;
(b) The applicant has limited or no use of one or both legs;
(c) The applicant suffers from severe limitation in the ability to
walk due to any arthritic, neurological or orthopedic condition
§ 346-13.1 HANOVER CODE § 346-13.1
1:700
or any physical ailment that prevents the applicant from
walking 200 feet without stopping to rest;
(d) The applicant suffers from a serious cardiac condition to the
extent that the person's functional limitations are classified in
severity as Class III or Class IV according to the standards set
by the American Heart Association; or
(e) The applicant suffers from any other physical or mental
impairment not heretofore mentioned which constitutes a
substantial degree of disability and imposes great difficulty on
the applicant walking more than 200 feet without stopping.
(4) Final determination.
(a) After collecting all pertinent information, the Parking Review
Committee will review and investigate all information related
to the application. The Parking Review Committee may obtain
an independent medical review of the applicant's medical
records and asserted disability. If the Parking Review
Committee determines the applicant has met the requirements
of this section, the Parking Review Committee may approve
and authorize the creation of the handicapped parking space
and installation of signage in accordance with applicable state
laws and regulations and shall define the duration of its
validity. In the event the Parking Review Committee
determines the applicant has not met the requirements of this
article, the Parking Review Committee shall deny the
application and inform the applicant, in writing, of the denial
and the reason(s) for the denial. The applicant may appeal the
decision of the Committee to Borough Council, which shall
consider such appeal pursuant to the provisions of the Local
Agency Law.152 Upon approval for a handicap parking space,
the applicant shall pay to the Borough $185 to cover the cost of
material and labor to erect the handicapped parking sign and
paint the appropriate markings within the street right-of-way.
In addition, the applicant shall pay to the Borough $100, which
will be held in escrow by the Borough to pay the costs of
removal of the sign and street painting when same are no
longer authorized.
(b) Fees described in § 346-13.1B(1) and C(4) are based upon
reasonable estimates of the cost of labor and material to
complete the tasks for which the fee is charged. The charges
shall be subject to change to reflect increases or decreases in
the cost of such labor and materials upon resolution of the
Borough Council enacted from time to time.
152. Editor's Note: See 2 Pa.C.S.A. § 551 et seq.
§ 346-13.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 346-13.1
1:701
(5) Nonexclusive right. If a handicapped parking space is created
under this section, the handicapped parking space so created may
be used by any person parking a vehicle lawfully bearing
registration plates or placards issued to handicapped persons or
disabled veterans. The decision to approve the creation of a
handicapped parking space shall not be construed as granting the
applicant the exclusive right to park his/her vehicle in the
handicapped parking space created hereunder.
(6) Other parking regulations. Nothing in this chapter shall exempt
handicapped individuals from other parking restrictions or
regulations applicable to the space/block.
D. Limitation on number of handicapped parking spaces. The Parking
Review Committee shall not authorize handicapped parking space(s) in
excess of the limitations set forth below.
(1) Central Business District. No additional handicapped parking
spaces may be granted by the Parking Review Committee within
the Central Business District, as defined by the Zoning
Ordinance153 of the Borough. The Director of Public Works may
direct the installation of a handicapped parking space within the
Central District as he/she deems appropriate to ensure adequate
and convenient parking for handicapped persons and the general
public. In making such determinations, the Public Works Director
shall consider all relevant factors that the Parking Review
Committee must consider pursuant hereto.
(2) One-way roadways. When the roadway is a one-way roadway, no
more than two handicapped parking spaces may be granted on
each side of the block on which parking is permitted.
(3) Two-way roads. When the roadway is a two-way street, no more
than three handicapped parking spaces may be granted on each
side of the block on which parking is permitted.
(4) Other parking restrictions. The Parking Review Committee may
consider other parking restrictions applicable to a particular block
and other information regarding the block, including, but not
limited to, the size of the block and existing limitations or
restrictions on parking in the area and may further restrict the
number of handicapped parking spaces to maintain an adequate
number of unregulated parking spaces, as it deems appropriate.
(5) Council action. Borough Council may authorize more than the
maximum number of handicapped parking spaces on a particular
block by ordinance, setting forth the block which is excluded from
the above limitations and the maximum number of handicapped
parking spaces permitted on that particular block. Any such
ordinance shall expire and be of no further force and effect after
153. Editor's Note: See Ch. 370, Zoning.
§ 346-13.1 HANOVER CODE § 346-13.1
1:702
the expiration of two years from the effective date of the amending
ordinance, unless reenacted by Council. The Parking Review
Committee shall notify each applicant on the subject block no more
than 90 days and no less than 60 days prior to the expiration of
such ordinance.
(6) Existing handicapped parking spaces in excess of the limitations
set forth in this section and existing on the effective date of this
section shall be permitted to remain in place, subject to annual
review by the Parking Review Committee and/or review by the
Committee in response to a complaint of misuse or lack of need
therefor. Applicants for preexisting handicapped parking spaces
shall be notified of the obligation for an annual review of the grant
of the handicapped parking space and of the obligation to notify the
Borough of a change of circumstances resulting in the absence of a
need for the handicapped parking space as set forth in Subsection
B(2) above.
(7) In designating a handicapped parking space, the Parking Review
Committee and the Director of Public Works shall confirm that the
space to be designated and any access isles shall be level, with
surface slopes not exceeding 1:50 (2%) in all directions.
E. Placement of signs.
(1) Generally. For a single application for a handicapped parking
space, sign and road marking placements will be positioned as
close as possible to the place of residence of the applicant as the
street design and existing street features permit. In the event more
than the permissible number of handicapped parking spaces are
requested on a one- or two-way roadway, the handicapped parking
spaces may be relocated in the center of the block or otherwise
adequately positioned to collectively reflect, as a whole, the needs
of all applicants, as determined by the Parking Review Committee.
(2) Authority to post. The Director of the Department of Public Works
will direct all postings, sign removal and replacements of
handicapped parking space in accordance with Department rules
and regulations. The Department of Public Works will report the
posting or removal of handicapped parking signs and road
markings and all actions taken upon applications for handicapped
parking spaces to the Parking Review Committee.
(3) Disputes regarding sign placement. The Parking Review
Committee shall be responsible for investigating Borough and
citizen complaints regarding the placement of handicapped
parking signs and the Parking Review Committee shall require that
all complaints be in writing and it shall conduct an investigation of
the complaint within 90 calendar days after receiving a complaint.
Upon conducting an investigation, the Parking Review Committee
shall report the complaint, its investigation and its findings in a
§ 346-13.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 346-13.1
1:703
manner it deems just and appropriate, including, but not limited to,
the removal of the handicapped parking space. The complainant,
block residents, applicant and the Borough shall be entitled to
present evidence to the Parking Review Committee.
F. Annual reporting.
(1) Annual reporting. After approval of the application, the applicant
shall submit an annual renewal application. The renewal
application shall be designed by the Parking Review Committee
and require the applicant to verify the continuance of his/her
disability. The Parking Review Committee shall require an
applicant to submit an updated physician's statement of the
applicant's disability, based on the criteria set forth under the
Eligibility and Determination subsections of this chapter. The
Parking Review Committee may require the applicant to submit
medical records, other than a physician's statement, which
evidences the applicant's ongoing disability. In January of each
year, the Parking Review Committee shall mail to (via regular first
class mail) each applicant (and applicants under prior rules and
regulations) the renewal application referenced herein. If the
applicant fails to submit the renewal application, including the
physician's statement of disability and additional medical records
(if such records are requested) by March 15 of that year or the
applicant is no longer eligible for a handicapped parking space, the
Parking Review Committee shall inform the Director of Public
Works that the handicapped parking space should be removed. The
Parking Review Committee may obtain an independent medical
review of the applicant's medical records. The Parking Review
Committee shall give written notice of its determination that the
applicant is no longer eligible for a handicapped parking space to
the applicant within 30 days of the Borough's receipt of the renewal
application. The applicant may appeal the determination of the
Parking Review Committee to Borough Council, which shall
consider such appeal pursuant to the provisions of the Local
Agency Law.
G. Penalties for violations.
(1) False statements. It shall be unlawful for any person to knowingly
and willfully, with the intent to deceive, make a false statement to
any public official for the purpose of obtaining a handicapped
parking space. Any person who violates this provision shall be
guilty of committing a summary offense and, upon conviction
thereof, shall be fined not less than $500, nor more than $1,000,
plus court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred by the
Borough in the enforcement proceedings.
(2) Violations. Any person who violates any other provision of this
chapter shall be guilty of committing a summary offense and, upon
conviction thereof, shall be subject to a criminal fine not to exceed
§ 346-13.1 HANOVER CODE § 346-13.1

B. Purpose. The Hanover Borough Council has determined that hazardous

exist because large vehicles are often parked on streets in the Borough.
These hazardous and unsafe traffic conditions create a nuisance and
are detrimental to the public health, safety and welfare of the residents
of the Borough of Hanover and others, impede emergency vehicles
(including fire trucks, ambulances, etc.) and interfere with the peaceful
and quiet enjoyment of the residents of Hanover Borough in their
homes and neighborhoods. The Borough Council has determined that
the adoption of this article is necessary to remediate the foregoing.
A. Parking of large vehicles prohibited.
(1) No person shall park, cause to be parked, or permit to be parked
any large vehicle on any street within the municipal limits of the

any truck or truck trailer or tri-axle vehicle for the purpose of the
delivery or pickup of merchandise, material, or goods provided that
the parking of said vehicle shall terminate immediately upon
conclusion of the delivery or pickup of merchandise, material or
goods.
(4) A large vehicle may be stored, unoccupied, upon private property,
including but not limited to storage on private roads owned by or
leased to the owner of such large vehicle. All such stored large
vehicles must be located on the side or rear of the property on a
crushed stone, black top or concrete surface capable of supporting
the vehicle. All parking areas and access roads or areas that are
created or expanded after the adoption of this article shall be
constructed of a hard, homogeneous, all-weather surface such as
cement or asphalt or equivalent; shall be graded to provide
convenient vehicular access and proper drainage; and shall be
maintained in good and usable condition. All existing parking areas
and access roads or areas shall be constructed and maintained with
an aggregate base, cement or asphalt all-weather surface. The

this article which are contradictory to the terms hereof are hereby
revoked and rendered null and void.
B. The provisions of this article, as far as they are the same as those of
ordinances in force immediately prior to the enactment of this article,
are intended as a continuation of such ordinances and not as new
enactments. The provisions of this article shall not affect any suit or
prosecution pending to enforce any right or penalty or to punish any
offense under the authority of any ordinance in effect at the time of the
passage of this article.
C. The provisions of this article are severable, and if any of its provisions
shall be held to be unconstitutional, illegal, or invalid, such decision
shall not affect the validity of any of the remaining provisions of this
article. It is hereby declared as the legislative intent that this article
would have been adopted had such unconstitutional, illegal, or invalid
provision not been included herein.
A. Any person who violates the provisions of this article shall be subject to
a summary criminal proceeding before the magisterial district justice
as provided by the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure, as may be
amended from time to time. Upon finding of a violation, a fine shall be
imposed of not less than $100 nor more than $500, together with court
costs and reasonable attorney fees incurred by the Borough of Hanover
in prosecution of the violation. Any person who fails to pay the fines,

property, purpose or person is not transferable to another property,
purpose or water user without prior written approval from the public
water supplier.

§ 355-10. Effective date; amendments.
This article shall become effective the 11th day of December 2002. The
Borough reserves the right to make changes from time to time as, in its
opinion, may be desirable or beneficial and to amend this article in such
manner and at such times, as in its opinion, may be desirable.
A. The Emergency Management Services Code (35 Pa.C.S.A. § 7101 et
seq.) does not allow the Borough of Hanover/Hanover Municipal Water
Works to take actions, such as water rationing, to deal with natural
resource shortages on their own. The Code provides for the governor to
declare such an emergency.
B. Water rationing is a severe action dictated at the local level due to
seriously depleted water supplies that threaten public health and safety
and the general welfare of the impacted community.
C. A stand-alone local water rationing plan for the service area of the
Borough of Hanover/Hanover Municipal Water Works has been
prepared as a separate document.
D. If the Governor has the service area of the Borough of Hanover/
Hanover Municipal Water Works under a proclamation, a written
request will be made to the Commonwealth Drought Coordinator to
consider and approve implementing the rationing plan.
E. If a Governor's proclamation does not cover the service area of the
Borough of Hanover/Hanover Municipal Water Works, the following
procedure will be followed:
(1) A request will be made to the Commonwealth Drought Coordinator
who will determine whether or not the request, together with other
available information, establishes the existence of a water shortage
emergency that will require the Governor to issue a proclamation
declaring a state of local drought or water shortage emergency for
the affected area, and will make a recommendation to PEMA.
(2) If PEMA concurs in the existence of a local water shortage
emergency, PEMA will submit to the Governor a proposed
proclamation to declare a state of local drought or water shortage
emergency for the affected area described in the proclamation.
(3) After the Governor signs the proclamation, PEMA will notify the
Commonwealth Drought Coordinator that the plan may be
approved and put into effect.

required to be paid in advance of the movement of its wires; and
the grantee is given not less than 10 business days' advance written
notice to arrange for such temporary relocation.

operation, maintenance, or repair of the cable system, the grantee

such public way to a condition reasonably comparable to the

municipal utilities are both aerial and underground, the grantee

nor any other person, shall discriminate or permit discrimination

provided in connection with the cable system in the franchise area. It

on the cable system so long as such person's financial or other
obligations to the grantee are satisfied.
C. Prohibition against reselling service. No person shall resell, without the
express prior written consent of the grantee, any cable service,
program or signal transmitted over the cable system by the grantee.
A. Customer service standards. The franchising authority hereby adopts
the customer service standards set forth in Part 76 of the FCC's rules
and regulations (47 CFR 76.309). The grantee shall comply in all
respects with the customer service requirements established by the
FCC.
B. Customer bills. Customer bills shall be designed in such a way as to
present the information contained therein clearly and comprehensibly
to customers, and in a way that is not misleading and does not omit
material information. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
Subsection A above, the grantee may, in its sole discretion, consolidate
costs on customer bills as may otherwise be permitted by Section
622(c) of the Cable Act [47 U.S.C. § 542(c)].
C. Privacy protection. The grantee shall comply with all applicable federal
and state privacy laws, including Section 631 of the Cable Act (47
U.S.C. § 551) and regulations adopted pursuant thereto.
A. Oversight of franchise. In accordance with applicable law, the
franchising authority shall have the right to oversee, regulate and, on
reasonable prior written notice and in the presence of the grantee's
employees, periodically inspect the construction, operation and
maintenance of the cable system in the franchise area, and all parts
thereof, as necessary to monitor the grantee's compliance with the
provisions of this franchise agreement.
B. Technical standards. The grantee shall comply with all applicable
technical standards of the FCC as published in Subpart K of 47 CFR 76.
To the extent those standards are altered, modified, or amended during
§ A402-48 GENERAL PROVISIONS § A402-51
1:823
the term of this franchise, the grantee shall comply with such altered,
modified or amended standards within a reasonable period after such
standards become effective. The franchising authority shall have, upon
written request, the right to obtain a copy of tests and records required
to be performed pursuant to the FCC's rules.
C. Maintenance of books, records, and files.
(1) Books and records. Throughout the term of this franchise
agreement, the grantee agrees that the franchising authority, upon
reasonable prior written notice to the grantee, may review such of
the grantee's books and records regarding the operation of the
cable system and the provision of cable service in the franchise
area which are reasonably necessary to monitor grantee's
compliance with the provisions of this franchise agreement at the
grantee's business office, during normal business hours, and
without unreasonably interfering with grantee's business
operations. Such books and records shall include any records
required to be kept in a public file by the grantee pursuant to the
rules and regulations of the FCC. All such documents pertaining to
financial matters that may be the subject of an inspection by the
franchising authority shall be retained by the grantee for a
minimum period of three years.
(2) File for public inspection. Throughout the term of this franchise
agreement, the grantee shall maintain at its business office, in a file
available for public inspection during normal business hours, those
documents required pursuant to the FCC's rules and regulations.
(3) Proprietary information. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in this section, the grantee shall not be required to
disclose information which it reasonably deems to be proprietary or
confidential in nature. The franchising authority agrees to treat any
information disclosed by the grantee as confidential and only to
disclose it to those employees, representatives, and agents of the
franchising authority that have a need to know in order to enforce
this franchise agreement and who agree to maintain the
confidentiality of all such information. The grantee shall not be
required to provide customer information in violation of Section
631 of the Cable Act (47 U.S.C. § 551) or any other applicable
federal or state privacy law. For purposes of this section, the terms
"proprietary" or "confidential" include, but are not limited to,
information relating to the cable system design, customer lists,
marketing plans, financial information unrelated to the calculation
of franchise fees or rates pursuant to FCC rules, or other
information that is reasonably determined by the grantee to be
competitively sensitive. In the event that the franchising authority
receives a request under a state "sunshine," public records or
similar law for the disclosure of information the grantee has
designated as confidential, a trade secret or proprietary, the
franchising authority shall promptly notify the grantee of such

8-28-2019 by Res. No. 1264]
No transfer of control of Comcast, defined as an acquisition of 51% or
greater direct ownership interest in Comcast, shall take place without prior
written notice to the Borough. No notice shall be required, however, for the
following: a transfer in trust, by mortgage, hypothecation, or by assignment
of any rights, title, or interest of the Comcast in the franchise or in the cable
system in order to secure indebtedness; or a transfer to an entity directly or
indirectly owned or controlled by Comcast.

request and cooperate with the grantee in its efforts to protect its
rights.
A. Insurance. Throughout the term of this franchise agreement, the
grantee shall, at its own cost and expense, maintain comprehensive
general liability insurance and provide the franchising authority
certificates of insurance designating the franchising authority and its
officers, boards, commissions, councils, elected officials, agents and
employees as additional insureds and demonstrating that the grantee
has obtained the insurance required in this section. Such policy or
policies shall be in the minimum amount of $1,000,000 for bodily injury
or death to any one person, and $1,000,000 for bodily injury or death of
any two or more persons resulting from one occurrence, and
$1,000,000 for property damage resulting from any one accident. Such
policy or policies shall be noncancelable except upon 30 days' prior
written notice to the franchising authority. The grantee shall provide
workers compensation coverage in accordance with applicable law. The
grantee shall indemnify and hold harmless the franchising authority
from any workers compensation claims to which the grantee may
become subject during the term of this franchise agreement.
B. Indemnification. The grantee shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless
the franchising authority, its officers, employees, and agents from and
against any liability or claims resulting from property damage or bodily
injury (including accidental death) that arise out of the grantee's
construction, operation, maintenance or removal of the cable system,
including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees, provided that
the franchising authority shall give the grantee written notice of its
obligation to indemnify and defend the franchising authority within 10
business days of receipt of a claim or action pursuant to this section. If
the franchising authority determines that it is necessary for it to employ
separate counsel, the costs for such separate counsel shall be the
responsibility of the franchising authority.
§ A402-51 GENERAL PROVISIONS § A402-54
1:825
§ A402-55. Notice of violation; enforcement; termination of
franchise; technical violations.
A. System capacity. During the term of this agreement, grantee's cable
system shall be capable of providing a wide variety of video
programming choices, including two-way interactive service, with
reception available to its customers in the franchise area in accordance
with FCC technical standards.
B. Service to school buildings. The grantee shall provide free "basic" and
"expanded basic" tier cable service and free installation at one outlet to
each public K-12 school; and each nonpublic K-12 school that receives
funding pursuant to Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education
Act of 1965, 20 U.S.C. § 6301 et seq., as amended, not including home
schools, located in the franchise area within 125 feet of the grantee's
distribution cable.
C. Service to governmental and institutional facilities. The grantee shall
provide free "basic" and "expanded basic" tier cable service and free
installation at one outlet to each municipal building located in the
franchise area within 125 feet of the grantee's distribution cable.
"Municipal buildings" are those buildings owned or leased by the
franchising authority for government administrative purposes, and
shall not include buildings owned by the franchising authority but
leased to third parties or buildings such as storage facilities at which
government employees are not regularly stationed.
A. Notice of violation or default. In the event the franchising authority
believes that the grantee has not complied with the material terms of
the franchise, it shall notify the grantee, in writing, with specific details
regarding the exact nature of the alleged noncompliance or default.
B. Grantee's right to cure or respond. The grantee shall have 45 days from
the receipt of the franchising authority's written notice to respond to
the franchising authority, contesting the assertion of noncompliance or
default; or to cure such default; or in the event that, by nature of the
default, such default cannot be cured within the forty-five-day period,
initiate reasonable steps to remedy such default and notify the
franchising authority of the steps being taken and the projected date
that they will be completed.
C. Public hearings. In the event the grantee fails to respond to the
franchising authority's notice or in the event that the alleged default is
not remedied within 60 days or the date projected by the grantee, the
franchising authority may schedule a public hearing to investigate the
default. Such public hearing shall be held at the next regularly
scheduled meeting of the franchising authority that is scheduled at a
time that is no less than 10 business days therefrom. The franchising
authority shall notify the grantee, in writing, of the time and place of
such meeting and provide the grantee with a reasonable opportunity to
be heard.
§ A402-54 HANOVER CODE § A402-55
1:826
D. Enforcement. Subject to applicable federal and state law, in the event
the franchising authority, after such public hearing, determines that the
grantee is in default of any provision of the franchise, the franchising
authority may:
(1) Seek specific performance of any provision that reasonably lends
itself to such remedy as an alternative to damages, or seek other
equitable relief; or
(2) In the case of a substantial default of a material provision of the
franchise, declare the franchise agreement to be revoked in
accordance with the following:
(a) The franchising authority shall give written notice to the
grantee of its intent to revoke the franchise on the basis of a
pattern of noncompliance by the grantee, including one or
more instances of substantial noncompliance with a material
provision of the franchise. The notice shall set forth with
specificity the exact nature of the noncompliance. The grantee
shall have 90 days from the receipt of such notice to object in
writing and to state its reasons for such objection. In the event
the franchising authority has not received a response from the
grantee or upon receipt of the response does not agree with
the grantee's proposed remedy, it may then seek termination of
the franchise at a public hearing. The franchising authority
shall cause to be served upon the grantee, at least 10 days
prior to such public hearing, a written notice specifying the
time and place of such hearing and stating its intent to request
termination of the franchise.
(b) At the designated hearing, the franchising authority shall give
the grantee an opportunity to state its position on the matter,
present evidence and question witnesses, after which it shall
determine whether or not the franchise shall be revoked. The
public hearing shall be on the record and a written transcript
shall be made available to the grantee within 10 business days.
The decision of the franchising authority shall be in writing and
shall be delivered to the grantee by certified mail. The grantee
may appeal such determination to an appropriate court, which
shall have the power to review the decision of the franchising
authority de novo and to modify or reverse such decision as
justice may require. Such appeal to the appropriate court must
be taken within 60 days of the issuance of the determination of
the franchising authority.
E. Technical violation. The franchising authority agrees that it is not its
intention to subject the grantee to penalties, fines, forfeitures or
revocation of the franchise for so-called "technical" breach(es) or
violation(s) of the franchise, which shall include, but not be limited, to
the following:
§ A402-55 GENERAL PROVISIONS § A402-55
1:827
§ A402-56. Miscellaneous provisions.
(1) In instances or for matters where a violation or a breach of the
franchise by the grantee was a good faith error that resulted in no
or minimal negative impact on the customers within the franchise
area; or
(2) Where there existed circumstances reasonably beyond the control
of the grantee and which precipitated a violation by the grantee of
the franchise, or which were deemed to have prevented the grantee
from complying with a term or condition of the franchise.
A. Force majeure. The grantee shall not be held in default under, or in
noncompliance with, the provisions of the franchise, nor suffer any
enforcement or penalty relating to noncompliance or default (including
termination, cancellation or revocation of the franchise), where such
noncompliance or alleged defaults occurred or were caused by strike,
riot, war, earthquake, flood, tidal wave, unusually severe rain or snow
storm, hurricane, tornado or other catastrophic act of nature, labor
disputes, failure of utility service necessary to operate the cable system,
governmental, administrative or judicial order or regulation or other
event that is reasonably beyond the grantee's ability to anticipate or
control. This provision also covers work delays caused by waiting for
utility providers to service or monitor their own utility poles on which
the grantee's cable or equipment is attached, as well as unavailability of
materials or qualified labor to perform the work necessary.
B. Notice. All notices shall be in writing and shall be sufficiently given and
served upon the other party by hand delivery, first-class mail, registered
or certified, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, or by reputable
overnight courier service and addressed as follows:

C. Entire agreement. This franchise agreement, including all exhibits,
embodies the entire understanding and agreement of the franchising
authority and the grantee with respect to the subject matter hereof and
supersedes all prior understandings, agreements and communications,
whether written or oral. All ordinances or parts of ordinances that are
in conflict with the provisions of this franchise agreement are
superseded by this franchise agreement.
D. Governing law. This franchise agreement shall be deemed to be
executed in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and shall be governed
in all respects, including validity, interpretation and effect, and
construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania, as applicable to contracts entered into and performed
entirely within the commonwealth.
E. Modification. No provision of this franchise agreement shall be
amended or otherwise modified, in whole or in part, except by an
instrument, in writing, duly executed by the franchising authority and
the grantee, which amendment shall be authorized on behalf of the
franchising authority through the adoption of an appropriate resolution
or order by the franchising authority, as required by applicable law.
F. No third-party beneficiaries. Nothing in this franchise agreement is or
was intended to confer third-party beneficiary status on any member of

G. No waiver of rights. Nothing in this franchise agreement shall be
construed as a waiver of any rights, substantive or procedural, grantee

A. Comcast shall pay to the Borough an amount equal to 3% of the gross
revenue derived from the operation of its cable system to provide cable
service in the Borough. Comcast shall not deduct or otherwise credit
against the franchise fee any tax, fee or assessment of general
applicability. The Borough may amend the franchise fee solely to reduce
the franchise fee percentage upon written notice to Comcast. A copy of
the resolution or ordinance authorizing the franchise fee adjustment by
the Borough shall accompany such written notice. Any change in
Comcast's franchise fee obligation contained herein shall commence

B. Franchise fee payments to the Borough under this provision shall be
computed at the end of each calendar quarter. Such payments shall be

calendar quarters and 60 days after the fourth calendar quarter.
Specifically, payments shall be due and payable on or before May 15
(for the first quarter), August 15 (for the second quarter), November 15
(for the third quarter), and March 1 (for the fourth quarter). In the
event that any franchise fee payment is not made on or before the date
by which it is due, then interest calculated at the then-current prime
rate, as published by the Wall Street Journal, shall be added to the
amount of franchise fee revenue due to the Borough. The interest rate
shall be applied as described from the date such franchise fee payment
was originally due. No acceptance of any payment shall be construed as
an accord that the amount paid is in fact the correct amount, nor shall
acceptance of any payment be construed as a release of any claim the
Borough may have for additional sums payable under this agreement.
C. Within 10 days of each franchise fee payment described herein,
Comcast shall provide a written report containing an accurate
statement of Comcast's gross revenue received for cable services for
each calendar quarter in connection with the operation of Comcast's
cable system and showing the basis for the computation of fees.
Specifically, the report shall contain line items for sources of revenue
received and the amount of revenue received from each source. The
report shall be verified by a financial representative of Comcast.

PENALTY ASSESSMENT FOR VIOLATION OF PRETREATMENT
STANDARDS
GENERAL REFERENCES
Sewers and sewage disposal  See Ch. 286. Sewer use regulations  See Ch. 290.
§ A403-1. Purpose.
The purpose of this policy is to establish procedures whereby the Borough
of Hanover may directly levy civil penalties in a manner consistent with the
Pennsylvania Penalty Law for Publicly Owned Treatment Works.
§ A403-2. Method of determination.
A. The following is the basis for determining an administrative or civil
penalty to be issued by the Borough of Hanover for violation(s) of
pretreatment standards and/or requirements. The maximum fine to be
assessed is $25,000 per day, per violation. Each day that a violation
shall continue will be considered as a separate violation.
B. The formula for calculation of an assessment is as follows:
Fine = (Cvf + 1,000 Evf + 1,000 Avf) (1.0 + Bvf + Dvf) ± Fvf
Where:
Avf = Value factor assessed for damage to air, water, land or
other natural resources and their uses
Bvf = Value factor assessed for the magnitude of the cost of
restoration
Cvf = Savings to the violator as a consequence of the violation
Dvf = Value factor assessed for the history of past violations
Evf = Value factor assessed for the deterrence of future
violations
Fvf = Value factor assessed for other relevant factors
(1) The value factor for Avf shall be a value between one and a value
that results in the statutory maximum penalty. This value may be
applied to each month in which one or more violations present
actual harm to human health or to the environment. If no actual
harm is incurred, this factor is zero. Where evidence of actual harm
to human health exists, a factor from 10 to a value which results in
the statutory maximum penalty should be assessed. Where the
identified impact relates only to the environment, a factor from one
to 10 should be used.
§ A402-57 GENERAL PROVISIONS § A403-2
1:831
(2) The magnitude of the cost of restoration shall be determined on a
case-by-case basis. The value may range from zero to a number
high enough to increase the penalty by 150%.
(3) Savings to the violator shall be based on the benefit gained from
delaying expenditures and avoiding costs. This shall be determined
on a case-by-case basis. A comparison of costs that should have
been incurred, from the start of noncompliance to achieve
compliance, versus present value shall be made.
(4) Based on the history of violations, including the recalcitrance of the
defendant, the value for this factor may range from zero (good
compliance, active cooperation in remedying the violation), to a
factor that will result in a 150% increase in the penalty (bad faith,
unjustified delay in preventing, correcting or mitigating violations,
violations of prior administrative orders or consent decrees, failure
to provide timely and full information, etc.). Significance of the
violation will be taken into account. Pollutants classified as
conventional shall have a minimum factor of one; pollutants
classified as toxic shall have a minimum factor of two. The
classification of pollutants shall be consistent with the definitions
outlined in the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (the Act).167
Toxic pollutants shall be those listed and designated pursuant to
Section 307(a)(1) of the Act. Conventional pollutants shall be those
listed and designated pursuant to Section 304(a)(4) of the Act.
(5) Deterrence factor.
(a) The value factor assessed for the deterrence of future
violations shall be calculated for each month in which a
violation is present. It shall be based on the value assigned for
the percent the pollutant exceeds the permit limitation. A
distinction is made between the conventional pollutants
[Section 304(a)(4) of the Act], and toxic pollutants [Section
307(a)(1) of the Act].
Percent Exceedance Toxic Conventional
0 to 20 0 to 2 0 to 1
21 to 40 1 to 3 1 to 2
41 to 100 2 to 5 2 to 4
101 or more 3 to 7 3 to 5
(b) The value added shall be the highest value based upon
assessment of each of the permit limitations exceeded in each
month.
(6) The value factor for F shall consist of all other factors of the
violation which have not been addressed in this policy. This factor
167. Editor's Note: See 33 U.S.C. § 1251 et seq.
§ A403-2 HANOVER CODE § A403-2
1:832
§ A403-3. Notice of fine.
The penalty assessment determined in accordance with this policy shall be
assessed on the user in the form of a notice of fine. The date payable shall
be 30 days from the date of receipt by the user. The fine is payable directly
to the Borough of Hanover. The user may appeal the fine in accordance
with the most recent edition of the Borough of Hanover's Fine Assessment
Appeal Policy.
§ A403-4. Consent penalty.
A consent penalty may be negotiated between the defendant and the
Borough in lieu of the penalty assessment fine. Negotiated penalties may be
less than that of the original assessment as determined on a case-by-case
basis. Consent penalties shall be incorporated into binding and enforceable
compliance agreements negotiated to achieve timely and effective
correction of the violation. All compliance agreements shall stipulate
further penalties for breach of any terms of the agreement. As consent
penalties are negotiated, all consent penalties agreements shall provide
for the user to knowingly and explicitly waive its right pursuant to 35
P.S. § 752.7(b) or other applicable authority, whether in law or equity, to
appeal or otherwise contest the violation, the amount of the penalty or any
provision of the consent penalty agreement entered into by the user.
§ A403-5. Construal of provisions.
In addition to the penalties and assessments contained herein, nothing in
this policy is to be construed as precluding any other action or remedy
available, in equity or at law, to any person, legal entity or governmental
entity.
§ A403-6. Maximum penalty.
The maximum penalty that may be issued hereunder shall not exceed
$25,000 per day. Each day that a violation shall continue shall be deemed a
separate violation.

Description of Floodplain Areas
The identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific areas:
FW (Floodway Area)  the areas identified as Floodway in the AE Zone in the Flood Insurance Study prepared by the FEMA. The term shall also include floodway areas which have been identified in other available studies or sources of information for those floodplain areas where no floodway has been identified in the Flood Insurance Study.
FF (Flood-Fringe Area)  the remaining portions of the one hundred (100) year floodplain in those areas identified as an AE Zone in the Flood Insurance Study, where a floodway has been delineated.
The basis for the outermost boundary of this area shall be the one hundred (100) year flood elevations as shown in the flood profiles contained in the Flood Insurance Study.
FA (General Floodplain Area)  the areas identified as Zone A in the FIS for which no one hundred (100) year flood elevations have been provided. When available, information from other Federal, State, and other acceptable sources shall be used to determine the one hundred (100) year elevation, as well as a floodway area, if possible. When no other information is available, the one hundred (100) year elevation shall be determined by using a point on the boundary of the identified floodplain area which is nearest the construction site in questions.
In lieu of the above, the municipality may require the applicant to determine the elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering techniques. Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by professional engineers or others of demonstrated qualifications, who shall certify that the technical methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. Studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by the Borough. (Amended Ord. #2152A 9/9/2009)

SECTION 140-135. STANDARD FOR REVIEW OF PROPOSED VARIANCES OR SPECIAL EXCEPTION.
A. Variance. The Board shall hear requests for variances where it is alleged that the provisions of the zoning ordinance inflict unnecessary hardship upon the applicant. Subject to the provisions of Section 801, of Act 247, "Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code," the Board may by rule prescribe the form of application and may require preliminary application to the zoning officer. The Board may grant a variance provided the following findings are made where relevant in a given case:
82
1. That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions, including irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or shape, or exceptional topographical or other physical conditions peculiar to the particular property, and that the unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions, and not the circumstances or conditions generally created by the provisions of the zoning ordinance in the neighborhood or district in which the property is located.
2. That because of such physical circumstances or conditions there is no possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity with the provisions of the zoning ordinance and that the authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of property.
3. That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the appellant.
4. That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is located, nor substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or development of adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the public welfare.
5. That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum variance that will afford relief and will represent the least modification possible of the regulation in issue.
In granting any variance, the Board may attach such reasonable conditions and safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement the purposes of this act and the zoning ordinance.
B. Special Exceptions. Where the provisions of this ordinance provide that the Zoning Hearing Board is to hear and/or decide Special Exceptions to the terms of this ordinance, they shall determine that:
1. The proposed change will not substantially injure or detract from the use of the neighboring property or from the character of the neighborhood, and that the use of the property adjacent to the area included in the proposed change or plan is adequately safeguarded.
2. The use and the operation in connection with the proposed change would be in harmony with the orderly and appropriate development of the zone, giving consideration to:
(a) Location of the use, including location with respect to the existing or future streets giving access to it.
(b) Nature and intensity of the operations involved.
(c) That adequate water, sewer, storm drainage, fire and police
protection are or can be provided for the use.
83
(d) That the use will not create traffic congestion or cause commercial or industrial traffic that would jeopardize public safety.
3. The proposed change will serve the best interests of the Borough, the convenience of the community (where applicable), and the public welfare.
The Zoning Hearing Board may attach such reasonable conditions and safeguards considered necessary to implement the purposes and objectives of this act, to protect the public welfare and the Comprehensive Plan.

Whenever such persons shall have been officially notified by the Zoning Administrative Officer or by service of a summons in a prosecution, or in any other official manner, that he is committing a violation, each day's continuance of such violation after such notification shall constitute a separate offense punishable by a like fine or penalty.
