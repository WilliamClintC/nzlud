PREFACE 
This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Mustang, Oklahoma. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1977 Code, as supplemented through April 16, 1996, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1977 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

CODE APPENDIX 	CDA:1 
CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES 	CCT:1 
STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE 	SLT:1 
CHARTER INDEX 	CHTi:1 
CODE INDEX 	CDi:1 
 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Code Attorney, and Connie Timmons, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Trisha Winham, City Clerk, for her cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that her efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Section 2-13. - Ordinances: Emergency. 
An emergency ordinance is an ordinance which, in the judgment of the Council, is necessary for the immediate preservation of peace, health, or safety, and which should become effective prior to the time when an ordinary ordinance would become effective.

The continued validity of such registration shall be dependent upon the registrant's maintaining a current valid state mechanical license, and the expiration, revocation or suspension of a state mechanical license shall automatically invalidate the registration issued by the city. No person shall continue to engage in mechanical work following such suspension or revocation or otherwise engage in such mechanical work without a valid city registration when such registration is required. 
(b)  Grounds for suspension or revocation. After ten days' notice and adequate opportunity for a hearing, the city council may revoke or suspend a city mechanical registration for any of the following reasons: 
(1)  Making a material misstatement in the application for registration or the renewal of registration; 
(2)  Obtaining any registration by false or fraudulent representation; 
(3)  Loaning or allowing the use of such registration by any other person or illegally using a registration; 
(4)  Demonstrating incompetence to act as a mechanical journeyman or mechanical contractor; 
(5)  Violating any provisions of this article; or 
(6)  Willfully failing to perform normal business obligations without justifiable cause. 
(c)  Procedure for suspension or revocation. A request that the registration be suspended or revoked may be presented to the city council by the community development director, or by any aggrieved person who shall specify the reasons for the request, who shall agree to testify at a hearing and who shall sign such request before a notary public. Failure to perform any of these acts shall invalidate the request as determined by the council. A copy of such request shall be attached to the notice of hearing and provided to the registrant by the city. At the hearing, the registrant may be represented by counsel, may present witnesses in his behalf, and may cross examine other witnesses.

(Ord. No. 1132, § 3, 12-1-2015)  
Sec. 22-155. - Acceptance and effective date of franchise. 
(a)  No franchise granted pursuant to this chapter and passed by the city council or a vote of the qualified electors, as applicable, shall become effective for any purpose unless and until written acceptance thereof shall have been filed with the city clerk, duly executed by the proper officers of the franchisee. Written acceptance, which shall be in the form and substance approved by the municipal counselor, must contain, in addition to any other matters included, the following express representations by the grantee that:

(Ord. No. 1132, § 3, 12-1-2015)  
Sec. 22-156. - Franchise fee. 
(a)  Finding. The city has authority to grant a non-exclusive franchise to a cable television operator for the right to use the public streets, and other public ways, for the purpose of maintaining and operating a cable television business within the city. The business of delivering cable services to the residents of the city is a business affected with a public interest. The construction, installation, maintenance and operation of a cable system involves the occupation of and placement of private commercial facilities in the valuable and scarce public streets and other public ways within the city and which are maintained by the city at a significant cost, and such use is essential to the performance of the general function or purpose of the cable television operator. The city further finds that the grant of a franchise for use of rights-of-way to provide service is a valuable property right without which a grantee would be required to invest substantial capital. 
(b)  A grantee of a franchise hereunder shall pay to the city a franchise fee in an amount to be set by the franchise agreement as a percentage of gross revenues derived from operation of the cable system by the grantee to provide cable service. Such payment shall be in addition to any other payment, charge, permit fee or bond owed to the city by the grantee and shall not be construed as payment in lieu of personal or real property taxes levied by state, county or local authorities; provided, however, such fee shall include and be in lieu of any fee required by the city for any construction, building, or other permit for use or occupation of, or work in, the streets, except for the inspection fee and service charge levied under chapter 42 of this Code. As compensation for the use of valuable public ways and privileges granted to operate a system, and to defray the cost of the regulation, the franchisee shall pay to the city a franchise fee of three percent of the franchisee's gross revenues received from the operation of its system to provide cable service within the city. The city reserves the right to increase the franchise fee up to five percent of the franchisee's gross revenue upon 90 days' notice to the franchisee. Further, in the event the cable act, the FCC rules and regulations or other federal laws are amended to permit the city to assess a franchise fee of a greater amount than stated in this subsection, the city shall have the right to negotiate with the franchisee for an increase in the franchise fee to the maximum then permitted. 
(c)  The franchise fee shall be payable to the city on a quarterly basis and shall be due no later than 45 days after the end of the calendar quarter for which the franchise fee is being calculated. 
(d)  Should FCC, state or federal law or regulation be amended in the future to allow the city to recover fees for services not set forth in the definition of gross revenues set forth in section 22-102, then, in that event, the franchisee shall upon 90 days' written notice commence making the additional payment to the city as legally authorized and to the fullest extent of such authorization. 
(e)  If the franchise fee payment is not received by the city on the due date, the franchisee shall be assessed interest on any delinquency from the due date until paid in full at the rate of 18 percent per annum. If any franchise fee shall be delinquent for more than 90 days, the franchisee shall be deemed in material default and subject to the provisions of this article regarding termination of a franchise. 
(f)  The franchisee shall submit with each payment a report showing the amounts of gross revenues for the preceding quarter on which the franchise fee is determined. Additionally, the franchisee shall submit to the city an annual revenue audit statement within three months of the close of the fiscal year, setting forth the computation of gross revenues for the preceding year and an explanation of the method of computation. The annual statement shall be submitted to the city by a nationally recognized certified public accountant firm. The required reports shall be prepared at the expense of the franchisee on forms reasonably acceptable to the city and certified by the franchisee's chief financial officer or the certified public accountant firm. The same reports shall be due within 90 days of the termination of the franchise. 
(g)  Except as otherwise provided in the cable act and FCC regulations, all payments required by this section shall be in addition to all other fees and payments required to be made by the franchisee to the city. 
(h)  Acceptance by the city of any payment shall not be construed as an accord or satisfaction that such payment is correct, nor shall acceptance be construed as a release of any claim the city may have for additional sums which may be due. 
(i)  The city shall have the right, at its cost and upon reasonable notice, to inspect and audit all books and records of the franchisee which may be necessary for the determination of gross revenues and computation of franchise fees due. If the city determines franchise fees have been underpaid in an amount in excess of three percent, the cost of audit shall be paid by the franchisee. The books and records necessary for such audit shall be maintained by the franchisee in Oklahoma County or Canadian County. 
(Ord. No. 1132, § 3, 12-1-2015)  
Sec. 22-157. - Renewal. 
A franchise granted pursuant to this chapter shall be renewed pursuant to the procedures established by the Cable Act or such other procedure to which the city and a grantee mutually agree. In the event that the city and an existing franchisee cannot agree upon terms for renewal of the franchise agreement, the parties may mutually agree to hold over the current franchise agreement for no more than one year or as otherwise provided for by applicable federal law. 
(Ord. No. 1132, § 3, 12-1-2015)  
Sec. 22-158. - Transfers. 
(a)  No transfer of a franchise shall occur without prior approval of the city, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. 
(b)  An application for a transfer of a franchise shall provide complete information on the proposed transaction, including details on the legal, financial, technical and other qualifications of the transferee, and on the potential impact of the transfer on subscriber rates and service, to the extent required by FCC rules. 
(c)  At least 120 calendar days prior to the contemplated effective date of a transfer, the franchisee shall submit to the city an application, together with any required FCC transfer forms, for approval of the transfer. To the extent consistent with FCC rules, such application and/or the FCC forms shall include the following: 
(1)  A statement of the reason for the contemplated transfer. 
(2)  The name, address and telephone number of the proposed transferee. 
(3)  A detailed statement of the corporate or other business entity organization of the proposed transferee, including, but not limited to, the following: 
a.  The names, business addresses, state of residence and country of citizenship of all general partners and corporate officers of the proposed transferee. 
b.  The names, business addresses, state of residence and country of citizenship of all persons and entities having, controlling or being entitled to have or control ten percent or more of the ownership of the proposed transferee and the respective ownership share of each such person or entity. 
c.  The name and address of any parent or subsidiary of the proposed transferee and of any other business entity owning or controlling in whole or in part, or owned or controlled in whole or in part by the proposed transferee. 
d.  A detailed and complete financial statement or annual report of the proposed transferee, for the three fiscal years immediately preceding the date of the request for transfer approval, or a letter or other acceptable evidence in writing from the proposed transferee's lending institution or funding source, addressed to both the proposed transferee and the city, setting forth a clear statement of its intent as a lending institution or funding source to provide whatever capital shall be required by the proposed transfer to construct, install, maintain and operate the proposed system in the city. If the corporate or business entity organization of the proposed transferee has not been in existence for a full three years, the proposed transferee shall submit a certified financial statement for the period of existence. 
e.  A detailed description of all previous experience of the proposed transferee in operating cable television systems and providing cable television services or related or similar services, including a statement identifying, by place and date, any other cable television franchises awarded to the proposed transferee, its parent, subsidiaries or affiliates currently operating or in the status of transfer; and the status of such franchises with respect to completion thereof. 
f.  Other information the city may reasonably request consistent with FCC regulations. 
(d)  In making a determination on whether to grant an application for a transfer of a franchise, the city council, in good faith, shall consider the legal, financial, technical and other qualifications of the transferee to operate the system; whether the incumbent franchisee is in material compliance with its franchise agreement and this article and, if not, the franchisee's or proposed transferee's commitment to cure such material noncompliance; and whether operation by the transferee would adversely affect cable service to subscribers, or otherwise be contrary to the public interest. 
(e)  No application for a transfer of a franchise shall be granted unless the transferee agrees in writing that it will abide by and accept all terms of this article and the franchise agreement, and that it will assume the obligations and liabilities of the previous franchisee under this article and the franchise agreement. 
(f)  Approval by the city of a transfer of a franchise does not constitute a waiver or release of any of the rights of the city under this article or the franchise agreement, whether arising before or after the date of the transfer. 
(g)  The city may impose on a proposed transferee a processing fee to reimburse the city for its actual out of pocket costs in excess of the filing fee in considering an application for transfer of a franchise. The fee shall not exceed $10,000.00. 
(h)  Notwithstanding the forgoing, a franchisee may transfer a franchise agreement or cable system to an affiliate by providing written notice to the city at least 30 days in advance of such internal corporate restructuring or transfer, provided such transfer is not related to a merger or acquisition between the grantee or an affiliate and an unaffiliated third party. 
(Ord. No. 1132, § 3, 12-1-2015)  
Sec. 22-159. - Franchise reviews and modification. 
Upon written notice given by the city or the franchisee, one to the other, the terms and conditions of the franchise agreement may be modified, provided that both the city and the franchisee are agreeable to such modification. Modifications shall be directed toward effecting alterations in the terms and conditions to reflect those technical, economic, or regulatory changes which have occurred during the interim period. 
(Ord. No. 1132, § 3, 12-1-2015)  
Sec. 22-160. - Election and costs. 
The Cable Act preempts any state or local requirement of a voter-approved cable television franchise. In the event the preemption is eliminated and applicable state or local law requires franchises to be voter-approved, then, in order for a nonexclusive franchise to be granted pursuant to this chapter, an election must be held and a majority of those voting must vote in favor of the granting of such franchise. The entire cost of the election together with all printing and publishing costs relating thereto shall be prepaid by the applicant selected by the council to be grantee, regardless of whether or not the applicant is granted a franchise by said election. When the actual costs of the election are known, the final payment may be adjusted accordingly. 
(Ord. No. 1132, § 3, 12-1-2015)

Sec. 22-162. - Indemnification. 
(a)  Except in the event of the city's, its employees' or agents' negligence or wrongful acts, the franchisee shall, at its cost and expense, indemnify, save, hold harmless and defend the city, its officials, boards, commissions, agents, consultants and employees against any and all claims, suits, causes of action, demands, penalties, liabilities, proceedings or judgments for damages or equitable relief filed by third parties resulting from or arising out of or through: 
(1)  The franchisee's construction, installation, maintenance or operation of its system. 
(2)  Any processes or procedures, acts or omissions by the franchisee in connection with the consideration of an award to the franchisee of a franchise and/or any amendments thereto. 
(3)  The conduct of the franchisee's business, including, without limitation, any acts or omissions of the franchisee, its servants, employees or agents, whether or not such act or omission is authorized, required, allowed or prohibited by this article or the franchise agreement. 
(b)  This indemnification shall include all expenses, including, but not limited to, out of pocket expenses, attorneys' fees and litigation expenses incurred by the city in defending itself from such claims and demands, provided, if any action at law or suit in equity is instituted by a third party (a "claim") with respect to which the city intends to seek indemnification under this section, the city shall promptly notify the franchisee of such action or suit. The franchisee shall have the right to conduct and control any claim through counsel of its own choosing, but the city may, at its election, participate in a defense of any such claim at its sole cost and expense. It is further provided that if a conflict of interest should exist or develop between the franchisee and the city, then the city may proceed in the litigation, claim, proceeding or action which, in the exercise of its discretionary authority, represents the best interest of the city, at its own cost and expense.

(d)  In addition to the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, nothing in this section shall prohibit the city from participating in the defense of any litigation by its own separate counsel at its own costs. Compliance by the franchisee with these indemnity provisions shall not limit any other remedies available to the city, at law or equity or waive any defense, position or objection the city may assert. 
(e)  Nothing in this section shall be construed as an intent to waive or circumvent the provisions of the Governmental Tort Claims Act, 51 O.S. § 151 et seq. 
(Ord. No. 1132, § 3, 12-1-2015)  
Sec. 22-163. - Performance bond. 
(a)  The franchise agreement shall provide that, prior to the initial commencement of any system construction, upgrade or other work in the streets or other public ways of the city, the franchisee shall establish and maintain a performance bond in favor of the city, in an amount specified in the franchise agreement or other authorization as may be necessary to ensure the franchisee's faithful performance of each term and condition of this article, the franchise agreement and all applicable ordinances, statutes, rules and regulations, relating to the performance of any construction, upgrade or other work which is required of the franchisee. 
(b)  If the franchisee shall fail to fulfill the material obligations as imposed, or breaches any such obligations, there shall be recoverable, jointly and severally, from the principal and sureties, any damages or loss suffered by the city proximately resulting from the failure of the franchisee to faithfully perform the material provisions of this article and the franchise agreement, including the cost of removal of property of the franchisee, the cost of completing the obligations of the franchisee, together with a reasonable attorney's fee. 
(c)  The franchise agreement may provide the amounts, terms and periods of maintenance of such performance bond. Upon completion of all construction, upgrade or other work in the streets or other public ways to the satisfaction of the city, the city may reduce the amount of the bond to an amount determined by the city sufficient to protect the city in the event of breach. Bond requirements may be also increased by the city to secure additional construction upgrade or other work. 
(d)  Any performance bond required by this action shall be issued by a surety authorized to conduct business in the state. The performance bond shall contain a restriction prohibiting cancellation or lapse without 30 days' written notice to the city from the surety or issuer of the performance bond of its intention to cancel or not renew. In the event of such cancellation or nonrenewal, the franchisee shall establish and maintain another performance bond, subject to the terms and conditions contained in this section; the intent of this provision is to prevent any lapse in coverage of a performance bond so long as applicable and required. 
(e)  The performance bond shall be filed and maintained with the city clerk. 
(f)  The rights available to the city pursuant to the performance bond are in addition to all other rights and remedies available to the city. The exercise of any such rights shall not be construed to excuse or waive unfaithful performance or breach by the franchisee, or limit the liability of the franchisee to the city. 
(Ord. No. 1132, § 3, 12-1-2015)  
Sec. 22-164. - Maps, reports and records. 
(a)  A franchisee shall maintain up-to-date copies of the franchisee's schedule of charges, contract or application forms for regular subscriber service, policy regarding the processing of subscriber complaints, delinquent subscriber disconnect and reconnect procedures and any other terms and conditions adopted as the franchisee's policy in connection with its subscribers, and shall provide such information to the city upon request.

Sec. 26-44. - Defendant to pay cost of incarceration. 
(a)  The municipal court shall require a person who is actually received into custody at the city jail facility or who is confined in a city or county jail or other holding facility at the request of the city, for any offense, to pay the municipality the costs of incarceration, both before and after conviction, upon conviction or receiving a deferred sentence. The costs of incarceration shall be collected by the clerk of the court as provided for collection of other costs and fines, which shall be subject to review under the procedures set forth in Section VIII of the Rules of the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals, Chapter 18, Appendix of Title 22 of the Oklahoma Statutes.

The defendant shall have an opportunity to object to the amount of costs solely on the grounds that the number of days served is incorrect. If no objection is made, the costs may be collected in the amount stated in the notice to the defendant. The chief of police or municipality may collect costs of incarceration ordered by the court from a jail account of the inmate. If the funds collected from the jail account of the inmate are insufficient to satisfy the actual incarceration costs ordered by the court, the municipality is authorized to collect the remaining balance of the incarceration costs by civil action. When the chief of police or municipality collects any court-ordered incarceration costs from a jail account of the inmate or by civil action, the court clerk shall be notified of the amount collected. 
(c)  Except as may otherwise be provided in 21 O.S. § 533, any offender receiving routine or emergency medical services or medications or injured during the commission of a felony or misdemeanor offense and administered any medical care shall be required to reimburse the municipality responsible for the operation of the jail the full amount paid by the municipality for any medical care or treatment administered to such offender during any period of incarceration or when the person was actually received into custody for any reason in the jail facility. 
(d)  Costs of incarceration shall be a debt of the inmate owed to the municipality responsible for the operation of the jail and may be collected as provided by law for collection of any other civil debt or criminal penalty.

Sec. 34-54. - False alarms; credit for fees paid under prior ordinances. 
(a)  When records in the city's possession indicate that at least five false alarms or complaints, or reporting of false information, have occurred within one fiscal year, the alarm administrator shall notify the alarm user by certified mail of the number of false alarms on record. The alarm user will also be notified that any more than nine responses to false alarms, as defined under "false alarmactivation of alarm" in section 34-31, in any one fiscal year will result in the alarm user being billed at the rate set forth in section 42-34. 
(b)  When the city's records indicate that nine false alarms or complaints, or reporting of false information, have occurred within one fiscal year, the alarm administrator shall notify the alarm user by certified mail of the number of false alarms on record. The alarm user will also be notified that, for the remainder of that fiscal year, any responses falling under "false alarmactivation of alarm," as defined in section 34-31, will result in the alarm user being billed the amount set forth in section 42-34. Notwithstanding the provisions set forth in subsections (a) and (b) of this section, the city acknowledges that there may occur certain situations beyond the reasonable control of the user which could result in an excess of false alarms or complaints. Therefore, upon written request of the user, the city manager is delegated the discretionary authority to waive the charge in those cases where he determines that such waiver is in the best interests of the public health, safety and welfare and that such excessive false alarms were outside the reasonable control of the user. In such cases, the city manager's decision shall be final. 
(c)  The alarm administrator shall, in both his notifications by certified mail per subsections (a) and (b) of this section, inform the alarm user of the revocation penalty noted in subsection (d) of this section and its applicability should future false alarm billings not be paid. 
(d)  If the amount billed to the alarm user for emergency responses to false alarms is not paid within 30 days of the statement date, the alarm administrator or his designee may revoke the alarm user's permit. 
(e)  The city's notice of revocation to the alarm user shall specifically state that the permit holder does have the right to appeal to the city manager, as noted in subsection (f) of this section. 
(f)  If the alarm user's permit is revoked, the alarm user may appeal the revocation to city manager, provided such appeal is made within ten calendar days from the date of revocation. The city manager has the discretionary authority, for good cause shown, to rescind the revocation. The city manager's decision shall be final. 
(g)  If the alarm user's permit is revoked and the alarm user seeks to operate his alarm for the remainder of the fiscal year, the alarm user must first make application to the city and pay the appropriate fee. 
(h)  It shall be a violation of this article to operate an alarm system when the permit for that system has been revoked by the alarm administrator or his designee and a new alarm permit has not yet been obtained. 
(i)  No alarm permit will be issued to an individual or business who owes billing to the city which results from implementing the provisions of subsection (b) of this section. 
(j)  The city utility billing department will notify the alarm system administrator of new customers. 
(k)  Users who have paid fees in any amount pursuant to prior ordinances will be given credit for payment of the registration fee imposed by this division and will not be subject to an additional registration fee. However, payment of prior fees totally in excess of the amount imposed by this division will not entitle users to any refund, except that persons who have paid renewal fees for fiscal year 1998-99 will be given a refund.

Priority 4 standard: 90 percent reliability or better during each month. 
a.  Three sub-areas will be defined by EMSA in the area comprising the eastern division beneficiary jurisdiction and three in the combined beneficiary and nonbeneficiary jurisdictions of the western division for compliance measurement for priority 1 transports. The operations contractor shall use best efforts to ensure response time equity for priority 1 transports among the sub-areas, keeping response times in each sub-area within 15 percent of the compliance required for the entire jurisdiction. Variations of more than 15 percent from the jurisdiction standards within the same sub-area for more than three consecutive months, or more than 6 months during any 12 month period, shall be considered chronic response time discrimination. Provided, however, that in the event the volume of priority 1 transports in any sub-area during any month is less than 100, sufficient additional priority 1 transports shall be added from the sub-area, in sequential order from one or more months immediately preceding, to that month's sub-area statistics so that the total volume of priority 1 transports included in the calculation is 100. 
b.  Response time exceptions. The operations contractor shall maintain mechanisms for reserve production capacity to increase production should a temporary system overload persist. However, it is understood that from time to time unusual factors beyond the contractor's reasonable control affect the achievement of specified response time standards. These unusual factors are limited to unusually severe weather conditions, declared disasters, or period of unusually high demand for emergency services. High demand is defined as those periods when 14 or more emergency responses within the beneficiary jurisdiction are in progress simultaneously. Equipment failure, traffic congestion, ambulance failure, dispatch error or other causes shall not be grounds for granting an exception to compliance with the response time standard.

Any utility customer who considers the medical service program charges applicable to his living unit to be erroneous because said utility customer opted out of the program, may request review of the charges by the city's utilities department.

Some nuisances are of such nature as to constitute a grave and immediate danger to the peace, health, safety, morals or welfare of one or more persons or of the public generally. It is recognized that circumstances may be such as to justify, and even to require, the city manager or other appropriate officer or agency of the city government to take immediate and proper action summarily to abate such nuisances, or to reduce or suspend the danger until more deliberate action can be taken toward such abatement. 
(b)  Request for abatement. The chief of the fire department, the chief of police, the city attorney, the building inspector, the electrical inspector, the plumbing inspector or any other officer subordinate to the city manager may submit, through or with the consent of the city manager, to the city council, a statement as to the existence of a nuisance as defined by the ordinances of the city or law, and a request or recommendation that it be abated. The city manager himself, the health officer, any councilmember, or any resident of the city may submit such a statement and request or recommendation to the city council. 
(c)  Determination by council; hearing. The council shall determine whether or not the alleged nuisance is a nuisance in fact. For the purpose of gathering evidence on the subject, the council shall have power to subpoena and examine witnesses, books, papers and other effects. Before proceeding to abate the nuisance or to have it abated, the council shall give notice of a hearing on the proposed abatement to the owner of any property concerned and to any other person alleged or deemed responsible for or to be causing the nuisance, and an adequate opportunity to be heard, if such notice and opportunity for a hearing can be given. Such notice to the owner and other persons concerned shall be given in writing by mail or by service by a police officer if their names and addresses are known, but if the names or addresses are not known and the peace, health, safety, morals or welfare of the persons or the public adversely affected would not be unduly jeopardized by the necessary delay, a notice of the hearing shall be published in a paper of general circulation within the city. 
(d)  Order to abate; abatement by city. If the council finds that a nuisance does in fact exist, it shall direct the owner and/or other persons responsible for or causing the nuisance to abate it within a specified time if the peace, health, safety, morals or welfare of the persons or the public adversely affected would not be unduly jeopardized by the consequent delay. If such peace, health, safety, morals or welfare would be unduly jeopardized by the consequent delay, or if the owner or other person responsible for or causing the nuisance does not abate it within the specified time, the council shall direct the city manager to abate the nuisance or to have it abated, if summary abatement is practical, as authorized by 50 O.S. § 16. The city clerk shall send a statement of the cost of such summary abatement to the owner and/or other persons responsible for or causing the nuisance, as may be just under the circumstances, if their names and addresses are known. Until paid, such cost shall constitute a debt to the city collectible as other debts of the city may be collected.

Sec. 38-40. - Abatement by suit in district court.

Sec. 38-41. - Abatement of health nuisances.

Such order shall be in writing and may be served personally on the owner or occupant of the premises, or authorized agent thereof, by the health officer or by a police officer, or a copy thereof may be left at the last usual place of abode of the owner, occupant or agent, if known and within the state. If the premises are unoccupied and the residence of the owner, occupant or agent is unknown or is without the state, the order may be served by posting a copy thereof on the premises, or by publication in at least one issue of a newspaper having general circulation in the city. 
(b)  If the order is not complied with, the health officer may cause the order to be executed and complied with, and the cost thereof shall be certified to the city clerk, and the cost of removing or abating such nuisance shall be added to the water bill or other city utility bill of the owner or occupant if he is a user of water from the city water system or such other utility service. The cost shall be treated as a part of such utility bill to which it is added, and shall become due and payable, and be subject to the same regulations relating to delinquency in payment, as the utility bill itself. If such owner or occupant is not a user of any city utility service, such cost, after certification to the city clerk, may be collected in any manner in which any other debt due the city may be collected. 
(Code 1977, § 8.12.110)

Surface casing shall conform to the following material standards: 
(1)  National Sanitation Foundation approved plastic pipe. 
(2)  Standard steel pipe (AWWA). 
(3)  Cast iron pipe (AWWA). 
Six inches of 3,000 pound test concrete shall be placed around the well casing. 
(h)  Drilled or driven well casings. Drilled or driven well casings shall be of steel or other suitable material. Where drilled wells extend into a rock formation, the well casing shall extend to and be set firmly in the formation. The annular space between the earth and the outside of the casing shall be filled with 3,000-pound test concrete to a distance of at least ten feet below the ground surface, to make it watertight around the outside of the casing to exclude pollution. 
(i)  Dug or bored well casings. Dug or bored well surface casings shall extend to a distance of at least ten feet below the ground surface. Where the water table is more than ten feet below the ground surface, the watertight casing shall extend below the table surface. Well casings for dug wells or bored wells may be built of sections of concrete, tile, or galvanized or corrugated metal pipe. When used, these shall be surrounded by six inches of 3,000-pound test concrete poured into the hole between the outside of the casing and the ground to a depth of at least ten feet, to make it watertight around the outside of the casing to exclude pollution. 
(j)  Cover. Every potable water well shall be equipped with a tight cover at the top of the casing well or pipe sleeve so that contaminated water or other substances cannot enter the well through the annular opening at the top. A dug well cover shall be provided with a pipe sleeve which will permit the withdrawal of the pump suction pipe, cylinder or jet body without disturbing the cover. Where pump section or discharge pipes enter or leave a well through the side of the casing, the circle of contact shall be watertight. 
(k)  Drainage. All potable water wells shall be constructed so that surface drainage will be diverted away from the well. 
(l)  Terminal construction. Where possible, a four-inch slab should extend at least two feet from the casing. Where a licensed well driller certifies that proper grouting is in place and local conditions warrant, the requirement for a slab may be waived. The casing must be capped with a commercial well seal and shall have access available for disinfection of the well. Electrical cables passing through the seal must be properly sealed. Vents must be turned downward and screened. Where a pitless adaptor is used, the unit must have NSF approval. A bentonite clay seal may be substituted for cement grout from a distance of 12 inches below the adaptor to the surface to facilitate maintenance of the pitless adaptor. A dug well cover shall be provided with a pipe sleeve which will permit the withdrawal of the pump mechanisms without disturbing the cover. All potable water wells shall be constructed so that surface drainage will be diverted away from the well. 
(Code 1977, § 13.32.100)  
Sec. 38-110. - Pumping equipment. 
(a)  Generally. Pumps shall be so constructed and installed as to prevent contamination from entering a potable water supply through the pump units.

DIVISION 1. - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND METHODS 
 
Sec. 50-31. - Statutory authorization. 
The Legislature of the State of Oklahoma has in 82 O.S. §§ 16011618, as amended, delegated to local governmental units the responsibility to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. 
(Ord. No. 1009, §§ 1, 2, 9-2-2008)  
Sec. 50-32. - Findings of fact. 
(1)  The flood hazard areas of the City of Mustang are subject to periodic inundation, which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(2)  These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazards areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage. 
(Ord. No. 1009, §§ 1, 2, 9-2-2008)  
Sec. 50-33. - Statement of purpose. 
It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Protect human life and health; 
(2)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and 
(7)  Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area.  
Sec. 50-34. - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
In order to accomplish its purposes, this article uses the following methods: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters; 
(4)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; 
(5)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
(Ord. No. 1009, §§ 1, 2, 9-2-2008)  
Secs. 50-3550-50. - Reserved.  
DIVISION 2. - GENERAL 
 
Sec. 50-51. - Definitions. 
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this article shall be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this article its most reasonable application. 
Accessory structure means structures which are on the same parcel of property as the principle structure and the use of which is incidental to the use of the principle structure (such as garages and storage sheds). 
Area of shallow flooding means a designated AO, AH, or VO zone on a community's flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with a one percent chance or greater annual chance of flooding to an average depth of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
Area of special flood hazard means the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. The area may be designated as zone A on the flood hazard boundary map (FHBM). After detailed ratemaking has been completed in preparation for publication of the FIRM, zone A usually is refined into zones A, AE, AH, AO or A1-99. 
Base flood means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
Base flood elevation means the elevation in feet above mean sea level of the base flood or one percent chance flood. 
Basement means any area of the building having its floor sub-grade (below ground level) on all sides. 
Board means the Oklahoma Water Resources Board. 
Critical feature means an integral and readily identifiable part of a flood protection system, without which the flood protection provided by the entire system would be compromised. 
Development means any manmade change in improved and unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials. 
Elevated building means a non-basement building built, in the case of a building in zones A1-30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X, and D, to have the top of the elevated floor adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during a flood up to the magnitude of the base flood. In the case of zones A1-30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X, and D, "elevated building" also includes a building elevated by means of fill or solid foundation perimeter walls with openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement of flood waters. 
Existing construction means for the purposes of determining rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced before the effective date of the FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date. "Existing construction" may also be referred to as "existing structures." 
Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the floodplain management regulations adopted by a community. 
Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads). 
Flood or flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
(1)  The overflow of inland or tidal waters. 
(2)  The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source. 
Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) means an official map of a community, on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
Flood insurance study means the official report provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The report contains flood profiles, water surface elevation of the base flood, as well as the floodway width, section area and mean velocity. 
Floodplain administrator means a person accredited by the board and designated by the city to administer and implement laws and regulations relating to the management of the floodplains. 
Floodplain or flood-prone area means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source (see definition of flooding). 
Floodplain management means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works and floodplain management regulations. 
Floodplain management regulations means zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as a floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance and erosion control ordinance) and other applications of police power. The term describes such state or local regulations, in any combination thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and reduction. 
Flood protection system means those physical structural works for which funds have been authorized, appropriated, and expended and which have been constructed specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of the areas within a community subject to a "special flood hazard" and the extent of the depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes hurricane tidal barriers, dams, reservoirs, levees or dikes. These specialized flood modifying works are those constructed in conformance with sound engineering standards. 
Floodproofing means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents. 
Floodway (regulatory floodway) means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
Functionally dependent use means a use that cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities, but does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities. 
Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure. 
Historic structure means any structure that is: 
(1)  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the department of interior) or preliminarily determined by the secretary of the interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register; 
(2)  Certified or preliminarily determined by the secretary of the interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the secretary to qualify as a registered historic district; 
(3)  Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the secretary of interior; or 
(4)  Individually listed on a local inventory or historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either: 
a.  By an approved state program as determined by the secretary of the interior; or 
b.  Directly by the secretary of the interior in states without approved programs. 
Levee means a manmade structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control, or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding. 
Levee system means a flood protection system, which consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such as closure, and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices. 
Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking or vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirement of Section 60.3 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations. 
Manufactured home means a structure transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle." 
Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
Mean sea level means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map are referenced. 
New construction means, for the purpose of determining insurance rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, "new construction" means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by a community. 
Recreational vehicle means a vehicle which is: 
(1)  Built on a single chassis; 
(2)  Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projections; 
(3)  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and 
(4)  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
Start of construction (for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Pub. L. 97-348)), includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
Structure means a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. 
Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before "start of construction" of the improvement. This includes structures that have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
(1)  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary conditions or 
(2)  Any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
Variance means a grant of relief to a person from the requirement of this article when specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance, therefore, permits construction or development in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article. (For full requirements see Section 60.6 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations.) 
Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with this community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in Section 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10) or (d)(3) is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
Water surface elevation means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

Sec. 50-74. - Variance procedures. 
(a)  The board of adjustment shall hear and render judgment on requests for variances from the requirements of this article. 
(b)  The board of adjustment shall hear and render judgment on an appeal only when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this article. 
(c)  Any person or persons aggrieved by the decision of the board of adjustment may appeal such decision in the courts of competent jurisdiction. 
(d)  The floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all actions involving an appeal and shall report variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
(e)  Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the state inventory of historic places, without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this section. 
(f)  Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing the relevant factors in subsection 50-73(2) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
(g)  Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this article, the board of adjustment may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this article. 
(h)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(i)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(j)  Prerequisites for granting variances: 
(1)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(2)  Variances shall only be issued upon: 
a.  Showing a good and sufficient cause; 
b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and 
c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws, regulations or ordinances. 
(3)  A written notice will be provided to any person granted a variance to build a structure below the base flood elevation. This notice will inform the variance applicant that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from permitting the structure to be built lower than the base flood elevation. 
(k)  Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that: 
(1)  The criteria outlined in subsections (a)(i) are met, and 
(2)  The structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
(l)  Any person seeking a variance shall file a petition with the board of adjustment, accompanied by a filing fee in the amount set forth in subsection 42-122(e). 
(m)  A copy of any variance issued shall be sent to the OWRB within in 15 days of issuance.

(Ord. No. 1009, §§ 1, 2, 9-2-2008)  
Sec. 50-94. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO/AH zones). 
Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 50-53 are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flows may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions apply: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified). 
(2)  All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures; 
a.  Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified); or 
b.  Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. 
(3)  A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standards of this section, as proposed in subsection 50-73(a) are satisfied. 
(4)  Require within zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes, to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures. 
(Ord. No. 1009, §§ 1, 2, 9-2-2008)  
Sec. 50-95. - Floodways. 
Floodways located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 50-53 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters that carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply: 
(1)  Encroachments are prohibited, including, fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(2)  If subsection (1) above is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of division 4 of this article. 
(3)  Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 65.12, of the National Flood Insurance Regulations, a community may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided that the community complies with all of 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 65.12.

DIVISION 2. - DRAINAGE SYSTEMS 
 
Sec. 50-131. - Purpose and applicability of division. 
The regulations and standards of this division are intended to protect the various portions of the urban area from flooding, to provide clean and sanitary channels for runoff, to prevent pollution of watersheds, streams and natural drainage channels, to prevent the encroachment of buildings and improvements on natural drainage channels, to equitably apportion the cost of improvements, to protect natural scenic areas, and to provide for the conservation of the natural resources of the area. The regulations, policies and standards contained in this division shall apply to the area outlined on the comprehensive plan, which is made a part of this division. All subdivisions of land and all improvements of any character which affect drainage in any portion of the area contained on the comprehensive plan shall be subject to the provisions of this division. 
(Code 1977, § 13.12.010)  
Sec. 50-132. - Classification of drainage channels; responsibility for improvement of drainage channels. 
(a)  Primary drainage channels shall be those rivers and other channels which have been so designated on the comprehensive plan. 
(b)  Secondary drainage channels shall include all channels in the area set forth on comprehensive plan which are not classified as primary channels. 
(c)  In general it is intended that channels which are designed as primary channels serve a drainage area of 640 acres or more. It is intended by this division to provide that the improvement of primary drainage channels will be the responsibility of the city primarily, since the whole city is benefited materially, except that the developer of the land containing the primary channel is expected to lay out, design and otherwise plan and carry out his improvements in a manner that will not interfere with or restrict the natural flow of water or materially change the conditions of runoff. Increased runoff and changes in primary channels which are created by improvements of an individual subdivision shall be the responsibility of the developer of the subdivision and shall be made in accordance with the provisions of this division. It is intended by this division that the improvement of secondary channels shall be the responsibility of the developer of the area served by the channel since the primary benefit is to the area served by the secondary channel and not to the city as a whole. 
(Code 1977, § 13.12.020)  
Sec. 50-133. - Methods for determining stream flow and runoff. 
The maximum condition of rainfall for a 100-year interval shall be used for the purposes of determining all runoff for the sizing of drainage channels and structures, unless otherwise specified in this division. Values used in formulas for runoff and size of drainage structures shall reflect and shall not be less than the degree of urbanization set forth in the projected land use plan contained in the general plan. The following formulas and values shall be used for calculating all stream flow and runoff for the policies and regulations established this division: 
(1)  Runoff from all drainage areas shall be determined by rational formula: 
Q = AIR 
In which: 
Q 	= 	Cubic feet per second. 
A 	= 	Area to be drained in acres, determined by field surveys for areas less than 640 acres, and by latest government quadrangle maps for larger areas. 
I 	= 	Percent of imperviousness of the area. This may vary between 40 percent and 95 percent. 
R 	= 	Rate of rainfall over the entire drainage area in inches per hour, based on time of concentration and latest government records for the area. 
 
(2)  The size of closed storm sewers, open channels, culverts and bridges shall be determined using the Manning formula: 
Q = 1,486 / n  r 2/3 s 1/2 
Q 	= 	Discharge in cubic feet per second. 
A 	= 	Cross sectional area of water in conduit in square feet. 
r 	= 	Hydraulic radius of water in conduit. 
s 	= 	Mean slope of hydraulic gradient, in feet of vertical rise per foot of horizontal distance. 
n 	= 	Roughness coefficient, based on condition and type of material of conduit lining, but not less than 0.013. 
 
(Code 1977, § 13.12.030)  
Sec. 50-134. - Protection and improvement of primary drainage channels. 
All primary drainage channels which are located within or immediately adjacent to an improvement or a subdivision shall be protected and improved by the developer as follows: 
(1)  All land having an elevation below the 100-year maximum flood elevation and not protected by levees or dikes shall be dedicated to the city for the purpose of providing drainage and for public park and utility easement use. 
(2)  The existing channel lying within or immediately adjacent to the subdivision shall be cleaned to provide for the free flow of water, and the channel shall be straightened, widened and improved to the extent required to prevent overflow beyond the limits of the dedicated drainage area. 
(3)  Site improvement shall provide for the grading of all building sites and streets to an elevation where all lots, building areas and streets will not be subject to overflow and in a manner that will provide for the rapid runoff of all rainfall; however, such improvements shall be carried out in a manner that will preserve and protect large trees and attractive physical features of the area. 
(4)  Whenever channel improvement is carried out, sodding, backsloping, cribbing and other bank protection shall be designed and constructed to control erosion for all the anticipated conditions of flow for the segment of channel involved. 
(5)  A drainage channel shall not be located in a street easement unless it is placed in an enclosed storm sewer, or unless a paved street surface is provided on both sides of a paved channel to give access to abutting properties. 
(6)  Culverts, bridges and other drainage structures shall be constructed in accordance with the specifications of the city at all locations where drainage channels intersect with continuous streets or alleys. 
(Code 1977, § 13.12.040)  
Sec. 50-135. - Protection and improvement of secondary drainage channels and surface drainage. 
(a)  All secondary drainage channels which are located within or immediately adjacent to an improvement or a subdivision, and all surface drainage conditions, shall be protected and improved as follows: 
(1)  Secondary drainage channels which have a primary function of collecting surface water from adjacent properties or intercepting and diverting side hill drainage shall be provided with an improved open channel. 
(2)  Secondary drainage channels which have a primary function of transporting water through the block or collecting water from cross channels and which have a drainage area of less than 40 acres shall be an improved open channel or closed storm sewer. Where the secondary drainage channel has a drainage area of greater than 40 acres, an improved open channel or closed storm sewer shall be provided. 
(3)  A drainage channel shall not be located in a street easement unless it is placed in a closed storm sewer, or unless a paved street surface is located on both sides of a paved drainage channel to give access to abutting properties. 
(4)  Site grading shall be carried out in such a manner that surface water from each lot shall flow directly to a storm sewer, improved channel or paved street without crossing more than two adjacent lots. 
(5)  Surface water collected on streets shall be diverted to storm drains at satisfactory intervals to prevent overflow of six-inch-high curbs during a 100-year frequency rain for the area and grades involved; provided, however, that in no case shall the drainage area served by one street exceed 20 acres, regardless of the amount of flow. 
(6)  Drainage easements of satisfactory width to provide working room for construction and maintenance shall be provided for all storm sewers. In no case shall the total easement be less than 20 feet. 
(7)  Open channels shall be improved by providing a paved section that will carry the runoff from a rain of 50-year frequency and a sodded section to carry the runoff from a rain of 100-year frequency. The design of the channel improvements shall be in accordance with the standards set forth on figure B or figure C of Ordinance No. 168, on file in the office of the city clerk. 
(b)  Whenever an open improved channel is required or authorized for a secondary drainage channel under the provisions of this division and the channel crosses residential lots 80 percent or more of which have a width of not less than 90 feet and an area of not less than 13,500 square feet and the channel improvement is to be designed as an integral part of the landscaping of the area that will be maintained by the property owners of the area, then the planning commission may modify the requirements of this section to permit a channel improvement design in accordance with figure D of Ordinance No. 168, on file in the office of the city clerk. The developer may elect to provide a paved section to accommodate runoff from a rain of 100-year frequency, provided that sodding shall be carried out to the extent necessary to protect paved surfaces. 
(Code 1977, § 13.12.050)  
Sec. 50-136. - Standards for improvements.

Editor's note The city's "Standard Drainage Policy for the City of Mustang" is on file with the city clerk.  
Sec. 50-166. - Stormwater management required. 
(a)  It shall be the goal of the owner/developer to limit the storm runoff leaving his property to the so-called historic value (before development). To achieve this, the developer/owner shall provide stormwater management for the increased stormwater runoff resulting from his development. 
(b)  Where a developer/owner proposes development or use of only a portion of the property, provision for stormwater runoff control shall be required for that portion of the property proposed for immediate development or use. 
(c)  The development shall provide a sufficient stormwater drainage system for the conveyance of existing stormwater runoff received from upstream and from the subject property, with specific allowance having been made for the continued conveyance of stormwater runoff from properties adjacent to the proposed development which may develop in the future. 
(d)  All roofs, paved areas, yards, courts and courtyards, other than one-family or two-family residential structures, shall drain into an existing or improved storm sewer system or to an approved place of disposal, not generally including streets. Release of stormwater onto arterial (section line) streets may be considered acceptable if: 
(1)  Present street flow does not exceed four inches in depth at the face of the curb during a 50-year storm event; or 
(2)  The release of stormwater when added to existing street flow does not increase the depth of flow at the face of the curb above four inches in depth during a 50-year storm. 
Release of stormwater onto all other classifications of streets may be considered acceptable if the depth of flow does not exceed six inches in depth at the face of the curb during a 100-year storm event. The addition of off-site stormwater improvements may be waived by the city council if, in the opinion of the city council, the addition of storm sewers would cause extreme hardship on the developer, in which case the council will address alternative methods of disposal. 
(e)  In the case of one-family and two-family residential structures, stormwater may be discharged onto flat areas such as streets or lawns if drainage is provided so that the stormwater will flow away from the building and if the requirements of the city drainage standards are met. 
(f)  The owner/developer shall provide for the construction, operation and perpetual maintenance of stormwater detention systems acceptable to the city, except as provided in section 50-168(2). No conveyance of the responsibility for the detention system is allowed or implied by the issuance of building permits. Stormwater detention systems shall be considered a priority during construction. All stormwater drainage systems, erosion control and sedimentation control shall be constructed as one of the first items of a development, and shall be constructed prior to any change in the stormwater runoff of the development. 
(Code 1977, § 13.14.040)  
Sec. 50-167. - Development standards.

Sec. 74-32. - Findings, purpose, intent and authority. 
(a)  Findings. The regulations contained in this article are supported by the following findings of fact: 
(1)  Oil and gas drilling and production is an important component of the Mustang area economy. 
(2)  Oil and gas well drilling and production activities create conditions that potentially threaten the health, safety and general welfare of persons residing or working on property in proximity to such operations. 
(3)  Oil and gas well drilling and production activities, in the absence of local regulatory controls, may generate noxious aerial emissions, introduce contaminants into groundwater, emit high noise or light levels, produce large volumes of dust, congest local streets, present fire or chemical spill hazards and produce other deleterious effects, all of which fall disproportionately on adjacent land uses, and which can result individually or cumulatively in injury to persons or damage to property and inhibit the quiet peace and enjoyment of the surface uses of real property in the vicinity of such operations. 
(4)  The proliferation of oil and gas well pad sites within the city creates conflicts between such development and other existing and future surface uses of real property within the city. To assure the compatibility of residential, commercial, industrial and agricultural uses with oil and gas well development, it is necessary for the city to regulate the location of oil and gas well operations relative to other surface uses of real property within the city consistent with the right of mineral owners to reasonably access subsurface resources. 
(5)  The city recognizes that the State of Oklahoma regulates oil and gas well drilling and production activities. The regulations in this article are intended to supplement such standards and additionally implement compatible local measures that assure the health, safety and general welfare of the city's residents and businesses. 
(b)  Purpose and intent. In order to protect the public health, peace, safety and welfare of the city and its residents, this article is created to establish reasonable and uniform limitations, safeguards and controls for the drilling and operation of wells and production of oil, gas and other hydrocarbon substances within the corporate limits of the city, and to provide that this land use may be conducted in harmony with other uses within the city. The provisions set forth in this article shall be considered as minimum requirements and shall not relieve any person from any duty imposed by law to use reasonable care and take reasonable precautions for the safeguarding of people and the protection of and noninterference with property rights. 
(c)  Authority. This article is adopted pursuant to authority vested under the constitution and laws of the State of Oklahoma and the Mustang City Charter. Each authorization identified in this article shall be construed as an exercise of the city's police, nuisance, and zoning powers pursuant to the Charter and Oklahoma Statutes. 
(Ord. No. 1158, § 2, 4-3-2018)  
Sec. 74-33. - Applicability of article to existing operations. 
This article shall not apply to any producing oil or gas well located within the boundaries of the city on the effective date of this article. Such wells shall remain subject to the requirements of any ordinance that was in effect at the time of drilling. 
(Ord. No. 1158, § 2, 4-3-2018)  
Sec. 74-34. - Violations; penalties. 
It shall be unlawful and an offense for any person to violate or neglect to comply with any provision of this article, irrespective of whether or not the verbiage of each section of this article contains the specific language that such violation or neglect is unlawful and is an offense. Any person who shall violate any of the provisions of this article, or any of the provisions of a drilling and operating permit issued pursuant to this article, or any condition in a conditional use permit, or any condition of the bond filed by the permittee pursuant to this article, or who shall neglect to comply with the terms of this article, shall be punished as provided in section 1-8. Each violation of each separate provision of this article, or of the permit, or of the bond, shall be considered a separate offense, and each day's violation of each separate provision thereof shall be considered a separate offense. In addition to such penalties, it is further provided that the city council, at any regular or special session or meeting thereof, may, provided ten days' notice has been given to the permittee that revocation is to be considered at such meeting, revoke or suspend any permit issued under this article and under which drilling or producing operations are being conducted if the permittee thereof has violated any provisions of the permit or the bond or this article.

ARTICLE VII. - OFFENSES BY OR AGAINST MINORS  
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 
 
Sec. 78-351. - Curfew. 
(a)  Findings; purpose. The city council has determined that there has been an increase in juvenile violence, juvenile gang activity, and crime by persons under the age of 18 in the city. Persons under the age of 18 are particularly susceptible, by their lack of maturity and experience, to participate in unlawful and gang-related activities and to be victims of older perpetrators of crime. The city has an obligation to provide for the protection of minors from each other and from other persons, for the enforcement of parental control over and responsibility for children, for the protection of the general public, and for the reduction of the incidence of juvenile criminal activities. The city council has determined that a curfew for those under the age of 18 will be in the interest of public health, safety and general welfare and will help to attain the objectives set out in this subsection and to diminish the undesirable impact of such conduct on the citizens of the city. 
(b)  Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the following terms, phrases, words and their derivations shall have the meaning given in this subsection: 
Curfew hours means from 12:01 p.m. (midnight) until 6:00 a.m. on Monday though Friday, and from 1:00 a.m. until 6:00 a.m. on Saturday and Sunday. 
Emergency means an unforeseen combination of circumstances or the resulting state that calls for immediate action. The term includes but is not limited to a fire, a natural disaster or an automobile accident, or any situation requiring immediate action to prevent serious bodily injury or loss of life. 
Establishment means any privately owned place of business operated for a profit to which the public is invited, including but not limited to any place of amusement or entertainment. 
Minor means any person under the age of 18. 
Parent and guardian mean any person having legal custody of a minor as a: 
(1)  Natural, step or adoptive parent; 
(2)  Legal guardian; 
(3)  Person who stands in loco parentis; 
(4)  Person to whom legal custody has been given by order of the court; or 
(5)  Person at least 18 years of age and authorized by the parent or guardian to have the custody and care of a minor. 
Public place means any street, alley, highway, sidewalk, park, playground or place to which the general public or a substantial group of the general public has access and a right to resort for business, entertainment or other lawful purpose. A public place shall include but not be limited to any store, shop, restaurant, tavern, bowling alley, cafe, theater, drugstore, pool room or shopping center, and any other place devoted to amusement or entertainment of the general public. It shall also include the immediate area of such places, and the common areas of schools, hospitals, apartment houses, office buildings, transport facilities and shops. 
Remain means to leave or stay behind, to tarry and to stay unnecessarily upon the streets, including the congregating of groups (or of interacting minors) totaling four or more persons in which any minor involved would not be using the streets for ordinary or serious purposes such as mere passage or going home; or to fail to leave the premises when requested to do so by a police officer or the owner, operator or other person in control of the premises. 
Street means a way or place, of whatever nature, open to the use of the public as a matter of right for purposes of vehicular travel, or in the case of a sidewalk thereof for pedestrian travel. The term "street" includes the legal right-of-way, including but not limited to the cartway or traffic lanes, the curb, the sidewalks whether paved or unpaved, and any grass plots or other grounds found within the legal right-of-way of a street. 
Year of age continues from one birthday, such as the 17th birthday, to but not including the day of the next, such as the 18th birthday, making it clear that the phrase "17 or less years of age" is treated in this section as equivalent to the phrase "under 18 years of age." 
(c)  Violations by minors. It shall be unlawful for any person 17 or less years of age (under 18) to be or remain in or upon the streets or public places within the city at night during the curfew hours. 
(d)  Violations by parent or guardian. It shall be unlawful for a parent or other person having legal custody of a minor knowingly to permit or by inefficient control to allow such a minor to be or remain upon any city street or public place or on the premises of any establishment under circumstances not constituting an exception or defense to or otherwise beyond the scope of this section. For purposes of this subsection, the term "knowingly" includes knowledge which a parent or legal guardian should reasonably be expected to have concerning the whereabouts of a minor in that parent's or person's legal custody. 
(e)  Violations by operators of public places. It shall be unlawful for the owner or operator or person otherwise in charge of a public place to knowingly allow or permit a minor to remain on the premises of the public place during the curfew hours in violation of this section. 
(f)  Defenses. 
(1)  The following shall constitute defenses to violations of this section: 
a.  The minor is accompanied by a parent or legal guardian. 
b.  The minor is accompanied by an adult, authorized by a parent of such minor to take the parent's place, accompanying the minor for a designated period of time, date and purpose within a specified area. A written communication containing this information, and signed by the minor and by the parent or legal guardian of such minor, which includes the minor's home address and telephone number and which is in the possession of the authorized adult shall constitute prima facie proof of such authorization. 
c.  The minor is exercising First Amendment rights protected by the United States Constitution, such as the free exercise of religion, freedom of speech, and the right of assembly. Such minor shall evidence the bona fides of such exercise by possessing a written communication, signed by such minor and countersigned by a parent or legal guardian of such minor with their home address and telephone number, specifying the times and dates when, and where, and in what manner, the minor will be on the streets and other public places during the curfew hours in the exercise of a First Amendment right specified in such communication. 
d.  The minor is on an errand, specific business or activity directed or permitted by his parent without detour or stop, and the minor has in his possession a written communication signed by the minor, countersigned by a parent or legal guardian of such minor, evidencing their home address and telephone number, and establishing such reason relating to a direct route for a designated time for a described purpose, including points of origin and destination. Each communication will also note the date and time limits the reason will encompass. 
e.  The minor is on the residence of the place where such minor resides, or on the residence of either next-door neighbor not communicating an objection to the police officer. 
f.  The minor is attending an official school, religious or other recreational activity supervised by adults and sponsored by the city, a civic organization or other similar entity that takes responsibility for the minor, or going to or returning home from, without any detour or stop, an official school, religious or other recreational activity supervised by adults and sponsored by the city, a civic organization or another similar entity that takes responsibility for the minor. 
g.  The minor is within the scope of his employment and carries a certified card or some other form of communication indicating employment, briefly identifying the minor, the addresses and telephone numbers of his home and his place of employment, and his hours of employment, or other valid proof of employment. 
h.  The minor is engaged in interstate vehicular travel with the consent of his parent or legal guardian. This contemplates normal travel and clearly exempts bona fide interstate movement through the city, particularly on normal routes. 
i.  The minor is within the scope of the temporary modification of this section by the city council as set forth in this section. 
j.  The minor is married or has otherwise had disabilities of minority removed in accordance with state law. 
k.  The minor is acting in an emergency situation. 
(2)  It is a defense for the owner or operator of a public place wherein or whereon minors are remaining during curfew hours that he has posted in public view a sign at least 8½ inches by 11 inches, which states that minors on the premises during curfew hours in violation of this section will not be tolerated, and/or the owner or operator has promptly notified the police department that a minor was present on the premises of the establishment during curfew hours and refused to leave. 
(g)  Temporary modification of curfew hours. The city council may authorize a temporary relaxation of the curfew hours in matters of reasonable necessity and matters determined to be consistent with the public interest and the purposes of this section. Such determination and modification of the curfew hours by the city council shall define the activity or purpose, the scope of the use of the streets and/or public places permitted, the period of time involved, and any other information necessary or pertinent to inform the public of the terms of the relaxation of this section. Such action by the city council may be by motion or resolution. 
(h)  Enforcement; discretionary authority of police officers. A police officer of the city, upon finding or having attention called to any minor on the streets in prima facie violation of this section, normally shall take the minor to the city police station or other place designated by the chief of police, where a parent or legal guardian will immediately be notified to come for such minor. It is specifically provided that a police officer is given the discretionary authority to return the minor to his residence if the officer determines such act to be in the best interest of the minor. 
(i)  Court jurisdiction. The jurisdiction of the municipal court over a minor who violates the provisions of this section shall be subject to 10 O.S. § 7303-1.2. Absent an interlocal agreement with the district court for the municipal court to exercise jurisdiction over minors under 18 years of age, the municipal court shall refer all alleged juvenile violations to the juvenile bureau of the district attorney's office. 
(j)  Determination of age. In the absence of convincing evidence of age, such as a birth certificate or valid driver's license, a police officer on the street shall in the first instance use his best judgment in determining age. 
(k)  Notice to parent or guardian in lieu of full enforcement. In the case of a first violation by a minor, the municipal court may, at the discretion of the court, cause to be delivered by certified mail, sent to the minor's parent or legal guardian, written notice of the violation with a warning that any subsequent violation may result in full enforcement of this section.

(b)  It shall be unlawful for any child who is over the age of 16 years and under the age of 18 years, and who has not finished four years of high school work or the equivalent, to neglect or refuse to attend and comply with the rules of some public, private or other school, or receive an education by other means for the full term the schools of the district are in session; provided that this section shall not apply if any such child: 
(1)  Is prevented from attending school by reason of mental or physical ability, to be determined by the board of education of the district upon a certificate of the school physician or public health physician, or, if no such physician is available, a duly licensed and practicing physician. 
(2)  Is excused from attendance at school, due to any emergency, by the principal teacher of the school in which the child is enrolled, at the request of the parent, guardian, custodian or other person having control of such child. 
(3)  Has attained his 16th birthday and is excused from attending school by the school administrator of the school district where the child attends school and the parent, guardian or custodian of the child. No such child shall be excused from attending school by such joint agreement between a school administrator and the parent, guardian or custodian of the child unless and until it has been determined that such action is for the best interest of the child and/or the community, and that such child shall thereafter be under the supervision of the parent, guardian or custodian until the child reaches the age of 18 years.

(7)  Signs which are so illuminated that it interferes or potentially interferes with the effectiveness of, or obscures, any official traffic sign, signal or device, or imitates or may be confused with any such official traffic sign, signal or device, are prohibited. 
(8)  No person may upgrade an existing nonconforming billboard to an electronic or multiple message sign without first obtaining a billboard conversion permit from the city council approving of the proposed upgrade and the design and placement thereof prior to actual changes being made. 
a.  An application for a billboard conversion permit shall be submitted in writing, providing the location of the existing billboard, the type of technology intended to be used, the design and placement of the billboard and conversion features, and providing such other information as requested by the community development director and required by this section.

Sec. 98-62. - Standards for mobile containers; furnishing of containers. 
(a)  The containers referred to in this section shall be 90-gallon plastic carts on wheels that will be furnished to each residence by the city. Such carts, and the grounds immediately around them, shall be kept in a safe and sanitary condition at all times. The city shall provide one cart for each residence. In addition, residents shall have the option of leasing an additional cart for a minimum of six months for an additional monthly fee to be added to the resident's monthly utility bill. Containers are the property of the city, and shall remain at the assigned location regardless of changes of ownership or occupancy of the residence. Every dwelling in any zoning district within the city not zoned A-1 shall be provided a plastic cart for the disposal of garbage. 
(b)  Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, those residents who had purchased a private owner cart prior to September 2, 1997, will be exempt from the minimum six-month usage period and shall only be charged for those months they actually use such carts, provided they contact the utility billing office so the necessary adjustments can be made. 
(Code 1977, § 8.32.020; Ord. No. 672, § 1, 12-2-1997; Ord. No. 679, § 1, 12-2-1997)

Garbage shall be put in containers. Limbs which are securely bundled and tied and not exceeding three feet in length and weighing no more than 25 pounds will be picked up when placed no more than two feet from the curb or edge of the street. Grass clippings shall be placed in plastic bags no larger than 30 gallons and weighing no more than 25 pounds each.

No substances which are deleterious to the plastic cart shall be placed in them, and if the cart is damaged by a substance placed therein the expense of repair will be charged to the resident. 
(Code 1977, § 8.32.030; Ord. No. 672, § 1, 12-2-1997)  
Sec. 98-64. - Placement of mobile containers for collection; frequency of collection; exceptions to frequency of collections. 
(a)  Placement of mobile containers for collection; frequency of collection. By 7:00 a.m. on the day of pickup, the 90 gallon plastic carts should be placed in the street right-of-way not more than two feet from the curb or edge of the street surface whereby collectors can obtain them without going on private property. The front of the cart should be placed facing the street to allow the sanitation truck loader to grasp the cart for emptying. Carts shall be removed from the street right-of-way and returned to a location behind the front building line of the residence within 24 hours after the cart has been emptied by the collectors. Residents will be furnished once-a-week pickup. 
(b)  Exceptions to frequency of collections. Residents will be furnished a once-a-week pickup. However, there may be certain extraordinary circumstances in which this cannot be met, including, but not limited to, weather conditions in which the refuse trucks cannot safely operate on the streets of Mustang and/or to and from the dumping site. These conditions may also include, but not be limited to debris blocking the streets, ice or snow-packed streets, or flooding. In such instances, the sanitation provider will provide that service as soon as conditions permit. In such circumstances, the provider will also make an exception to the normal amount of additional plastic bags a resident is allowed. However, this exception does not allow for such items that would normally not be considered for a weekly pickup, and all waste items must still be prepared as stated in section 98-63. There will be no adjustment to any charges for services if that service is simply delayed for such circumstances. 
(Code 1977, § 8.32.040; Ord. No. 672, § 1, 12-2-1997; Ord. No. 767, § 1, 2-6-2001)  
Sec. 98-65. - Containers for commercial establishments. 
Containers for commercial establishments shall be owned and maintained by the city. Container rental shall be based upon the number of service pickups required by the business establishment and the size of the container. Business establishments will be provided a container for the accumulation of garbage, and such container shall be of such construction and design that it can be maintained in a sanitary condition. Small business establishments having a low enough volume of garbage and refuse that it can be accommodated in the 90-gallon plastic cart will be allowed to use the 90-gallon plastic carts and will be furnished the carts by the city at the cost of the carts to the city. 
(Code 1977, § 8.32.050)  
Sec. 98-66. - Use of municipal service required; monthly rate; deposit. 
All owners or occupants of all premises in the city shall be required to receive sanitation service and will be provided a 90-gallon plastic cart as directed in section 98-62. Every resident shall pay a monthly rate to the city clerk as the city council may establish. The city may require a utilities deposit in an amount to be determined annually by the city council.

(Code 1977, § 8.32.060)  
Sec. 98-67. - State user fee. 
On and after January 1, 1996, there is imposed upon each customer of the solid waste sanitation service operated by or through the city or the Mustang Improvement Authority a state user fee for landfill disposal sites as set forth in section 42-98. The fee shall be in addition to any periodic charges for sanitation services. The user fee shall be included in each billing cycle, shall be stated separately from any other periodic charges, and shall be identified as a fee necessitated by increased costs for utilization of landfill disposal sites for purposes of administration and enforcement of the provisions of the Oklahoma Solid Waste Management Act, pursuant to 27A O.S. § 2-10-802, as amended, effective January 1, 1996. The fee shall be collected insofar as practicable at the same time as, and in the same manner as, the periodic charges for sanitation service in accordance with the regular billing practice of the city and/or the Mustang Improvement Authority. The city and/or the Mustang Improvement Authority will use such monies to the extent necessary to defray the increased costs resulting from utilization of landfill disposal sites and related matters. 
(Code 1977, § 8.32.062)  
Sec. 98-68. - Private trash haulers. 
It shall be unlawful for any private contractor to furnish garbage and refuse, trash or rubbish removal service to any owner or occupant of any premises or to any individual, firm or corporation within the city where such service has been offered to such owner, occupant or individual, firm or corporation as provided in this section. It is further provided that any permit issued hereunder shall be revoked and the commercial services terminated when the city offers the services provided in this section. All agreements between commercial haulers and owner-occupants, individuals or firms or corporations within the city shall contain a clause incorporating this section or language substantially to the same legal effect. 
(Code 1977, § 8.32.065)  
Sec. 98-69. - Failure to pay for services; return of containers; damaging containers. 
(a)  A failure to pay the fees for sanitation services or any other utility services provided by the city within 60 days after being billed therefor shall result in the discontinuance of all utility services provided by the city. At least 48 hours prior to such termination of service, a notice of delinquency shall be delivered and hung on the door by the meter reader to the delinquent party. Such notice shall clearly state that all utility services will be terminated unless charges are paid within 48 hours of the date and time of this notice. A charge as set forth in section 42-98 will be assessed to replace a cart after nonpayment of the bill. The city shall be responsible for all normal wear and tear upon the carts, but any damage done through neglect or omission of the resident shall be repaired by the city, and the resident will be billed for such repairs. Upon a resident terminating his garbage service, the resident will account for his cart with the city and return the cart in good working condition, normal wear and tear excepted, and the failure to return the cart shall result in the total value of the cart being charged against the resident on his final bill. Vandalism or damage done to a cart by a party not the resident (third party) is declared to be a misdemeanor punishable in the municipal court of the city, and upon conviction thereof shall be punished by a fine not greater than $100.00 plus court costs. 
(b)  In addition to the remedies contained in subsection (a) of this section, the following penalties may result from any wilful violations of this article: 
(1)  Any person who willfully fails to pay for sanitation services used or made available when the payment has become overdue by at least 60 days shall be guilty of an offense. 
(2)  Each day the person willfully fails to pay for sanitation services so used or made available shall be deemed to be a separate offense. 
(3)  Upon conviction for the offense of wilful failure to pay a utility bill for sanitation services used or made available, the person convicted shall be punished as provided in section 1-8. 
(4)  The terms "wilful" and "willfully," as used in this section, carry the implication that, for guilt in the offense described in this section, the act must have been done willingly, beyond a reasonable doubt, rather than for the reasons of financial inability to pay in full a city utility bill for sanitation services when and after such a bill is due. It is the intent of the city that a punishable omission must be knowingly, willfully and willingly done by person having the ability to pay, in whole or in part, the city sanitation bill in question. Bona fide indigency may be an affirmative defense to the charge of willingly or willfully not paying the city sanitation bill when such indigency is successfully proved by the defendant.

Secs. 106-268106-290. - Reserved.  
ARTICLE V. - DESIGN STANDARDS 
 
Sec. 106-291. - General principles. 
The quality of design of the urban area is dependent on the quality of design of the individual subdivisions that compose it. Good community design requires the coordination of the efforts of each subdivider and developer of land within the urban area. Therefore, the design of each subdivision shall be prepared in accordance with the principles established by the comprehensive plan for land use, circulation, community facilities and public utility services, and in accordance with the general principles set out in this article. 
(Code 1977, § 16.16.010)  
Sec. 106-292. - Planning units. 
It is intended that the Mustang urban area should be designed as a group of integrated residential neighborhoods and appropriate commercial, industrial and public facilities. The neighborhood, as a planning unit, is intended as an area principally for residential use, and of a size that can be served by one elementary school. Space for religious, recreational, educational and shopping facilities to serve the residents of the neighborhood should be provided and designed as an integral part of each neighborhood. 
(Code 1977, § 16.16.011)  
Sec. 106-293. - Size of lots and other areas to be adequate for intended use. 
The size of lots and blocks and other areas for residential, commercial, industrial and public uses should be designed to provide adequate light, air, open space, landscaping, and off-street parking and loading facilities. 
(Code 1977, § 16.16.012)  
Sec. 106-294. - Preservation of topography and natural physical features. 
The arrangement of lots, blocks and the street system should be designed to make the most advantageous use of topography and natural physical features. Tree masses and large individual trees should be preserved. The system of sidewalks and roadways and the lot layout should be designed to take advantage of the visual qualities of the area. 
(Code 1977, § 16.16.013)  
Sec. 106-295. - Traffic circulation. 
Circulation within the urban area shall be provided in accordance with the following design criteria: 
(1)  Each subdivision shall provide for the continuation of all arterial streets and highways as shown on the transportation plan map. Arterial streets should be located on the perimeter of the residential neighborhood. 
(2)  Minor streets should be designed to provide access to each parcel of land within the residential neighborhood and within industrial areas, and in a manner that will discourage use by through traffic. They should be planned so that future urban expansion will not require the conversion of local streets to collector or arterial routes. 
(3)  Collector streets should be designed to provide a direct route from other minor streets to the major street system. 
(4)  All subdivision street systems should be designed to allow vehicular and pedestrian circulation within subdivisions and from one subdivision to another. 
(5)  Ingress and egress to residential properties shall be provided only on minor streets and, where design allows, restricted to local streets only. 
(6)  Pedestrian ways should be separated from roadways used by vehicular traffic. Sidewalks shall be designed to provide all residential building sites as required by section 106-370 with direct access to all neighborhood facilities, including elementary schools, parks and playgrounds, churches and shopping centers. 
(Code 1977, § 16.16.014)  
Sec. 106-296. - Implementation of comprehensive plan. 
(a)  Minimum standards for development are contained in the zoning ordinance, the building code and this chapter. However, the comprehensive plan expresses policies which are intended to achieve optimum quality of development in the urban area. If only the minimum standards are followed, as expressed by the various ordinances regulating land development, a standardization of development will occur. 
(b)  Subdivision design shall be of a quality to carry out the purpose and spirit of the policies expressed in the comprehensive plan and in this chapter rather than be limited to the minimum standards required in this chapter. 
(Code 1977, § 16.16.015)  
Sec. 106-297. - Compliance with other regulations. 
(a)  In addition to the requirements established in this chapter, all subdivision plats shall comply with the following laws, rules and regulations: 
(1)  All applicable statutory provisions; 
(2)  The provisions of this Code, including all requirements of chapter 122, pertaining to zoning, chapter 18, pertaining to buildings and building regulations, chapter 118, pertaining to utilities, and chapter 102, pertaining to streets and sidewalks; 
(3)  The city's comprehensive plan, including section 3.0, Goals, Objectives and Policies, the Transportation Plan Map and the Utility Plan Map; 
(4)  All laws, rules and regulations of the health department and appropriate state agencies; 
(5)  The requirements of the state department of transportation if the subdivision or any lot contained therein abuts a state highway or connecting street; and 
(6)  The standards and regulations adopted by the director and by all boards, commissions, agencies and officials of the city dealing with the subdivision of land. 
(b)  If the owner of land proposed to be subdivided places restrictions on any of the land contained in the subdivision which are greater than those required by this chapter or any regulations stated in this section, such restrictions or a reference thereto should be indicated on the subdivision plat. 
(Code 1977, § 16.16.020)  
Sec. 106-298. - Streets. 
The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade and location of all streets shall conform to all of the elements of the comprehensive plan, including the standards contained in the transportation plan, and shall be designed in accordance with the following provisions: 
(1)  Integration with street system. All streets shall be properly integrated with the existing and proposed system of thoroughfares and dedicated rights-of-way as established on the transportation plan and shall provide for the integration of future streets. 
(2)  Conformance with transportation plan. Major streets shall be planned to conform with the transportation plan map. 
(3)  Subdivisions abutting or containing major street. Whenever a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed major street, the planning commission may require service streets, reverse frontage with screen planting contained in a nonaccess reservation along the rear property line, deep lots, or such other treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection of residential properties and to afford separation of arterial and local traffic. 
(4)  Minor streets. Minor streets shall be designed so that their use by arterial traffic will be discouraged, to conform as much as possible to topography, to permit efficient drainage and utility systems, and to require the minimum number of streets necessary for convenient and safe access to property. 
(5)  Provision for future streets and resubdivision. When a tract is subdivided into lots containing one or more acres, such lots or parcels shall be arranged to permit the logical location and opening of future streets and appropriate resubdivision with provision for adequate utility easements and connections for such resubdivisions. 
(6)  Provision for development of adjoining properties. The arrangement of streets shall be such as to cause no hardship in the subdividing of adjacent properties. The planning commission may require the dedication of street rights-of-way to facilitate the development of adjoining properties.

Notes: 
(1)  All streets (except rural estates) shall have six-inch curbs and provide storm drainage as per chapter 50, article III. Stopping sight distances for vertical alignment shall be determined by use of the methods given on page 609 of the Traffic Engineering Handbook, third edition, Washington Institute of Traffic Engineers, 1965. 
(2)  A cul-de-sac shall not exceed 500 feet in length, measured from the nearest street right-of-way line to the outer curbline (or edge of street paving in rural estate zoning) of the cul-de-sac. When topography or ownership create a hardship, the planning commission may waive the 500-foot maximum cul-de-sac length, but in no case shall the cul-de-sac length be in excess of 1,000 feet. If the street is more than 150 feet in length, a turnaround shall be provided. Culs-de-sac shall be designed in accordance with the design standards for city streets. 
(3)  An intersection sight triangle shall be used as per city codes. 
(4)  Rural estate streets shall be provided with bar ditches that have sufficient capacity to manage the storm drainage requirements per chapter 50, article III. Stormwater shall be contained within the bar ditches. Drainage culverts shall be provided with sufficient capacity to manage storm drainage per chapter 50, article III. The size of each culvert shall be shown on the preliminary plat. 
_____ 
(8)  Right-of-way width. Street right-of-way widths shall be in accordance with table 1, and where not otherwise designated it shall be the responsibility of the developer to dedicate rights-of-way to provide a width of not less than required in this chapter. 
(9)  Earth slopes. Right-of-way widths in excess of the standards designated in table 1 may be required whenever, due to topography, additional width is necessary to provide earth slopes. Slopes in excess of 2.5 to 1 shall be supported by a retaining wall or other construction method approved by the city council as recommended by the city engineer. 
(10)  Subdivisions abutting or containing limited access highway or railroad right-of-way. Where a subdivision borders on or contains a railroad right-of-way or limited access highway right-of-way, the planning commission may require a street approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of the intervening land. Such distances also shall be determined with due regard for the requirements of approach grades and future grade separation structures. 
(11)  Reserve strips. The creation of reserve strips shall not be permitted adjacent to a proposed or existing public easement or right-of-way in such manner that it denies access from adjacent property to the street or easement, except where their control is placed in the city under conditions approved by the planning commission and city council. 
(12)  Intersections. 
a.  Streets shall be designed to intersect, as nearly as possible, at right angles (90 degrees). 
b.  No more than two streets shall intersect at any one point unless specifically approved by the planning commission. 
c.  Street jogs with centerlines of less than 150 feet apart shall be avoided. The planning commission shall require that streets be connected in such a manner that a smooth flow of traffic and the elimination of traffic hazards are ensured. 
d.  Street corners shall have a minimum radius of 25 feet at the curbline. Street intersections involving major streets and highways shall have a minimum street corner radius of 30 feet at the curbline. Alley intersections and abrupt changes in alignment within a block shall have the corners rounded to permit safe vehicular movement in accordance with section 106-299 and standard engineering practice.

When developments of commercial or industrial properties are to be located across from each other along a section line road, the ingress and egress driveways shall be in alignment. 
(14)  Street access for commercial and industrial subdivisions. Commercial or industrial subdivisions should have access to an arterial street and may have access to a collector street if traffic conditions, as determined by the planning commission, warrant such extension, but shall not have access to a residential street. 
(15)  Dead-end streets. 
a.  Permanent dead-end streets or culs-de-sac shall be designed in accordance with standards in the transportation plan. A cul-de-sac shall not exceed 500 feet in length, measured from the entrance to the center of the turnaround, and shall have a turnaround having a radius of not less than 50 feet at the property line and not less than 40 feet at the curbline; however, when deemed advisable, the planning commission may permit a variation from this length in order to adjust for topographic conditions. In all instances, provisions shall be made for adequate storm drainage structures to prevent water from standing in the end of a cul-de-sac or stub street. The cul-de-sac's terminus shall be no closer than 100 feet from the right-of-way line to the boundary of adjoining property. 
b.  The arrangement of streets should provide for the continuance of local, collector or arterial streets between adjacent properties when such continuation is deemed necessary by the planning commission for convenient movement of traffic, for effective fire protection, or for efficient provision of utilities, where such continuation is an accordance with the comprehensive plan and transportation plan. If the adjacent property is undeveloped and the street must be a dead-end street temporarily, the right-of-way shall be extended to the property line. In the phasing of a final plat, a temporary turnabout may be required for temporary dead-end streets in excess of 1,000 feet. Temporary stub streets shall be permitted up to 200 feet, if adjoining property is under separate ownership. The planning commission may limit the length of temporary dead-end streets in accordance with the design standards of this chapter. 
c.  For temporary dead-end streets in excess of 1,000 feet as allowed in subsection (15)b of this section, the subdivider shall post signs stating that the street is a dead-end street, as well as providing fire hydrants along the radius. For permanent dead-end streets, the applicant shall be required to post signs and provide fire hydrants according to the requirements of section 106-444. In all instances, provisions must be made for adequate storm drainage structures to prevent water from standing in the end of the cul-de-sac or stub street. 
(16)  Access to major streets from residential subdivisions. Whenever a residential subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed major street, access to such major street shall be limited by one or more of the following means: 
a.  Access from a major street to individual lots shall be prohibited. 
b.  Reverse frontage may be required with screened plantings along the rear property line. Deep lots or other such treatment may be required along with this solution. For corner lots or lots with double or reverse frontage, the planning commission shall require that a "Limits of No Access" note be placed on the face of the final plat resulting in no access from collector streets or major streets when a lot may derive its access from a local street. 
c.  A series of culs-de-sac, U-shaped streets or short loops entered from and designed generally at right angles to a parallel street with the rear line of their terminal lots backing onto major streets shall be encouraged. 
(17)  Half streets. Half streets shall be prohibited except where essential to the reasonable development of the subdivision in conformity with other requirements of this chapter, and provided that the planning staff recommends to the planning commission that it will be practical to obtain the dedication of the other half of the street easement when the adjoining property is subdivided. Wherever a half street is adjacent to the tract to be subdivided, the other half of the street shall be platted within the tract being subdivided. 
(18)  Improvement of existing streets; dedication of additional right-of-way. Where a subdivision borders an existing street or road not meeting city standards or specifications, or when the comprehensive plan, transportation plan or zoning setback requirements indicate plans for realignment or widening of that street or road which would require use of some of the land in the subdivision, the applicant shall dedicate the additional right-of-way from the centerline. All arterial or section line roads abutting or bordering a proposed subdivision shall be improved to city standards and specifications. Upon recommendation by the city engineer, the planning commission may require the improvement of an abutting collector or local street or road, or any part thereof, to city standards and specifications. Land reserved for any public street or road purposes shall not be counted in satisfying yard or area requirements of the zoning ordinance. The land shall be either dedicated to the city in fee simple, as an easement, or as a dedication on an approved final plat. 
(19)  Street names generally. No street names shall be used which will duplicate or be confused with the names of existing streets. Street names shall be subject to the approval of the planning commission. (Refer to chapter 102, article III.) 
(20)  Street names for continuations of existing streets. Streets that are obviously in alignment with other already existing streets shall bear the names or numbers of the existing streets. 
(Code 1977, § 16.16.021; Ord. No. 753, § 1, 6-6-2000; Ord. No. 834, § 1, 4-15-2003)  
Sec. 106-299. - Alleys. 
(a)  Alleys shall be provided in commercial and industrial districts, except that, upon recommendation by the planning staff, the planning commission may waive this requirement where other definite and assured provision is made for service access, such as adequate off-street loading, unloading and parking facilities, consistent with and adequate for the uses proposed. 
(b)  Alleys serving commercial and industrial areas shall not be less than 30 feet in width, and if provided shall be paved in accordance with city standards and specifications. 
(c)  Placement of utilities under paved alleys should be avoided in commercial or industrial areas which contain utility lines. 
(d)  Alleys are not required in residential areas, but when provided shall be not less than 20 feet in width and shall be paved in accordance with city standards and specifications. 
(e)  Alley intersections and sharp changes in alignment shall be avoided, but, where necessary, corners shall be designed and constructed in such a manner as to permit safe and convenient vehicular movement. 
(f)  Where alley intersections are unavoidable, as in "T," "L" or "H" alley configurations, a sight triangle at each intersection corner shall be provided. Corner lines shall be cut with a chord to provide a sight triangle with legs of ten feet from the point of intersection along both alley right-of-way lines. The sight triangle shall be included in the alley easement. 
(g)  Dead-end alleys shall be avoided, but, where unavoidable, shall be provided with adequate turnaround facilities at the dead end, as determined by the planning commission. 
(Code 1977, § 16.16.022)  
Sec. 106-300. - Easements; installation of utilities. 
(a)  Utility easements required. The subdivider shall dedicate to the public easements to the end that each and every lot within a subdivision shall have access to all available essential public utilities. 
(b)  Width of utility easements. Where alleys are not provided, easements of not less than ten feet shall be provided along each rear lot line, resulting in a 20-foot total easement along rear lot lines. If the area abuts property not previously subdivided, a 20-foot easement is required along the boundary of the subdivision; however, if the subdivider is able to obtain a ten-foot utility easement (by separate document in favor of the city) on this abutting property, then the subdivider is required only to dedicate ten feet of easement on his property. Where utility easements are necessary or required along side lot lines of individual lots, a ten-foot easement shall be required, centered on the property line, with five feet in each abutting lot. On such side lot easements, the side yard setback line will be measured from the near edge of the utility easement to the structure. 
(c)  Private improvements on utility easements. Private improvements on utility easements should be avoided; however, when an improvement such as fencing, landscaping, a driveway or parking is placed upon utility easements, the property owner shall be responsible for replacement or repair of any improvements when utilities must be repaired or replaced. No private improvement shall be situated on or across an easement in the rear yard unless a revocable permit is first obtained from the city manager. 
(d)  Authority to require aerial easements or easements of greater width. Aerial easements and easements of greater width for either extension of main sanitary sewers or other utilities, storm sewers and drainage, or the accommodation of utilities in unique situations, such as but not limited to lots backing onto unplatted land, may be required where deemed necessary by the planning commission. 
(e)  Drainage easements. Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainage channel or stream, there shall be provided a right-of-way or easement for drainage, public open space and utility purposes adequate to contain all of the runoff from a 100-year flood. In addition, the easement shall be determined with due regard for convenient access of maintenance equipment, which requires a minimum of eight feet in width for access. In no case shall a drainage easement be less than 25 feet in width. All other requirements of the comprehensive plan, chapter 50, article III, pertaining to storm sewers, chapter 50, article II, pertaining to flood prevention, and other related regulations shall be met. 
(f)  Utility easements for private roads. For all subdivisions utilizing private roads, public utility easements having a minimum width of 20 feet shall be provided on one side adjacent to and outside of the designated right-of-way of the private roads. 
(g)  Location and depth of utility lines. 
(1)  Separation of water and sewer lines. A minimum horizontal distance of ten feet shall be maintained between parallel water and sanitary sewer lines. 
(2)  Placement in 20-foot easements. The placement of utilities within a 20-foot easement shall be as follows: 
a.  The electric line shall be located in the easement four feet north or east of the centerline. 
b.  The telephone line shall be located in the easement two feet north or east of the centerline. 
c.  The sewer or water line shall be located in the easement four feet south or west of the centerline. 
d.  The cable TV line shall be located within the easement six feet south or west of the centerline. 
e.  The natural gas line shall be located within the easement eight feet south or west of the centerline. 
(3)  Placement in 15-foot easements. The placement of utilities within 15-foot easements shall be as follows: 
a.  The electric line shall be located within the easement 2½ feet north or east of the centerline. 
b.  The telephone line shall be located within the easement 1½ feet north or east of the centerline. 
c.  The sewer or water line shall be located within the easement 2½ feet south or west of the centerline. 
d.  The cable TV line shall be located within the easement 3½ feet south and west of the centerline. 
e.  The gas line shall be located within the easement 6½ feet south or west of the centerline. 
(4)  Depth. The depth of utility lines shall be as follows: 
a.  The electric line shall be laid at a depth of approximately 40 inches. 
b.  The telephone line shall be laid at a depth of 18 to 24 inches. 
c.  The water line shall be laid at a minimum depth of three feet six inches. 
d.  The sewer line shall be laid at a depth in accordance with standard engineering practices and as approved by the city engineer. 
e.  The cable TV line shall be laid at a depth of 12 inches. 
f.  The natural gas line shall be laid at a depth of 24 to 30 inches. 
(h)  Order of construction of utilities. 
(1)  Electrical lines, telephone or television cables and/or gas mains shall not be buried in public easements prior to the installation of required water, sewer and stormwater drainage improvements being constructed; provided that in all cases the lines having the greatest depth shall be constructed first. 
(2)  The city engineer may permit the construction of utility tunnels and or conduits which meet city criteria and standards prior to the construction of water, sewer or stormwater drainage improvements. 
(i)  Conflicts with existing private easements. When existing private easements may potentially interfere with a proposed public dedication or easement, the subdivision shall be designed to minimize the number and extent of places where such existing private easements cross public easements. 
(j)  All new electrical distribution lines in the City of Mustang must be placed underground. 
All electrical distribution and service lines in new subdivisions must be placed underground within dedicated utility easements so as to promote and preserve the health, safety and general welfare of the public and to assure the orderly development of all such new additions and subdivisions. 
If it does not prove to be feasible to bury the new lines, the utility company may apply for a variance to this ordinance through the Mustang Planning Commission who will make a recommendation to the city council. 
A variance from this ordinance may be granted only upon a finding by the city council that: 
(1)  The application of this chapter to the particular area would create an unnecessary hardship; 
(2)  Such conditions are peculiar to the particular area involved; 
(3)  Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good, or impair the purposes and intent of this chapter or the comprehensive plan; 
(4)  The variance, if granted, would be the minimum necessary to alleviate the unnecessary hardship. 
(Code 1977, § 16.16.023; Ord. No. 903, § 1, 4-20-2004; Ord. No. 1138, § 1, 5-3-2016)  
Sec. 106-301. - Public areas and open space. 
Public parks, playgrounds, school sites and other public areas and open spaces shall be provided in accordance with the requirements set forth in the comprehensive plan and in the ordinances relating thereto. Refer to article VI of this chapter for required park land dedication. 
(Code 1977, § 16.16.024)  
Sec. 106-302. - Blocks. 
(a)  The lengths, widths and shapes of blocks shall be determined with due regard for the following: 
(1)  Provision of adequate building sites suitable to the special needs of the type of use contemplated; 
(2)  Zoning requirements as to lot sizes and dimensions; 
(3)  Need for convenient access, circulation, control and safety of street traffic; and 
(4)  Limitations and opportunities of topography. 
(b)  Blocks for residential use shall not be longer than 1,800 feet or less than 500 feet measured along the centerline of the block. Wherever practical, blocks along primary arterial and secondary arterial streets shall be not less than 1,000 feet. 
(c)  When a block exceeds 600 feet in length, the planning commission may require a dedicated easement not less than 15 feet in width and a paved crosswalk not less than four feet in width to provide pedestrian access across the block. Such pedestrian walkways or crosswalks may be required by the planning commission if deemed essential to provide circulation or access to schools, playgrounds, shopping centers, transportation or other community facilities. 
(d)  Blocks used for residential purposes shall be of sufficient width to allow for two tiers of lots of appropriate depth, but shall not be less than 220 feet in width except where otherwise required to separate residential development from through traffic. Other exceptions to this prescribed block width shall be permitted for blocks adjacent to major streets, railroads or waterways. Such exceptions are allowed provided other applicable provisions of this chapter are met. 
(e)  Blocks intended for business and industrial use shall be of a width and depth suitable for the intended use, with due allowance for off-street parking and loading facilities. 
(Code 1977, § 16.16.025)  
Sec. 106-303. - Lots. 
(a)  Generally. The lot arrangement shall be such that there will be no foreseeable difficulties for reasons of topography or other conditions in securing a building permit. All lots shall be arranged to comply with the comprehensive plan, the zoning ordinance, all drainage ordinances and building codes and all other ordinances of the city, and to provide access from an approach street. 
(b)  Dimensions. Lot dimensions shall comply with the minimum standards of the zoning ordinance. Additional requirements shall be as follows: 
(1)  Lots shall have a width, depth and area of not less than that required by the zoning ordinance. Lots, tracts or parcels created for a particular commercial or industrial use shall have sufficient area and dimensions to provide for off-street parking and loading facilities as required by the zoning ordinance for the type of use and development proposed. 
(2)  Corner lots shall have an extra width that is adequate to permit building setbacks from side streets and front streets. 
(3)  Side lot lines shall be at right angles to street lines or radial to curving street lines, except in townhouse development abutting a curved linear right-of-way. 
(4)  Corner lot lines shall be cut with a chord to provide a sight triangle with legs of 25 feet from the point of intersection of the property lines along both property lines. The triangle shall be dedicated to the city and be included in the street right-of-way easement. 
(5)  The 2002 edition of the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality, Title 252, Oklahoma Administrative Code, Chapter 641, "Individual and Small Public On-Site Sewage Disposal Systems" guidelines and all subsequent amendments or revisions are adopted by reference. 
(c)  Lots under one ownership; lots for commercial and industrial uses. Where a block is to be developed and retained under single ownership, it is not required that the block be subdivided into lots; however, the block must meet all requirements of this chapter and other applicable regulations for lots and blocks, including lot sizes and dimensions. All lots proposed for commercial or industrial use shall abut upon a dedicated street, and shall be of appropriate size and arrangement to provide for adequate off-street parking and loading facilities based on the intended use. No individual parcel shall be created for a particular commercial or industrial use that has an area, width or depth that is less than is required for the permitted use under the applicable provisions of the zoning ordinance. 
(d)  Double frontage and reverse frontage lots. Double frontage and reverse frontage lots shall be avoided, except where they are needed to provide for the separation of residential development from traffic arteries or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation. In all cases, a sight-proof screening shall be provided and shall not be less than six feet in height. The sight-proof screening shall be provided along the rear portion of the lots abutting such a traffic artery. There shall be no right of access to the rear or side portion of any lot abutting such traffic artery. 
(e)  Street access. Low or medium density residential lots shall not derive access from a major street. Lots facing collector streets should be minimized to the fullest extent possible. Where a lot borders a collector street and a local street, access shall be gained from the local street only. If lots have access on local streets, the planning commission shall require on the face of the final plat a note limiting access for lots that back or side onto a collector, arterial or other major street. Where driveway access from a major or arterial street may be necessary for several adjoining lots, the planning commission may require that such lots be served by a combined access drive in order to limit possible traffic hazards. Driveways should be designed and arranged so that vehicles avoid backing into major or arterial streets. It is encouraged that driveways should be designed and arranged so that vehicles avoid backing into collector streets. 
(f)  Drainage. Lots shall be laid out so as to provide positive drainage away from all buildings. Individual lot drainage shall be coordinated with the general storm drainage pattern for the area. Drainage shall be designed so as to avoid concentration of storm drainage water from each lot to adjacent lots. (Refer to chapter 50, article III, for storm sewer and drainage requirements.)

Sec. 106-304. - Building and setback lines. 
(a)  Building lines shall be provided for all residential subdivisions as required by the zoning ordinance. 
(b)  Where crosswalks are provided or required, a side yard building line shall be provided not less than ten feet back of a crosswalk right-of-way line on the side of a lot abutting a midblock crosswalk. 
(c)  Platted building lines shown on an approved final plat that are more restrictive than the setback requirements of the zoning ordinance shall represent the mandatory setback lines. 
(Code 1977, § 16.16.027)  
Sec. 106-305. - Planned unit developments. 
(a)  Whenever a subdivision is developed as a neighborhood unit under the requirements and allowances of chapter 122, article VIII, pertaining to planned unit developments, the planning commission may vary the requirements of this chapter having to do with design, but not of procedures or improvements, in order to allow the subdivider more freedom in the arrangement of streets and lots, but at the same time protect the convenience, health, safety and general welfare of the future residents of the subdivision as well as the character of the surrounding property and the general welfare of the entire community. 
(b)  In addition to the requirements of chapter 122, article VIII, the following requirements shall apply: 
(1)  Review as to subdivision requirements shall be carried out simultaneously with the processing of the planned unit development application if the division of the land, vacant or improved, into two or more lots, parcels, sites, units, plots or interests for the purpose of offer, sale, lease or development, either on the installment plan or upon any or all other plans, terms or conditions, including resubdivision, whether residential or nonresidential, is part of and integral to the planned unit development application; and 
(2)  The applicant may submit an application for preliminary plat review and approval for all or part of the development concurrent with an application for planned unit development, even though such submittal is not mandatory under this chapter. 
(c)  The following procedure shall be required for simultaneous preliminary plat review and approval as set forth in subsection (b) of this section: 
(1)  An application for preliminary plat review or approval shall be submitted along with the application for planned unit development approval to the planning commission in accordance with the requirements and procedures of this chapter. 
(2)  The planning commission shall review the planned unit development application and shall forward its comments and recommendations to the city council. 
(3)  The planning commission shall review the preliminary plat, and if it finds that the plat conforms to this chapter and other applicable regulations, may grant tentative approval pending approval of the planned unit development application by the city council. Tentative approval of such plat shall vest no rights or interest to the applicant until the planned unit development is approved by the city council. 
(d)  A planned unit development may be subdivided or resubdivided for purposes of sale or lease after the planned unit development has been finally approved and development completed or partially completed, except when the proposed subdivision creates a change in the planned unit development design. If the change affects planned unit development boundaries or density of uses or if there are major changes to streets, drainage, utilities, etc., then the planning commission may approve the subdivision or resubdivision subject to city council approval of an amended planned unit development. 
(Code 1977, § 16.16.030)  
Section 106-306. - Storage area; garages required. 
(a)  All residential dwellings, including manufactured and mobile homes, shall contain one or more storage area(s) for each dwelling unit which may be in a basement located under said dwelling, in a closet area, and/ or in a separate fully enclosed structure on the site, which may be a garage, the total of which area shall be equal to not less than 15 percent of the interior living area of each dwelling. 
(b)  All one-family dwellings (including modular homes), two-family dwellings, townhouses and multifamily dwelling units must have a minimum of two off-street parking spaces for each family dwelling units, one of which must be in an enclosed garage. Said garage must measure not less than ten feet in width and 20 feet in depth. From and after the effective date of this ordinance, all conversions from existing garages to living area shall be reviewed by the community development director or his designee, before any permits will be issued, to ensure that all parking and storage requirements will be met. This section shall not apply to mobile homes.

The determination as to whether land dedication or a monetary contribution is to be made for a particular subdivision shall be made by the city council, based upon the recommendation of the leisure services board and the standards set forth in the comprehensive plan. The following procedures will apply: 
(1)  Prior to the submittal of a preliminary plat, the developer of a potential subdivision shall submit to the planning staff a sketch plan of the proposed subdivision. The developer shall consult with the planning staff about a set of mutually agreeable park sites and/or fee dedication. 
(2)  The developer shall attend a review session with the leisure services board prior to the submittal of a preliminary plat and prior to making detailed engineering studies or plans. A quorum of three voting members of the leisure services board is needed to make recommendations on a park dedication issue. 
(3)  Recommendations made by the leisure services board shall be referred to the city council. Recommendations shall be made on the following: 
a.  Dedication or fees in lieu of land; 
b.  Size of land to be dedicated; 
c.  Location of land to be dedicated; and 
d.  Any required improvements of park land. 
(4)  Upon receiving the recommendation from the leisure services board, the city council shall consider the matter. Recommendations shall be based on this chapter and the comprehensive plan. 
(5)  The city council shall, upon review of the sketch plan and the recommendations of the leisure services board, make a decision on the type and amount of land to be dedicated and location of the park dedication, or fee in lieu of land, and any required park land improvements. If land is required, the site shall be indicated on the preliminary plat as reserved for future dedication for city council approval. When required, the monetary contribution shall be paid prior to the final acceptance of the final plat by the city council. 
(6)  Further refinement of acres (or fee in lieu of if required by the council) shall be made on the preliminary plat. Exact measures of land (or fee in lieu of) may be made when the final plat is submitted for approval. 
(7)  If a subdivision is to be platted in phases, the city council shall decide how phasing of land dedication or fee in lieu of will be accomplished. 
(Code 1977, § 16.20.040; Ord. No. 708, § 1, 3-2-1999)  
Sec. 106-335. - Calculation of required land area. 
(a)  The land area to be dedicated from a residential subdivision plat shall be determined by the following formula: 
2 Acres × Each 1,000 Persons Projected to Occupy the Fully Developed Subdivision = Amount of Land to be Dedicated 
Which is: 
0.002 Acres × Number of Persons per Dwelling × Number of Dwelling Units Projected for Subdivision = Amount of Land to be Dedicated 
(b)  In determining the number of persons projected to occupy a subdivision, the most recent federal decennial census statistics on number of persons per dwelling unit for the city shall be used. These figures shall be calculated by the planning staff and approved by the planning commission. 
(Code 1977, § 16.20.050; Ord. No. 708, § 1, 3-2-1999)  
Sec. 106-336. - Calculation of amount of monetary contribution; payment. 
(a)  In those instances where it is established that less than 1,500 persons will ultimately occupy any given subdivision as reflected by the sketch plan submitted, the planning staff and the leisure services board, as described in this article, shall review the plan and promptly recommend to the city council whether land or money should be required of the developer and builder. The city council shall then make the final decision. 
(b)  If a fee in lieu of land contribution is required, the amount of the fee shall be determined at the time of final platting according to the following formula: 
(1)  Fees in lieu of park land dedication will be calculated on a per-unit cost of $100.00 per unit. In the event of multi-unit dwellings or structures, each individual dwelling unit shall be deemed a unit for purposes of calculation of fees. 
(2)  One-half of this fee ($50.00) shall be due from the developer, as shown on the preliminary or final plat, and one-half ($50.00) shall be due by the builder as shown on the building permit; provided that nothing shall prevent either party from paying the entire fee. 
(3)  Fees due from or attributable to the developer and builder shall be placed in the park improvement fund. 
(c)  The entire amount of the fees assessed must be paid prior to recording the final plat. 
(Code 1977, § 16.20.060; Ord. No. 708, § 1, 3-2-1999)  
Sec. 106-337. - Credit for dedicating land in excess of requirements; deviations from preliminary plat. 
(a)  The city council may determine that a developer may dedicate more land than would be required by the formulas set out in this article and receive a written credit against future mandatory park land dedications. Where a developer dedicates land against future requirements, the development which is thereby relieved of all or part of its mandatory park land dedication requirement must be in the same general area as that served by the dedicated credit land, such general area to be at the city's sole determination. The credit shall attach to the relieved land and remain with the relieved land, regardless of change in ownership thereof. 
(b)  If a developer deviates from the approved preliminary plat in final platting or rezones land within the preliminary plat which has the effect of increasing the density of population over the earlier population density estimates made under this article, or where the use of property is changed from a nonresidential use to a residential use, the owner or subdivider shall be obligated to provide additional land or a fee based on the value of the previously platted land to compensate for the increase in population. Such contribution shall be made prior to the city issuing a building permit or the city council approving a final plat. 
(Code 1977, § 16.20.070; Ord. No. 708, § 1, 3-2-1999)  
Sec. 106-338. - Suitability of dedicated land. 
Any land dedicated to meet the requirements of this article shall be reasonably located and adaptable for use as an active park or recreation facility as defined by the comprehensive plan. Factors to be used in evaluating the adequacy of the proposed park and recreation land areas include but are not limited to the following: 
(1)  Unity. The dedicated land should form a single parcel or tract of land at least three acres in size, unless the leisure services board determines that a smaller tract would be in the public interest or that additional contiguous land will be reasonably available for dedication to or purchased by the city. 
(2)  Shape. The shape of the parcel or tract of land to be dedicated should be appropriate for park and recreation purposes, i.e., ball diamonds, tennis courts and usable open space. 
(3)  Access. Public access to park land shall be approved by the planning commission and delineated on the preliminary plat. The access shall consist of at least 150 feet of street frontage. At the time the land abutting the delineated areas is developed, the developer of such abutting land shall furnish and pay for paving all abutting street frontage and shall provide water and sewer access to the boundary of at least one side of the delineated area to meet minimum requirements as determined by the chief building inspector and/or city engineer. 
(4)  Topography. The land to be dedicated to meet the requirements of this article should be suitable for parks, open spaces and recreation activities. Fifty percent of the land to be dedicated shall not exceed five percent grade. 
(5)  Location. The land to be dedicated shall be located so as to serve the recreation and open space needs of the subdivision for which the dedication is made. However, an evaluation of possible locations would also include factors such as freedom from possible safety hazards, i.e., major thoroughfares, and unusable land such as floodplains or drainage channels. 
(6)  Usable open space. For purposes of this section, usable open space is defined to mean any parcel of land which meets the requirements as to suitability, and does not necessarily require that the land be appropriate for such recreation purposes as ball diamonds, soccer, tennis and organized sports. Usable open space uses would also include but not be limited to the following: hiking trails, arboretums, bike paths, picnic areas, existing or planned greenbelt areas to be left in their natural state, linkage parcels for the greenbelt corridors as shown on the comprehensive plan, and similar uses that would benefit the public either from natural beauty or open space type of recreation use. 
(Code 1977, § 16.20.080; Ord. No. 708, § 1, 3-2-1999)  
Sec. 106-339. - Use of monetary contributions. 
A separate fund to be entitled "Park Improvement Fund" is hereby created and will contain all money paid in by developers, builders, owners, subdividers or others at final approval of subdivision plats in lieu of the dedication of land. The fees and the interest accrued thereon shall be held in the fund, to be used only for the purposes of purchasing park land or for the improvement, development and maintenance of park and recreational land and for recreational facilities and programs within the general area in which the subdivision is located, as determined by the city council. It is specifically provided that the general area can include any location within the city boundaries when it is determined by the city council that such expenditures will inure to the benefit of the entire city. 
(Code 1977, § 16.20.090; Ord. No. 708, § 1, 3-2-1999)  
Sec. 106-340. - Conveyance of dedicated land. 
Land accepted for dedication under the requirements of this article shall be conveyed by one of the following methods: 
(1)  By dedication to the city within the plat to be filed of record in the office of the county clerk; or 
(2)  By warranty deed transferring the property in fee simple to the city. 
(Code 1977, § 16.20.100; Ord. No. 708, § 1, 3-2-1999)  
Sec. 106-341. - Moratorium on park land dedications. 
(a)  The City of Mustang finds that it currently has sufficient dedicated park lands to serve the needs of the citizens of the City of Mustang, and finds that a monetary contribution in lieu of park land dedication shall be required of developers on all applications for approval of zoning requests, preliminary plats or final plats filed or pending with the City of Mustang. 
(b)  On all applications for approval of zoning requests, preliminary plats or final plats filed or pending with the City of Mustang, a moratorium on compliance with section 106-334 is declared, except as provided in subsection (d), below. Instead, the fee in lieu of park land dedication set forth in subsection 106-336(b) shall be due from developers and builders. 
(c)  The duties of the leisure services board as set forth in section 106-333 shall be suspended during the period that this moratorium remains in effect, except for purposes of reviewing inquiries pursuant to subsection (d). 
(d)  In the event the city planning department desires to include a dedicated park within its proposed development, the developer shall follow the procedure set forth in section 106-334, in which event the leisure services board shall review the request and make its determination and recommendation to the city council in the same manner as it would have in the absence of this declared moratorium.

Sec. 106-366. - Sanitary sewer system. 
(a)  The subdivider shall provide a sewage collection and disposal system in accordance with this chapter and all other applicable ordinances, standards or regulations. 
(b)  The subdivider shall, at his expense, install all sanitary sewers whenever a public sanitary sewer is reasonably accessible or procurable. For purposes of this section, a public sewer system is considered reasonably accessible if an existing or funded sewer main serves the watershed into which the subdivision naturally drains and is within one-quarter mile (1,320 feet) of any exterior boundary of the subdivision. Sewer service is considered procurable unless the city or other public agency owning and maintaining the public sewer system cannot or will not, by reason of statute, ordinance, regulation or policy, accept sewage from the subdivision. The internal sanitary sewer system shall be available to each lot within the subdivision. 
(c)  The city shall provide adequate engineering inspection and will bill the developer according to section 106-364. 
(Code 1977, § 16.24.090)  
Sec. 106-367. - Individual sewage disposal systems. 
(a)  Generally. If a public sanitary sewer system is not reasonably accessible as described in section 106-366, as determined by the city engineer, the subdivider may install a temporary alternate sewage disposal system, upon the recommendation of the city engineer and the approval of the city council, in addition to the provisions set forth in subsection (d) of this section, such recommendation and approval to be based upon considerations involving the general health, safety and welfare and best interests of the city. Such alternate systems shall be installed in accordance with the recommendations and requirements of the state department of environmental quality. Such system shall be constructed under the supervision of the city department of community development and shall conform to the following provisions: 
(1)  At the time of submission of the preliminary plat to the planning commission, the developer shall also submit sketches showing the design, size and layout of the system. 
(2)  In addition to other requirements, the preliminary and final plat shall show: 
a.  The location of easements and utility line infrastructure, including the easements and infrastructure described in subsection (c) of this section; 
b.  The location of all present and proposed structures; 
c.  The location of all present walks and driveways; 
d.  The location of all existing or proposed water wells, if any; and 
e.  The location of the present disposal system. 
(3)  The system shall be dedicated to the city as shown on the plat, in the same manner as easements are dedicated. Upon acceptance, the system shall become the property of the city, which shall thereafter maintain the system, except for any tank type, air injection, aerobic treatment system, which will be owned, maintained and operated by the property owner until such time as city service becomes accessible. 
(b)  Sewer charges to users of alternate system. Property owners served by the alternate system shall be assessed charges for sewer service at the basic rate charged other customers of the city sewer system. Except for those portions of the sewer payments necessary for maintenance, operation and repair of the system, monies collected for sewer service from users of the alternate system will be placed in a special fund and used to extend city sewer service to properties served by temporary alternate systems. 
(c)  Provisions for future city sewer service. 
(1)  Infrastructure required. 
a.  Developments and subdivisions shall contain provisions and completed infrastructure for connection to city sewer service when such service becomes accessible. Therefore, in addition to the temporary alternate disposal system, such subdivisions or developments must meet requirements for sewer service as though such service were available. This sewer infrastructure must allow for connection of the properties included in the subdivision or development to city sewer service at a single connection site and will be dedicated to the city as a part of the final plat approval process. Sewer infrastructure, as used in this section, refers to sewer system mains or refers to installation of manholes, sewer mains, lateral lines, service lines and appurtenances. 
b.  If a developer desires to connect to city sewer service at the time of development when such service is not otherwise procurable as defined in this article, upon approval of the city council, the city will furnish materials and the developer will provide installation for connection lines. Such approval shall be solely within the discretionary authority of the city council, and such decision shall be made based upon funds available, the general health, safety and welfare, the best interests of the city, and applicable law. 
c.  The city may connect the subdivision or other properties to city sewer service when such service becomes accessible. There will be no additional charge or fee to property owners for such connection. 
(2)  Exceptions. 
a.  Upon recommendation by the city engineer and upon approval by the city council, in lieu of installing the sewer infrastructure system, a fee in the amount of 110 percent of the engineer's approved estimate may be paid into an escrow account to be used, within the drainage basin, to bring the infrastructure to the area and/or pay for the cost of the system within the subdivision. If the city is unable to provide the infrastructure within five years, then the escrow funds will be returned to the developer. 
b.  If none of the requirements or other exceptions provided in this chapter related to the sewer infrastructure system are feasible or are in the interests of the public health, safety and welfare, as determined by the city council, which will be provided a recommendation by the city engineer, then the council may approve a type system not otherwise addressed in this article, or any modification of a system, whether or not addressed in this article. In such cases, the city may determine to maintain such system if the city determines that such maintenance would be in the interests of the public health, safety and welfare. If it is not a system that conforms to the sewer extension program, then an alternate system could be developed and the city will maintain the alternate system. 
(d)  New septic tank systems. Septic tank lateral field disposal systems shall not be permitted as temporary alternate systems without the express recommendation of the city engineer and the planning commission and approval of the city council. Approval from the council may be requested before the final plat is submitted. It is expressly declared that septic tank disposal systems are discouraged, and approval shall be given only in cases of extreme hardship involving topography or unique configurations of the property or other special considerations. The reasons for such approval shall be publicly declared. Generally, convenience or economic considerations shall not constitute hardship, except in cases involving construction by individuals not a part of a subdivision. 
(e)  Repairs to existing septic tank systems. 
(1)  For existing septic tank systems requiring repair, the owner or occupant of the property must submit an application for a repair permit to the community development department, at a fee in an amount set by the city council. The application must be accompanied by the results of a satisfactory percolation test performed within the past 15 days. The community development department reserves the right to refuse to issue a permit for repair if the department determines that the system cannot be practicably repaired and/or constitutes a danger or hazard to the general health, safety and welfare. 
(2)  Notwithstanding and in addition to the provisions of subsection (e)(1) of this section, if a septic tank system, whether existing and operational before or after the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived, is damaged by fire, explosion, natural cause, public enemy or damage from any cause, including natural deterioration or wear and tear, by more than 50 percent of its true value, it shall not be replaced with another septic tank system unless the community development department shall determine that there is no other feasible option available to the occupant. In such cases, replacement of the system with another system will be determined by the applicable provisions of this article. 
(3)  For purposes of this subsection, the term "repair" shall not be construed to include normal maintenance, which would include the removal of sludge, root removal or other clearing of obstructions, repair of broken or crushed service lines, and those other activities commonly associated with the operation and maintenance of septic tank systems.

(c)  in all cases, the storm drainage system shall be separate and independent of any sanitary sewer system. 
(d)  Each lot, site and block within a plat or subdivision shall be adequately drained as prescribed in this chapter and all other ordinances and regulations. 
(e)  No lot or site within a plat or subdivision shall derive sole access to a public street through a regulatory floodway unless such access shall be designed to remain open under base flood conditions. 
(f)  Areas subject to inundation under base flood conditions shall be indicated, with the minimum floor elevation of each lot so affected on a certified copy of the recorded final plat. The planning commission and the city council may, when deemed necessary for the health, safety or welfare of the present and future population, place restrictions on the subdivision, design and use of areas within or affecting the regulatory floodway. The planning commission shall not approve any subdivision of land within the regulatory floodway of any stream or watercourse unless the applicant demonstrates that the subdivision and all development anticipated therein will comply with all ordinances and regulations relating thereto.

Whenever the commission records the finding based upon a traffic engineering survey and investigation that normal movement of traffic within legal limitations is or has become impeded or dangerous at any intersection or crossing because of increased use of such street or changed conditions, and that the increased use or change in conditions requires the installation at the intersection of suitable traffic control devices reasonably found from the data reported in the survey to be necessary to restore normal movement of traffic within legal limitations, or to provide greater safety and efficiency in the use of streets entering and leaving the intersection, the commission shall designate the intersection or location for installation of traffic control devices, and the director shall initiate necessary steps to obtain and install such traffic control devices.

Sec. 114-110. - Meaning of signal indicators. 
The display of signal lights, arrows and words is deemed to have the following meanings and require the appropriate response on the part of vehicular traffic and pedestrians: 
(1)  Green alone, "go": 
a.  Vehicular traffic facing the signal, except when prohibited, may proceed straight through or turn right or left unless an official sign at such place prohibits such turn, but any vehicle and any pedestrian lawfully within the intersection or adjacent crosswalk at the time the signal displays green shall have the right-of-way over such vehicular traffic. 
b.  Pedestrian traffic facing a green signal may proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk unless a "walk" signal indicator is operating. 
(2)  Yellow or amber alone, "caution": 
a.  The showing of such signal color following green shall constitute a warning that the red or "stop" signal will be exhibited immediately thereafter. 
b.  Vehicles facing the signal shall stop before entering the near side crosswalk or at the limit line, if it is marked, unless the vehicle is so near the limit line when the "caution" signal first flashes that a stop cannot be made in safety, in which event vehicles may proceed cautiously through the intersection and clear such intersection before the red signal flashes. 
c.  Pedestrians facing the signal shall not enter the roadway until the green or "go" signal is shown alone, unless authorized to proceed by a pedestrian "walk" signal. 
(3)  Red alone, "stop": 
a.  Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then before entering the intersection and shall remain standing until green or "go" is shown alone. Where official signs are erected so indicating, vehicles in the right traffic lane shall stop before making a right turn, but such vehicles shall yield the right-of-way to any pedestrians or other traffic in the intersection and the turn shall not be made so as to interfere in any way with traffic proceeding on a green signal indication on the cross street. 
b.  Pedestrians facing the signal shall not enter or cross the roadway when such movement interferes with traffic proceeding on a green signal indication on the cross street, or when the movement cannot be made in safety. No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway until the green or "go" is shown alone, unless authorized to do so by a pedestrian "walk" signal. 
(4)  Red with green arrow: 
a.  Vehicular traffic facing such signal when in the proper traffic lane may cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by the arrow, but shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection. If the movement indicated by the green arrow is a left turn, the left turn shall be made only on the red with green arrow signal. 
b.  No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway until the green or "go" is shown alone, unless authorized to do so by a pedestrian "walk" signal.

(Code 1977, § 13.08.170(A))  
Sec. 118-132. - Establishment of charges for domestic users. 
At least biannually, the city council shall review total operation and maintenance costs of the treatment works and set sewer user fees to recover all such costs. Operation and maintenance costs shall include replacement of the treatment works. For the purpose of providing funds for the maintenance of the sanitary sewage system of the city and for other purposes, each respective user thereof shall pay a domestic wastewater user's charge based on the following formula: 
Sewer cost/ 
1,000 gallons = 	      Operation and Maintenance Cost (annual) × 1,000       
3 months (winter) water consumption by sewer customer × 4 
 
(Code 1977, § 13.08.170(B))  
Sec. 118-133. - Proration. 
The sewer costs shall be prorated to all domestic and commercial users on the basis of water consumed by the users during the three winter months using the following formula: 
Sewer cost/ 
1,000 gallons = 	      Operation and Maintenance (annual) × 1,000       
3 months (winter) water consumption for city × 4 
 
(Code 1977, § 13.08.170(C))  
Sec. 118-134. - Amount of user charge. 
The sewer user charge shall be based upon the quantity of water used or consumed by said premise or facility therein or thereon as the same is measured by the water meters in use. The sewer user charge shall be $4.74 per 1,000 gallons of water as determined from the meter records of the City of Mustang. 
(Code 1977, § 13.08.170(D); Ord. No. 1022, § 2, 5-19-2009; Ord. No. 1106, § 7, 8-19-2014)  
Sec. 118-135. - Calculation of residential charges. 
Residential sewer user charges shall be calculated in the following manner: 
(1)  A "winter period consumption base" shall be calculated for each residential or housekeeping unit. Said consumption base shall be the average amount of the water consumed each period by a residential or housekeeping unit during the three billing cycles which occur between December 1 and March 1 this will represent the bills mailed on or about December 15, January 15 and February 15, which should reflect water used or consumed in the month of November, December and January. The "winter period consumption base" shall be recalculated annually and shall become effective after the last billing period of the above described three-month base setting months. The domestic sewer user charge shall be $4.74 per 1,000 gallons of the "winter period consumption base." 
(2)  If a residential user does not have a "winter period consumption base" established at his current residential or housekeeping unit, for whatever reason, water consumption will be estimated at 7,500 gallons per month. The domestic user without an established current winter period consumption base shall be charged $4.74 per 1,000 gallons based on 7,500 gallons (or $35.66) per month, until such time as a "winter period consumption base" is established. This section shall apply until a winter period consumption base is established for the user at the residential or housekeeping unit. 
(3)  Any customer relocating within the service area during or after his winter period consumption base has been established shall be charged on the basis of his previously established winter period consumption base at his previous premises or facility, or a non-winter month consumption base shall be established at the customer's new residential or housekeeping unit as stated in subsection (2) of this section until such time as a new winter period consumption base is established for the new residential or housekeeping unit. The city shall determine which base will provide a reasonable sewer charge for the customer's new residential or housekeeping unit. 
(4)  Water used from private sources shall be metered as required in this section, and the sewer service charges shall be billed accordingly. 
(5)  If a lot, parcel of land, premises or facility discharging sewage, water or other liquids directly into the city's sewer system is supplied either in whole or in part with water from wells or any sources other than the city, then such well or other source of supply shall be registered with the city, and if the water from the well or other supply is not measured by a water meter, the owner or occupant shall, at his own cost, install and maintain a meter on the supplies in such a location and in such a manner as is satisfactory to the city. These meters shall serve as a control for the establishment of the sewer service charge and shall be read as provided by subsection (1) of this section. If, at the option of the customer, the installation of a meter would be impractical, water consumption will be estimated at 7,500 gallons per month per residential or housekeeping unit. 
(6)  The basis for determining the sewer user charge shall be reviewed as needed and shall be adjusted to reflect any increase or decrease in wastewater treatment costs based on previous experience. 
(7)  Any commercial or industrial sewer user installing a meter to measure its actual sewer flow shall be charged $4.74 per 1,000 gallons of actual sewage flow. 
(8)  Sewer rates shall increase in each subsequent year by two percent or the consumer price index as published by the U.S. Department of labor for the Southwest Region, whichever is greater. Rate increases shall be effective on October 1 of each subsequent year beginning October 1, 2010. 
(9)  For residential users establishing new service that do not have a "winter period consumption base" established at their current residential or housekeeping unit, water consumption will be estimated at the following rates until a winter period consumption base is established for the user at the residential or housekeeping unit:

(a)  All PVC water lines shall be tested by means of hydrostatic pressure of not less than 100 pounds per square inch for three hours. If test plugs are used, they shall be furnished and installed by the water line contractor at his own expense, together with all necessary anchors, braces and other devices necessary to withstand the hydrostatic pressure on such plug without placing any hydraulic thrust on the pipe line or any part thereof. The contractor shall be solely responsible for any and all damages to the pipe line and public and private property which might be caused by the failure of such test plugs or supports thereof. The allowable leakage shall not exceed ten gallons per 24 hours per inch diameter per mile of 42 inches and smaller pipe; and 7½ gallons on 48-inch pipe and larger. 
(b)  After the section of line to be tested has been filled with water, the specified test pressure shall be applied by means of a force pump of such design and capacity that such pressure can be applied and maintained for the duration of the test period, which shall not be less than three hours for 24 inches and smaller pipe. 
(c)  All water supplied to the line, after the initial filling thereof, shall be metered by means of a tested water meter as furnished and installed by the city.

The minimum cover shall be not less than two feet below the bottom of the ditch at crossings or parallel runs. 
(Code 1977, § 13.20.190)  
Sec. 118-220. - Embedment materials. 
All Class 200-900-40 water (PVC) pipe shall be bedded in sand, except under the following conditions. The following three material classifications will be allowed as bedding materials when the soil type has been classified by an approved testing laboratory: 
(1)  Class I. Angular, one-fourth to 1½ inches (six to 40 mm) graded stone, including a number of fill materials that have regional significance such as coral, slag, cinders, crushed shell and crushed stone. 
Note: The size range and resulting high voids ration of Class I material make it suitable for use to dewater trenches during pipe installation. This permeable characteristic dictates that its use be limited to locations where pipe supports will not be lost by migration of fine grained natural material from the trench walls and bottom or migration of other embedment materials into the Class I material. When such migration is possible, the material's minimum size range could be reduced to finer than one-fourth inch (mm) and the gradation properly designed to limit the size of the voids. 
(2)  Class II. Coarse sands and gravels with maximum particle size of 1½ inches (40 mm), including variously graded sands and gravels containing small percentages of fines, generally granular and noncohesive, either wet or dry. Soil types GW, GP, SW and SP are included in this class. 
Note: Sands and gravels which are clean or borderline between clean and with fines should be included. Coarse-grained soils with less than 12 percent but more than five percent fines are neglected in ASTM D2487 and the USCS and should be included. The gradation of Class II material influences its density and pipe support strength when loosely placed. The gradation of Class II materials may be critical to the pipe support and stability of the foundation and embedment if the material is imported and is not native to the trench excavation. A gradation other than well graded, such as uniformly graded or gap graded, may permit loss of support by migration into void spaces of a finer grained natural material from the trench wall and bottom. 
(3)  Class III. Fine sand and clayey (clay filled) gravels, including fine sands, sand-clay mixtures and gravel-clay mixtures. Solid types GM, CG, SM and SC are included in this class. 
(Code 1977, § 13.20.200)  
Sec. 118-221. - Methods of placing embedment materials. 
The following compaction methods are recommended as the optimums which will achieve desirable densities with the least effort: 
(1)  Manufactured angular, granular materials. Manufactured materials which are angular, granular such as broken coral, crushed stone or rock, crushed shells, crushed slag or cinders which have a maximum size of 1½ inches (40 mm) may be placed on loose dumping with a maximum of compactive effort, except that care shall be taken to assure proper placement of material under pipe haunches. 
(2)  Clean granular soils. With coarse-grained soils containing less than five percent fines such as GW, GP, SW, SP, GW-GP and SW-SP, the maximum density will be obtained by compacting by saturation or vibration. If internal vibrators are used, the height of successive lifts or backfill shall be limited to the penetrating depth of the vibrator. If surface vibrators are used, the backfill should be placed in lifts of six to 12 inches (150 to 300 mm). This material may also be compacted by tamping or other means provided that the desired relative density is obtained. 
(3)  Coarse-grained soils with little to no fines. Coarse-grained soils which are borderline between clean and with fines containing between five to 12 percent fines, such as GW-GM, SW-SM, GW-GC, SW-SC, GP-GM, SP-SM, GP-GC and SP-SC, should be compacted by either hand or mechanical tamping, saturation or vibration, or whichever method meets the required density. 
(4)  Coarse-grained soils with fines. Coarse-grained soils containing more than 12 percent fines, such as GM, GC, SM, SC and the borderline cases in the group (e.g. GM-SM), should be compacted by hand or mechanical tamping. The backfill should be placed in lifts of four to six inches (100 to 150 mm). 
(5)  Fine-grained soils. Fine-grained soils such as MH, CH, ML, CL, SC-CL, SM-ML and ML-CL, should be compacted by hand or mechanical tamping in lifts of four to six inches (100 to 150 mm). 
(6)  Tamping and vibrating. Soils which require compaction by tamping or vibrating generally reach maximum density with a minimum of effort when controlled to optimum moisture content. 
(7)  Saturation. If flooding, jetting or puddling is employed for compaction, care should be taken to provide drainage and prevent flotation of the pipe. Saturation shall not be permitted during freezing weather. Erosion of support at the pipe sides and bottom by water jetting shall be prevented. Apply only enough water to give complete saturation. Allow time for the saturated soil in each layer to dewater and solidify until it will support the weight of workers. 
(8)  Use of compaction equipment. Take care to avoid contact between the pipe and compaction equipment. Do not use compaction equipment directly over the pipe until sufficient backfill has been placed to assure that such equipment will not damage or disturb the sewer pipe. 
(9)  Bedding. Sand is preferred but Class I, II or III soil is required primarily to bring the trench bottom up to grade. Bedding materials shall be placed to provide uniform and adequate longitudinal support under the pipe. Blocking shall not be used to bring the pipe to grade. Bell holes at each joint shall be provided to permit the joint to be assembled properly while maintaining uniform pipe support. A compacted depth of four to six inches (100 to 150 mm) is generally sufficient bedding thickness. In trenches which have natural materials of fine grains, and in conditions where migration of trench wall material into bedding material can be anticipated, either wide trench construction or well graded bedding material without void shall be used. 
(10)  Haunching. The most important factor affecting water pipe performance and deflection is the haunching material and its density. Place and consolidate the material under the pipe haunch to provide adequate side support to the pipe while avoiding both vertical and lateral displacement of the pipe from proper alignment. Where coarse materials with voids have been used for bedding, coarse materials shall also be used for haunching and consideration shall be given to using wide trench construction. Place haunching up to the pipe spring line. 
(11)  Initial backfill. Initial backfill begins above the spring line of the pipe. Use little or no tamping of the initial backfill since this area will provide little or no additional side support. The only purpose of extending the initial backfill to levels over the top of the pipe shall be to protect the pipe from impact damage resulting from any large objects in the final backfill. 
(Code 1977, § 13.20.200)  
Sec. 118-222. - Laying and joining pipe and fittings. 
Before setting any water pipe in place, each component of piping shall be inspected for damage and cleaned. Damaged components shall be rejected or repaired. Pipe bells shall be laid on the upstream end. Water pipe laying shall commence at the lowest elevation, which shall remain plugged until the water line is accepted by the city, and shall terminate only at manholes, service branches or cleanouts. Trenches shall be dewatered, if necessary, and pipe shall be laid under water only when approved by the city engineer. Whenever water pipe laying is interrupted, the end of the pipe shall be temporarily plugged to prevent the entrance of water, mud or foreign matter, and the pipe shall be secured to prevent being dislodged or floating. 
(Code 1977, § 13.20.221)  
Sec. 118-223. - Location and alignment. 
Pipe and fittings shall be embedded in the trench with the invert conforming to the required elevations, slopes and alignment, and with the pipe bottom uniformly and continuously supported by a firm bedding and foundation.

(b)  Cement lining in pipes or fittings which are broken or loosened in unloading or subsequent handling shall be repaired by and at the expense of the contractor, who may employ the pipe manufacturer to make such repairs, but in any case the repairs shall be made under the direct supervision of the representative of the pipe manufacturer. All outside pipe coating which is damaged by the contractor shall be repaired, prior to laying the pipe or placing the backfill, by removing all damaged coating, wire brushing the exposed metal and applying two coats of a permanently elastic coal tar paint of a type and quality equal to that used in originally coating the outside of the pipe and preferably of the same brand and formula. This paint shall be sufficiently hard before backfilling so that it will not be damaged thereby. 
(c)  Where pipe is to be laid in front of or adjacent to business houses or manufacturing establishments, or where homes have well kept front yards, the pipe shall be delivered to the site of the work as the pipe is laid. Local storage of the pipe at the site of the work will not be permitted. By permission of the city engineer, 12 joints of pipe may be allowed on the site of the work at any one time, but it is to be laid before stopping work at night, and all trench backfilling shall closely follow the pipe laying.

Sec. 118-304. - Responsibility for materials. 
The contractor shall be responsible for the acceptability and storage of all material furnished by him and shall assume responsibility for the replacement of all such material found damaged in shipping or on the job site or defective in manufacture. This shall include the furnishing of all material and labor required for the replacement of installed material discovered to be defective prior to the final acceptance of the work. 
(Code 1977, § 13.28.040)  
Sec. 118-305. - Trench construction; generally. 
Trenches shall be excavated to the alignment and elevations as indicated on the sewer plans, any deviations must be approved by the city engineer. All trench excavation shall comply with applicable regulations, laws and ordinances. Specified in this division are standard construction requirements covering a broad range of both normal and unusual conditions that can be anticipated in sewer trench excavation and construction. Some items or work are specified as options to the contractor which does not need city engineer approval, however, some options do require the city engineer's approval. 
(Code 1977, § 13.28.050)  
Sec. 118-306. - Conflicting obstructions. 
Conflicting obstructions may be encountered when excavating the construction sewers without deviations from the location established by the sewer system drawings. The contractor shall be responsible for all conflicting surface and subsurface structures, utilities and obstructions. The contractor shall be responsible to call Oklahoma One-Call System at 1-800-522-6543, 48 hours prior to any excavation. The contractor shall bear all expense arising from obstructions encountered. 
(Code 1977, § 13.28.060)  
Sec. 118-307. - Removal of improved surfaces. 
Unless specified otherwise, the contractor shall remove all pavement or other improved surfaces which require removal for the excavation. 
(Code 1977, § 13.28.070)  
Sec. 118-308. - Stockpiling excavated materials. 
All excavated material shall be stockpiled in a manner that will not endanger the work. Hydrants under pressure, water and gas valves, manhole covers, fire and police call boxes or other utility controls shall be left unobstructed and accessible until the work is completed. Gutters shall be kept open or other satisfactory provisions made for street drainage, and natural watercourses shall not be obstructed adjacent to streets, walks or driveways. 
(Code 1977, § 13.28.080)  
Sec. 118-309. - Disposal of debris, removed pavement and waste excavation. 
No debris shall be disposed of in the trench backfill. Debris, removed pavement and excavation which is surplus or unsuitable for backfill shall be disposed of by the contractor in a manner suitable to the city. 
(Code 1977, § 13.28.090)  
Sec. 118-310. - Dewatering. 
Where conditions are such that running or standing water occurs in the trench bottom, or the soil in the trench bottom displays a quick tendency, the water shall be removed by pumps and suitable means such as well points or pervious underdrain bedding until the pipe has been installed and the backfill has been placed to a sufficient height necessary to prevent flotation of the sewer line. Care shall be taken that any underdrain is of proper gradation and thickness to prevent migration of material between the underdrain, pipe, embedment and native soils in the trench below at the sides of the sewer pipe. 
(Code 1977, § 13.28.100)  
Sec. 118-311. - Trench excavation and support. 
The maximum earthload on flexible pipe results from the consolidated prism of earth directly over the pipe, which is only as wide as the pipe. The load on flexible pipe does not increase in excess of the prism load as it does with rigid pipe. If the design load on the pipe is calculated based on embankment conditions (prism load), the contractor may excavate a trench which is as wide as is dictated by practical and economical construction. Types of construction for various anticipated conditions are described as follows: 
(1)  Narrow unsupported, vertical-walled trench. The amount of pavement to be removed and replaced, amount of rock excavation or the amount of embedment material used may dictate that the most economical installation uses narrow, vertical-walled trenches. The width of narrow trenches as determined by the minimum working room for a man to place haunching material shall provide a minimum of 18 inches (450 mm) for four-inch to six-inch (100 and 150 mm) size pipes and not less than six-inch to nine-inch (150 to 230 mm) clearance on each side of the pipe for eight-inch (200 mm) and larger sizes. The resulting narrow trench minimum widths shall comply with Table 1. In narrow trenches the pipe embedment shall be compacted all the way to the trench walls.

48 	1.3 	62 
 
Note: Minimum trench widths are intended to provide adequate spacing between the pipe and trench wall for proper placing and compaction of haunching material and may vary somewhat depending on construction procedures being used. 
(2)  Unsupported subditch trench. A variation of the narrow vertical-walled trench is to lay the pipe in a subditch and backcut or slope the sides of the excavation above the top of the pipe, as shown in Figure 2. This type of construction may be permitted by the city engineer where no inconvenience to the public or damage to the property, building, subsurface structures or pavements will result. In such case, width of the subditch below the top of the pipe shall comply with Table 1. 
EXAMPLE OF SUBTRENCH 
FIGURE 2 
(3)  Wide trench. Wide trenches are classified as trenches whose width at the top of the pipe is greater than 2½ pipe diameters on each side of the pipe or a total of six pipe diameters. Although there is no width of trench beyond which the load on a flexible pipe exceeds the prism load, accepted installation practices usually dictate narrow trench construction. In isolated circumstances it may be more cost effective to use wide trench construction i.e., in areas where narrow trench walls cannot be maintained. If trench width at the top of a small diameter pipe (six inchesten inches diameter) must exceed six pipe diameters, the embedment up to the pipe springline should be compacted to a point approximately 2½ pipe diameters from each side of the pipe. For large diameter PVC (SDR-35) pipe (12 inches48 inches diameter) installed in wide trenches, the embedment up to the pipe springline should be compacted to a point at least one pipe diameter or two feet (600 mm) from each side of the pipe, whichever is greater. 
(4)  Supported trench. Where an unstable or flowing soil condition is encountered in the trench wall, such as may be found by excavation below groundwater or in weak or noncohesive soils, stabilize this condition before laying the pipe. Depending upon the severity of the condition, the city engineer or contractor may elect to use tight sheeting, skeleton sheeting, stay bracing, trench jacks or a trench shield or box to support the trench during pipe laying operations. If the condition is too severe, it may be necessary to leave any sheeting in place or to use chemical or cement grouting of the soil adjacent to the excavation to prevent migration between the material used beneath and around the pipe and trench wall material. To allow sufficient working room plus trench wall supports the minimum excavated trench width to the outside of the sheeting or shield box shall be as shown in Table 2.

Table 2 widths are based upon eight to ten inches (200 to 250 mm) clearance on each side of the pipe to the inner face of trench supports. The trench supports are assumed to be six-inch (150 mm) thick trench box or shield walls or four-inch (100 mm) walls inside of two-inch (50 mm) sheeting. Exceptionally deep trenches with thicker sheeting and bracing or other systems of trench support may require the city engineer to vary these trench widths. Timber sheeting, where used below the top of the pipe, shall be driven approximately two feet (60 cm) below the bottom of the pipe and be left in place approximately 1½ feet (45 cm) above the top of the pipe. In supported trenches, compaction of foundation and embedment materials should extend to the trench wall or sheeting left in place. 
(Code 1977, § 13.28.110)  
Sec. 118-312. - Trench bottom. 
The soil surface at the trench bottom shall be free of any protrusions which may cause point loading on any portion of the pipe or bell, and shall provide a firm, stable and uniform support for the pipe. 
(1)  Special trench foundation. Where an unsuitable trench bottom condition is encountered, it must be stabilized by a method approved by the city engineer and/or chief building official. 
(2)  Over-excavation. During the course of construction, should the contractor inadvertently over-excavate the trench more than six inches (150 mm) below the bottom of the pipe, but less than 12 inches (300 mm) below the bottom of the pipe, he shall fill that area of over-excavation with acceptable embedment material and compact to a density approximately equal to the native soil. 
(3)  Rock subgrade. Ledge rock, hard pan, cobbles, boulders or stones larger than 1½ inches (40 mm) shall be removed from the trench bottom to permit a minimum bedding thickness of four to six inches (100 to 150 mm) under pipe. Sharp stones and crushed rock, larger than three-fourths inch, which could cause significant scratching or abrasion of the pipe, should be excluded from the embedment material. 
(Code 1977, § 13.28.120)  
Sec. 118-313. - Embedment materials. 
All SDR-35 and Schedule 40 sewer pipe shall be bedded in river sand as approved by the city engineer and/or chief building official. 
(1)  Use of compaction equipment. Take care to avoid contact between the pipe and compaction equipment. Do not use compaction equipment directly over the pipe until sufficient backfill has been placed to ensure that such equipment will not damage or disturb the sewer pipe. 
(2)  Bedding. Sand is required to bring the trench bottom up to grade. Bedding materials shall be placed to provide uniform and adequate longitudinal support under the pipe. Blocking shall not be used to bring the pipe to grade. Bell holes at each joint shall be provided to permit the joint to be assembled properly while maintaining uniform pipe support. A compacted depth of four to six inches (100 to 150 mm) is generally sufficient bedding thickness. Compaction of the sand bedding around and over PVC sewer lines shall be 80 percent to 95 percent density as required by ASTM 698 Standard. 
(3)  Haunching. The most important factor affecting sewer pipe performance and deflection is the haunching material and its density. Place and consolidate the material under the pipe haunch to provide adequate side support to the pipe while avoiding both vertical and lateral displacement of the pipe from proper alignment. 
(4)  Initial backfill. Initial sand backfill begins above the spring line of the pipe. Use little or no tamping of the initial backfill since this area will provide little or no additional side support. The only purpose of extending the initial backfill to levels over the top of the pipe shall be to protect the pipe from impact damage resulting from any large objects in the final backfill. 
(Code 1977, § 13.28.130)  
Sec. 118-314. - Laying and joining pipe and fittings. 
Before setting any sewer pipe in place, each component of piping shall be inspected for damage and cleaned. Damaged components shall be rejected or repaired. Pipe bells shall be laid on the upstream end. Sewer laying shall commence at the lowest elevation, which shall remain plugged until the sewer line is accepted by the city, and shall terminate only at manholes, service branches or cleanouts. Trenches shall be dewatered, if necessary, and pipe shall be laid under water only when approved by the city engineer. Whenever sewer pipe laying is interrupted, the end of the pipe shall be temporarily plugged to prevent the entrance of water, mud or foreign matter, and the pipe shall be secured to prevent being dislodged or floating. 
(Code 1977, § 13.28.140)  
Sec. 118-315. - Location and alignment. 
Pipe and fittings shall be embedded in the trench with the invert conforming to the required elevations, slopes and alignment, and with the pipe bottom uniformly and continuously supported by a firm bedding and foundation. 
Curved alignment. In special cases where curved alignment is required, the recommended allowable minimum curve radii for SDR-35 PVC sewer pipe shall be based on the following formula: 
R 	= 	300 D, where 
R 	= 	Minimum allowable radius of curvature from bending, 
D 	= 	Pipe diameter, where R and D are in the same dimensional units. 
 
This formula results in an insignificant amount 0.06 percent of ellipsing or diametric pipe deflection. 
(Code 1977, § 13.28.150)  
Sec. 118-316. - Cutting and beveling pipe. 
For shorter than standard pipe lengths, field cuts may be made with either hand or mechanical saws or plastic pipe cutters. Ends shall be cut square and perpendicular to the pipe axis. Spigots shall have burrs removed and ends smoothly beveled by a mechanical beveler or by hand with a rasp or file. Field spigots shall be stop marked with a felt tip marker or wax crayon for the proper length of assembly insertion. The angle and depth of field bevels and lengths to stop marks shall be comparable to factory pipe spigots. 
(1)  Bell holes for elastomeric seal joints. The bell hold shall be no larger than necessary to accomplish proper joint assembly. When the joint has been made, the void under the bell should be filled with bedding or haunching material to provide adequate support to the pipe throughout its entire length. 
(2)  Assembly of joints. Assemble all joints in accordance with recommendations of the manufacturer. If a lubricant is required to facilitate assembly it shall have no detrimental effect on the gasket or on the pipe when subject to prolonged exposure. Proper jointing may be verified by rotation of the spigot by hand or with a strap wrench. If unusual joining resistance is encountered or if the insertion mark does not reach the flush position, disassemble the joint, inspect for damage, reclean the joint components and repeat the assembly steps. Note that fitting bells may permit less insertion depth than pipe bells. ( Note: When mechanical equipment is used to assemble joints, care should be taken to prevent over insertion.) 
(3)  Branch fittings. Fittings for service branches in new construction shall be molded or fabricated with all gasketed connections. Taps into existing lines shall use a gasketed fitting in conjunction with a repair sleeve coupling or a gasketed saddle wye or tee with all stainless steel clamps. Saddles may be mounted on pipe with solvent cement or gasket but shall be secured by metal banding. Install saddles in accordance with manufacturer's recommendations. Holes for saddle connections shall be made by mechanical hole cutters or by keyhole saw or sabre saw. Holes for wye saddles shall be laid out with a template and shall be deburred and carefully beveled where required to provide a smooth hole shaped to conform to the fitting. The contractor will be permitted to use fittings which are prefabricated using pipe sections, molded saddles and PVC solvent cement, provided the solvent cement used in fabrication has cured at least 24 hours prior to installation. Cemented mitered connections without socket reinforcement shall not be permitted. Only PVC primer and solvent cement shall be used in cementing in accordance with the cement manufacturer's recommendations and ASTM D2855, "Making Solvent-Cemented Joints with PVC Pipe and Fittings." Quickly place temporary band clamps both upstream and downstream of the saddle and tighten. 
(4)  Service lines. Unless required otherwise by the drawings, service lines from the property line to the collection sewer shall be at a minimum depth of three feet (one m) at the property line and shall be laid on a straight alignment and uniform slope of not less than one-fourth inch per foot (20 mm/m) for four-inch (100 mm) pipe and one-eighth inch per foot (100 mm/m) for six-inch (150 mm) pipe. Where collection sewers are deeper than seven feet (two m) a vertical standpipe or stack shall be required. The standpipe or stack does not require concrete encasement; however, it shall be uniformly supported by compacted backfill. 
(5)  Pipe caps and plugs. All caps and plugs shall be braced, staked, anchored, wired on or otherwise secured to the pipe to prevent leakage under the maximum anticipated thrust from internal abnormal operation conditions or test pressures from water to air. 
(6)  Manholes. Details of manhole construction shall be as shown on attached drawings from walls, bottoms, tops, castings, ladders and drop structures. Unless the drawings require otherwise, the pipe may first be laid through and beyond the manhole location followed by over-building the manhole, grouting the bench and cutting out the top of the pipe in the manhole. All manhole connections should be made using proper water stops. If portland cement grout is incorporated in the manhole connection, the grout shall be of a type that expands, rather than shrinks, upon curing. Water stops shall be installed in accordance with manufacturer's recommendations. Hinged connections which use short pipe bell stubs outside the manhole face will not be required to prevent shear breakage in SDR-35 PVC sewer pipe because of its flexibility. Excessive manhole settlement can cause excessive deflection and should be prevented. All sewer connections shall remain plugged until the entire sewer system being installed has been accepted by the city. The entire outside of all brick manholes shall be coated with 1:2 Portland cement and sand mortar, all other manholes shall be coated with tar. 
(7)  Installing pipe through casings. Encasements for pipes under highways, streets, railroads, water lines and driveways shall have runners or cradles to support the pipe in the casing. A minimum of two supports shall be used per joint of pipe providing a maximum span of 6½ feet (1.9 m) for SDR-35 PVC pipe lengths of 12½ feet (3.8 m). The maximum span between supports for pipe lengths of 20 feet (6.1 m) shall not exceed that shown in Table 3. All encasements of SDR-35 PVC sewer pipe shall be in ductile iron pipe.

Note: Each joint must be supported. Therefore, the maximum unsupported span will always be limited by pipe length. 
(8)  Backfill material. The material used in the final backfilling operation need not be as carefully selected as was the bedding, haunching and initial backfill. In selection of final backfill material, exclude boulders, frozen clumps of dirt and rubble which could damage the pipe. 
(9)  Backfill compaction. Unless specified otherwise, the final backfill shall use special compaction under improved surfaces and shoulders of streets, roads, aprons, curbs and walks, and natural compaction shall be used under open fields, lawns and wide shoulders or neutral grounds which are free of traffic. Natural compaction is attained by the loose placing of material, usually pushed or bladed, into the trench, rolling the surface layer with the placement equipment, mounding the surface and filling and maintaining all sunken trenches until final acceptance of the work trenches. In natural compaction, the main consolidation results from rainfall and groundwater fluctuations. 
(10)  Minimum cover for load applicant. Provide at least 30 inches (760 mm) of cover over the top of the pipe before the trench is wheel-loaded. Provide for at least 48 inches (1,200 mm) of cover before using mobile trench compactors of the hydrohammer or impactor type. Depth of cover may be reduced to 36 to 42 inches (915 to1,070 mm) under some cases. 
(Code 1977, § 13.28.160)  
Sec. 118-317. - Restoration of surfaces and/or structures. 
The contractor shall restore and/or replace shrubbery, fences, sod or other disturbed surfaces or structures to a condition equal to that which existed before the work began, to the satisfaction of the chief building official. 
Clean up. Surplus pipeline materials, tools and temporary structures resulting from the work shall be removed by the contractor. All debris and excess earth from excavations shall be removed and disposed of by the contractor in compliance with applicable regulations, laws and ordinances. The construction site shall be left clean, to the satisfaction of the chief building official. 
(Code 1977, § 13.28.170)  
Sec. 118-318. - Field performance and acceptance test. 
All sewer projects shall be tested upon completion of construction. The city engineer or chief building official shall designate the locations of tests and the extent of the sewer system to be tested, optional methods of testing leakage, alignment and deflection, and the extent of recording test results. All equipment for performing tests and making measurements shall be furnished by the contractor. All sections of the sewer system which fail to pass the tests shall have defects located and repaired or replaced and be retested until it is approved for acceptance. 
(1)  Cleaning. Prior to other tests, all sanitary sewer lines shall be cleaned and inspected for major defects. Precleaning by an appropriately sized sewer cleaning ball or by high velocity jet or other method may be necessary. 
(2)  Visual test. All sanitary sewer lines shall be inspected visually to verify accuracy of alignment and freedom from debris and obstructions. The full diameter of the pipe for straight alignments shall be visible when viewed between consecutive manholes. The method of test shall be visually lamping with mirrors and lights. 
(3)  Air testing. The low pressure air test is a test which can be used for acceptance or leak location. The section of sewer line to be tested is plugged. Low pressure air is introduced into the plugged line. The sewer line should be flushed and cleaned prior to testing. The air test shall, as a minimum, conform to the test procedure described in ASTM C-828-80 entitled "Low-Pressure Air Test of Vitrified Clay Pipe Lines" or latest revision. 
(4)  Leakage test. Leakage tests shall be specified for all new construction. This may include appropriate water or low pressure air testing. The leakage outward or inward (exfiltration or infiltration) shall not exceed 100 gallons per inch of pipe diameter per mile per day (0.19 m three/cm of pipe dia./km/day) for any section of the system. An exfiltration or infiltration test shall be performed with a minimum positive head of two feet (0.61 m). The air test, if used, shall, as a minimum, conform to the test procedure described in ASTM C-828-80 entitled "Low-Pressure Air Test of Vitrified Clay Pipe Lines" or latest revision. The testing methods selected should take into consideration the range in groundwater elevations projected and the situation during the test. With pressure pipe sewers, the leakage allowance should not exceed 100 gallons per inch diameter per mile per day (0.19 m three/cm of pipe dia./km/day) under a test head appropriate to the local conditions. Certification of the test results must be submitted to the reviewing authority before approval of the installation will be given. Replacement of existing sewers may require the connection of house service lines as the sewer is installed. Under these circumstances, the engineer shall specify special construction and/or inspection techniques to ensure the exclusion of infiltration to meet the above standards. 
(5)  Deflection testing. Unless specified otherwise, the maximum allowable pipe deflection for SDR-35 PVC (reduction in vertical inside diameter) shall be five percent. Deflection tests shall be performed on all flexible pipe. The mandral will be pulled through all sewer pipes prior to acceptance.

Notice of a public hearing before the planning commission shall be given by the secretary of the planning commission by mailing written notice at least 20 days in advance of the meeting to all owners of property within a 300-foot radius of the exterior boundary of the property. Fifteen days' notice of the public hearing shall be given by the planning commission by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the City of Mustang. For conditional use permits for uses in the C6 commercial special use district, notice of the public hearing before the planning commission shall be given at least 30 days in advance of the meeting to all owners of property within a 1,320-foot radius of the exterior boundary of the property. 
(5)  An application recommended by the planning commission for approval, or approval subject to modification or conditions, shall be transmitted to the city council with the report and recommendations of the planning commission within 30 days of the commission hearing for city council action therein. 
(6)  An application recommended for denial by the planning commission shall not be considered further, unless the applicant, within 15 days of the action by the planning commission, shall file with the city clerk a written request for hearing before the city council. If no such request is filed, then $50.00 of the original fee (or $500.00 for applications for a conditional use permit for a sexually oriented business) shall be refunded to the applicant. Upon filing of such request for hearing before the city council, the planning commission shall transmit to the city council its report and recommendation and a copy of its minutes on the hearing.

(3)  Side yard. 
a.  For dwellings of one story located on interior spaces, there shall be a side yard on each side of the main building of not less than five feet for one-story main buildings, and not less than eight feet for main buildings of more than one story. For unattached buildings of accessory use, there shall be a side yard of not less than five feet; provided, however, that unattached one-story buildings of accessory use shall not be required to be set back more than three feet from an interior side space line when all parts of the accessory building are located not less than 90 feet back of the access drive or street. 
b.  For dwellings and accessory buildings located on corner spaces, there shall be a side yard setback from the intersecting drive or street of not less than 15 feet in case such space is back-to-back with another corner space, and 25 feet in every other case.

(Code 1977, § 17.22.050; Ord. No. 1138, § 8, 5-3-2016)  
Sec. 122-446. - Building coverage. 
Main and accessory buildings in the R-MH-2 district shall not cover more than 35 percent of a mobile home space. 
(Code 1977, § 17.22.060)  
Sec. 122-447. - Building height. 
No building in the R-MH-2 district shall exceed 2½ stories or 35 feet in height. 
(Code 1977, § 17.22.070)  
Sec. 122-448. - Fencing and lighting. 
(a)  Requirements. Whenever any new R-MH-2 mobile home park land use is established so as to abut the side or rear line of a lot or tract in any existing residential district or any subcategory thereof, including a residential planned unit development (PUD), such residential use including, but not limited to, a parking lot or parking area, a fence or wall that is sight-proof from single-story residential areas or streets, not less than six feet nor more than ten feet high, as measured from the finished grade, shall be constructed between the R-MH-2 mobile home park land use and the adjacent residential tracts or lots. Such fence shall be maintained by the property owner in good condition, as determined by the community development director. This fence shall be placed along and within three feet of the rear lot line and along and within three feet of the side lot line to the point of the front yard setback of the residential tract or lot, except where the front yard of the R-MH-2 lot is used for off-street parking, then the provisions of article X of this chapter pertaining to off-street parking lots shall apply. In addition, the lighting shall be arranged so that there will be no annoying glare directed or reflected toward residential buildings in a residential district. Such sight-proof screening shall consist of a sturdy opaque fence or, if appropriate, decorative planting, which complies with the aesthetic standards of the adjoining residential district, and adequate so that the R-MH-2 mobile home park use is not visible from any residential street or pedestrian way, except as to those portions of the operation of use which exceed the height limitations of the fencing or screening. This provision shall supersede all other fencing and lighting requirements for R-MH-2 mobile home park districts which may be contrary to this provision. 
(b)  Fencing plan to be part of preliminary and final plats. 
(1)  At the time of submission of an application for building permit for any R-MH-2 mobile home park district adjoining the side or rear line of a residential district, a fencing plan shall be submitted which shows all screening, fencing, or, where appropriate, decorative planting, and the materials and type of screening and fencing. This fencing plan will be considered a supplemental part of the building permit application and no building permit will be issued without an approved fencing plan. 
(2)  At the time of consideration of the building permit application, the community development department will review the fencing plan to determine the adequacy of the proposed screening, fencing, and/or planting to meet the purposes set forth herein. The director of community development shall submit a recommendation which shall include any information provided by the city engineer regarding the application. If the community development department determines that the proposed plan for screening, fencing, and/or planting is not adequate to obstruct visibility or is inharmonious with the aesthetic standards of the adjoining residential district, or is not of sufficient materials, construction, or strength to reasonably withstand factors of nature and weather, then the community development department may make such requirements as are necessary and reasonable to meet the criteria set forth herein. 
(c)  Fencing plan in R-MH-2 mobile home park districts. In those R-MH-2 mobile home park districts which adjoin the side or rear lot line of residential districts, a fencing plan shall be submitted and approval must be granted prior to the issuance of any building permit, or, if no building permit is required, prior to the issuance of any occupancy permit within the R-MH-2 mobile home park district. 
(d)  Fencing approval required for occupancy. An occupancy permit will not be issued until the fencing, screening, and planting, as required, is complete in accordance with the approved fencing plan. 
(e)  Fencing/screening definitions. As used in this section, fencing or screening shall mean a structure of wood, stone, ornamental iron, or metal, brick, tile, or concrete, and vinyl, landscaping or other opaque construction materials, connected together and designed for use in a fixed position, erected upon the ground for aesthetic and functional purposes. 
(Code 1977, § 17.22.080; Ord. No. 819, § 1, 10-1-2002)

_____ 
Sec. 122-473. - General requirements; all commercial districts. 
Unless specifically stated otherwise, the following requirements shall apply to all commercial districts. 
(1)  Lot width. For buildings, there shall be a minimum lot width of 100 feet at the front building line and such lot shall abut a street for a distance of not less than 100 feet. 
a.  Where a tract abuts a section line road or a state highway a distance of not less than 100 feet, and is commercially developed and platted as a unified tract, the requirement that a portion of each lot abuts a street may be met by showing that the lot abuts a common access driveway for the required distance. 
b.  Common access driveway means one or more shared private driveways intended to provide access for vehicles from the roadway of an approved public street to private property. 
c.  Common access driveways must be identified as such on the preliminary and final plat, must be restricted to use for ingress and egress only, and must meet all requirements for fire, emergency and other required access. Common access driveways must be constructed to the standards for streets to be dedicated to the public. 
d.  Where lot access is provided through a common access driveway, the face of the preliminary and final plat shall include statements that access to lots within the platted area is limited to the common access driveway (except as otherwise shown on the plat), that the common access driveway is not a public street, and that maintenance of the common access driveway shall be the responsibility of owners of lots within the platted area. The city may require covenants to be submitted to reasonably ensure continued maintenance of the common access driveway, which covenants shall provide that the city may enforce compliance therewith. 
(2)  Yard requirements. The following requirements shall apply to commercial districts: 
a.  Front yard. All buildings shall setback from the street right-of-way line to provide a front yard at least 30 feet in depth. Where commercially zoned property frontage is along a designated state highway there shall be a 50-foot setback for all buildings from the right-of-way and/or property line. 
b.  Rear yard. When any commercial building is to be serviced from the rear there shall be provided an alleyway, service court, rear yard or combination thereof, of not less than 30 feet. In all other cases if delivery service and firefighting capabilities can be maintained there shall be a rear yard for a main building of not less than 25 feet. Unattached or accessory buildings may not be located in the rear yard of a main building other than those designated for trash or recycling activities, and shall not encroach on any easement or be constructed closer than ten feet of the property line when abutting residential and/or agricultural zoned districts. Areas designated for trash and/or recycling activities, when adjacent to residential or agriculturally zoned property, shall not exceed six feet in height nor be located in required landscaping areas. 
Any commercial activity which involves or requires outside communication devices for the public and/or delivery or service activities shall not locate said device(s) closer than 35 feet to the rear property line. Such devices shall be set to accommodate the minimum necessary volume for the activity being conducted. 
The rear yard setback shall also be modified when a proposed building exceeds a total of 20 feet in height when any portion of the rear yard abuts a residential and/or agricultural zoned district. The building height shall include all facades and/or decorative features. In cases where the building height is greater than 20 feet from the finished grade, the rear yard setback shall be increased by two feet for every one foot of height increase above 20 feet. This provision shall not be construed as allowing a maximum total building height exceeding the limit set forth in subparagraph (3), below. 
c.  Side yard. For attached buildings, there shall be no side yard requirements, except as required by the fire code. For unattached buildings, there shall be a side yard setback of not less than five feet where abutting commercially zoned properties. For buildings and accessory buildings located on corner lots not designated as section line roads and/or state highways, there shall be a side yard setback from the intersecting streetof no less than 25 feet. On corner lots abutting section line roads and/or state highways, the side yard setback shall be 35 feet in all cases. The interior side yard on a corner lot shall be the same as for buildings and accessory buildings on an interior lot where abutting commercially zone properties; and when adjoining a residential district, a side yard of not less than 15 feet shall be provided. 
(3)  Height requirements. No building shall exceed 35 feet in height. 
(4)  Fencing, lighting and noise. 
a.  Requirements. 
1.  Whenever any new commercial land use is established so as to abut the side or rear line of a lot or tract in any existing residential district or any subcategory thereof, including a residential planned unit development (PUD), such residential use including, but not limited to, a parking lot or parking area, a fence or wall that is sight-proof from single-story residential areas or streets, not less than six feet nor more than ten feet high, as measured from the finished grade, shall be constructed between the commercial and residential lots. Such fence shall be maintained by the commercial property owner in good condition, as determined by the community development director. This fence shall be placed along the rear lot line and along the side lot line to the point of the front yard setback of the residential tract or lot, except where the front yard of the commercial lot is used for off-street parking, then the provisions of article X of this chapter pertaining to off-street parking lots shall apply. In addition, the lighting shall be arranged so that there will be no annoying glare directed or reflected toward residential buildings in a residential district. This provision shall supersede all other fencing and lighting requirements for commercial districts which may be contrary to this provision. 
2.  Whenever any land zoned for C-3, C-4 or C-5 commercial use is established so that the rear line abuts a lot of tract in any existing rural estates, single-family, two-family, low density multiple-family residential district, including a residential planned unit development (PUD), then the fence required under subsection (4)(a)1. shall be a masonry fence meeting the requirements of subparagraph (iv), below. 
3.  Whenever any new commercial land use is established so as to abut the side or rear line of a lot or tract in any existing rural estates, single-family, two-family, low density multiple-family residential district, including a residential planned unit development (PUD), and the commercial land use is such that high volumes of vehicular or pedestrian traffic may be generated or encouraged, including but not limited to retail convenience stores, retail intensive shopping centers, restaurants with exterior seating areas, and automobile car washes, then the fence required under subsection (4)(a)1. shall be a masonry fence not less than six feet nor more than eight feet high, as measured from the finished grade, constructed between the commercial and residential lots along the entire length of the adjoining property line. The masonry fence shall be of opaque material consisting of stone, brick, masonry block or split-faced masonry block. Wood, plastic, metal, imitation stone or concrete, or other material not made of stone, brick or masonry are not approved materials for construction of the separating fence between commercial and residential uses. Construction of the masonry fencing shall have an approved footing and construction plans as approved by the community development department; be required to have all necessary inspections as determined by the chief inspector; and be reinforced to the extent as to not be susceptible to collapse under adverse weather conditions. This may include, but not be limited to, steel reinforcement, concrete reinforcement or other measures to ensure stable conditions and longevity of the fence. 
4.  For purposes of this subdivision, a residential use shall be considered an existing use if both a preliminary plat and a final plat have been filed and approved by the city. 
b.  Fencing plan to be part of preliminary and final plats. 
1.  At the time of submission of an application for building permit for any commercial district adjoining the side or rear line of a residential district, a fencing plan shall be submitted which shows all screening, fencing, or, where appropriate, decorative planting, and the materials and type of screening and fencing. This fencing plan will be considered a supplemental part of the building permit application and no building permit will be issued without an approved fencing plan.

The director of community development shall submit a recommendation which shall include any information provided by the city engineer regarding the application. If the community development department determines that the proposed plan for screening, fencing, and/or planting is not adequate to obstruct visibility or is inharmonious with the aesthetic standards of the adjoining residential district, or is not of sufficient materials, construction, or strength to reasonably withstand factors of nature and weather, then the community development department may make such requirements as are necessary and reasonable to meet the criteria set forth herein.

(Ord. No. 1037, § 9, 2-2-2010)  
Sec. 122-640. - Findings and restrictions applicable to sexually oriented business. 
(a)  The city council has found that sexually oriented businesses require special supervision from the public safety agencies and community development agencies of the city in order to protect and preserve the health, safety, morals and welfare of the patrons of such businesses as well as the citizens of the city. Sexually oriented businesses are frequently used for unlawful sexual activities, including prostitution and sexual liaisons of a casual nature. There is convincing documented evidence that sexually oriented businesses, because of their very nature, have a deleterious effect on existing businesses around them and the surrounding residential areas adjacent to them, causing increased crime and the downgrading of property values. It is recognized that sexually oriented businesses, due to their nature, have serious and objectionable operational characteristics that contribute to urban blight and downgrade the quality of life in the adjacent area. The city council desires to minimize and control these adverse effects and thereby protect the health, safety, and welfare of the citizenry. This is done to protect the citizens from increased crime, preserve the quality of life, preserve the property values and character of surrounding neighborhoods, and deter the spread of urban blight. The city council does not condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material. The council recognizes that state and federal law prohibits the distribution of obscene materials, and therefore expects and encourages all law enforcement officials to enforce state obscenity statutes against any such illegal activities within the city. Based on these findings, it is the intent of the city council to regulate sexually oriented businesses in order to promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of the city, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious location and concentration of sexually oriented businesses within the city. 
(b)  The location of sexually oriented businesses shall be in compliance with applicable commercial zoning regulations of the city and may not be located within 1,000 feet of: 
(1)  Any building primarily and regularly used for worship services or religious activities; 
(2)  Any public or private educational facility, including but not limited to child day care facilities, nursery schools, preschools, kindergartens, elementary schools, private schools, intermediate schools, junior high schools, middle schools, high schools, vocational schools, secondary schools, continuation schools, special education schools, junior colleges, and universities; a school includes the school grounds, but does not include facilities used primarily for another purpose such as offices and vehicle maintenance facilities and only incidentally used by students; 
(3)  Any public or private fraternal organization; 
(4)  Any public park or recreational area which has been designated for park or recreational activities including but not limited to a park, playground, nature trail, swimming pool, reservoir, athletic field, golf course, basketball or tennis courts, wilderness area, or other similar land within the city which is under the control, operation, or management of the parks department or any public trusts, provided that a recreation area as used in this article shall not be interpreted as including turnpikes and highways that also contain jogging or bicycle paths; 
(5)  Any public library; 
(6)  A premises licensed pursuant to the alcoholic beverage control regulations of the state where any beverage containing alcohol is sold, distributed or served; 
(7)  An entertainment business which is oriented primarily towards children or family entertainment; 
(8)  Any other sexually oriented business; or 
(9)  Any land zoned or used for residential purposes. 
The distance between a sexually oriented business and any use named above shall be measured in a straight line, without regard to the intervening structures, objects or political boundaries, from the nearest exterior boundary of the parcel or the premises where a sexually oriented business is conducted, to the nearest property boundary of the premises of a listed use. For purposes of determining measured distance, property situated on the opposite side of the street shall be considered as if it were located on the same side of the street with the sexually oriented business. 
(c)  The following conditions shall be imposed on any conditional use permit granted for a sexually oriented business: 
(1)  The business may not operate between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and 9:00 a.m. the following day, and may not operate on Sunday; 
(2)  No one under the age of 21 years may be allowed to enter or be upon, or be employed by, such business; 
(3)  No low-point beer, beer, wine, alcoholic beverage, mixed drinks, or any other similar substance which is regulated by the Oklahoma Alcoholic Beverage Law Enforcement Commission or which requires a license from local government as a condition to selling may be served or sold within or upon the premises; 
(4)  Any other conditions determined to be appropriate by city staff, the planning commission or the city council. 
(d)  Any person, firm, or corporation who violates any provision of this article shall be guilty of an offense, and upon conviction shall be punished, subject to the provisions of section 1-7. For purposes of this provision, each day that the violation occurs shall be deemed a separate violation.

(a)  Requirements. Whenever any new Industrial-1 land use is established so as to abut the side or rear line of a lot or tract in any existing residential district or any subcategory thereof, including a residential planned unit development (PUD), such residential use including, but not limited to, a parking lot or parking area, a fence or wall that is sight-proof from single-story residential areas or streets, not less than six feet nor more than ten feet high, as measured from the finished grade, shall be constructed between the industrial and residential lots. Such fence shall be maintained by the industrial property owner in good condition, as determined by the community development director. This fence shall be placed along and within three feet of the rear lot line and along and within three feet of the side lot line to the point of the front yard setback of the residential tract or lot, except where the front yard of the industrial lot is used for off-street parking, then the provisions of article X of this chapter pertaining to off-street parking lots shall apply. In addition, the lighting shall be arranged so that there will be no annoying glare directed or reflected toward residential buildings in a residential district. Such sight-proof screening shall consist of a sturdy opaque fence and, if appropriate, decorative planting, which complies with the aesthetic standards of the adjoining residential district, and adequate so that the Industrial-1 use is not visible from any residential street or pedestrian way, except as to those portions of the operation of use which exceed the height limitations of the fencing or screening. This provision shall supersede all other fencing and lighting requirements for Industrial-1 districts which may be contrary to this provision. 
(b)  Fencing plan to be part of preliminary and final plats. 
(1)  At the time of submission of an application for building permit for any Industrial-1 district adjoining the side or rear line of a residential district, a fencing plan shall be submitted which shows all screening, fencing, and, where appropriate, decorative planting, and the materials and type of screening and fencing. This fencing plan will be considered a supplemental part of the building permit application and no building permit will be issued without an approved fencing plan. 
(2)  At the time of consideration of the building permit application, the community development department will review the fencing plan to determine the adequacy of the proposed fencing to meet the purposes set forth herein. The director of community development shall submit a recommendation which shall include any information provided by the city engineer regarding the application. If the community development department determines that the proposed plan for fencing is not adequate to obstruct visibility or is inharmonious with the aesthetic standards of the adjoining residential district, or is not of sufficient materials, construction, or strength to reasonably withstand factors of nature and weather, then the community development department may make such requirements as are necessary and reasonable to meet the criteria set forth herein. 
(c)  Fencing plan in Industrial-1 districts. In those Industrial-1 districts which adjoin the side or rear lot line of residential districts, a fencing plan shall be submitted and approval must be granted prior to the issuance of any building permit, or, if no building permit is required, prior to the issuance of any occupancy permit within the Industrial-1 district. 
(d)  Fencing approval required for occupancy. An occupancy permit will not be issued until the fencing, as required, is complete in accordance with the approved fencing plan.

(a)  Requirements. Whenever any new Industrial-2 land use is established so as to abut the side or rear line of a lot or tract in any existing Residential District or any subcategory thereof, including a residential planned unit development (PUD), such residential use including, but not limited to, a parking lot or parking area, a fence or wall that is sight-proof from single-story residential areas or streets, not less than eight feet nor more than ten feet high, as measured from the finished grade, shall be constructed between the industrial and residential lots. Such fence shall be maintained by the property owner in good condition, as determined by the community development director. This fence shall be placed along and within three feet of the rear lot line and along and within three feet of the side lot line to the point of the front yard setback of the residential tract or lot, except where the front yard of the industrial lot is used for off-street parking, then the provisions of article X of this chapter pertaining to off-street parking lots shall apply. In addition, the lighting shall be arranged so that there will be no annoying glare directed or reflected toward residential buildings in a residential district. Such sight-proof screening shall consist of a sturdy opaque fence and, if appropriate, decorative planting, which complies with the aesthetic standards of the adjoining residential district, and adequate so that the Industrial-2 use is not visible from any residential street or pedestrian way, except as to those portions of the operation of use which exceed the height limitations of the fencing or screening. This provision shall supersede all other fencing and lighting requirements for Industrial-2 districts which may be contrary to this provision. 
(b)  Fencing plan to be part of preliminary and final plats. 
(1)  At the time of submission of an application for building permit for any Industrial-2 district adjoining the side or rear line of a residential district, a fencing plan shall be submitted which shows all screening, fencing, and, where appropriate, decorative planting, and the materials and type of screening and fencing. This fencing plan will be considered a supplemental part of the building permit application and no building permit will be issued without an approved fencing plan. 
(2)  At the time of consideration of the building permit application, the community development department will review the fencing plan to determine the adequacy of the proposed fencing to meet the purposes set forth herein. The director of community development shall submit a recommendation which shall include any information provided by the city engineer regarding the application. If the community development department determines that the proposed plan for fencing is not adequate to obstruct visibility or is inharmonious with the aesthetic standards of the adjoining residential district, or is not of sufficient materials, construction, or strength to reasonably withstand factors of nature and weather, then the community development department may make such requirements as are necessary and reasonable to meet the criteria set forth herein. 
(c)  Fencing plan in Industrial-2 districts. In those Industrial-2 districts which adjoin the side or rear lot line of residential districts, a fencing plan shall be submitted and approval must be granted prior to the issuance of any building permit, or, if no building permit is required, prior to the issuance of any occupancy permit within the Industrial-2 district. 
(d)  Fencing approval required for occupancy. An occupancy permit will not be issued until the fencing, as required, is complete in accordance with the approved fencing plan. 
(e)  Fencing/screening definitions. As used in this section, fencing or screening shall mean a structure of wood, stone, ornamental iron, or metal, brick, tile, or concrete, and vinyl, or other opaque construction materials, connected together and designed for use in a fixed position, erected upon the ground for aesthetic and functional purposes.

(a)  Requirements. Whenever any new Industrial-3 land use is established so as to abut the side or rear line of a lot or tract in any existing residential district or any subcategory thereof, including a residential planned unit development (PUD), such residential use including, but not limited to, a parking lot or parking area, a fence or wall that is sight-proof from single-story residential areas or streets, ten feet high, as measured from the finished grade, shall be constructed between the industrial and residential lots. Such fence shall be maintained by the property owner in good condition, as determined by the community development director. This fence shall be placed along and within three feet of the rear lot lines and along and within three feet of the side lot line to the point of the front yard setback of the residential tract or lot, except where the front yard of the industrial lot is used for off-street parking, then the provisions of article X of this chapter pertaining to off-street parking lots shall apply. In addition, the lighting shall be arranged so that there will be no annoying glare directed or reflected toward residential buildings in a residential district. Such sight-proof screening shall consist of a sturdy opaque fence and, if appropriate, decorative planting, which complies with the aesthetic standards of the adjoining residential district, and adequate so that the Industrial-3 use is not visible from any residential street or pedestrian way, except as to those portions of the operation of use which exceed the height limitations of the fencing or screening. This provision shall supersede all other fencing and lighting requirements for Industrial-3 districts which may be contrary to this provision. 
(b)  Fencing plan to be part of preliminary and final plats. 
(1)  At the time of submission of an application for building permit for any Industrial-3 district adjoining the side or rear line of a residential district, a fencing plan shall be submitted which shows all screening, fencing, and, where appropriate, decorative planting, and the materials and type of screening and fencing. This fencing plan will be considered a supplemental part of the building permit application and no building permit will be issued without an approved fencing plan. 
(2)  At the time of consideration of the building permit application, the community development department will review the fencing plan to determine the adequacy of the proposed fencing to meet the purposes set forth herein. The director of community development shall submit a recommendation which shall include any information provided by the city engineer regarding the application. If the community development department determines that the proposed plan for fencing is not adequate to obstruct visibility or is inharmonious with the aesthetic standards of the adjoining residential district, or is not of sufficient materials, construction, or strength to reasonably withstand factors of nature and weather, then the community development department may make such requirements as are necessary and reasonable to meet the criteria set forth herein. 
(c)  Fencing plan in Industrial-3 districts. In those Industrial-3 districts which adjoin the side or rear lot line of residential districts, a fencing plan shall be submitted and approval must be granted prior to the issuance of any building permit, or, if no building permit is required, prior to the issuance of any occupancy permit within the Industrial-3 district. 
(d)  Fencing approval required for occupancy. An occupancy permit will not be issued until the fencing, as required, is complete in accordance with the approved fencing plan. 
(e)  Fencing/screening definitions. As used in this section, fencing or screening shall mean a structure of wood, stone, ornamental iron, or metal, brick, tile, or concrete, and vinyl, or other opaque construction materials, connected together and designed for use in a fixed position, erected upon the ground for aesthetic and functional purposes.

ARTICLE VIII. - PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS[11] 

Footnotes: 
--- (11) --- 
State Law reference Planned unit developments, 11 O.S. § 43-110 et seq. 
 
Sec. 122-791. - Generally. 
A planned unit development is a special zoning district category that provides an alternate approach to conventional land use controls. The planned unit development may be used for particular tracts or parcels of land that are under common ownership and are to be developed as one unit according to a master development plan. The planned unit development is subject to special review procedures. Once approved by the city council, it becomes a special zoning classification for the property it represents. 
(Code 1977, § 17.44.010)  
Sec. 122-792. - Purpose and intent of article. 
(a)  It is the intent of this article to encourage unified design of residential, commercial, industrial or institutional areas and facilities, or combinations thereof, and to provide for integrated development having harmony of design and variety of function. It is also the intent of this article to encourage the development of planned commercial and industrial sites to eliminate the adverse impacts of traditional strip zoning. 
(b)  The purpose of the planned unit development provisions is to: 
(1)  Encourage innovative land development while maintaining appropriate limitations on the character and intensity of use, ensuring compatibility with adjoining and proximate properties, and following the guidelines of the comprehensive plan; 
(2)  Permit flexibility within the development to maximize the unique physical features of the particular site; 
(3)  Encourage efficient use of land, facilitate economic arrangement of buildings and circulation systems, and encourage diversified living environments and land uses; 
(4)  Achieve a continuity of function and design within the development; 
(5)  Encourage innovative development of smaller parcels of land that have been passed over; and 
(6)  Provide a vehicle for negotiating modifications in standard development requirements in order to both encourage innovative development and protect the health, safety and welfare of the community. 
(Code 1977, § 17.44.020)  
Sec. 122-793. - Establishment of district; minimum area; master plan. 
A planned unit development may be authorized by an amendment to the official zoning district map after public hearings by the planning commission and city council. A planned unit development shall be considered a special zoning district, and it may be authorized for any use or combination of uses permitted in this chapter. A planned unit development must comply with the following requirements: 
(1)  Minimum district area. A planned unit development zoning district shall have a minimum area of not less than one acre or the minimum area requirement of the zoning district which the planned unit development is based upon, whichever is greater. 
(2)  Master plan. A planned unit development master plan is required as the basis for review and approval of a planned unit development application. The planned unit development master plan shall be adopted as a part of the ordinance of rezoning and shall be in conformance with the requirements of this chapter and the following: 
a.  The planned unit development master plan shall consist of two elements, the design statement and the master development plan map; 
b.  The planned unit development master plan shall establish residential densities, as well as amount, type and general location of all land uses; and 
c.  The planned unit development master plan shall serve as the basis for review and approval of all subdivision plats and building permits within the planned unit development. 
(Code 1977, § 17.44.030)  
Sec. 122-794. - Effect of approval. 
(a)  Approval of a zoning change to planned unit development adopts the master plan prepared by the applicant and reviewed as a part of the application. The master plan establishes new and specific requirements for amount and type of land use, residential densities, development regulations, and location of specific elements of the development such as open space, landscaping and screening. 
(b)  The planned unit development classification replaces any previous zoning district classification on a parcel. 
(c)  Where there is no provision in the planned unit development master plan for special development regulations, the requirements of the most restrictive conventional zoning district in which a proposed use or a structure is permitted shall be applied to the development. 
(Code 1977, § 17.44.040)  
Sec. 122-795. - Criteria for review and approval. 
(a)  Because the planned unit development provides the opportunity for higher densities, greater design flexibility, mixed land uses, and improved marketability, the applicant should be prepared to provide amenities and services that might not be required or possible in a conventional development. Review and approval of a planned unit development is, therefore, a process of negotiation between the city government and the applicant to achieve the intents and purposes of this chapter and the comprehensive plan. The following factors should be specifically included as review criteria for the evaluation of a planned unit development application. Other factors not listed in this section may also be considered in the review process in order to respond to specific design and land use proposals. 
(b)  The following design standards should be specifically included as review criteria for the evaluation of a planned unit development application: 
(1)  General development standards. The proposed planned unit development should be designed to provide for the unified development of the area in accordance with the spirit and purpose of the comprehensive plan and the land uses and zoning districts adjacent to it. 
(2)  Modification of zoning requirements. Design of the planned unit development may provide for modification of conventional zoning ordinance requirements for such elements as yard areas, densities, setback and height on individual lots in accordance with the planned unit development master plan. 
(3)  Conformance with master plan and comprehensive plan. Density, land use and intensity of use requirements should be based on the planned unit development master plan and should be reviewed carefully for conformance to the comprehensive plan. 
(4)  Conformance with building code. Building code requirements should not be reduced or modified in the design of a planned unit development. 
(5)  Gross density. The maximum number of dwelling units within a planned unit development should be based on calculation of gross density. Gross density should be established in the planned unit development master plan and should be calculated by dividing the total land area to be developed for residential uses (exclusive of arterial streets) by the number of dwelling units. 
(6)  Housing type and location. Location and type of housing should be established in a general pattern and shown on the master development plan map. 
(7)  Park dedication, parking facilities and landscaping. Park dedication requirements (chapter 106, article VI), parking requirements (article X of this chapter) and landscaping requirements (article IX, division 2 of this chapter) should not be reduced in the design of a planned unit development. 
(8)  Intensity. Proposed development should conform to the level of intensity guidelines in the comprehensive plan and should be developed in a manner and at a scale that will be compatible with adjacent developed neighborhoods. 
(9)  Amenities. Amenities should be considered as an important justification for development and city approval of a planned unit development. Where gross or net densities are to be increased to promote economy of development, or where other methods of land use intensification are proposed, usable open space should be furnished along with provisions for its permanent retention and continued maintenance. Sidewalks and pedestrian ways shall be planned where it is necessary to provide for amenity and public safety. 
(10)  Minimum land area and frontage. The minimum area and frontage for a planned unit development request involving office, commercial or industrial land uses should generally be at least the minimum required by the conventional zoning associated with the proposal. 
(11)  Streets. The following are general design standards for streets: 
a.  Street design should be innovative and should restrict through traffic from residential areas as much as possible. 
b.  Encouragement should be given to design of short local streets serving limited areas, such as the residential cul-de-sac. 
c.  Development of a private street system should be considered appropriate under certain conditions where there is no through traffic. However a private street system should not serve as a reason for reduction of minimum design and paving standards in urban areas. 
d.  On-street parking bays or other similar areas should not be approved. 
(12)  Adjacent land uses. The following general guidelines should be used to establish the relationship of the planned unit development to abutting land uses: 
a.  The master development plan map shall show graphically the treatments that will be employed to separate the planned unit development from abutting properties, including commitments to landscaping, screening, earth berms or similar techniques. 
b.  It is appropriate to specifically establish areas with height limitations where a transition to more intense uses is proposed or where a higher intensity development is proposed to abut a lower intensity area. 
(13)  Mixed land use developments. Where a planned unit development proposes a mix of uses which would generally be incompatible with a conventional development, the planned unit development master plan should specifically establish appropriate guidelines to ensure a harmonious development. 
(14)  Common access. In commercial or industrial developments, the planned unit development master plan should establish specific standards and locations for common access driveways both within the development and abutting arterial streets. 
(c)  Streets and alleys for planned unit developments should be designed and constructed in accordance with city standards and specifications for right-of-way width and paving cross sections. 
(Code 1977, § 17.44.050)  
Sec. 122-796. - Application procedure generally. 
(a)  The developer and/or builder of a planned unit development shall follow a five-step application and review procedure: 
(1)  Pre-application review; 
(2)  Application for rezoning, and submission of the planned unit development master plan, including the design statement and master development plan; 
(3)  Preliminary plat, where required by the subdivision regulations (chapter 106); 
(4)  Final plat, where required by the subdivision regulations (chapter 106); and 
(5)  Application for building permits and site plan review. 
(b)  Each required step shall be completed and approved before the following step is reviewed. Where appropriate, other methods authorized in the subdivision regulations may be substituted for the steps described in subsections (a)(3) and (4) of this section. The planning commission and city council may, however, review more than one step at the same public hearing. 
(c)  Public hearings shall be required as follows: 
(1)  Public hearings shall be held on the application for rezoning and the planned unit development master plan in accordance with regular procedures for zoning applications; provided, if the proposed rezoning includes a use that is allowed only in the C6 commercial special use district, then the notice required shall be in accordance with that required for C6 zoning amendments; and 
(2)  Public hearings on required plats shall be held in accordance with regular procedures established in the subdivision regulations.

(Code 1977, § 17.44.062)  
Sec. 122-799. - Preliminary plat. 
Upon approval of the planned unit development master plan and the ordinance of rezoning, the developer shall prepare a preliminary plat for the entire development area. Where a recorded plat exists and where there will be no extensive easements, no property owners' associations, no plat restrictions, and no sale of lots which do not conform to the platted lot lines, the planning commission may waive the platting requirement. 
(Code 1977, § 17.44.063)  
Sec. 122-800. - Final plat. 
Where a subdivision plat has been required for a planned unit development, the developer shall prepare a final plat for review, approval and filing of record according to procedures established by the subdivision regulations (chapter 106). In addition to these procedures, the following shall apply: 
(1)  The final plat shall include provisions for the ownership and maintenance of common open space. The open space may be dedicated to a private association or to the public, provided that a dedication to the public shall not be accepted without the approval of the city council.

(b)  Continuing review of project status. Development of at least one tract within a Planned Unit Development (PUD) shall begin within three years from approval date of the PUD master plan. If development has not begun, the city council, after hearing the planning commission's recommendation, may cause the reversion of the PUD to its former zoning classification(s). Development must also take place on at least one additional tract every three years after the initial three-year deadline, or the city council, after hearing the planning commission's recommendation, may cause the reversion of all remaining undeveloped tracts within the PUD to their former zoning classifications. This ordinance shall apply to all PUD rezoning applications approved after the effective date of this section. 
To prevent the tracts in the PUD from reverting back to their former zoning classifications, one of the following must occur: 
(1)  Development. In order for development to be considered to have begun, an application shall be made for a plat or building permit. Said permit or application fees shall be paid prior to the end of the three-year period. When construction of permanent improvements or structures is the method of development they must begin within six months of the purchase of said permit. When platting is the method of development there shall be at least a preliminary plat approved by council within one year of application. A final plat shall be approved within one year from date of approval of the preliminary plat, or neither will be considered to have begun and the city council, after hearing the planning commission's recommendation, may cause the reversion of all remaining undeveloped tracts within the PUD to their former zoning classifications. 
(2)  Development time line. 
a.  Application for permanent improvements or structures must be made within three years of effective date of the PUD. Actual construction must begin within six months of application; or 
b.  Application for preliminary plat must be made within three years of the effective date of the PUD. Preliminary plat must be approved by council one year from date of application. Council must approve final plat within one year after the preliminary plat has been approved. 
(3)  Extension. To request an extension, the owner may submit in writing to the city council not less than 60 days before the expiration, reason or reasons for not starting development within the PUD and request the actual extension of time required to begin development. The planning commission shall review all such requests and make a recommendation to the city council. The city council shall then review such requests and determine if the extension of time is warranted. At that time, the city council shall either grant or deny the extension or modify the time requested. Only one extension will be permitted, and if no development has taken place before the expiration of the extension, the city council, after hearing the planning commission's recommendation, may cause the reversion of all remaining undeveloped tracts within the PUD to their former zoning classifications.

(c)  In all single-family residential and two-family residential districts, all yards shall be landscaped. The landscaping of these yards shall, at a minimum, consist of a combination of living vegetation, such as trees, shrubs, grasses or ground cover materials, planted or transplanted and maintained, or preserved as existing natural vegetation areas (e.g. woods or thickets). 
In all single-family residential and two-family residential districts, within the front yard of a lot of a newly constructed residential structure, there shall be at least one medium tree (two-inch caliper or greater) planted and/or existing and maintained for every 75 feet, or fraction thereof, of frontage with a minimum of one tree per lot. An occupancy permit shall not be issued for the residential structure until the tree(s) required hereunder have been planted and/or are existing and maintained. 
(d)  For multi-family, commercial and industrial development, landscaping is required along and within the front property line along section-line road frontage. Planting shall be adjacent to, but not in the public right-of-way. Generally, planting required in this section should be in an irregular line and spaced at random. Clustering of plants and tree species is recommended to produce a professionally acceptable composition and mix of vegetation. 
(e)  Landscaping in commercial districts shall meet the following requirements: 
(1)  Rear yard landscaping. There shall be a ten-foot rear yard landscaping buffer for all commercial lost that abut a residential or agricultural zoned district. This buffer must contain one evergreen tree of two-inch caliper per ten lineal feet; or one deciduous tree of two-inch caliper per 15 lineal feet. Other requirements as outlined in subsection 122-873(c)(1) are also applicable. This required landscape buffer shall run the length of the commercial property (exclusive of permitted driveways of sidewalks). No parking, hard surface treatment or other commercial activities shall be placed within this required landscape buffer, other than permitted driveways or sidewalks. 
(2)  Side yard landscaping. All commercially zoned property shall provide for a landscaped side yard area where the property abuts a street, public property or right-of-way, or a non-commercially zoned district. On a side yard that abuts a local street, collector street, public property and/or right-of-way (other than a section line road or a state highway) or a non-commercially zoned property, there shall be a 7.5-foot greenbelt landscape buffer outside the right-of-way. This area shall contain a tree planting of one tree per 35 lineal feet of street frontage or property line, whichever is applicable. 
On a side yard that abuts a section line road or state highway, there shall be a ten-foot greenbelt landscape buffer outside the right-of-way. This greenbelt shall include one tree per 50 lineal feet of road frontage. 
Landscape buffers shall run the length of the property line (exclusive of permitted driveways or sidewalks) and be shown in detail on the landscape plan. No parking lot or hard surface treatment shall encroach on the required buffer, other than permitted driveways of sidewalks. Nor shall trash receptacles or recycling activities be located in the required buffers. 
(3)  Front yard landscaping. There shall be a ten-foot landscaping buffer outside the right-of-way along all front yards in commercial zoned districts. If the front yard abuts a local street, collector street, public property and/or right-of-way (other than a section line road or a state highway), one tree per every thousand square feet of building area will be required. In addition, one tree per every 50 lineal feet of street frontage will be required. 
If the front yard abuts a section line road or state highway, one tree per every thousand square feet of building area will be required. In addition, one tree per every 35 lineal feet of street frontage will be required. 
Fifty percent of the required trees in the front yard landscape buffer may be used in parking lot islands. Clustering of the required trees in a manner so as to not inhibit tree growth or compromise the integrity of paved surfaces, buildings, screening walls and sidewalks is acceptable. Trees located in parking lot islands must have adequate island size to accommodate proper tree growth, moisture requirements and longevity. 
These requirements must be shown on the required landscaped plan and be approved by the community development director. Creative design is encouraged as long as it is in keeping with the intent and purpose of the landscaping requirements to provide environmental enhancements, beautification, heat mitigation and community enhancement of com metrical properties. Designs that relegate tree planting to secondary status, side or hidden areas are not deemed acceptable design practices. 
(f)  Landscaping in industrial districts shall meet the same standards applicable to commercial district when adjoining residential and/or agriculturally zoned districts. 
(g)  Multi-family. 
(1)  The tree requirements for a duplex shall be one tree per unit located within the front yard outside of the right-of-way. Additionally, one tree shall be planted in the back yard within 15 feet of the rear property line. The required trees shall be a minimum of two-inch caliper.

Note 1: For mixed uses containing any combination of retail, office, manufacturing and industrial, or warehousing activity, parking requirements shall be tabulated separately for each use within the development using the list of specific standards or table 3. When types of uses are not known at the time of development, then the director shall make the determination as to the type of parking, e.g., retail, which will be required. Mixed uses regulated under separate parking requirements shall not be combined to achieve a larger square footage total that would result in a reduced parking requirement. Where any part of a mixed use is converted to another use category, then the parking requirements shall be recalculated based on the new square footage figure. 
Note 2: Where a manufacturing and industrial use has more than one working shift of employees, parking facilities shall be adequate to accommodate overlap requirements during transition periods. 
Note 3: Where a multiple-purpose retail or industrial building is proposed to be occupied by a use which can be demonstrated by the occupant to require less parking than the standards contained in this section, the director may permit paving of a smaller parking area to meet the estimated need; provided, however, that the balance of the land to be created by the proposed use and the amount of parking thus determined shall be the off-street parking requirement for the permitted use. This decision can be appealed to the board of adjustment.

APPENDIX A - CABLE FRANCHISE AGREEMENT[1] 
Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note Printed herein is the Cable Franchise Agreement adopted December 1, 2015, by and between the City of Mustang and CoxCom, LLC. Amendments are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original ordinance. Obvious misspellings and punctuation errors have been corrected without notation. Additions made for clarity are indicated by brackets. 
 
ARTICLE 1 - GRANT, TERM AND NATURE OF FRANCHISE 
 
Section 1. - Short title. 
This cable television franchise agreement shall be known and may be cited as the "Cox Cable Franchise."  
Section 2. - Definitions. 
The word "City" as used herein shall mean The City of Mustang, Oklahoma, and the word "Company" as used herein shall mean CoxCom, LLC, d/b/a Cox, a limited liability company organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware and licensed to do business in the State of Oklahoma, and its successors and assigns. All of the definitions contained in section 22-102 of the Cable Ordinance, as it may be amended from time to time, are expressly incorporated herein.  
Section 3. - Grant. 
The City hereby grants to the Company a non-exclusive Franchise to install, construct, operate and maintain a Cable System and to provide Cable Services under such terms and conditions as are set forth in this Agreement. This franchise does not grant the Company any right of eminent domain. This franchise does not grant the authority to Company to provide telecommunications information services, nor may such services, if provided by Company, be regulated pursuant to this franchise. Any requirement, duty, obligation, or privilege arising from the Cable Ordinance not specifically mentioned herein, is incorporated into this Franchise Agreement just as if it had been fully set forth.  
Section 4. - Franchise Area. 
This Franchise is granted for the entire corporate boundaries of the City as of the Effective Date of December 1, 2015, and shall also include any additions thereto, by annexation or other legal means, during the term of the Franchise. The Company shall provide Cable Service to the entire franchise area pursuant to Section 22-181 of the Cable Ordinance.  
Section 5. - Service Discrimination Prohibited. 
The Company shall not deny access to Cable Service to any group of potential residential cable subscribers because of the income of the residents of the local area in which such group resides. The Company shall comply with all applicable local, state and federal nondiscrimination statutes and regulations.  
Section 6. - Legal Compliance. 
The Company shall comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws and standards with respect to the construction, maintenance and operation of a cable system.  
Section 7. - Term. 
The City hereby grants to the Company the right and privilege, for a term of ten (10) years, commencing on December 1, 2015, to construct, erect, operate, modify and maintain, in, upon, across, above, over and under the streets, alleys, easements and other public ways and places now laid out or dedicated within the City, and all extensions thereof or additions thereto within the City, such towers, antennas, cables, electronic equipment and other network appurtenances necessary for the operation and maintenance of a Cable System within the City.  
Section 8. - Rights and Privileges. 
The rights and privileges granted by this Franchise are expressly made subject to and shall be limited by: (1) the provisions of the Cable Ordinance, as it presently exists or may hereafter be amended; (2) the provisions of this Franchise Agreement entered into by and between The City and the Company; (3) the City's City Charter; (4) the Oklahoma State Constitution; (5) Oklahoma State law; and (6) the Federal Cable Act of 1984, as amended.  
Section 9. - Effective Date. 
This Franchise Ordinance shall become effective on December 1, 2015. The Oklahoma Attorney General has opined (2002 OK AG 21) that the Oklahoma Constitutional provision requiring a vote of the people to approve the grant or renewal of franchises is preempted by 47 U.S.C. §§ 541 and 546 of the Communications Act of 1934 as amended; therefore, renewal of this franchise shall not be submitted to a vote of the citizens of the City of Mustang.  
Section 10. - Additional Cable Franchises. 
Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent the City from granting a cable franchise to any other person, firm or corporation. The City shall comply with applicable law concerning the granting of additional cable franchises. In the event the City grants any other entity a cable franchise with terms and conditions that are more favorable or less burdensome, to use the public streets or rights-of-way to deliver cable services to residents, the Company may request that this Cable Franchise be modified consistent with applicable law.  
Section 11. - Non-Waiver. 
Neither the Company nor the City shall be relieved of its obligations to comply, promptly and completely, with any provision of the Franchise by reason of any failure of the other party to promptly enforce compliance with this Franchise, nor does either party waive or limit any of its rights under this Franchise by reason of such failure or neglect.  
ARTICLE 2 - GENERAL RIGHT-OF-WAY USE AND CONSTRUCTION 
 
Section 1. - Right to Construct. 
The Company may perform all construction in the Public Rights-of-Way for any facility needed for the maintenance, operation or extension of the Company's Cable System, subject to the terms of this Franchise, the Mustang Municipal Code and generally applicable laws.  
Section 2. - General Standard. 
All work authorized and required hereunder shall be done in a safe, thorough and workmanlike manner. All equipment shall be durable and installed and maintained in accordance with good engineering practices and comply with applicable law.  
Section 3. - Joint Trenching/Boring. 
To the extent it makes economic sense, the Company shall joint trench or share bores or cuts and work with other providers (such as, but not limited to, telecommunications, gas and electric companies), licensees, permittees and franchisees so as to reduce the number of Public Right-of-Way cuts within the City. The Company may request assistance from the City to facilitate access to joint trenches or shared bores that are approved by the City.  
Section 4. - Removal at Expiration of the Franchise. 
At the expiration of the term for which this Franchise is granted, or upon the expiration of any renewal or extension period which may be granted, the City shall, subject to any other lawful and valid authorizations the Company may have to use the System in Public Rights-of-Way, have the right to require the Company, at the Company's sole expense: (i) to remove all portions of the System from all Rights-of-Way within the City; and (ii) to restore affected sites to their original condition. The City may not order removal of the System, or portions thereof, until the parties have exhausted all applicable processes governing cable franchise renewals set forth in 47 U.S.C. §546. Should the Company fail, refuse or neglect to comply with the City's directive, all portions of the System, or any part thereof, may at the option of the City become the sole property of the City, at no expense to the City, or be removed, altered or relocated by the City at the cost of the Company. The City shall not be liable to the Company for damages resulting from such removal, alteration or relocation.  
Section 5. - Obligations of the City. 
(a)  The City agrees not to unreasonably block, restrict, or limit the construction, installation, maintenance or upgrade of Company's Cable system. 
(b)  The City agrees to process any and all applicable permits for the installation, construction, maintenance, repair, removal, and other activities associated with the placement of Company's communications or transmission facilities of any kind in a timely and prompt manner.  
Section 6. - Right-of-Way Use Conditions. 
In addition to complying with the construction and street occupancy standards set forth in the Mustang Municipal Code, the Company shall comply with the following: 
(a)  The Company shall utilize existing poles, conduits and other facilities whenever possible, and shall not construct or install any new, different or additional poles, conduits, or other facilities, on public property, until written approval of the City, is obtained, which approval by the City shall not be unreasonably withheld. However, no location of any pole or wire-holding structure of the Company shall be a vested interest and such poles or structures shall be removed or modified by the Company at its own expense whenever the City determines that the public convenience would be enhanced thereby. 
(b)  The facilities of the Company shall be installed underground in those areas of the City where existing telephone and electric services are both underground at the time of network construction. In the areas where either telephone or electric utility facilities are installed aerially at the time of network construction, the Company may install its facilities aerially with the understanding that at such time as the existing aerial facilities are required to be placed underground by the City, the Company shall likewise place its facilities underground. 
(c)  The Company shall notify the City prior to beginning any work, of the Company's intention to commence any construction in any streets. The City shall cooperate with the Company in granting any permits required, providing such grant and subsequent construction by the Company shall not unduly interfere with the use of such streets and that proposed construction shall be done in accordance with applicable ordinances. 
(d)  All transmission lines, equipment and structures shall be so installed and located as to cause minimum interference with the rights and reasonable convenience of property owners and at all times shall be kept and maintained in a safe, adequate and substantial condition, and in good order and repair. The Company shall at all times use ordinary care and shall install and maintain in use commonly accepted methods and devices for preventing failures and accidents which are likely to cause damage, injuries or nuisances to the public. Suitable barricades, flags, lights, flares or other safety devices shall be used at such times and places as are reasonably required for the safety of all members of the public. Any poles or other fixtures placed in any public way by the Company shall be placed in such a manner as not to interfere with the usual travel on such public way. 
(e)  The Company shall, at its own expense and in a manner approved by the City, restore to City standards and specifications any damage or disturbance caused to the public way as a result of its operations or construction on its behalf. Company shall guarantee and maintain such restoration for a period of one year against defective materials or workmanship. 
(f)  Whenever, in case of fire or other disaster, it becomes necessary in the judgment of the City Manager or the Chief of the Fire or Police Department, to remove or damage any of the Company's facilities, no charge shall be made by the Company against the City for restoration and repair, unless such acts taken by the City amount to gross negligence. 
(g)  The Company shall have the authority to trim trees on public property at its own expense as may be necessary to protect its wires and facilities, subject to the supervision and direction of the City. Trimming of trees on private property shall require written consent of the private property owner. 
(h)  The Company at its expense shall protect, support, temporarily disconnect, relocate, or remove any property of the Company when in the opinion of the City Manager the same is required by reason of traffic conditions, public safety, street vacation, freeway or street construction or reconstruction, change or establishment of street grade, installation of sewers, drains, water pipes, power lines, signal lines, transportation facilities, tracks, or any other types of structures or improvements by governmental agencies whether acting in a governmental or a proprietary capacity, or any other structure or public improvement, including, but not limited to, movement of buildings, urban renewal and redevelopment, and any general program under which the City shall undertake to cause all such properties to be located beneath the surface of the ground. The Company shall in all cases have the privilege, subject to the corresponding obligations, to abandon any property of the Company in place. Nothing hereunder shall be deemed a taking of the property of the Company and the Company shall not be entitled to any costs, fees, damages or surcharges by reason of anything hereunder. To the extent there are state or federal funds available to compensate the Company for the cost of relocating its facilities, the Company shall be offered such compensation on a nondiscriminatory basis. 
(i)  Upon failure of the Company to commence, pursue or complete any work to be done in any street and required by law or by the provisions of the Cable Ordinance, within the time prescribed and to the satisfaction of the City Council, the City Council may, at its option, cause such work to be done and the Company shall pay to the City the cost thereof in the itemized amounts reported by the City Manager to the Company within thirty (30) days after receipt of such itemized report. 
(j)  The Company shall make no paving cuts or curb cuts unless absolutely necessary, but only after written permission has been given by the City Manager. 
(k)  The Company shall install, in conduit, all cable passing under any roadway. 
(l)  Except as provided for herein and in applicable ordinances, the City shall not unreasonably block, restrict, or limit the construction of the Company's Cable System and shall process any and all applicable permits for the installation, construction, maintenance, repair, removal or other activities associated with the Company's Cable System of any kind in a timely and prompt manner. 
(m)  Except as provided for herein and in applicable ordinances, the City shall process any and all applicable permits for the installation, construction, maintenance, repair, removal, and other activities associated with the placement of the Company's Cable System in a timely and prompt manner.  
Section 7. - Insurance. 
The Company shall maintain insurance in the amounts and pursuant to the conditions set forth in Section 22-161 of the Cable Ordinance. Further, the Company shall indemnify and hold the City harmless in compliance with, and to the extent as set forth in, Section 22-162 of the Cable Ordinance.  
ARTICLE 3 - FRANCHISE FEE/CONSIDERATION 
 
Section 1. - Franchise Fee. 
(a)  In consideration for the franchise grant of authority contained herein, the Company shall pay to the City a franchise fee of five percent (5%) of the annual gross revenues derived from operation of the Cable System by the Company as provided in section 22-156 of the Cable Ordinance to provide Cable Service. Nothing in this Franchise shall be construed to limit any authority of the City to impose any tax, fee or assessment of general applicability. 
(b)  Such payment shall be in addition to any other payment, charge, permit, fee or bond owed to the City by the Company and shall not be construed as payment in lieu of personal or real property taxes levied by State, County or local authorities; provided, however, such fee shall include and be in lieu of any fee required by the City for any construction, building, or other permit for use or occupation of, or work in, the streets, except for the inspection fee and service charge levied under the Mustang Municipal Code.  
Section 2. - Additional Commitments Not Franchise Fees. 
No term or condition in this Franchise shall in any way modify or affect the Company's obligation to pay franchise fees. Although the total sum of franchise fee payments and additional commitments set forth elsewhere in this Franchise may total more than five percent (5%) of the Company's Gross Revenues in any 12-month period, the Company agrees that the additional commitments herein are not franchise fees, nor are they to be offset or credited against any franchise fee payments due to the City, nor do they represent an increase in franchise fees to be passed through to subscribers.  
Section 3. - Alternative Compensation. 
In the event the obligation of the Company to compensate the City through franchise fee payments is lawfully suspended or eliminated, in whole or part, then the Company shall pay to the City such other compensation as is permitted by state or federal law.  
Section 4. - Audit. 
The City shall have the right to conduct audits pursuant to Sections 22-156 and 22-164 of the Cable Ordinance.  
ARTICLE 4 - CUSTOMER SERVICE STANDARDS

To the extent such standards are in conflict with those set forth in Section 22-187 of the Cable Ordinance, the parties agree that the federal standards shall prevail.
