to questions from the applicant's personal data questionnaire are

B. The examiner shall ask questions based on the information contained in
the personal data questionnaire. Before administering the test, the
examiner shall ask each applicant whether there is any more
information related to the personal data questionnaire which the
applicant would like to provide. There shall also be a post-test review,
during which the examiner shall again ask the participant, if deception
is indicated, whether there is any information which the applicant is
withholding.
C. If the examiner shall deem any of the applicant's responses to be
deceptive, the examiner must tell the applicant immediately and give
the applicant an opportunity to explain, deny or admit the deception. If
the applicant denies being deceptive or if the explanation is found
unsatisfactory by the examiner, the applicant will be given the
opportunity to retake the test with a second examiner. Notice of the
opportunity to retest shall be given in writing to the applicant. The
second examiner will not have access to the results of the first test prior
to readministering the polygraph. If the second examiner finds no
deception, the applicant will be considered as having passed the
polygraph. If the second examiner also finds the applicant deceptive,
the applicant will be considered as having failed the examination.
D. An applicant who has failed both tests may appeal to the Civil Service
Commission for a third examination, and the decision to give the
applicant an opportunity to take a third test resides solely within the

shall make a written recommendation to the Commission on whether
the applicant is appropriate for consideration for appointment as a
police officer.

and, if the recommendation is to disqualify, then a written explanation
of the reasons for disqualification must be included. The Commission

Commission, as provided in § 16-21, or if the conditional appointee is
determined to be unqualified in accordance with the procedures set
forth in § 16-39, the Commission shall strike the name of the person
from the eligibility list and certify the next highest name for each name
stricken from the eligibility list. As each subsequent vacancy occurs in
the same or another position, precisely the same procedure shall be
followed.
C. For promotional positions, fulfilling the performance requirement set

provisions of this article. No examination, other than a physical examination
as directed by the Civil Service Commission, shall be required in any case
of reappointment or reinstatement.
§ 16-38. Appointment of Chief of Police.
In the case of a vacancy in the office of Chief of Police, the appointive power
may nominate a person to the Commission. It shall then become the duty of
the Commission to subject the person to a noncompetitive examination, and
if the person shall be certified by the Commission as qualified, he may then
be appointed to the position, and shall be subject to all the provisions of this
chapter.
§ 16-39. Physical and psychological medical examination.
A. An applicant selected from the eligibility list shall receive a conditional
offer of employment. The offer of employment shall be conditioned upon

medical examination and a determination that the conditional
appointee is capable of performing all the essential functions of the
position. Physical medical examinations shall be under the direction of
a physician or other qualified medical professional. Psychological
medical examinations shall be under the direction of a psychiatrist or
psychologist.

a physical or mental condition which calls into question the person's
ability to perform all of the essential functions of the position for which
the person was conditionally appointed.
C. If the opinion rendered by the physician, other qualified medical
professional, psychiatrist or psychologist calls into question the
conditional appointee's ability to perform all essential functions of a
position, a person designated by the Borough Council shall meet with
the conditional appointee for the purpose of having one or more
interactive discussions on whether the conditional appointee can, with
or without reasonable accommodation, perform all the essential
functions of the position.
D. If, at the conclusion of the interactive discussion under Subsection C,
the Borough Council determines that the conditional appointee is not
qualified, the Borough Council shall give written notice to the
conditional appointee and the Commission.

an appointee may be dismissed only for a cause specified in § 16-21 or
because of incapacity for duty due to the use of alcohol or drugs. If at the
close of a probationary period the conduct or fitness of the probationer
has not been satisfactory to the Borough Council, the probationer shall
be notified in writing that the probationer will not receive a permanent
appointment, and the appointment shall cease. If the probationer is not
notified or dismissed in accordance with this section, the probationer's
retention shall be equivalent to a permanent appointment. The decision of
a borough to suspend or discharge a probationer shall be final and shall not
be subject to the hearing provisions of § 16-44.

A. Promotions shall be based on merit to be ascertained by examinations
to be prescribed by the Commission. All questions relative to
promotions shall be practical in character and will fairly test the merit

notify the Commission of a vacancy in the police force which is to be
filled by promotion and shall request the certification of an eligibility
list. The Commission shall certify for each vacancy the names of three
persons on the eligibility list who have received the highest average in

fitness of the candidate, unless the Borough Council makes objections
to the Commission regarding one or more of the persons so certified for
any reason provided under § 16-21.

necessary by any borough to reduce the number of paid employees of
the police force, then the borough shall furlough the person or persons,
including probationers, last appointed to the respective force. Such
removal shall be accomplished by furloughing in numerical order,
commencing with the person last appointed until such reduction shall

§ 16-43 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 16-44
1:37
A. The person suspended, removed or reduced in rank may make written
answers to any charges filed against the person not later than the day
fixed for hearing. The Commission shall grant the person a hearing,
which shall be held within a period of 10 days from the filing of charges
in writing, unless continued by the Commission for cause at the request
of the Borough Council or the accused. Notwithstanding this provision,
the failure of the Commission to hold a hearing within 10 days from the
filing of the charges in writing shall not result in the dismissal of the
charges filed.
B. At any hearing, the person against whom the charges are made may be
present in person and by counsel. The Borough Council may suspend
the person, without pay, pending the determination of the charges
against the person, but in the event the Commission fails to uphold the
charges, then the person sought to be suspended, removed or reduced
in rank shall be reinstated with full pay for the period during which the
person was suspended, removed or reduced in rank, and no charges
shall be officially recorded against the person's record. A stenographic
record of all testimony taken at the hearings shall be filed with, and

of Common Pleas of the county, and the case shall there be determined
as the court deems proper. No order of suspension made by the
Commission shall be for a longer period than one year. The appeal shall
be taken within 30 days from the date of entry by the Commission of its
final order and shall be by petition. Upon the appeal being taken and
docketed, the Court of Common Pleas shall fix a day for a hearing and
shall proceed to hear the appeal on the original record and additional
proof or testimony as the parties concerned may desire to offer in
evidence. The decision of the court affirming or revising the decision of
the Commission shall be final, and the employee shall be suspended,
discharged, reduced in rank or reinstated in accordance with the order
of court.
D. The Borough Council and the person sought to be suspended, removed
or reduced in rank shall at all times have the right to employ counsel
before the Commission and upon appeal to the Court of Common Pleas.
Unless the Borough Council or the person sought to be suspended,
removed or reduced in rank requests that the proceedings before the
Commission be open to the public, the proceedings before the
Commission pursuant to this section shall be held in the nature of a
closed executive session that shall not be open to the public. Any such
request shall be presented to the Commission before the civil service
hearing commences. The deliberations of the Commission, including

§ 31-1. Title.
This article shall be known as the "Danville Borough Joint Emergency
Operations Plan Ordinance."
§ 31-2. Parties.
The Borough of Danville hereby resolves to enter into an Intergovernmental
Cooperation Agreement with certain other townships and boroughs of

municipalities as would desire to enter into an intergovernmental
agreement in the future, whereby a Montour County Joint Emergency

§ 31-4. Conditions and agreement.
The conditions of the intergovernmental cooperation agreement to be
entered into between the participating municipalities and the county are
generally as follows:
A. The municipalities agree that they shall take steps to assure the
formulation of the County Emergency Operations Plan, and they shall
adopt and declare the County Emergency Operations Plan to be the
emergency operations plan of each of their municipalities for the
purpose of fulfilling the requirement in Subsection 7503(1) of the
Emergency Management Services Code13 to prepare, maintain, and
keep current a disaster emergency management plan for each of their
municipalities.
B. Each municipality agrees and shall provide necessary information to
the County Emergency Management Agency on a periodic basis, as
determined by the Coordinator of the Montour Emergency
Management Agency (hereafter referred to as the "Coordinator"), in
order to prepare and maintain a joint Emergency Operations Plan that
can and will be implemented for response to emergencies affecting the

Uniform Construction Code Board of Appeals
[Adopted 12-13-2005 by Ord. No. 468]
§ 31-6. Establishment of Appeals Board.
§ 31-7. Purpose.
The Appeals Board is established to provide a process for the resolution of
code grievances derived from the decision of the code official in order to
insure the health, safety, and general welfare for the citizens of the Montour
County Council of Governments Region.
§ 31-8. Organization.
A. The municipalities of the Montour County Council of Governments,
which participate in the UCC program, do hereby create and establish
the Montour County Board of Appeals, hereinafter referred to as the
"Appeals Board."
B. The participating municipalities shall designate by ordinance the
Appeals Board as the body to hear appeals brought under:
(1) The codes and standards promulgated in the most current version
of the Uniform Construction Code (Act 45 of 1999) of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as amended by the participating
municipalities, and as subsequently adopted in Title 34 Pa. Code
Chapters 401, 403 and 405.
(2) The Rules and Regulations contained in Title 34 Code Chapters 401
to 405, adopted by the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and
Industry.
(3) The International Code Council Property Maintenance Code as
amended by the participating municipalities that have adopted this

(4) The International Code Council Fire Code as amended by the
participating municipalities that have adopted that code.
A. Any resident of the Montour COG Region having the qualifications
according to Subsection E or F shall be eligible for appointment to the
Appeals Board regardless of whether the resident's home municipality
participates in the code administration program. The intent of the
regional appeals board is to provide uniform interpretation of the codes
and to recruit persons who are well qualified professionally, regardless
of residence. Therefore, it is not expected that representation will
necessarily reflect any sort of balance among the municipalities. A non-
Montour County COG Region resident may fill a position on the Appeals
Board when the Montour County COG cannot find a person within the
§ 31-6 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 31-8

A. General rule. Unless otherwise provided by the Act, a public record of
the Borough of Danville shall be accessible for inspection and
duplication by a requester in accordance with this chapter. A public
record shall be provided to a requester in the medium requested if the
public record exists in that medium; otherwise, it shall be provided in

access during the regular business hours of the Borough. There shall be
no access to a record which is not a public record.

However, in the event that the requester wishes to pursue the relief and
remedies provided for in the Act, the requester must initiate such relief
with a written request on the form provided by the Borough. A standard
request form is attached to this Policy.
C. Written requests. A written request for access to records may be
received in person, by mail, by facsimile or by electronic means. A
written request shall be addressed to the Secretary of the Borough of
Danville, 239 Mill Street, Danville, Pennsylvania, 17821. Written
requests should identify or describe the records sought with sufficient
specificity to enable the Borough to ascertain which records are being
requested and shall include the name and address to which the
§ 60-1 DANVILLE CODE § 60-2
1:74
§ 60-3. Access to public records.
Borough should address its response. A written request need not
include any explanation of the requester's reason for requesting or
intended use of the records.

the Borough shall not be required to create a public record which does
not currently exist or to compile, maintain, format or organize a public
record in a manner in which it does not currently compile, maintain,
format or organize the public record.
E. Conversion of an electronic record to paper. If a public record is only
maintained electronically or in other non-paper media, the Borough
shall, upon request, duplicate the public record on paper when
responding to a request for access in accordance with this chapter.
A. Use. The Borough shall not deny a requester access to a public record
due to the intended use of the public record by the requester.
B. Redaction. If the Borough determines that a public record contains
information which is subject to access as well as information which is
not subject to access, the Borough's response shall grant access to the
information which is subject to access, and deny access to the
information which is not subject to access. If the information which is
not subject to access is an integral part of the public record and cannot
be separated, the Borough shall redact from the public record the
information which is not subject to access and the response shall grant
access to the information which is subject to access. The Borough may
not deny access to the public record if the information which is not
subject to access is able to be redacted. Information which the Borough
redacts in accordance with this subsection shall be deemed a denial.

request, but shall not exceed five business days from the date the
written request is received by the Borough. If the Borough fails to
send the response within five business days of receipt of the written
request for access, the written request for access shall be deemed
denied.
(2) Exception:

1:75
[2] The request for access requires the retrieval of a record
stored in a remote location.

record is a public record subject to access under the Act.

policies regarding access to public records.
[6] The requester refuses to pay applicable fees.
[7] The extent or nature of the request precludes a response
within the required time period.
(b) Upon a determination that one of the factors listed in
Subsection A applies, then the Borough shall send written
notice to the requester within five business days of its receipt
of the request notifying the requester that the request for
access is being reviewed, the reason for the review and a
reasonable date that the response is expected to be provided.
If the date that a response is expected to be provided is in
excess of 30 days following the five business days allowed in
Section 901 of the Act, the request for access shall be deemed
denied.

telephone number and signature of the public official or public

address any grounds stated by the Borough for delaying or denying
the request. All appeals dealing with law enforcement records shall
be handled pursuant to Section 503(d) of the Act.

certification of copies if the certification is at the behest of the
requester and for the purpose of legally verifying the public record.
D. Waiver of fees. The Borough may waive the fees for duplication of a
public record, including, but not limited to, when:
(1) The requester duplicates the public record; or
(2) It deems it is in the public interest to do so.
E. Other fees/limitations. Except as otherwise provided by the Act, no
other fees shall be imposed. A reasonable fee equal to the actual cost

danger to persons or property. This term shall not include devices which are

danger, but not to summon the Fire Department or other agency (for
example, residential smoke detectors which are not designed to summon
the Fire Department).

response by personnel and/or equipment from the Fire Department or other

sewage, water or cable utilities upon any municipality-owned bridge within
the present limits of the Borough of Danville unless such company, firm,
corporation, authority, municipality, person or persons seeking to attach
such utilities shall first make application to the Borough for permission to
attach the same through a permit issued by the Borough Council.
§ 90-2. Application for permit; compliance with conditions.
It shall be the duty of said company, firm, corporation, authority,
municipality, person or persons to submit to the Borough a written
statement specifying the type of utilities, location of the utilities, a shop

for similar service in the community. Upon completion of the permitting
process and the installation of said utility and attachment, an itemized bill
will be submitted to the applicant, and any deposit not accounted for shall

corporation, authority, municipality, person or persons permitted to attach

governing laws. Utility attachments must not impede the flow of water
through a structure or the movement of traffic, either pedestrian or
vehicular, and must be located so as not to interfere with routine
maintenance operations.

and mark such utilities within 30 days after notice to do so, it shall be lawful
for the Borough to order the work to be done, and the cost thereof shall be
collected from the owner or owners of such utilities.

Municipalities are free to establish freeboard requirements based on
existing conditions, historical data, etc.]
SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA)  An area in the floodplain

it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include
excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection
of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property
of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling
units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the

structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged
condition would equal or exceed 50% or more of the market value of the
structure before the damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT  Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals
or exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure before the start
of construction of the improvement. This term includes structures which
have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work
performed. The term does not, however, include any project for
improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local
health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary
to assure safe living conditions.

otherwise adversely impacted by hazardous substances and that
identified public health, safety, and welfare risks may affect water
drawn from or around certain areas of such impacted groundwater. The
Borough Council has determined that it is necessary and appropriate to
prohibit the use of wells to supply water for domestic use or
agricultural use in order to protect Borough residents by minimizing
the health, safety and welfare risks. The purpose hereof is to protect the
public health, safety and welfare by imposing the restrictions and
requirements set forth herein.
B. The Borough Council further finds that the Borough is serviced by a
public water system that is available to residents of the Borough and
that providing public water is in the best interests of the health, safety,
and welfare of the residents of the Borough.
§ 120-22 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 123-2
1:131
PERSON  An individual, firm, corporation, association, partnership,

corporation or other legal entity which is recognized by law as the subject
of rights and duties. The term includes the federal government, state
government, political subdivisions and commonwealth instrumentalities.
PUBLIC WATER SYSTEM  A system for the provision to the public of water
for human consumption and/or domestic use and/or agricultural use.
WELL  An opening in the surface of the earth for the purpose of removing
water through nonmechanical or mechanical means for any purpose other
than a public emergency.
§ 123-3. Use restrictions.
Except as provided in § 123-7 hereof, no person shall install, construct,
develop, expand, modify or use a well within the Borough for the purpose
of removing water in any quantity through mechanical or nonmechanical
means for domestic use or agricultural use.
§ 123-4. Wells for purposes other than domestic or agricultural use.
A person shall be permitted to install, construct, develop, expand, modify
or use a well within the Borough for any reason other than domestic
use or agricultural use, such as groundwater monitoring and construction
dewatering. Under no circumstances, however, may a well installed for such
purposes be used for either domestic use or agricultural use.
§ 123-5. Connection to public system required.
Except as provided in § 123-7 hereof, in the event that any parcel is being
serviced by a well for domestic use and/or an agricultural use as of the
date of the enactment of this chapter, within 30 days after the effective date
of this chapter, the owner of said parcel shall be required to take those
steps necessary to connect to a public water system to obtain water for
domestic use and/or agricultural use. The cost of constructing a main from
the structure to be serviced to the boundary of the parcel and connecting to
a public water system shall be borne by the owner. The use of any existing
well for domestic use and agricultural use is expressly prohibited.
§ 123-6. Enforcement official; notification of violations.
The Borough Secretary, or his/her designee, shall be the official having the
authority to enforce this chapter. After the effective date of this chapter,
the enforcement official shall contact all owners of parcels which, from
the information available to the Borough, appear to have wells prohibited
under this chapter and give written notice of the need to cease using such
wells for domestic use and/or agricultural use and the need to connect to
a public water system, as required under § 123-5 hereof. The owner shall
take steps to comply with the provisions of this chapter within 30 days
from the date of such notice. Where, upon information available to the
§ 123-2 DANVILLE CODE § 123-6
1:132
enforcement official, it is suspected that a well is being used on a parcel in
violation of this chapter, the enforcement official may inspect such parcel
and serve an appropriate notice and order of such violation, requiring that
action be taken promptly by the owner to bring the parcel into compliance
with this chapter. If the owner fails to act in accordance with such order,
the enforcement official may seek remedies and penalties as provided in
§ 123-8.
§ 123-7. Grandfathered parcels.
As of the date of enactment of this chapter, the parcels situate at 101 Alton
Street, 237 Rooney Avenue, and 320 Church Street (the "grandfathered
parcels") currently have a well which is supplying or could supply water
for agricultural use or domestic use. The Borough Council finds that the
grandfathered parcels are outside the area where groundwater has been
impacted by hazardous substances which were the impetus for this chapter.
As a result, the grandfathered parcels are exempt from the requirements
of §§ 123-3 through 123-5 hereof; provided, however, that if the owner of
a grandfathered parcel, who owns the grandfathered parcel on the date
of enactment of this chapter, subsequently sells, transfers or otherwise
conveys ownership of the grandfathered parcel, through whatever means,
to another individual or entity, the grandfathered parcel shall forfeit its
exempt status, and the new owner shall be required to comply with all
provisions of this chapter, including §§ 123-3 through 123-5 above.
§ 123-8. Violations and penalties.
Any person who violates the provisions of this chapter shall be subject to all
rights and remedies available to the Borough as provided by law, including
the right of the Borough to seek an order from a court of appropriate
jurisdiction requiring compliance with this chapter. The Borough may also
seek collection of costs and attorneys' fees associated with such
enforcement action. Any violation of this chapter is a public nuisance,
subject to abatement, and any well in violation of this chapter shall be
immediately taken out of service and lawfully abandoned in compliance with
applicable legal requirements. A court of competent jurisdiction may order
any person violating any provision of this chapter to properly and lawfully
remove or abandon a well.
§ 123-9. Building and zoning permits.
No permit for the construction or alteration of a building or structure, nor
any permit for any zoning approval, shall be issued for any improvement
on a parcel which has, or proposes, a water supply for domestic use and/or
agricultural use from a well in violation of this chapter.
§ 123-10. Notification to water suppliers.
The Borough Secretary, or his/her designee, shall provide a copy of this
chapter to all water suppliers that operate a public water system in any
§ 123-6 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 123-10
1:133
portion of the Borough, whether the public water system services a
development or services Borough residents, generally.
§ 123-11. Notification to DEP.
Prior to the enactment of any modification, amendment or repeal of this
chapter, the Borough shall give to DEP notice of its intent to modify, amend
or repeal this chapter. Such notice shall be provided at least 30 days prior
to the date of the meeting at which the modification, amendment or repeal
of this chapter will be presented to the Borough for consideration and vote.
§ 123-12. Repealer.
Any portion of the Code of the Borough of Danville that is in conflict with
any provision of this chapter is hereby repealed solely to the extent of such
conflict.
§ 123-13. Severability.
Should any sentence, paragraph, subdivision, clause, phrase or section of
this chapter be adjudged or held to be unconstitutional, illegal or invalid,
the same shall not effect the validity of this chapter as a whole, or any part
or provision thereof, other than the part decided to be unconstitutional,
illegal or invalid, and such shall not effect the validity of the Code of the
Borough of Danville.
§ 123-14. Legislative authority.
This chapter is enacted pursuant to, inter alia, the Uniform Environmental
Covenants Act, Act No. 68 of December 18, 2007, P.L. 450, 27 Pa.C.S.A.
§ 6501 et seq., and applicable regulations, and the Land Recycling and

QUALITY OF LIFE TICKETING
§ 183-1. Title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Quality of Life
Ticketing Ordinance of the Borough of Danville."
§ 183-2. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to provide for a mechanism by means of
issuance of tickets rather than citation to permit a citizen who believes he
may have been in violation to pay the ticket rather than cause the issuance
of a citation and a costly and protracted legal hearing before a judge and
unnecessary appeals. The resolution in this manner is beneficial from a
twofold perspective in that it permits the Borough to maintain and enforce
its laws and permits a citizen so accused to resolve the dispute in a manner
that does not unduly burden the resident by requiring the issuance of a
citation and a court hearing. It also does not deprive the citizen the right to
property and after service of a notice of violation(s), they shall be
subject to prosecution in accordance with Section 106.3 and as
prescribed by the authority having jurisdiction."
L. Section 308.2. Delete "occupant" and replace with "owner."
M. Section 308.3. Delete entire section and replace with the following: "All
owner(s) of all properties in Danville Borough shall dispose of garbage

garbage disposal facility or approved garbage containers."

sewer connection, multiple charges shall be computed as if each had
separate connections and facilities.
E. Where more than one dwelling unit and/or nonresidential establishment
is served water from a common meter, the sewer rental or charge shall
be determined by dividing the total quarterly water consumption by the
number of dwelling units and/or nonresidential establishments being
served from the common water meter and by computing separate
billings by applying the rates set forth in Subsection B to the resulting
water consumption quotient, subject to the minimum of $45 per quarter
annum for each such dwelling and/or nonresidential establishment.

K. If the owner of any nonresidential improved property, including any
school, shall fail to provide this Borough with complete information
required to compute the sewer rental or charge to such nonresidential
improved property, this Borough may estimate a reasonable applicable
sewer rental or charge for such nonresidential improved property, and
such estimated sewer rental or charge shall be the actual sewer rental
or charge payable until the required information is filed; provided,
however, that no rebates will be paid by this Borough if the information
filed reveals a lower indicated sewer rental or charge than that
estimated by this Borough.
L. Additional classifications and sewer rentals or charges or modifications
of the preceding schedule of sewer rentals or charges may be
established by this Borough from time to time as deemed necessary.
M. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to prohibit this Borough
from entering into separate agreements with owners with respect to
sewer rentals or charges to be imposed in those cases where, due to
seasonal fluctuations, contributions toward construction by owners or
other unusual circumstances, the sewer rentals or charges set forth
herein shall be deemed by this Borough to be unfair or inequitable.
A. In the case of an owner of improved property whose bill for sewer
rentals or charges shall be computed, in whole or in part, upon the basis
of water volume usage metered by this Borough, the billing shall be
based upon the water consumption for the immediately preceding
quarter annum. In the case of an owner of improved property whose
quarterly bill for sewer rentals or charges shall be computed on any
basis completely independent of water volume usage metered by this
Borough, the quarterly billing dates shall be the first days of January,
April, July and October, respectively, in each year, or on such other
dates as this Borough by resolution or ordinance shall specify, and shall
cover a quarterly billing period consisting of the immediately
succeeding three complete calendar months.
B. Sewer rentals or charges shall be due and payable upon the applicable
billing date set forth on the bill, and the appropriate amount computed
in accordance with this article shall constitute the net bill. If sewer
rentals and charges are not paid within 30 calendar days after each
billing date, an additional sum of 5% shall be added to such net bill,
which net bill, plus such additional sum, shall constitute the gross bill.
Payment made or mailed and postmarked on or before the last day of
such thirty-calendar-day period shall constitute payment within such
period. If the end of such thirty-calendar-day period shall fall on a legal
holiday or on a Sunday, payment made on or mailed and postmarked on

§ 194-10. Filing and collection of liens.
Sewer rentals or charges imposed by this article shall be a lien on the
improved property connected to and served by the sewer system and any
such sewer rentals or charges which are delinquent shall be filed as a lien
against the improved property so connected to and served by the sewer
system, which lien shall be filed in the office of the Prothonotary of Montour
County, Pennsylvania, and shall be collected in the manner provided by law
for the filing and collecting of municipal claims.
§ 194-11. Measuring volume for computation of sewer rentals or
charges.
the next succeeding weekday which is not a legal holiday shall
constitute payment within such period.
C. Every owner of improved property which is connected to the sewer
system initially shall provide this Borough with and thereafter shall
keep this Borough advised of his correct address. Failure of any person
to receive bills for sewer rentals or charges shall not be considered an
excuse for nonpayment nor shall such failure result in an extension of
the period of time during which the net bill shall be payable.
A. Methods of measuring volume.
(1) Whenever the entire water supply of an improved property
discharging sewage and/or industrial wastes into the sewer system
is supplied by this Borough, the volume of water furnished, as
determined from meter readings of this Borough, shall be used as
the volume of water consumed in computing sewer rentals or
charges, subject to adjustment, if appropriate, as provided in this
article.
(2) Whenever an improved property discharging sewage and/or
industrial wastes into the sewer system shall have a source or
sources of water supply in addition to or other than this Borough,
the owner of such improved property shall provide a meter on such
additional or other source or sources of water supply. The total
volume of water consumed, as determined from the meter readings
of this Borough and the meter readings of the meter or meters on
such additional source or sources of water supply, or the meter
readings of the meter or meters on such other source or sources of
water supply, as appropriate, shall be used as the volume of water
consumed in computing the sewer rentals or charges, subject to
adjustment, if appropriate, as provided in this article.
(3) The volume of water consumed to be used for computation of sewer
rentals or charges, as provided in this article, may be established
by estimates or other methods of measurement approved by this
Borough, where this Borough considers metering to be impractical.
§ 194-9 DANVILLE CODE § 194-11
1:202
(4) This Borough may require an industrial establishment, or the
industrial establishment may elect, to install, pay for and maintain
a meter approved by this Borough for measuring wastes
discharged to the sewer system, in which case sewer rentals or
charges shall be based upon the actual volume of wastes so
metered as being discharged to the sewer system. The sewer
rentals shall be computed at the rates set forth under § 194-8B.
(5) Exclusion from the sewer system of noncontaminated wastewaters
and waters used for cooling purposes may be required by this
Borough, or such exclusion may be optional with the owner of an
industrial establishment, if not required by this Borough. When
such waters are excluded, the volume of water or other measure to
be used for computation of sewer rentals or charges shall be
computed in one of the following methods:
(a) By installing a meter or other measuring device on the
connection to the sewer system. The readings from such meter
or measuring device shall be used as the measure of discharge
of sewage and/or industrial wastes in computing sewer rentals
or charges in accordance with the volume rate schedule set
forth in § 194-8B.
(b) By installing a meter or other measuring device to measure the
volume of water not being discharged into the sewer system.
The readings from such meter or measuring device shall be
deducted from the total water meter readings and the
remainder shall be the volume of water to be used in
computing sewer rentals and charges in accordance with the
volume rate schedule set forth in § 194-8B.
(c) If it is not practical, in the opinion of this Borough, to install a
meter or other measuring device to determine continuously the
volume of water not discharged into the sewer system, this
Borough shall determine, in such manner and by such method
as it may prescribe, the percentage of metered water which is
being discharged into the sewer system. The volume of water
to be used in computing sewer rentals or charges in
accordance with the volume rate schedule set forth in § 194-8B
shall be the percentage so determined of the volume of water
measured by the water meter or meters. Any dispute as to such
estimated percentage shall be submitted to this Borough after
notice of such estimate. The decision of this Borough with
respect to the matter shall be final for the then-current
calendar year.
B. Measuring devices. The furnishing and installation of meters or other
measuring devices which shall not be owned by the Authority or this
Borough, but which shall be required or permitted under provisions of
this article, shall be the sole responsibility of the owner. The installation
or use of such meters or other measuring devices at all times shall be

§ 194-12. Fees. [Added 6-13-1984 by Ord. No. 301]
subject to the approval of this Borough and may be tested and inspected
by this Borough whenever necessary. The owner shall be responsible
for the maintenance, safekeeping and repair of any such meter, whether
such repairs shall be made necessary by ordinary wear and tear or
other causes.
C. Meter readings. This Borough shall be responsible for the reading of all
meters or other measuring devices, and the same shall be available to
employees and agents of this Borough at all reasonable times.87
A. It is the purpose of this section to provide for the recovery of costs from
users of the Borough sewer system for the implementation of the
program established herein. The applicable charges or fees shall be set
forth in the Borough's Schedule of Charges and Fees.88
B. Enumeration of charges.
(1) The Borough may adopt charges and fees which may include:
(a) Fees for reimbursement of costs of setting up and operating
the Borough's pretreatment program.
(b) Fees for monitoring, inspections and surveillance procedures.
(c) Fees for reviewing accidental discharge procedures and
construction.
(d) Fees for permit applications.
(e) Fees for filing appeals.
(f) Fees for consistent removal by the Borough of pollutants
otherwise subject to federal pretreatment standards.
(g) Other fees as the Borough may deem necessary to carry out
the requirements contained herein.
(2) These fees relate solely to the matters covered by this article and
are separate from all other fees chargeable by the Borough.

to worker health and safety; and physical, chemical or biological
damage to the sewer system.
(5) Local limits shall be applied to all significant industrial users and
shall be included in all wastewater discharge permits. Local limits
may be applied to other industrial users if deemed appropriate by
the Borough.
(6) Discharging any pollutant in excess of a local limit established for
that pollutant shall constitute an unauthorized discharge. Such a
discharge is subject to the actions and penalties set forth herein.
§ 194-24 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 194-24
1:221
H. Prohibition on dilution. No industrial user shall, in any way, attempt to
dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate
pretreatment to achieve compliance with the limitations contained in
applicable categorical standards or in any other pollutant-specific
limitation, including local limits, developed by the Borough or state.
I. Slug loads and spills. Each industrial user shall provide protection from
spills resulting from prohibited discharges and slug load discharges.
Facilities to prevent spills and slug loads shall be provided and
maintained at the owner or industrial user's own cost and expense.

procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the
Borough for review and shall be approved by the Borough before
construction of the facility. All existing industrial users shall
complete a spill prevention control and countermeasure (SPCC)
plan or provide evidence that such a plan is not necessary for their
facility. No industrial user who commences discharge to the sewer
system after the effective date of this article shall be permitted to
introduce pollutants into the sewer system until this requirement
has been fulfilled. Review and approval of such plans and operating
procedures shall not relieve the industrial user from the
responsibility to modify its facility as necessary to meet the
requirements of the industrial pretreatment program. In the case of
a spill, it is the responsibility of the industrial user to immediately
telephone and notify the Borough of the incident. The notification
shall include location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration
and volume, corrective actions being taken or planned and
expected duration.
(2) Written notice. Within five days following a spill, slug load or other
accidental discharge, the industrial user shall submit to the
Borough a detailed written report describing the cause of the
discharge and the measures to be taken by the industrial user to
prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not
relieve the industrial user of any expense, loss, damage or other
liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the sewer
system, fish kills or any other damage to person or property; nor
shall such notification relieve the industrial user of any fines, civil
penalties or other liability which may be imposed by this article or
applicable law.
(3) Notice to employees. A notice shall be permanently posted on the
industrial user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising
employees whom to call in the event of a spill or other accidental
discharge. Employers shall ensure that all employees who may
cause or suffer such a discharge to occur are advised of the
emergency notification procedure.

of this article shall submit the report within 180 days of first
discharge of the hazardous waste, except as provided in Subsection
N(4) of this section.
(3) The required report need be submitted only once for each
hazardous waste discharged. Industrial users regulated under
categorical standards which have already submitted such
information in baseline monitoring reports or periodic compliance
reports do not have to report this information again.
(4) Industrial users that discharge less than 15 kilograms of hazardous
wastes in a calendar month do not have to comply with these
reporting requirements. This exemption does not apply to acute
hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e).
(5) An industrial user shall notify the Borough within five days of

G. Transferability of permits. Wastewater discharge permits are issued to
a specific industrial user for a specific operation. A wastewater
discharge permit shall not be reassigned or transferred or sold to a new
person, new industrial user, different premises or a new or changed
operation without the approval of the Borough. Any succeeding
industrial user shall also comply with the terms and conditions of the
existing wastewater discharge permit. The Borough may, at its
discretion, deny the transfer of a wastewater discharge permit and
require application for a new wastewater discharge permit under the
provisions of this section.
H. Duration of wastewater discharge permits. Wastewater discharge
permits shall be issued for a specified time period, not to exceed five
§ 194-26 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 194-26
1:229
years. A wastewater discharge permit may be issued for a period of
less than a year or may be dated to expire on a specific date. The
industrial user shall apply for reissuance of the wastewater discharge
permit a minimum of 180 days prior to the expiration of the industrial
user's existing wastewater discharge permit. The terms and conditions
of the wastewater discharge permit may be subject to modification by
the Borough during the term of the wastewater discharge permit as
limitations or requirements as identified in § 194-24 are modified or
other just cause exists. The industrial user shall be informed of any
proposed changes in its wastewater discharge permit at least 30 days
prior to the effective date of the change. Any changes or new conditions
in the wastewater discharge permit shall include a reasonable time
schedule for compliance.
I. Delayed permit renewal.
(1) If the industrial user has complied with the terms of the wastewater
discharge permit and the industrial pretreatment program and has
applied for renewal as provided for in Subsection H of this section
and the wastewater discharge permit is not renewed on or before
the expiration date through no fault of the industrial user, then the
existing wastewater discharge permit shall remain in effect until it
is reissued or rescinded by the Borough.
(2) If the wastewater discharge permit is not renewed because of a
failure of the industrial user to apply for renewal in a timely fashion
or through an act or omission of the industrial user, then discharge
of industrial waste by the industrial user without a wastewater
discharge permit is an unauthorized discharge and is subject to the
enforcement provisions of this article.
J. Appeal of wastewater discharge permits.
(1) Any industrial user that is issued a wastewater discharge permit
may appeal the permit conditions, in whole or in part. Appeal
procedures shall be as set forth in § 194-27G of the Borough Code.
(2) During the process of appeal, the wastewater discharge permit
shall remain in effect and shall be enforced with the exception of
those conditions specified in writing in the appeal. Conditions
imposed by federal or state regulations (e.g., categorical
standards) shall not be waived. Conditions which, in the opinion of
the Borough, would constitute a hazard or pose a potential threat of
pollution if waived shall not be waived during an appeal.
K. Baseline monitoring reports.
(1) As soon as possible following the promulgation of a categorical
standard, the wastewater discharge permit of industrial users
subject to such standards shall be revised, if necessary, to require
compliance with such categorical standard within the time frame
prescribed by the categorical standard.
§ 194-26 DANVILLE CODE § 194-26
1:230
(2) Where an industrial user, subject to a newly promulgated
categorical standard, has not previously submitted an application
for a wastewater discharge permit as required by Subsection D of
this section, the industrial user shall, within 180 days after the
promulgation of the applicable categorical standard:
(a) Apply for a wastewater discharge permit; and
(b) Provide the baseline monitoring information required by 40
CFR 403.12(b). This information may be incorporated into the
application for a wastewater discharge permit.
(3) An industrial user with an existing wastewater discharge permit
shall submit to the Borough within 180 days after the promulgation
of an applicable categorical standard the information required by
40 CFR 403.12(b).
(4) A new source or an industrial user that becomes a categorical
industrial user through a change in facilities or processes shall
submit a report containing the information required by 40 CFR
403.12(b) at least 90 days prior to commencement of discharge
from the regulated process or facility.
L. Categorical compliance report. Within 90 days following the date for
final compliance with applicable categorical standards or, in the case of
a new source, following commencement of the discharge of industrial
waste from processes regulated by categorical standards into the sewer
system, any industrial user subject to categorical standards shall
submit to the Borough a report indicating the nature and concentration
of all pollutants in the discharge from the regulated process which are
limited by categorical standards and the average and maximum daily
flow for those process units in the industrial user's facility which are
limited by such categorical standards. The report shall certify that the
information contained therein concerning wastewater constituents and
flows is representative of discharges during normal work cycles. The
report shall also state whether the applicable categorical standards are
being met on a consistent basis and, if not, what additional operation
and management practices and/or pretreatment is necessary to bring
the industrial user into compliance with the applicable categorical
standards, and including a schedule for completion of the required
actions in the form described in Subsection D(1)(l) of this section. This
statement shall be signed by an authorized representative of the
industrial user and certified to by a certified professional.
M. Periodic compliance reports.
(1) All significant industrial users shall report to the Borough, at least
twice a year, the date of the report to be as determined by the
Borough and contained in the wastewater discharge permit.
Reports may be required more frequently, if deemed necessary by
the Borough.
§ 194-26 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 194-26
1:231
(2) The reports required under this section shall contain, at a
minimum, the measured concentrations of all pollutants regulated
by the wastewater discharge permit, a record of all measured daily
flows which exceeded the average daily flow value reported in
compliance with Subsection D(1)(h) of this section and a statement
of accuracy and completeness signed and certified by the
authorized representative of the significant industrial user.
(3) For significant industrial users subject to categorical standards, if
discharge limits are based on mass units per production unit, then
production information regarding the regulated processes during
the reporting period shall be included in the report, along with flow
and concentration values, so that a determination of compliance or
noncompliance with categorical standards can be made.
(4) For significant industrial users subject to categorical standards, the
report shall contain the certification of compliance with those
standards, signed by a certified professional.
N. Reporting and resulting of discharge limit violations.
(1) If, upon receipt of valid sampling and testing results, a significant
industrial user becomes aware that a violation of discharge limits
has occurred, the significant industrial user shall, within 24 hours
of becoming aware of the violation, notify the Borough of this fact.
Within 30 days of becoming aware of the violation, the significant
industrial user shall also sample and analyze its discharge(s) for
each parameter found to be in violation and report the results of
the resampling and analysis to the Borough.
(2) Each significant industrial user shall have a duty, on receipt of
validly obtained sampling and analysis results, of inspecting the
results and determining if any wastewater discharge permit
condition has been violated. Failure to examine and compare
testing results with wastewater discharge permit conditions shall
not be a valid defense for failure to comply with these reporting
conditions.
O. Sampling and analysis. All sampling and analysis performed in
compliance with wastewater discharge permit conditions or to prepare
the reports required in Subsections K, L, M and N of this section shall
be accomplished using techniques specified in 40 CFR Part 136, or
alternative procedures approved by the administrator or using
procedures described in standard methods if no EPA-approved
procedure exists.
P. Monitoring facilities.
(1) The Borough may require an industrial user to provide and operate,
at the industrial user's own expense, monitoring facilities to allow
inspection, sampling and flow measurement of the wastewater or
industrial waste discharge. The monitoring facility should normally
§ 194-26 DANVILLE CODE § 194-26
1:232
be situated on the industrial user's premises, but the Borough may,
when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship
on the industrial user, allow the facility to be constructed in the
public street or sidewalk area and located so that it will not be
obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles.
(2) There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or
facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for
analysis. The facility, sampling and measuring equipment shall be
maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at
the expense of the industrial user.
(3) Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling
and monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the
Borough's requirements and all applicable local construction
standards and specifications. Construction shall be completed
within 90 days following written notification by the Borough.
Q. Inspections. The Borough may inspect the facilities of any user to
ascertain whether the purposes of the industrial pretreatment program
are being met and all requirements are being complied with. Persons or
occupants of premises where wastewater is created or discharged shall
allow the Borough or its representative ready access at all reasonable
times to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection,
sampling, records examination and copying or in the performance of
any of their duties. The Borough, approval authority and EPA shall have
the right to set up on the user's property such devices as are necessary
to conduct sampling, inspection, compliance monitoring and/or
metering operations. Where a user has security measures in force
which would require proper identification and clearance before entry
onto their premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with
its security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification,
personnel from the Borough, approval authority and EPA will be
permitted to enter, without delay, for the purpose of performing their
specific responsibilities.
R. Pretreatment facilities. Industrial users shall provide necessary
wastewater pretreatment as required to comply with the industrial
pretreatment program and shall achieve compliance with all applicable
categorical standards within the time limitations as specified by the
applicable categorical standards. Any facilities required for
pretreatment shall be provided, operated and maintained at the
industrial user's expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment
facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the Borough
for review and shall be acceptable to the Borough before construction
of the facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures will in
no way relieve the industrial user from the responsibility of modifying
the facility as necessary to produce a discharge which complies with
the provisions of the industrial pretreatment program. Any subsequent
changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be
reported to and be acceptable to the Borough prior to the industrial
§ 194-26 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 194-26
1:233
user's initiation of the changes. The review and acceptance of plans
and procedures by the Borough shall not be considered as an approval
regarding their efficacy, safety or reliability; such considerations are
solely the responsibility of the industrial user.
S. Confidentiality.
(1) Information and data on an industrial user obtained from reports,
questionnaires, wastewater discharge permit applications and
monitoring programs and from inspections shall be available to the
public or any governmental agency without restriction unless the
industrial user specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to
the satisfaction of the Borough that the release of such information,
processes or methods of production are entitled to protection as
trade secrets of the industrial user.
(2) When requested by the person showing a report and supported by
evidence acceptable to the Borough as to need for protection as
confidential material, the portion of a report which might disclose
trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for
inspection by the public but shall be made available upon written
request to governmental agencies for uses related to the industrial
pretreatment program, the Borough's NPDES permit, any state
permit and/or the industrial pretreatment program; provided,
however, that such portions of a report shall be available for use by
the EPA, the state or any state agency in judicial review or
enforcement proceedings involving the person showing the report.
Wastewater constituents and characteristics will not be recognized
as confidential information.
(3) The Borough shall maintain a secure place to store records
containing confidential information and shall ensure that all
records marked as confidential are kept secure from casual or
public scrutiny.
(4) When information accepted by the Borough as confidential is
transmitted to any government agency, a notification to the
industrial user shall be provided listing the confidential information
transmitted and the governmental entity requesting it.
T. Change in operations.
(1) Any industrial user contemplating or planning a change in the
manufacturing process, raw materials, auxiliary processes,
pretreatment processes or other changes which may result in
changes to wastewater character, composition, volume or rate of
flow shall notify the Borough, in writing, at least 30 days prior to
making such a change, or, if the change is unplanned, immediately
upon making the change. The report shall include all information
necessary to determine the effect on the wastewater of the change.
(2) The Borough may, on receipt of such a report:
§ 194-26 DANVILLE CODE § 194-26
1:234
§ 194-27. Enforcement.
(a) Continue an existing wastewater discharge permit in effect;
(b) Require application for a new wastewater discharge permit;
(c) Modify an existing wastewater discharge permit to reflect the
changed nature of the waste;
(d) Rescind and reissue an existing wastewater discharge permit
in order to make substantial changes in wastewater discharge
permit conditions;
(e) Revoke an existing wastewater discharge permit or require the
industrial user to cease or prevent the discharge; or
(f) Take such other action as it deems appropriate.
U. Records.
(1) The Borough shall keep and maintain all records relating to the
administration and enforcement of the industrial pretreatment
program, including but not limited to wastewater discharge permit
applications, investigations and calculations, wastewater discharge
permits, inspection reports, industrial user reports, sampling
results and enforcement activities, for a minimum of three years. In
cases of ongoing litigation, records shall be maintained as long as
they may be required.
(2) All industrial users shall keep and maintain records of monitoring
activities and results, wastewater discharge permits and reports to
the Borough for a minimum of three years. In cases of ongoing
litigation, such records shall be maintained as long as they may be
required.
A. Right to refuse. The Borough reserves the right to refuse to accept
wastewater or combinations of wastewater which are discharged in
violation of the terms or conditions of the industrial pretreatment
program or any written directions issued by the Borough pursuant to
the conditions of the industrial pretreatment program. The Borough
may take such steps as it deems necessary, as outlined in this section, to
compel discontinuance of use of the sewer system or pretreatment of
industrial wastes in order to comply with the provisions of the industrial
pretreatment program.
B. Suspension of permit.
(1) The Borough may suspend the wastewater discharge permit when
such suspension is necessary, in the opinion of the Borough, in
order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or
may present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the
health or welfare of persons or to the environment, causes
interference or pass-through or causes the Borough to violate any

ARTICLE I
General Provisions
§ 212-1. Short title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Danville Borough
Stormwater Management Ordinance."
§ 212-2. Findings.
The governing body of Danville Borough finds that:
A. Inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting
from development throughout a watershed increases flood flows and
velocities, contributes to erosion and sedimentation, overtaxes the
carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers, greatly
increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater,
undermines floodplain management and flood-reduction efforts in
upstream and downstream communities, reduces groundwater
recharge, threatens public health and safety, and increases nonpoint
source pollution of water resources.
B. A comprehensive program of stormwater management, including
reasonable regulation of development and activities causing
accelerated runoff, is fundamental to the public health, safety, welfare,
and the protection of the people of the municipality and all the people of
the commonwealth, their resources, and the environment.
C. Inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting
from land development and redevelopment throughout a watershed can
also harm surface water resources by changing the natural hydrologic
patterns; accelerating stream flows (which increase scour and erosion
of streambeds and stream banks, thereby elevating sedimentation);
destroying aquatic habitat; and elevating aquatic pollutant
concentrations and loadings such as sediments, nutrients, heavy
metals, and pathogens. Groundwater resources are also impacted
through loss of recharge.
D. Stormwater is an important water resource that provides groundwater
recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams, which also
protects and maintains surface water quality.
E. Public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an
essential component in successfully addressing stormwater issues.
F. Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to
implement a program of stormwater controls. These municipalities are
required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their
separate storm sewer systems under the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES).

installed, implemented, operated, and maintained to meet the purposes
and requirements of this chapter and to meet all requirements under
Title 25 of the Pennsylvania Code and the Clean Streams Law, conform
to the state water quality requirements, meet all requirements under
the Stormwater Management Act, and any more stringent requirements
as determined by the municipality.
D. The municipality may, after consultation with PADEP, approve measures
for meeting the State Water Quality Requirements other than those in
this chapter, provided that they meet the minimum requirements of,
and do not conflict with state law, including, but not limited to, the
Clean Streams Law.
E. All regulated activities shall include, to the maximum extent
practicable, measures to:
(1) Protect health, safety, and property.
(2) Meet the water quality goals of this chapter by implementing
measures to:
§ 212-10 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 212-10
1:281
(a) Minimize disturbance to floodplains, wetlands, natural slopes,
existing native vegetation, and woodlands.
(b) Create, maintain, or extend riparian buffers and protect
existing forested buffers.
(c) Provide trees and woodlands adjacent to impervious areas
whenever feasible.
(d) Minimize the creation of impervious surfaces and the
degradation of waters of the commonwealth and promote
groundwater recharge.
(e) Protect natural systems and processes (drainageways,
vegetation, soils, and sensitive areas) and maintain, as much as
possible, the natural hydrologic regime.
(f) Incorporate natural site elements (wetlands, stream corridors,
mature forests) as design elements.
(g) Avoid erosive flow conditions in natural flow pathways.
(h) Minimize soil disturbance and soil compaction.
(i) Minimize thermal impacts to waters of the commonwealth.
(j) Disconnect impervious surfaces by directing runoff to pervious
areas wherever possible and decentralize and manage
stormwater at its source.
F. Impervious areas:
(1) The measurement of impervious areas shall include all of the
impervious areas in the total proposed development, even if
development is to take place in stages.
(2) For developments taking place in stages, the entire development
plan must be used in determining conformance with this chapter.
(3) For projects that add impervious area to a parcel, the total
impervious area on the parcel is subject to the requirements of this
chapter.
G. If diffused flow is proposed to be concentrated and discharged onto
adjacent property, the applicant must document that adequate
downstream conveyance facilities exist to safely transport the
concentrated discharge, or otherwise prove that no erosion,
sedimentation, flooding, or other harm will result from the
concentrated discharge.
(1) Applicant must provide an easement for proposed concentrated
flow across adjacent properties to a drainageway or public right-ofway.
§ 212-10 DANVILLE CODE § 212-10
1:282
(2) Such stormwater flows shall be subject to the requirements of this
chapter.
H. Stormwater drainage systems shall be provided in order to permit
unimpeded flow along natural watercourses, except as modified by
stormwater management facilities or open channels consistent with this
chapter.
I. Where watercourses traverse a development site, drainage easements
(to encompass the one-hundred-year flood elevation with a minimum
width of 20 feet) shall be provided conforming to the line of such
watercourses. The terms of the easement shall prohibit excavation, the
placing of fill or structures, and any alterations that may adversely
affect the flow of stormwater within any portion of the easement. Also,
maintenance, including mowing of vegetation within the easement, may
be required, except as approved by the appropriate governing
authority.
J. When it can be shown that, due to topographic conditions, natural
drainageways on the site cannot adequately provide for drainage, open
channels may be constructed conforming substantially to the line and
grade of such natural drainageways. Work within natural drainageways
shall be subject to approval by PADEP under regulations at 25 Pa Code
Chapter 105 through the joint permit application process, or, where
deemed appropriate by PADEP, through the general permit process.
K. Any stormwater management facilities or any facilities that constitute
water obstructions (e.g., culverts, bridges, outfalls, or stream
enclosures, etc.) that are regulated by this chapter, that will be located
in or adjacent to waters of the commonwealth (including wetlands),
shall be subject to approval by PADEP under regulations at 25 Pa. Code
Chapter 105 through the joint permit application process, or, where
deemed appropriate by PADEP, the general permit process. When there
is a question whether wetlands may be involved, it is the responsibility
of the applicant or his agent to show that the land in question cannot be
classified as wetlands; otherwise, approval to work in the area must be
obtained from PADEP.
L. Should any stormwater management facility require a dam safety
permit under PADEP Chapter 105, the facility shall be designed in
accordance with Chapter 105 and meet the regulations of Chapter 105
concerning dam safety.
M. Any stormwater management facilities regulated by this chapter that
will be located on, or discharged onto state highway rights-of-way shall
be subject to approval by the Pennsylvania Department of
Transportation (PENNDOT).
N. Minimization of impervious surfaces and infiltration of runoff through
seepage beds, infiltration trenches, etc., are encouraged, where soil
conditions and geology permit, to reduce the size or eliminate the need
for detention facilities.
§ 212-10 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 212-10
1:283
§ 212-11. Exemptions/modifications.
O. Infiltration BMPs should be dispersed throughout the site, made as
shallow as practicable, and located to maximize use of natural on-site
infiltration features while still meeting the other requirements of this
chapter.
P. Roof drains shall not be connected to streets, sanitary or storm sewers,
or roadside ditches in order to promote overland flow and infiltration/
percolation of stormwater where it is advantageous to do so. When it is
more advantageous to connect directly to streets or storm sewers, then
the municipality shall permit it on a case-by-case basis.
Q. Applicants are encouraged to use low-impact development (LID)
practices to comply with the requirements of this chapter and the state
water quality requirements.
R. When stormwater management facilities are proposed within 1,000 feet
of a downstream municipality, the SWM plan shall be submitted to the
downstream Municipal's Engineer for review and comment.

E. The municipality may deny or revoke any exemption pursuant to this
section at any time for any project that the municipality believes may
pose a threat to public health, safety, property or the environment.
F. An applicant proposing regulated activities, after demonstrating
compliance with Subsections A, B, and C, may be exempted from
various requirements of this chapter if documentation can be provided
that a downstream man-made water body (i.e., reservoir, lake, or manmade
wetlands) has been designed or modified to address the potential
stormwater flooding impacts of the proposed development.
G. The purpose this section is to ensure consistency of stormwater
management planning between local ordinances and NPDES permitting
(when required) and to ensure that the applicant has a single and clear
set of stormwater management standards to which the applicant is
subject. The municipality may accept alternative stormwater
management controls under this section, provided that:
(1) The alternative controls are documented to be acceptable to PADEP
(or delegated authority), for NPDES requirements pertaining to
postconstruction stormwater management requirements.
§ 212-11 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 212-11
1:285
§ 212-12. Waivers.
(2) The alternative controls are in compliance with all other sections of
this chapter, including, but not limited to, § 212-10D and
Subsections A through C of this section.
H. Agricultural activities are exempt from requirements of this chapter
provided the activities are performed according to the requirements of
25 Pa. Code Chapter 102.
I. Forest management and timber operations are exempt from the rate
and volume control requirement and SWM site plan preparation
requirement of this chapter provided the activities are performed

with § 212-10D, except waiver requests for § 212-19B and C, which
will be at the municipality's sole discretion.
C. If an applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the governing body of
the municipality that any mandatory provision of this chapter is
unreasonable or causes unique or undue unreasonableness or hardship
as it applies to the proposed project, or that an alternate design may
result in a superior result within the context of §§ 212-2 and 212-3 of
this chapter, the governing body of the municipality upon obtaining the
comments and recommendations of the Municipal Engineer and
Conservation District may grant a waiver or relief so that substantial
justice may be done and the public interest is secured; provided that
such waiver will not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose
of this chapter.
D. The applicant shall submit all requests for waivers in writing and shall
include such requests as a part of the plan review and approval process.
The applicant shall state in full the facts of unreasonableness or
hardship on which the request is based, the provision or provisions of
this chapter that are involved, and the minimum waiver or relief that is

1:286
the applicant's proposal shall result in an equal or better means of
complying with the intent or purpose and general principles of this
chapter.
E. The municipality shall keep a written record of all actions on waiver
requests.
F. The municipality may charge a fee for each waiver request, which shall
be used to offset the administrative costs of reviewing the waiver
request. The applicant shall also agree to reimburse the municipality
for reasonable and necessary fees that may be incurred by the
Municipal Engineer and/or Solicitor in any review of a waiver request.
G. In granting waivers, the municipality may impose reasonable conditions
at will, in its judgment, to substantially secure the objectives of the
standards or requirements that are to be modified.
H. The municipality may grant applications for waivers when the following
findings are made, as relevant:
(1) That the waiver shall result in an equal or better means of
complying with the intent of this chapter.
(2) That the waiver is the minimum necessary to provide relief.
(3) That the applicant is not requesting a waiver based on cost
considerations.

A. The low-impact development practices provided in the BMP Manual
and in Appendix B of this chapter shall be utilized for all regulated
activities to the maximum extent practicable.115
B. Stormwater runoff volume controls shall be implemented using the
Design Storm Method or the Simplified Method as defined below. For
regulated activity areas equal to or less than one acre that do not
require hydrologic routing to design the stormwater facilities, this
chapter establishes no preference for either method; therefore, the
applicant may select either method on the basis of economic
considerations, the intrinsic limitations on applicability of the analytical
procedures associated with each methodology, and other factors.
(1) The Design Storm Method (CG-1 in the BMP Manual) is applicable
to any sized regulated activity. This method requires detailed
modeling based on site conditions.
(a) Do not increase the postdevelopment total runoff volume when
compared to the predevelopment total runoff volume for the
two-year, twenty-four-hour storm event.
(b) For hydrologic modeling purposes.
[1] Existing nonforested pervious areas must be considered
meadow (good condition) for predevelopment hydrologic
calculations.
[2] Twenty percent of existing impervious area, when present
within the proposed project site, shall be considered
meadow (good condition) for predevelopment hydrologic
calculations for redevelopment.
(2) The Simplified Method (CG-2 in the BMP Manual) is independent of
site conditions and should be used if the Design Storm Method is
not followed. This method is not applicable to regulated activities
115. Editor's Note: Appendix B is included at the end of this chapter.
§ 212-12 DANVILLE CODE § 212-13
1:288
greater than one acre or for projects that require detailed design
of stormwater storage facilities. For new impervious surfaces:
(a) Stormwater facilities shall capture at least the first two inches
of runoff from all new impervious surfaces.
(b) At least the first one inch of runoff from new impervious
surfaces shall be permanently removed from the runoff flow,
i.e. it shall not be released into surface waters of the
commonwealth. Removal options include reuse, evaporation,
transpiration, and infiltration.
(c) Wherever possible, infiltration facilities should be designed to
accommodate infiltration of the entire permanently removed
runoff; however, in all cases at least the first 0.5 inch of the
permanently removed runoff should be infiltrated.
(d) Actual field infiltration tests at the location of the proposed
elevation of the stormwater BMPs are required. Infiltration test
shall be conducted in accordance with the BMP Manual.
Notification of the municipality shall be provided to allow
witnessing of the testing.
(3) In cases where it is not possible or desirable to use infiltrationbased
best management practices to partially fulfill the
requirements in either Subsection B(1) or (2), the following
procedure shall be used:
(a) At a minimum, the following documentation shall be provided
to justify the decision to not use infiltration BMPs:
[1] Description of and justification for field infiltration/
permeability testing with respect to the type of test and
test locations.
[2] An interpretive narrative describing existing site soils and
their structure as these relate to the interaction between
soils and water occurring on the site. In addition to
providing soil and soil profile descriptions, this narrative
shall identify depth to seasonal high water tables and
depth to bedrock, and provide a description of all
subsurface elements (fragipans and other restrictive
layers, geology, etc.) that influence the direction and rate
of subsurface water movement.
[3] A qualitative assessment of the site's contribution to
annual aquifer recharge shall be made, along with
identification of any restrictions or limitations associated
with the use of engineered infiltration facilities.
[4] The provided documentation must be signed and sealed by
a professional engineer or geologist.

(c) The performance criteria for water quality best management
practices shall be determined from the Pennsylvania
Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual, most current
version.
C. The applicable worksheets from the BMP Manual must be used in
calculations to establish volume control.
A. Lands contained within Montour County that have not had release rates
established under an approved Act 167 Stormwater Management Plan:
(1) Postdevelopment discharge rates shall not exceed the
predevelopment discharge rates for the one-, two-, ten-, twentyfive-,
fifty-, and one-hundred-year, twenty-four-hour storm events.
B. Lands contained within Montour County that have had release rates
established under an approved Act 167 Stormwater Management Plan:
(1) The postdevelopment peak discharge rates shall be in accordance
with the approved release rate map for the individual watershed.
A. Sensitive areas, as defined below, and stormwater hotspots which
require special consideration with regard to stormwater management.
(1) Sensitive areas are defined as those areas that, if developed, have
the potential to endanger a water supply. These areas consist of the
delineated one-year zone of contribution and direct upslope areas
tributary to the water supply wells. Municipalities may update the
sensitive area boundaries based on new research or studies as
required.
(2) Stormwater hotspots are land development projects that have a
high potential to endanger local water quality and could potentially
threaten groundwater reservoirs. The Municipal Engineer will
§ 212-13 DANVILLE CODE § 212-15
1:290
determine what constitutes these classifications on a case-by-case
basis. The PADEP wellhead protection contaminant source list shall
be used as a guide in these determinations. Industrial
manufacturing site and hazardous material storage areas must
provide NPDES SIC codes. Industrial sites referenced in 40 CFR
125 are also examples of hotspots.
B. Performance standards.
(1) The location of the boundaries of sensitive areas is set by drainage
areas tributary to any public water supply. The exact location of
these boundaries as they apply to a given development site shall be
determined using mapping at a scale which accurately defines the
limits of the sensitive area. If the project site is within the sensitive
area (in whole or in part), two-foot contour interval mapping shall
be provided to define the limits of the sensitive area. If the project
site is adjacent to, but within 500 linear feet of a defined sensitive
area, a five-foot contour interval map defining the limits of the
sensitive area shall be included in the stormwater management
plan to document the site's location relative to the sensitive area.
(2) Stormwater hotspot developments may be required to prepare and
implement a stormwater pollution prevention plan and file notice of
intent as required under the provision of the EPA Industrial
Stormwater NPDES Permit Requirements.
(3) Stormwater hotspot developments must use an acceptable
pretreatment BMP prior to volume control and/or rate control
BMPs. Acceptable pretreatment BMPs for these developments
include those based on filtering, settling, or chemical reaction
processes such as coagulation.
(4) Stormwater hotspot developments and development in sensitive
areas must include riparian buffers as defined in Article VI.

erosion and sedimentation control and stream crossing regulations
under 25 Pa. Code, Chapters 102 and 105. The erosion and
sedimentation control plan shall be submitted to the Montour County
Conservation District for approval and shall address the following, as
applicable:
(1) Design of the roadway system, including haul roads, skid roads,
landing areas, trails, and storage and staging areas.
(2) Runoff control structures (e.g., diversions, culverts, detention
ponds, etc.).
(3) Stream crossings for both perennial and intermittent streams.
(4) Access to public roadways, including design of rock construction
entrance for mud and debris control.
(5) A remediation plan for restoring the disturbed area through
regrading, topsoil placement, reseeding, and other stabilization
techniques, as required.
E. Additional erosion and sedimentation control design standards and
criteria that must be applied where infiltration BMPs are proposed
include the following:
§ 212-16 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 212-16
1:293
(1) Areas proposed for infiltration BMPs shall be protected from
sedimentation and compaction during the construction phase, so as
to maintain their maximum infiltration capacity.

§ 212-17. Riparian buffer requirements.
Where a riparian buffer is required for a regulated activity, the riparian
buffer shall be established as follows:
A. The buffer shall be measured perpendicularly from the top of the
stream bank landward.
(1) High quality or exceptional value watersheds: a minimum of 150
feet;
(2) Impaired streams: a minimum of 150 feet;
(3) All other watersheds: a minimum of 50 feet; or
(4) As determined by a stream corridor study approved by PADEP and
the municipality.
B. The riparian buffer shall be located on both sides of all perennial and
intermittent streams. The perennial and intermittent streams and the
riparian buffer boundaries shall be shown on all applications for
building permits, subdivision, or land development. Existing uses within
the buffer are permitted to continue but not be expanded. Placement of
new structures or roadways within the riparian buffer shall be
prohibited, unless specifically permitted by PADEP. Where a wetland
exists within the buffer area, the buffer shall be extended landward to
provide a minimum buffer of 25 feet, as measured perpendicularly from
the wetland boundary.
C. The buffer shall be undisturbed forest consisting of appropriate native
species.
D. Where wetlands are located partially or entirely within a buffer, the
buffer shall be extended to encompass the wetland and shall be
widened by a distance sufficient to provide a twenty-five-foot riparian
forest buffer measured perpendicularly from the wetland boundary.
E. The following uses shall be permitted in the buffer:
(1) Footpaths, trails and bike paths, provided that:
(a) Width is limited to five feet;
(b) Width may be increased, provided a corresponding increase in
the buffer is provided;
(c) Construction shall have minimal impact to the buffer.
(2) Stream crossings, provided the crossing is designed and
constructed in such a manner as to minimize the impact to the
buffer. The riparian buffer shall be restored to its original
§ 212-17 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 212-17
1:295
condition, to the maximum extent practical, upon completion of
construction.
(3) Utility lines, provided that the crossing is designed and constructed
in such a manner as to minimize the impact to the inner buffer and
provided that there is no practical alternative to locating the utility
line within the buffer. The riparian buffer shall be restored to its
original condition, to the maximum extent practical, upon
completion of construction.
(4) Maintenance and restoration of the riparian buffer.
(5) Projects conducted with the objective of improvement,
stabilization, restoration, or enhancement of the stream bank,
stream channel, floodplain, watershed hydrology, riparian buffers,
or aquatic habitat and maintenance activities associated with such
projects. These projects include, but are not limited to, agricultural
and stormwater management best management practices. Such
projects must receive appropriate permits and approvals from
PADEP prior to starting the project.
(6) Minor private recreational uses for the property owner. Such uses
include benches, fire rings, and similar uses. Such uses do not
include structures such as cabins, sheds, pavilions, garages,
dwellings, or similar structures.
F. Disturbance of the riparian buffer shall be limited to the area necessary
to perform an allowable use.
G. Where possible and practical, disturbances shall be installed and
restored prior to beginning the next phase.
H. Allowable activities shall not cause stormwater flow to concentrate.
I. Any vegetation removed for an allowable activity shall be replaced
immediately upon completion of the activity. Where mature trees are
removed, such trees shall be replaced with the largest practical trees of
acceptable native species.
J. Erosion and sedimentation controls shall be installed and maintained
during construction. Evidence of an approved erosion and
sedimentation control plan, NPDES permit or other PADEP permit,
where required, shall be submitted prior to issuance of local permits.
K. Riparian buffers shall be maintained in a manner consistent with sound
forest management practices. In the absence of a site specific
management plan, the following maintenance guidelines apply:
(1) Buffers shall be inspected periodically for evidence of excessive
sediment deposition, erosion, or concentrated flow channels.
Prompt action shall be taken to correct these problems and prevent
future occurrence.
§ 212-17 DANVILLE CODE § 212-17
1:296
§ 212-18. Riparian buffer easement.
For all riparian buffers, an easement shall be provided:
(2) Trees presenting an unusual hazard of creating downstream
obstructions shall be removed. Such material shall be removed
from the floodplain or the riparian forest buffer (whichever is
widest); or cut into sections small enough to prevent the possibility
of creating obstructions downstream. Wherever possible, large
stable debris should be conserved.
(3) Vegetation should be inspected periodically to ensure diverse
vegetative cover and vigorous plant growth consistent with
buffering objectives.
(a) Remove invasive plant species that may threaten the integrity
of the buffer.
(b) Periodic cutting of trees may be necessary to promote vigorous
growth and encourage regeneration.
(4) Excessive use of fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, and other
chemicals shall be avoided. These products should be used only
when absolutely necessary to maintain buffer vegetation.
A. Easements shall be in accordance with § 212-30 and recorded in
accordance with § 212-47 of this chapter.

Design Criteria
§ 212-19. Design criteria for stormwater management and drainage
facilities.
A. General design guidelines.
(1) Stormwater shall not be transferred from one watershed to
another, unless:
(a) The watersheds are sub-watersheds of a common watershed
which join together within the perimeter of the property;
(b) The effect of the transfer does not alter the peak rate discharge
onto adjacent lands; or
(c) Easements from the affected landowner(s) are provided.
(2) Consideration shall be given to the relationship of the subject
property to the drainage pattern of the watershed. A concentrated
discharge of stormwater to an adjacent property shall be within an
existing watercourse or confined in an easement or returned to a
predevelopment flow type condition.
(3) Low-impact development BMPs and recharge facilities are
encouraged (e.g., rooftop storage, dry wells, cisterns, recreation
area ponding, diversion structures, porous pavements, holding
tanks, infiltration systems, in-line storage in storm sewers, and
grading patterns). They shall be located, designed, and constructed
in accordance with the latest technical guidance published by
PADEP, provided they are accompanied by detailed engineering
plans and performance capabilities and supporting site specific
soils, geology, runoff and groundwater and infiltration rate data to
verify proposed designs. Additional guidance from other sources
may be accepted at the discretion of the Municipal Engineer (a
preapplication meeting is suggested).

adverse hydrologic or hydraulic condition within the watershed, as
identified in the plan.
(6) The design and construction of multiple-use stormwater detention
facilities are strongly encouraged. In addition to stormwater
§ 212-19 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 212-19
1:299
management, facilities should, where appropriate, allow for
recreational uses including ball fields, play areas, picnic grounds,
etc. Consultation with the municipality, and prior approval are
required before design. Provision for permanent wet ponds with
stormwater management capabilities may also be appropriate.
(a) Multiple use basins should be constructed so that potentially
dangerous conditions are not created.
(b) Water quality basins or recharge basins that are designed for a
slow release of water or other extended detention ponds are
not permitted for recreational uses, unless the ponded areas
are clearly separated and secure.
(7) Should any stormwater management facility require a dam safety
permit under PADEP Chapter 105, the facility shall be designed in
accordance with Chapter 105 and meet the regulations of Chapter
105 concerning dam safety.
B. Stormwater management facility design considerations. All stormwater
management facilities shall meet the following design requirements:
(1) For stormwater management facilities and BMPs that retain or
detain water and are of a relatively small scale (less or equal to

and convey flows at computed outlet velocities without erosion.
(18) Emergency spillways. Any stormwater management facility
designed to store runoff shall provide an emergency spillway
designed to convey the one-hundred-year postdevelopment peak
rate flow with a blocked primary outlet structure. The emergency
spillway shall be designed per the following requirements:
(a) The top of embankment elevation shall provide a minimum one
foot of freeboard above the maximum water surface elevation.
This is to be calculated when the spillway functions for the onehundred-
year postdevelopment inflow, with a blocked outlet
structure.

1:302
spillway invert if riprap is the proposed armoring material.
Emergency spillway armor must extend up the sides of the
spillway, and continue at full width to a minimum of 10 feet
past the toe of slope.
(d) Municipal Engineer may require the use of additional
protection when slopes exceed 4:1 and spillway velocities
might exceed NRCS standards for the particular soils involved.
(e) Any underground stormwater management facility (pipe
storage systems) must have a method to bypass flows higher
than the required design (up to a one-hundred-year
postdevelopment inflow) without structural failure, or causing
downstream harm or safety risks.
(19) Stormwater management basins. Design of stormwater
management facilities having three feet or more of water depth
(measured vertically from the lowest elevation in the facility to the
crest of the emergency spillway) shall meet the following additional
requirements:
(a) The maximum water depth within any stormwater
management facility shall be no greater than eight feet when
functioning through the primary outlet structure.
(b) The top of embankment width shall be at least 10 feet.
(c) A ten-foot wide access to the basin bottom must be provided
with a maximum longitudinal slope of 10%.
(d) Berms shall be constructed using soils that conform to the
unified soil classification of CH, MH, CL or ML. The

density per ASTM 2922 or ASTM 3017.
(e) A cutoff and key trench of impervious material shall be
provided under all embankments four feet or greater in height.
The cutoff trench shall run the entire length of the
embankment and tie into undisturbed natural ground.
(f) Antiseep collars, or a PADEP-approved alternative, must be
provided on all outflow culverts in accordance with the

frames, concrete top units, and grade adjustment rings shall be
set in a bed of mortar.
(d) A minimum pipe size of 18 inches in diameter shall be used in
all roadway systems (public or private) proposed for
construction in the municipality. Pipes should be designed to
provide a minimum velocity of 2 1/2 feet per second when
flowing full. Arch pipes of equivalent cross-sectional area may
be substituted in lieu of circular pipe where the depth of cover

runoff away from dwellings and structures.
§ 212-19 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 212-19
1:305
(l) All inlets in paved areas shall have heavy-duty bicycle-safe

2.50 90 or greater
(f) Manning's "n" values used for swale capacity design must
reflect the permanent condition.
A. All calculations shall be consistent with the guidelines set forth in the
BMP Manual, as amended herein.
B. Stormwater runoff from all development sites shall be calculated using
either the Rational Method or the NRCS Rainfall-Runoff Methodology.
Methods shall be selected by the design professional based on the
individual limitations and suitability of each method for a particular
site.
C. Rainfall values:
(1) Rational Method. The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation
Drainage Manual, Intensity-Duration-Frequency Curves,
Publication 584, Chapter 7A, latest edition, shall be used in
conjunction with the appropriate time of concentration and return
period.
(2) NRCS Rainfall-Runoff Method. The Soil Conservation Service Type
II, twenty-four-hour rainfall distribution shall be used in
conjunction with rainfall depths from NOAA Atlas 14 or be
consistent with the following table:
§ 212-19 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 212-20
1:307
Return Interval
(year)
24-hour Rainfall Total
(inches)
1 2.35
2 2.82
10 4.09
25 5.05
50 5.94
100 6.99
D. Runoff volume:
(1) Rational Method. Not to be used to calculate runoff volume.
(2) NRCS Rainfall-Runoff Method. This method shall be used to
estimate the change in volume due to regulated activities.
Combining curve numbers for land areas proposed for development
with curve numbers for areas unaffected by the proposed
development into a single weighted curve number is not
acceptable.
E. Peak flow rates:
(1) Rational Method. This method may be used for design of
conveyance facilities only. Extreme caution should be used by the
design professional if the watershed has more than one main
drainage channel, if the watershed is divided so that hydrologic
properties are significantly different in one versus the other, if the
time of concentration exceeds 60 minutes, or if stormwater runoff
volume is an important factor. The combination of Rational Method
hydrographs based on timing shall be prohibited.
(2) NRCS Rainfall-Runoff Method.
(a) This method is recommended for design of stormwater
management facilities and where stormwater runoff volume
must be taken into consideration. The following provides
guidance on the model applicability:
[1] NRCS's 55: limited to 100 acres in size.
[2] NRCS's TR-20 or HEC-HMS: no size limitations.
[3] Other models as preapproved by the Municipal Engineer.
(b) The NRCS antecedent runoff condition II (ARC II, previously
AMC II) must be used for all simulations. The use of continuous
simulation models that vary the ARC are not permitted for
stormwater management purposes.
§ 212-20 DANVILLE CODE § 212-20
1:308
(3) For comparison of peak flow rates, flows shall be rounded to a tenth
of a cubic foot per second (cfs).
F. Runoff coefficients.
(1) Rational Method. Use Table C-1 (Appendix C).116
(2) NRCS Rainfall-Runoff Method. Use Table C-2 (Appendix C).117
Curve numbers (CN) should be rounded to tenths for use in
hydrologic models as they are a design tool with statistical
variability. For large sites, CN's should realistically be rounded to
the nearest whole number.
(3) For the purposes of predevelopment peak flow rate and volume
determination, existing nonforested pervious areas conditions shall
be considered as meadow (good condition).
(4) For the purposes of predevelopment peak flow rate and volume
determination, 20% of existing impervious area, when present,
shall be considered meadow (good condition).
G. Design storm.
(1) All stormwater management facilities shall be verified by routing
the proposed one-, two-, ten-, twenty-five-, fifty-, and one-hundredyear
hydrographs through the facility using the storage indication
method or modified Puls method. The twenty-four-hour design
storm hydrograph shall be computed using a calculation method
that produces a full hydrograph.
(2) The stormwater management and drainage system shall be
designed to safely convey the postdevelopment one-hundred-year
storm event to stormwater detention facilities, for the purpose of
meeting peak rate control.
(3) All structures (culverts or bridges) proposed to convey runoff under
a municipal roadway shall be designed to pass the fifty-year design
storm with a minimum of one foot of freeboard measured below the
lowest point along the inside surface of the crown for culverts or
the low chord for bridges. For detailed guidance for design of
culverts and bridges, refer to PennDOT Publications 13M and 15M.
H. Time of concentration.
(1) The time of concentration is a parameter that represents the
average condition that best reflects the hydrologic response of the
area. The following time of concentration (Tc) computational
methodologies shall be used unless another method is preapproved
by the Municipal Engineer:
116. Editor's Note: Appendix C is included at the end of this chapter.
117. Editor's Note: Appendix C is included at the end of this chapter.
§ 212-20 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 212-20
1:309
(a) Predevelopment  NRCS's Lag Equation:
Time of Concentration = Tc = [(Tlag/.6) * 60] (minutes)
Where:
Tlag = Lag time (hours)
L = Hydraulic length of watershed (feet)
Y = Average overland slope of watershed (percent)
S = Maximum retention in watershed as defined by:
S = [(1000/CN)  10]
CN = NRCS curve number for watershed
(b) Postdevelopment; commercial, industrial, or other areas with
large impervious areas (>20% impervious area)  NRCS
Segmental Method. The length of sheet flow shall be limited to
100 feet. Tc for channel and pipe flow shall be computed using
Manning's equation.
(c) Postdevelopment; residential, cluster, or other low-impact
designs less than or equal to 20% impervious area  NRCS
Lag Equation or NRCS Segmental Method.
(2) Additionally, the following provisions shall apply to calculations for
time of concentration:
(a) The postdevelopment Tc shall never be greater than the
predevelopment Tc for any watershed or subwatershed. This
includes when the designer has specifically used swales to
reduce flow velocities. In the event that the designer believes
that the postdevelopment Tc is greater, it shall still be set equal
to the predevelopment Tc for modeling purposes.
(b) The minimum Tc for any watershed shall be five minutes.
(c) The designer may choose to assume a five-minute Tc for any
postdevelopment watershed or subwatershed without
providing any computations.
(d) The designer must provide computations for all
predevelopment Tc paths. A five-minute Tc cannot be assumed
for predevelopment.
§ 212-20 DANVILLE CODE § 212-20
1:310
§ 212-21. Downstream hydraulic capacity analysis.
(e) Undetained fringe areas (areas that are not tributary to a
stormwater facility but where a reasonable effort has been
made to convey runoff from all new impervious coverage to
best management practices) may be assumed to represent the
predevelopment conditions for purpose of Tc calculation.
I. Drainage areas tributary to sinkholes or closed depressions in areas
underlain by limestone or carbonate geologic features shall be excluded
from the modeled point of analysis defining pre-development flows. If
left undisturbed during construction activities, areas draining to closed
depressions may also be used to reduce peak runoff rates in the
postdevelopment analysis. New, additional contributing runoff should
not be directed to existing sinkholes or closed depressions.
J. Where uniform flow is anticipated, the Manning's equation shall be
used for hydraulic computations and to determine the capacity of open
channels, pipes, and storm sewers. The Manning's equation should not
be used for analysis of pipes under pressure flow or for analysis of
culverts. Manning's "n" values shall be obtained from PENNDOT's
Drainage Manual, Publication 584 or PennDOT Publication 13M. Inlet
control shall be checked at all inlet boxes to ensure the headwater
depth during the ten-year design event is contained below the top of
grate for each inlet box.
K. The municipality may approve the use of any generally accepted full
hydrograph approximation technique that shall use a total runoff
volume that is consistent with the volume from a method that produces
a full hydrograph.
L. The municipality has the authority to require that computed existing
runoff rates be reconciled with field observations, conditions and site
history. If the designer can substantiate, through actual physical
calibration, that more appropriate runoff and time of concentration
values should be utilized at a particular site, then appropriate
variations may be made upon review and recommendation of the
municipality.
A. Any downstream or off-site hydraulic capacity analysis conducted in
accordance with this chapter shall use the following criteria for
determining adequacy:
(1) Natural or man-made channels or swales must be able to convey
the postdevelopment runoff associated with a bankfull event (or
two-year storm event) at velocities consistent with protection of the
channels from erosion. Acceptable velocities shall be based upon
criteria included in the PADEP Erosion and Sediment Pollution
Control Program Manual.
§ 212-20 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 212-21
1:311
(2) Natural or man-made channels or swales must be able to convey
the postdevelopment twenty-four-year design storm runoff without
creating any hazard to persons or property.
(3) Culverts, bridges, storm sewers or any other facilities which must
pass or convey flows from the tributary area must be designed in
accordance with PADEP, Chapter 105 regulations (if applicable)
and, at a minimum, pass the postdevelopment twenty-four-year
design storm runoff.
(4) It must be demonstrated that the downstream conveyance channel,
other stormwater facilities, roadways, or overland areas are
capable of safely conveying the one-hundred-year design storm
without causing additional damage to buildings or other
infrastructure.
(5) Proposed projects must be consistent with regulations from the
National Flood Insurance Program and any local floodplain
ordinances.

does not exist for a particular lot, or if the topography or any other
condition precludes the use of parking in the rear yard area, then the
front yard may be utilized for parking. If residential driveway/parking of
450 square feet or less is constructed in a rear or side yard and
accessed from a Borough alley, then all provisions of this article shall be
waived. Otherwise, and regardless of the existence or nonexistence of a
sidewalk and or curb, all provisions of this article must be complied
with when the driveway/parking is accessed from a Borough street
(other than alley).127

for any driveway. Where a driveway intersects with a sidewalk, the
sidewalk (implied or otherwise) shall be maintained at a maximum
slope of 8%. Where a driveway intersects with curb, the curb shall be
tapered. All driveway approaches shall be installed 1 1/2 inches above
the adjacent roadway or the gutter grade to maintain proper street
drainage.
D. General location restrictions. Access driveways shall be permitted at
locations in which:
(1) Sight distance is adequate to safely allow each permitted
movement to be made into or out of the access driveway;
(2) The free movement of normal highway traffic is not impaired;
(3) The driveway will not create a hazard; and
(4) The driveway will not create an area of undue traffic congestion on
the Borough street.
E. Minimum yard regulations. A minimum side yard setback distance of
five feet shall be maintained from the applicant's side yard property
line.
F. Surfacing. Any off-street parking or loading area shall be surfaced with
asphalt, concrete, brick, cement pavers or similar durable and dustless
material. Dustless material shall not include loose stone of any size. All
off-street parking areas shall be so graded and drained as to dispose of

Borough's Engineering Firm approves the driveway application, then the
Zoning Officer shall issue a permit for the construction of the driveway.
§ 216-38. Rectification of improper work.
If any person shall construct a driveway or a curb cut and shall not conform
to the requirements of this article, or if any person constructs a driveway
without obtaining a permit to do so, the Borough of Danville may order
such person, firm or corporation to remove the improper work and replace
the same in compliance with this article. Notice to remove and replace
improper or unpermitted work shall be given by registered or certified mail
and shall state that the person, firm or corporation shall have 30 days from
receipt of notice to comply therewith. Upon compliance, the Borough of

manner provided by law.
§ 216-39. Violations and penalties.

this article continues shall constitute a separate offense.
all surface water accumulated within the area and shall be so arranged
and marked as to provide for the orderly and safe loading, parking and
storage of self-propelled vehicles.128
G. Sight distances. All driveways shall be situated in such a fashion so that
safe driveway access onto the Borough right-of-way can be provided. In
a situation where significant safety hazards exist, such as excessive
slope or areas of extremely limited sight distance, a driveway permit
may be denied, based on the Borough Police Chief's review and
recommendation.

Plan Requirements and Processing Procedures
§ 220-4. Compliance required; submission to Planning Commission.
The plan requirements and processing procedures shall be followed by
subdividers as set forth herein and shall be submitted to the official
Planning Commission of the municipality for review and approval prior to
consideration or approval by the governing body.
§ 220-5. Effect of filing an application; schedule of submissions.136
With the exception of minor subdivisions, at the time of filing the
preliminary application and the final application, the applicant shall include
a check payable to the Borough of Danville in the amount specified in
Schedule I137 hereof. Said fee shall be treated as a deposit against the final
review fee for the preliminary application and the final application. Review
fees shall include the reasonable and necessary charges by the Borough's
professional consultants for review and report thereon to the Borough of
Danville. Such fees shall also cover the cost of inspection of improvements;
provided, however, that the applicant shall not be required to reimburse
the Borough for any inspection which is duplicative of inspections covered
by other governmental agencies or public utilities; the burden of proving
that any inspection is duplicative shall be on the applicant. In addition, fees
charged to the Borough relating to any appeal of a decision shall not be
considered review fees and may not be charged to the applicant.
A. Review fees shall be reasonable and in accordance with the ordinary
and customary charges for similar service in the community, but in no
event shall the fees exceed the rate or cost charged by the professional
consultant for comparable services to the Borough for services which
are not reimbursed or otherwise imposed on applicants.
B. Changes in regulations following plat approval.
(1) When an application for approval of a plat, whether preliminary or
final, has been approved or approved without condition or
approved by the applicant's acceptance of conditions, no
subsequent change or amendment in the zoning, subdivision or
other governing ordinance or plan shall be applied to affect
adversely the right of the applicant to commence and to complete
any aspect of the approved development in accordance with the
terms of such approval within five years from such approval.
(2) The five-year period shall be extended for the duration of any
litigation, including appeals, which prevents the commencement or
completion of the development, and for the duration of any sewer
or utility moratorium or prohibition which was imposed subsequent
136. Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I).
137. Editor's Note: See § 220-29, Fees.
§ 220-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 220-5
1:359
to the filing of any application for preliminary approval of a plat.
In the event of an appeal filed by any party for the approval or
disapproval of a plat, the five-year period shall be extended by the
total time from the date the appeal was filed until a final order in
such matter has been entered and all appeals have been concluded
and any period for filing appeals or requests for reconsideration
have expired; provided, however, that no extension shall be based
on any water or sewer moratorium which was in effect as of the
date of the filing of a preliminary application. [Added 12-9-2002
by Ord. No. 447]
C. Where final approval is preceded by preliminary approval, the aforesaid
five-year period shall be counted from the date of the preliminary
approval. In the case of any doubt as to the terms of a preliminary
approval, the terms shall be construed in the light of the provisions of
the governing ordinances or plans as they stood at the time when the
application for such approval was duly filed.
D. Where the landowner has substantially completed the required
improvements as depicted upon the final plat within the aforesaid fiveyear
limit, or any extension thereof as may be granted by the governing
body, no change of municipal ordinance or plan enacted subsequent to
the date of filing of the preliminary plat shall modify or revoke any
aspect of the approved final plat pertaining to zoning classification or
density or lot, building, street or utility location.
E. In the case of a preliminary plat calling for the installation of
improvements beyond the five-year period, a schedule shall be filed by
the landowner with the preliminary plat delineating all proposed
sections as well as deadlines within which applications for final plat
approval of each section are intended to be filed. Such schedule shall be
updated annually by the applicant, on or before the anniversary of the
preliminary plat approval, until final plat approval of the final section
has been granted, and any modification in the aforesaid schedule shall
be subject to approval of the governing body in its discretion.
F. Each section in any residential subdivision or land development, except
for the last section, shall contain a minimum of 25% of the total number
of dwelling units as depicted on the preliminary plan, unless a lesser
percentage is approved by the governing body in its discretion.
Provided that the landowner has not defaulted with regard to or
violated any of the conditions of the preliminary plat approval,
including compliance with the landowner's aforesaid schedule of
submission of final plats for the various sections, then the aforesaid
protections afforded by substantially completing the improvements
depicted upon the final plat within five years shall apply; and for any
section or sections beyond the initial section in which the required
improvements have not been substantially completed within said fiveyear
period, the aforesaid protections shall apply for an additional term
or terms of three years from the date of final plat approval for each
section.
§ 220-5 DANVILLE CODE § 220-5
1:360
§ 220-6. Preapplication.
G. Failure of the landowner to adhere to the aforesaid schedule of
submission of final plats for the various sections shall subject any such
section to any and all changes in zoning, subdivision and other
governing ordinance enacted by the municipality subsequent to the
date of the initial preliminary plan submission.
H. Applicability of ordinance amendments. When an application for either
special exception or a conditional use has been filed with either the
Zoning Hearing Board or the governing body, as relevant, and the
subject matter of such application would ultimately constitute either a
land development or a subdivision, no change or amendment of the
zoning, subdivision, or other governing ordinance or plans shall affect
the decision on such application adversely to the applicant and the
applicant shall be entitled to a decision in accordance with the
provisions of the governing ordinances or plans as they stood at the
time the application was duly filed. Provided, further, should such an
application be approved by either the Zoning Hearing Board or
governing body, as relevant, the applicant shall be entitled to proceed
with the submission of either land development or subdivision plans
within a period of six months or longer or as may be approved by either
the Zoning Hearing Board or the governing body following the date of
such approval in accordance with the provisions of the governing
ordinances or plans as they stood at the time the application was duly
filed before either the Zoning Hearing Board or governing body. If
either a land development or subdivision plan is so filed within said
period, such plan shall be subject to the provisions of Section 508(1)
through (4) of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code,138 as
amended, and specifically to the time limitations of said Section 508(4)
which shall commence as of the date of filing such land development or
subdivision plan. [Added 12-9-2002 by Ord. No. 447]
I. No application will be considered at a regular monthly meeting of the
Borough Planning Commission unless it has been submitted, with
required fees, not later than the first day of the month in which
consideration is requested, unless this requirement is waived by the
Planning Commission on a case-by-case basis. [Added 1-9-2007 by
Ord. No. 479]

as the "State Highway Law,"140 before driveway access to a
state highway is permitted.
B. Final application procedure.
(1) Filing.
(a) The subdivider/developer shall file with the Borough Planning
Commission and the Montour County Planning Commission a
final application for the section (or portion) to be developed. All
documents and data submitted hereunder shall be labeled
"final application." Failure to comply with the time limitation
herein provided shall make the approval of the preliminary
application null and void unless an extension of time is
requested by the subdivider/developer and for good cause
granted by the Commission.
(b) The subdivider/developer, not less than 15 days prior to the
meeting at which consideration is desired, shall file with the
Commission eight copies of a final application for the proposed
subdivision and development, including all information
required under Subsection B(10) and (11) hereof.
(2) Conformance with preliminary application. The final application
will have incorporated all changes and modifications required by
the Borough Council; otherwise, it shall conform to the approved
preliminary application, and it may constitute only that portion of
the approved preliminary application which the subdivider
proposes to record and develop at the time, provided that such
portion conforms to all of the requirements of this chapter.
(3) Completion of improvements or guaranty thereof prerequisite to
final plat approval.
(a) No plat or land development shall be finally approved unless
the streets shown on such plat have been improved to a mudfree
or otherwise permanently passable condition and any
walkways, curbs, gutters, sanitary sewers, storm sewers and
other improvements as may be required by this chapter have
been installed in accordance with the requirements of this
chapter. In lieu of the completion of any improvements
required as a condition for the final approval of a plat,
including improvements or fees required, the subdivider/
developer shall deposit with the municipality a financial
security acceptable to the governing body in an amount
140. Editor's Note: See 36 P.S. § 670-420.
§ 220-8 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 220-8
1:369
sufficient to cover the costs of such improvements or common
amenities, including but not limited to roads, stormwater
detention and/or retention basins and other related drainage
facilities, recreational facilities, open space improvements or
buffer or screen plantings which may be required. The
applicant shall not be required to provide financial security
for the costs of any improvements for which financial security
is required by and provided to the PA Department of
Transportation in connection with the issuance of a highway
occupancy permit. Such financial security shall provide for and
secure to the public the completion of any improvements which
may be required within the period fixed in this chapter for
such completion. The municipality shall be identified on such
security as a party to be notified in the event that said security
is canceled, revoked or redeemed by the holder thereof.
[Amended 12-9-2002 by Ord. No. 447]
(b) Without limitation as to other types of financial security which
the municipality may approve, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, federal or commonwealth-chartered
lending institution irrevocable letters of credit and restrictive
or escrow accounts in such lending institutions shall be
deemed acceptable financial security for the purposes of this
section.
(c) Such financial security shall be posted with a bonding company
or federal- or commonwealth-chartered lending institution
chosen by the party posting the financial security, provided
that said bonding company or lending institution is authorized
to conduct such business within the commonwealth.
(d) Such bond or other security shall provide for and secure to the
public the completion of any improvements which may be
required on or before the date fixed in the formal action of
approval or accompanying agreement for completion of the
improvements.
(e) The amount of financial security to be posted for the
completion of the required improvements shall be equal to
110% of the cost of completion estimated as of 90 days
following the date scheduled for completion by the developer.
Annually, the municipality may adjust the amount of the
financial security by comparing the actual cost of the
improvements which have been completed and the estimated
cost for the completion of the remaining improvements as of
the expiration of the 90th day after either the original date
scheduled for completion or a rescheduled date of completion.
Subsequent to said adjustment, the municipality may require
the developer to post additional security in order to assure that
the financial security equals said 110%. Any additional security
§ 220-8 DANVILLE CODE § 220-8
1:370
shall be posted by the developer in accordance with this
subsection.
(f) The amount of financial security required shall be based upon
an estimate of the cost of completion of the required
improvements, submitted by an applicant or developer and
prepared by a professional engineer licensed as such in this
commonwealth and certified by such engineer to be a fair and
reasonable estimate of such cost. The municipality, upon the
recommendation of the Municipal Engineer, may refuse to
accept such estimate for good cause shown. If the applicant or
developer and the municipality are unable to agree upon an
estimate, then the estimate shall be recalculated and
recertified by another professional engineer licensed as such
in the commonwealth and chosen mutually by the municipality
and the applicant or developer. The estimate certified by the
third engineer shall be presumed fair and reasonable and shall
be the final estimate. In the event that a third engineer is so
chosen, fees for the services of said engineer shall be paid
equally by the municipality and the applicant or developer.
(g) If the party posting the financial security requires more than
one year from the date of posting of the financial security to
complete the required improvements, the amount of financial
security may be increased by an additional 10% for each oneyear
period beyond the first anniversary date from posting of
financial security or to an amount not exceeding 110% of the
cost of completing the required improvements as reestablished
on or about the expiration of the preceding one-year period by
using the above cost-estimating procedure.
(h) In the case where development is projected over a period of
years, the governing body may authorize submission of final
plats by sections or stages of development, subject to such
requirements or guaranties as to improvements in future
sections or stages of development as it finds essential for the
protection of any finally approved section of the development.
(i) As the work of installing the required improvements proceeds,
the party posting the financial security may request the
governing body to release or authorize the release of, from
time to time, such portions of the financial security necessary
for payment to the contractor or contractors performing the
work. Any such requests shall be in writing addressed to the
governing body, and the governing body shall have 45 days
from receipt of such request within which to allow the
Municipal Engineer to certify, in writing, to the governing body
that such portion of the work upon the improvements has been
completed in accordance with the approved plat. Upon such
certification, the governing body shall authorize release by the
bonding company or lending institution of an amount as
§ 220-8 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 220-8
1:371
estimated by the Municipal Engineer fairly representing the
value of the improvements completed, or, if the governing body
fails to act within said forty-five-day period, the governing
body shall be deemed to have approved the release of funds
as requested. The governing body shall, prior to final release
at the time of completion and certification by its Engineer,
require retention of 10% of the estimated cost of the aforesaid
improvements.
(j) Where the governing body accepts dedication of all or some of
the required improvements following completion, the
governing body shall require the posting of financial security to
secure structural integrity of said improvements as well as the
functioning of said improvements in accordance with the
design and specifications as depicted on the final plat for a
term of 18 months from the date of acceptance of dedication.
Said financial security shall be of the same type as otherwise
required in this section with regard to installation of such
improvements, and the amount of the financial security shall
be 10% of the actual cost of installation of said improvements.
(k) If water mains or sanitary sewer lines, or both, along with
apparatus or facilities related thereto, are to be installed under
the jurisdiction and pursuant to the rules and regulations of a
public utility or Municipal Authority separate and distinct from
the municipality, financial security to assure proper completion
and maintenance thereof shall be posted in accordance with
the regulations of the controlling public utility or Municipal
Authority and shall not be included with the financial security
as otherwise required by this section.
(l) If financial security has been provided in lieu of the completion
of improvements required as a condition for the final approval
of a plat as set forth in this section, the municipality shall not
condition the issuance of building, grading or other permits
relating to the erection or placement of improvements,
including buildings, upon the lots or land as depicted upon the
final plat upon actual completion of the improvements depicted
upon the approved final plat. Moreover, if said financial
security has been provided, occupancy permits for any building
or buildings to be erected shall not be withheld following the
improvement of the streets providing access to and from
existing public roads to such building or buildings to a mudfree
or otherwise permanently passable condition, as well as
the completion of all other improvements as depicted upon the
approved plat, either upon the lot or lots or beyond the lot or
lots in question if such improvements are necessary for the
reasonable use of or occupancy of the building or buildings.
(4) Release from improvement bond.
§ 220-8 DANVILLE CODE § 220-8
1:372
(a) When the developer has completed all of the necessary and
appropriate improvements, the developer shall notify the
municipal governing body, in writing, by certified mail, of the
completion of the aforesaid improvements and shall send a
copy thereof to the Municipal Engineer. The municipal
governing body shall, within 10 days after receipt of such
notice, direct and authorize the Municipal Engineer to inspect
all of the aforesaid improvements. The Municipal Engineer
shall thereupon file a report, in writing, with the municipal
governing body and shall promptly mail a copy of the same to
the developer by certified mail. The report shall be made and
mailed within 30 days after receipt by the Municipal Engineer
of the aforesaid authorization from the governing body. Said
report shall be detailed and shall indicate approval or rejection
of said improvements, either in whole or in part, and if said
improvements or any portion thereof shall not be approved by
the Municipal Engineer, said report shall contain a statement
of reasons for such nonapproval.
(b) The municipal governing body shall notify the developer,
within 15 days of receipt of the Engineer's report, in writing,
by certified mail, of the action of said municipal governing
body with relation thereto.
(c) If the municipal governing body or the Municipal Engineer fails
to comply with the time limitation provisions contained herein,
all improvements will be deemed to have been approved, and
the developer shall be released from all liability pursuant to its
performance guaranty bond or other security agreement.
(d) If any portion of said improvements shall not be approved by
the municipal governing body, the developer shall proceed to
complete the same, and, upon completion, the same procedure
of notification as outlined herein shall be followed.
(e) Nothing herein, however, shall be construed in limitation of the
developer's right to contest or question, by legal proceedings
or otherwise, any determination of the municipal governing
body or the Municipal Engineer.
(f) Where herein reference is made to the Municipal Engineer, he
shall be a duly registered professional engineer employed by
the municipality or engaged as a consultant thereto.
(g) The foregoing procedures for release from an improvement
bond shall also be applicable to requests for partial releases of
not less than 25% each; provided, however, that if the
developer requests such partial releases, he shall be
responsible for all related costs of the Municipal Engineer.
(5) Remedies to effect completion of improvements.
§ 220-8 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 220-8
1:373
(a) In the event that any improvements which may be required
have not been installed as provided in this chapter or in accord
with the approved final plat, the governing body may enforce
any corporate bond or other security by appropriate legal and
equitable remedies. If the proceeds of such bond or other
security are insufficient to pay the cost of installing or making
repairs or corrections to all the improvements covered by said
security, the governing body may, at its option, install part of
such improvements in all or part of the subdivision or land
development and may institute appropriate legal or equitable
action to recover the moneys necessary to complete the
remainder of the improvements. All of the proceeds, whether
resulting from the security or from any legal or equitable
action brought against the subdivider/developer, or both, shall
be used solely for the installation of the improvements covered
by such security and not for any other municipal purposes.
Further, the governing body shall not be obliged to expend
general revenues of the Borough to complete improvements
for which the security is or becomes inadequate.
(b) In the further event that the governing body acts to realize the
proceeds of the security and to effect the completion of
improvements, it shall do so in its governmental capacity and
shall not be deemed to be acting in the capacity of the
subdivider or developer.
(6) Approval. The Planning Commission shall recommend to the
Borough Council whether the final application shall be approved or
disapproved, and the Borough Council shall render its decision and
communicate it, in writing, to the subdivider/developer not later
than 90 days following the date of the regular meeting of the
Planning Commission next following the date the application is
filed, provided that should said next regular meeting occur more
than 30 days following the filing of the application, said ninety-day
period shall be measured from the 30th day following the day the
application has been filed.
(a) If approved, the governing body shall sign the original final
subdivision application and attach thereto a notation that it has
received approval and return it to the subdivider/developer for
compliance with the recording requirements.
(b) If disapproved, the Borough Council shall attach to the
application a statement of reasons for such action and return it
to the subdivider/developer.
(c) The decision of the Borough Council shall be communicated to
the applicant personally or mailed to him, by certified mail, at
his last known address, not later than 15 days following the
decision.
§ 220-8 DANVILLE CODE § 220-8
1:374
(d) When requested by the developer, in order to facilitate
financing, the governing body shall furnish the developer with
a signed copy of a resolution indicating approval of the final
plat contingent upon the developer obtaining a satisfactory
financial security. The final plat or record plan shall not be
signed or recorded until the financial improvement agreement
is executed. The resolution or letter of contingent approval
shall expire and be deemed to be revoked if the financial
security agreement is not executed within 90 days, unless a
written extension is granted by the governing body. Such
extension shall not be unreasonably withheld and shall be
placed in writing at the request of the developer.
(7) Changes. No changes, erasures, modifications or revisions shall be
made on any final application of a subdivision/land development
after approval has been given by the Borough Council and
endorsed in writing on the application, unless the application is
resubmitted for approval.
(8) Recording. Plats and deeds shall be recorded in accordance with
§ 220-26. [Amended 12-9-2002 by Ord. No. 447141]

Design Standards
§ 220-15. Streets.
The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade and location of all streets

street, railroad right-of-way or rail crossings, access thereto shall be
limited to a minimum number of intersections as is practicable, and
such major access intersections with arterial streets and/or rail
crossings shall be determined with due regard for sight distance,
distance between intersections, approach grades and requirements for
future grade separations.
D. Marginal access streets paralleling such limited access arterial streets
shall be required, in such cases where practicable, reversing the
frontage of residential properties with a screen planting contained in a
nonaccess reservation strip along the rear of and between the property
line and the arterial street right-of-way. Such reserve strips shall be
prohibited except where their control is definitely placed with the
municipality.
E. Street jogs with center-line offsets of less than 125 feet shall be
avoided.
F. A tangent at least 100 feet long shall be introduced between curves on
arterial and collector streets.

than 600 feet and shall be provided with a turnaround having an outside
road diameter of at least 80 feet and a property line diameter of at least
100 feet.
L. No street grade shall be less than 1/2 of 1% or more than 10%, unless
topographic conditions make a steeper grade necessary.
A. The length, width and shape of blocks shall be determined with due
regard to:
(1) The provision of adequate building sites for the special type of use
contemplated.
(2) Requirements as to lot size and dimensions.
(3) The need for convenient access, circulation, control and safety of
street traffic.
(4) Limitations and opportunities of topography.
B. Block lengths shall not exceed 1,800 feet.

adequacy of existing or proposed community facilities to serve the
additional dwellings proposed by the subdivision.
B. Where a proposed park, playground, school or other public use shown
on the Official Map is located in whole or in part in a subdivision, the
Commission may require the reservation of such area as may be
deemed reasonable. Where said area is not dedicated, it shall be

Fees, Enforcement and Penalties
§ 220-29. Fees.
A. With the exception of minor subdivisions, at the time of filing the
preliminary application and the final application, the applicant shall
include a check payable to the Borough of Danville in the amount
specified in Schedule I hereof. Said fee shall be treated as a deposit
against the final review fee for the preliminary application and the final
application. Review fees shall include the reasonable and necessary
charges by the Borough's professional consultants for review and
report thereon to the Borough of Danville. Such fees shall also cover the
cost of inspection of improvements; provided, however, that the
applicant shall not be required to reimburse the Borough for any
inspection which is duplicative of inspections covered by other
governmental agencies or public utilities; the burden of proving that
any inspection is duplicative shall be on the applicant. In addition, fees
charged to the Borough relating to any appeal of a decision shall not be
considered review fees and may not be charged to the applicant.
Review fees shall be reasonable and in accordance with the ordinary
and customary charges for similar service in the community, but in no
event shall the fees exceed the rate or cost charged by the professional
consultant for comparable services to the Borough for services which
are not reimbursed or otherwise imposed on applicants. [Amended
12-9-2002 by Ord. No. 447; 1-9-2007 by Ord. No. 479]
(1) The governing body shall submit to the applicant an itemized bill
showing work performed, identifying the person performing the
services and the time and date when each task was performed.
Nothing in this subparagraph shall prohibit interim itemized billing
or municipal escrow or other security requirements. In the event
the applicant disputed the amount of any such review fees, the
applicant shall, no later than 30 days after the date of transmittal of
the bill to the applicant, notify the municipality and the
municipality's professional consultant that such fees are disputed
and shall explain the basis of their objection to the fees charged, in
which case the municipality shall not delay or disapprove the
applicant's application based on a dispute over fees. Failure of the
applicant to dispute a bill within 30 days shall be a waiver of the
applicant's right to arbitration of that bill under Section 510(g) of
the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code.145,146
(2) In the event that the municipality's professional consultant and the
applicant cannot agree on the amount of the review fees which are
able and necessary, then the applicant and the municipality shall
follow the procedure for dispute resolution set forth in Section
145. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10510(g).

that the arbitrator resolving such dispute shall be of the same
profession or discipline as the professional consultant whose fees
are being disputed.
(3) Subsequent to a decision on the application, the Borough Council
shall submit to the applicant an itemized bill for review fees,
specifically designated as a final bill. The final bill shall include all
review fees incurred at least through the date of the decision on the
application. If for any reason additional review is required
subsequent to the decision, including the conditions of the
approval, the review fees shall be charged to the applicant as a
supplement to the final bill.147

§ 220-30. Enforcement; violations and penalties.
(2) The amount of the review fee to be deposited for all land
development applications shall be in accordance with the following
schedule:
Area
(square feet) Amount of Fee
2,000 or less $200
2,001 or more $0.10 per square foot, up to a
maximum fee of $1,000
C. Processing fee. In addition to the above, each application for a
subdivision/land development shall be accompanied by a nonrefundable
fee to cover the cost of administration required to process applications.
Such fees shall be $5 per lot, but not less than $50 per application,
including applications for minor subdivisions. In addition, all applicants
shall pay the fee of the Montour County Planning Commission.
D. Resolution of fee disputes. The municipality may prescribe that the
applicant shall reimburse the municipality for the reasonable and
necessary expense incurred in connection with the inspection of
improvements. The applicant shall not be required to reimburse the
governing body for any inspection which is duplicative of inspections
conducted by other governmental agencies or public utilities. The
burden of proving that any inspection is duplicative shall be upon the
objecting applicant. Such reimbursement shall be based on a schedule
established by ordinance or resolution. Such expense shall be
reasonable and in accordance with the ordinary and customary fees
charged by the municipality's professional consultants to the
municipality for work performed for similar services in the community,
but in no event shall the fees exceed the rate or cost charged by the
professional consultant to the municipality for comparable services
when fees are not reimbursed or otherwise imposed on applicants, as
specified in the following schedule of professional consultants' fees.
[Added 1-9-2007 by Ord. No. 479148]
A. Enforcement authorization. In addition to all those who may by law
have the authority to enforce and/or prosecute, it is specifically
designated that it shall be the duty of the Borough Council of the
Borough of Danville to enforce this chapter.
B. Enforcement remedies. Any person, partnership or corporation who or
which has violated the provisions of this chapter shall, upon being
found liable therefor in a civil enforcement proceeding commenced by
the municipality, pay a judgment of not more than $500, plus all court
costs, including reasonable attorney's fees incurred by the municipality
148. Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I).
§ 220-29 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 220-30
1:395
as a result thereof. No judgment shall commence or be imposed, be
levied or be payable until the date of the determination of a violation by
the Magisterial District Judge. If the defendant neither pays nor timely
appeals the judgment, the municipality may enforce the judgment
pursuant to the applicable rules of civil procedure. Each day that a
violation continues shall constitute a separate violation, unless the
Magisterial District Judge, determining that there has been a violation,
further determines that there was a good-faith basis for the person,
partnership or corporation violating the chapter to have believed that
there was no such violation, in which event there shall be deemed to
have been only one such violation until the fifth day following the date
of the determination of a violation by the Magisterial District Judge,
and thereafter each day that a violation continues shall constitute a
separate violation.
C. Preventive remedies.
(1) In addition to other remedies, the municipality may institute and
maintain appropriate actions by law or in equity to restrain, correct
or abate violations; to prevent unlawful construction; to recover
damages; and to prevent illegal occupancy of a building, structure
or premises. The description by metes and bounds in the
instrument of transfer or other documents used in the process of
selling or transferring shall not exempt the seller or transferor
from such penalties or from the remedies herein provided.
(2) The municipality may refuse to issue any permit or grant any
approval necessary to further improve or develop any real property
which has been developed or which has resulted from a subdivision
of real property in violation of this chapter. This authority to deny
such a permit or approval shall apply to any of the following
applicants:
(a) The owner of record at the time of such violation.
(b) The vendee or lessee of the owner of record at the time of such
violation without regard as to whether such vendee or lessee
had actual or constructive knowledge of the violation.
(c) The current owner of record who acquired the property
subsequent to the time of violation without regard as to
whether such current owner had actual or constructive
knowledge of the violation.
(d) The vendee or lessee of the current owner of record who
acquired the property subsequent to the time of violation
without regard as to whether such vendee or lessee had actual
or constructive knowledge of the violation.
(3) As an additional condition for issuance of a permit or the granting
of an approval to any such owner, current owner, vendee or lessee
for the development of any such real property, the municipality may
§ 220-30 DANVILLE CODE § 220-30
1:396
require compliance with the conditions that would have been
applicable to the property at the time the applicant acquired an
interest in such real property.

§ 237-29. Parking for disabled persons.
A. Designation of parking space for disabled persons. At the request of a
person with a disability or severely disabled veteran, the Police
Department is authorized to designate a parking space near that
person's place of residence with a sign or signs indicating that such
parking space is reserved for a person with a disability or a severely
disabled veteran, that no parking is allowed there by others, and that
any unauthorized person parking there shall be subject to a fine and
may be towed. The request for designation of such a parking space shall
be made upon such form or forms as may be designed by the Police
Department for such purpose. The application fee shall be as
established by resolution of the Borough.
B. Signs on designated spaces. A reserved space shall be identified by a
sign. Such sign designating a reservation of a parking space for a
person with a disability or a severely disabled veteran shall contain the
following information:
(1) The word "Reserved."
(2) The international symbol for access for persons with disabilities.
(3) A statement that "No parking is allowed by others."
(4) A statement: "Unauthorized parking subject to towing and/or a fine
of up to $200."
C. Disability parking placard and plates.
(1) Vehicles utilizing parking spaces designated for persons with a
disability or severely disabled veterans shall display a current
disability plate or a disability parking placard issued by the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department of Transportation.
(2) The exception to Subsection C(1) above is that persons who are
dropping off or picking up a person with a disability or a severely
disabled veteran may utilize the reserved parking space designated
for such person with a disability or severely disabled veteran for a
period of not greater than 15 minutes. The burden shall be upon
such person to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he
or she was engaged in dropping off or picking up a person with a
disability or a severely disabled veteran.
D. Costs of signage. The cost of erecting and maintaining signs
designating reservation of parking spaces for persons with a disability
or severely disabled veterans shall be borne by the person for whom
such space is being reserved, in an amount as established by resolution
of the Borough.
E. Termination of reserved space. Upon the death or change of domicile of
the person with a disability or severely disabled veteran, or upon the
failure to utilize the reserved space, the reservation of the parking
§ 237-29 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 237-29
1:453
§ 237-30. Residential districts permit parking.
space shall terminate. Removal of the signage indicating reservation of
the space shall be by the Borough of Danville. Persons for whom the
space is reserved shall notify the Borough in the event of change of
domicile or utilization of reserved space.
F. Fines, penalties and payment for towing costs. Fines, penalties and
payment for towing costs shall be imposed as set forth in the
Pennsylvania Vehicle Code, 75 Pa.C.S.A. § 3354.
A. Purpose and intent. The Borough finds that:
(1) Certain residential areas in the Borough of Danville are subjected
to commuter vehicle parking, thereby depriving the residents of
those areas of spaces in which to park their own vehicles.
(2) The establishment of a permit parking program for certain affected
residential areas should facilitate efficient movement of traffic by
providing for residential parking preference during certain hours
of the day and days of the week while also ensuring primary access
of available parking spaces to neighborhood residents.
B. Permits required. It shall be unlawful for any person to park a motor
vehicle or trailer or any other type of motor vehicle without a proper,
valid parking permit placard displayed thereon between the hours
specified below during the days specified below and upon any of the
highways or parts of highways indicated and described below,

§ 237-30 DANVILLE CODE § 237-31
1:458
§ 237-31. C-2 District permit parking.
A. Purpose and intent. The Borough finds that:
(1) While the Borough has no responsibility to provide parking for
employers or employees of businesses within its C-2 District,
opportunity exists in certain areas to meet some of the parking
demand created as a result of such employers and employees.
(2) Facilitating some of the parking needs of employers and employees
of businesses within the Borough's C-2 District by utilizing spaces
that are less convenient for shopping purposes may help ensure
that employers and employees do not instead utilize prime
customer spaces intended for downtown clientele.
(3) While the Borough has no responsibility to provide parking for
residents living within its C-2 District, opportunity exists in certain
areas to meet some of the parking demand created as a result of
such residents.
(4) Facilitating some of the parking needs of residents living within the
Borough's C-2 District may help encourage the development and
rehabilitation of upper floor vacant spaces that could be utilized for
residential living.
(5) While the provision of off-street parking for dwelling units in the
C-2 District is required as detailed in § 260-32, Automotive
services; off-street parking and loading, facilitating some of the
parking needs of residents living within the Borough's C-2 District
may help meet any demand in excess of the parking supply
provided as a result of the regulations of Chapter 260 or as a result
of nonconforming properties that do not meet said regulations.
B. Permit parking permitted. Parking of a motor vehicle with a proper,
valid permit parking placard displayed thereon shall be permitted in

ARTICLE I
Title and Purposes
§ 260-1. Long title.
This chapter shall be entitled "An ordinance to limit and restrict to specified
districts or zones, and to regulate therein, buildings and structures
according to their construction and the nature and extent of their use, and
the nature and extent of the uses of land in the Borough of Danville, and
providing for the administration and enforcement of the provisions herein
contained and fixing penalties for the violation thereof."
§ 260-2. Short title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Danville Borough
Zoning Ordinance."
§ 260-3. Community development objectives.
A. The intent of this chapter is to establish a precise and detailed plan for
the use of land in Danville Borough based on the municipality's Master
Plan, including but not limited to those aspects of the Master Plan
relating to land use, density of population and location and function of
streets and other community facilities and utilities. This chapter has
been further enacted in order to promote and protect the general
health, welfare, safety and convenience of the municipality.
B. The Borough of Danville has enacted a Zoning Ordinance, of which this
statement is a part, in accordance with the Pennsylvania Municipalities
Planning Code.176 The adoption and enforcement of these regulations is
intended to provide the municipality with procedures which will assist
in directing its growth and development in accordance with local needs
and goals.
C. Pertinent local goals which these regulations are intended to bring to
fruition relate to such factors as land use, population density, streets
and traffic and other community facilities and utilities, generally as
defined in the Danville Borough Master Plan.
D. More specifically, it is intended to:
(1) Create a pattern of land uses which is compatible and harmonious,
where a suitable environment may be created for residential,
commercial and industrial functions. The protection of our present
and future residential areas is a prime concern, as well as the
reservation and protection of lands which are considered desirable
and suitable for commercial and industrial uses, but not those
industrial uses which will emit nuisances which would have an
adverse affect on any part of the community.
176. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10101 et seq.
§ 260-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 260-3
1:483
§ 260-4. Scope of regulations.
(a) Residential land use goals. The Borough will pursue policies
which will permit a wide variety of residential densities and
housing types in order to meet the physical, social and
economic needs of the Borough's current residents as well as
potential future residents.
(b) Commercial land use goals. Expansion of commercial
development is desired, including a greater variety of
commercial establishments to meet the needs of the residents.
Regardless of the location of future commercial development,
it should be designed and developed in a manner which would
not create an adverse environmental effect on existing or
developing residential areas.
(c) Manufacturing land use goals. Manufacturing development
should be located in a suitable area (or areas) and it should be
regulated to minimize noise, odors and other potentially
adverse environmental impacts on the residential areas of the
Borough.
(2) Maintain a density of population which can feasibly be served by
the streets and other public facilities which presently exist or can
be reasonably provided by the municipality.
(3) Direct the types of development and the intensity of development in
such a manner as will not place an unreasonable burden on the
capacity of local streets and other public facilities.
(4) Preserve the character, appearance and integrity of the community
in keeping with the present pattern and character of development.
(5) Protect the floodplain by prohibiting the forms of development
which would restrict the flow of the streams and/or result in
extensive loss of life or property.
A. Administration and enforcement. This chapter includes provisions for
the administration and the enforcement of the chapter and such other
provisions as are deemed necessary to implement the purposes of this
chapter and the purposes of Act 247, as amended.177
B. Flexibility and innovation. This chapter includes provisions to
encourage innovation and to promote flexibility, economy and ingenuity
in development, including subdivisions and land developments as
defined in Act 247, as amended. Such regulations provide authorization
to increase the permissible density of population and intensity of uses
based upon expressed standards and criteria set forth herein.

§ 260-8 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 260-10
1:505
§ 260-11. Degree of restrictiveness.
The phrase "more restrictive uses," as employed in this chapter, shall mean
the following:
boundary lines, all as shown on the Zoning Map; but where a zone
boundary line does not follow such a line, its location is shown on the
Zoning Map by a specific dimension expressing its distance from a
street or road line or other boundary line as indicated or by a reference
to a contour line delineated on the United States Geological Survey
Maps. [Amended 5-6-2008 by Ord. No. 491195]
B. Determination of locations of boundaries.
(1) The Floodway and Flood-Fringe Districts, as well as the
Approximated Floodplain Districts, shall serve as overlays to the
existing underlying zoning as shown on the Borough's Official
Zoning Map, and as such, the provisions for these districts shall
serve as a supplement to the underlying district provisions. Where
there happens to be any conflict between the provisions or
requirements of the Approximated Floodplain, Floodway or the
Flood-Fringe District and those of any underlying district, the more
restrictive provisions and/or those pertaining to the Floodway or
Flood-Fringe District shall apply.
(2) In the event of uncertainty as to the true location of a zone
boundary line in a particular instance, any decision of the Zoning
Officer may be appealed before the Zoning Hearing Board by an
affected property owner. It shall be the duty of the Zoning Hearing
Board to render its determination with respect thereto.
(3) Where interpretation is needed concerning the exact location of
any boundary of the Floodway or Flood-Fringe or Approximated
Floodplain District(s), the Zoning Hearing Board shall make the
necessary determination. The person questioning or contesting the
location of the district boundary shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to present his case to the Board and to submit his own
technical evidence if he so desires.
C. Division of lot or parcel in single ownership. Where a zone boundary
line divides a lot or parcel in single ownership at the time of the passage
of this chapter, any use authorized or permitted in either zone may be
extended a distance not to exceed 50 feet beyond the boundary of the
zone in which such use is authorized or permitted.
A. Those uses permitted in a P-1 Zone are the most restrictive.
B. All other uses are less restrictive in the order they are permitted in the
zones in the sequence shown: R-1A, R-1B, R-2A, R-2B, R-3, C-1, C-2,
C-2A, C-3 and M-1.

ARTICLE V
Supplementary Lot, Height and Yard Regulations
§ 260-19. Zone lot regulations.
A. Existing zone lots of record. In any R District, only a single-family
detached dwelling or an appurtenant use accessory to an adjacent
principal permitted use may be erected on a nonconforming zone lot of
official record at the effective date of this chapter, irrespective of its
area or width, the owner of which does not own any adjoining property
which would create a conforming lot if all or part of said property were
combined with the subject zone lot; provided, however, that such lots
shall be considered as separate lots in those cases where the
development of such lots shall conform with the setback requirements
of this chapter; and provided, further, that no lot or lots in single
ownership shall hereafter be reduced so as to create one or more
nonconforming lots; and provided, further, that on any nonconforming
lot no side yard shall be less than five feet nor shall any side yard
adjoining a side street be less than 10 feet; provided, further, that the
rear yard of any such lot shall in no case be less than 10 feet, and the
front yard shall be as required in § 260-21B.

regulations shall apply:
(1) When not served by public water or sewer, the minimum lot area
per dwelling unit shall be not less than 20,000 square feet nor less
than 100 feet in width at the front lot line when such lot is not
served by a public water or sanitary sewer system; and provided,
further, that any dwelling erected on such lot shall be in
accordance with the yard and coverage requirements as specified
in any R-1 District.
(2) Not served by public sewer. Lots served by a public water system
and an individual on-lot sewage disposal system such as a cesspool
or septic tank shall not be less than 10,000 square feet in area per

C. Lot frontage. The minimum lot frontage of any lot shall be measured
between the minimum building setback line as required for the district
where located and a parallel line not more than 10 feet beyond the
setback line. The width of any lot in any district, except C and M
Districts, shall not be less than 30% of the depth of said lot at the front
lot line; provided, however, that no lot need exceed a width of 300 feet
unless otherwise required in the district where located, nor shall any
such lot having a depth of 300 feet or more be less than 50 feet along
the front line.
D. Corner lots. At all intersecting public right-of-way lines, no obstructions
to vision (other than an existing building, post, column or tree)
exceeding 30 inches in height above the established grade of the street
at the property line shall be erected or maintained on any lot within the
triangle formed by the intersecting public right-of-way and a line drawn
between points along such street lot lines 30 feet distant from their
points of intersection. All trees or tree branches extending into this
area shall be trimmed so that branches are at least 10 feet above the
street grade.201
E. Through lots. Where a single lot under individual ownership extends
from a street to an alley, the widest street shall be deemed the street
upon which the property fronts and no principal structures and no
dwelling shall be erected which shall face on the rear of such a lot;
provided, however, that dwelling groups shall not be subject to this
limitation on the location of principal structures.
F. Required area or space cannot be reduced. The area or dimension of
any zone lot, yard, parking area or other space shall not be reduced to
less than the minimum required by this chapter; and if already less than
the minimum required by this chapter, said area or dimension may be
continued and shall not be further reduced.
A. General application. No building or structure shall have a greater
number of stories than are permitted in Article IV hereof; provided,

conical surface zone pertaining to the Danville airport. Within this zone,
no obstruction, including a structure, growth or other object, including
a mobile object shall be permitted to a height which would result in its
elevation to or greater than 909 feet above mean sea level.
A. Side yards.

improved lots, each having a principal building within 25 feet of any
side lot line of such unimproved lot, the front yard may be reduced to
the greatest depth of the front yard of the two adjoining improved lots,
but shall be not less than 15 feet. Where any unimproved lot shall front
on a right-of-way which is proposed on the municipality's Official Map
to be widened, the front yard of such lot shall be as required by Article
IV hereof and shall be measured from such proposed future right-ofway.
C. Front yard of corner lot. The front yard of any corner lot shall be
established on the wider of the two streets abutting said lot, except

project into required yards as follows:
(1) Cornices, canopies, eaves or other architectural features may
project into a side yard a distance not exceeding two inches per one
foot of side yard width, but may not exceed a total of three feet.
(2) Fire escapes may project into side and rear yards a distance not
exceeding four feet six inches.
(3) Bay windows, balconies, fireplaces, uncovered stairways and

(4) Open patios and decks may be located in side yards and rear yards.
If the patio/deck is located less than eight feet from a side or rear
property line, it shall be screened in accordance with § 260-25A
hereof. If the patio/deck is located eight feet or more from a side or
rear property line, no screening shall be required. In no case,
however, shall any patio or deck be nearer to any side or rear
property line than three feet. In case of a corner lot, no enclosed
patios shall extend into the side yard adjoining such side street.
E. Additional yards required where nonresidential uses abut R Districts.
All nonresidential uses first permitted in C-1 or less restrictive districts
which abut, at the lot line or on the same street, an R District, shall
provide yards, where they abut, of not less than 50 feet in depth;
provided, however, that if the yard requirement for the nonresidential
use is greater, then such greater distance shall be required. Such yards
shall be maintained as landscaped open spaces and shall not be
occupied by parking, loading or outdoor storage uses.
A. Building coverage. Land coverage by principal and accessory buildings
or structures on each zone lot shall not be greater than is permitted in
Article IV or other pertinent sections of this chapter.

be landscaped in accordance with this subsection shall provide a visual
screen not less than six feet high, consisting of a fence or evergreentype
hedges or shrubs spaced at intervals of not more than six feet,
located and maintained in good condition within 15 feet of the property
line adjoining or abutting an R District.
B. Unenclosed uses. Except for nurseries and the display for sales
purposes of new or used cars, motorcycles, trucks, trailers or farm

1:515
height, at intervals of not more than six feet and maintained in good
condition.
C. Landscaping requirements for parking lots. The objective of this
provision is to protect and promote the public health, safety and
general welfare by requiring the landscaping of parking lots which will
serve to reduce heat and noise and the glare of vehicle lights; to
preserve underground water reserves and return precipitation to the
groundwater; to act as a natural drainage system and ameliorate
stormwater drainage problems; to reduce soil erosion; to provide
shade; to relieve the blighted appearance of parking lots; and to
facilitate the creation of a convenient and attractive community.
(1) Landscape plan.
(a) No parking lot of 10 or more spaces shall be constructed,
enlarged or reconstructed until a landscape plan for that
parking lot has been approved by the Zoning Officer. The
Zoning Officer shall not approve the landscape plan submitted
to him unless it conforms to the requirements of this section.
(b) Landscape plans shall be prepared by a registered architect,
professional engineer, landscape architect or other qualified
landscaper and may be submitted as an element of the site
plan.
(c) Landscape plans shall be drawn to scale, including dimensions
and distances, and shall clearly delineate the existing and
proposed parking spaces or other vehicular use areas, access
aisles, driveways and the location, size and description of all
landscape materials.
(2) Parking lot landscaping design criteria.
(a) All parking lot landscaping shall be of such quality as to
improve and enhance the site and its surrounding areas.
(b) The primary landscaping materials used in parking lots shall
be trees which provide shade or are capable of providing shade
at maturity. Shrubbery, hedges and other planting material
may be used to complement the tree landscaping but shall not
be the sole contribution to the landscaping. Effective use of
earth berms and existing topography is also encouraged as a
component of the landscape plan.
(c) The interior dimensions of any planting area or planting
median shall be sufficient to protect the landscaping material
planted therein and to ensure proper growth.
(d) In those instances where plant material exists on a parking lot
site prior to its development, such landscape material may be
used if approved as meeting the requirements of this chapter.
§ 260-25 DANVILLE CODE § 260-25
1:516
§ 260-26. Miscellaneous building regulations.
(3) Planting materials. All planting materials shall be suitable for

two rows, not less than 6% of the interior of a parking lot shall be
landscaped and one tree shall be planted for every 200 square feet
of required interior landscaped area. The landscaping and planting
areas shall generally be dispersed evenly throughout the parking
lots. Where a parking lot abuts buildings on the subject property on
more than one side, border plantings adjacent to those buildings
may be considered as part of the interior landscape requirement.203
(5) Perimeter coverage requirements. Perimeter landscaping shall be
required along any side of a parking lot of 10 or more spaces that
abuts adjoining property that is not a right-of-way. A landscaping
strip having a minimum width of four feet shall be located between
the parking area and the abutting property lines.
(6) Street coverage requirements.
(a) Street landscaping shall be required along any side of a
parking lot of 10 or more spaces that abuts the right-of-way of
any street, road or highway.
(b) A landscaping strip having a minimum width of five feet shall
be located between the abutting right-of-way and the parking
lot.
(c) One tree shall be planted for each 40 linear feet of the
landscaping strip.
(7) Maintenance. The owners and their agents shall be responsible for
providing, protecting and maintaining all landscaping in healthy
and growing condition, replacing it when necessary and keeping it
free of refuse and debris.
A. Uses to be enclosed. All nonresidential uses, except for off-street
parking and loading facilities, service stations, transportation
terminals, storage yards, junkyards, vehicle sales lots and similar uses,
shall be conducted wholly within a completely enclosed building.
B. Unenclosed nonresidential uses. Unenclosed M District uses. All M
District uses which are not conducted wholly within a completely
enclosed building shall be not less than 100 feet distant from any R
District.

C. Special regulations for housing for the elderly.
(1) Maximum density. Increased density for housing for the elderly. In
any R District where housing shall be designed for occupancy by
elderly persons 60 years of age or older, the minimum lot area
required per dwelling unit shall be reduced to permit a maximum
density of 40 dwelling units for elderly persons per net acre.
(2) Off-street parking. Accessory off-street parking required to serve
housing for the elderly shall be provided in an amount of not less
than one space per three elderly dwelling units.
D. Enclosure of porches.
(1) In any new construction, no porch shall extend into any required
yard except open patios and decks as provided under § 260-21D.
(2) Any open patio, deck or porch which has been constructed within
any required yard prior to the date of this chapter shall not be
enclosed, except as follows:
(a) On an interior lot where such porch shall be located in a front
yard and the enclosure of such porch would be on a property
where such enclosure would not extend beyond the front wall
of the building or porch of any adjoining property.
(b) On a corner lot, the same provisions described in this
subsection shall apply. In adding the enclosure of a front porch,
it must also be in accordance with § 260-19D concerning the
clear sight triangle.
(c) The enclosure of a front porch in a required front yard of either
a corner lot or an interior lot shall not be allowed if such

§ 260-31 DANVILLE CODE § 260-31
1:534
be designed to primarily serve the residents of the large-scale
development of which they are a part.
(6) Aesthetic considerations. Due to the potential impact of a largescale
development on the municipality as a whole and since the
developer is provided the opportunity to modify otherwise
minimum development standards, the Zoning Hearing Board may
withhold the overall approval of such projects as well as the
approval of reduced standards pending its review and approval of
the proposed overall design, arrangement and layout of the
buildings to be erected, including the exterior design of such
buildings, to ensure that the architectural character of the largescale
development area will be compatible with that of the
adjoining areas.

within 100 feet of residential districts, fences, walls or year-round
screen planting shall be provided when necessary to shield
adjacent residential districts from parking lot illumination,
headlights, heat, blowing papers and dust and to reduce the visual
encroachments of commercial architecture, signs and activity.
(3) Justification for exception. Where such exceptions are requested,
they shall be granted solely for the purpose of promoting an
integrated site plan no less beneficial to the residents or occupants
of such developments as well as of neighboring properties than
would be obtained under the standard requirements of this chapter.
(4) Planned, integrated shopping centers and industrial parks shall be
subject to the following requirements regardless of the applicant's
request for consideration as a large-scale development:
(a) A tract of not less than three acres is required. [Amended

or any other use, there shall be provided at the time any building or
structure is erected, enlarged, increased in capacity or changed in use
off-street parking space for automobiles available to the occupants of
such buildings or visitors thereto at no charge; provided, however, that
for dwellings in the C-2 District, there shall be provided off-street
parking for each dwelling unit in accordance with this section.

II hereof; provided, further, that in any R District, on any lot having
an area of one acre or less, private garage space may be provided

of a building, structure or premises the use of which is not
specifically mentioned herein, the provisions for a use which is so
mentioned and to which said use is similar, in the opinion of the
Zoning Hearing Board, shall apply.
(3) Off-site facilities. All permitted and required accessory off-street
parking spaces, open or enclosed, shall be located on the same

and construction, there are no existing towers,
telecommunications towers, buildings, structures, elevated
tanks or similar uses able to provide the platform for the
telecommunications antenna; and
(b) Providing evidence, including coverage diagrams and technical
reports, demonstrating that co-location on existing
telecommunications towers is not technically possible in order
to serve the desired need. Co-location is not possible if:

interference with other existing or planned equipment for
the telecommunications tower, and the interference
cannot be prevented at a reasonable cost;
§ 260-37 DANVILLE CODE § 260-37
1:546
[3] Existing or approved telecommunications towers do not
have the space on which planned equipment can be placed
so it can function effectively and at least in parity with
other similar equipment in place or planned; or
[4] Other reasons make it impractical to place the equipment
planned by the applicant on existing and approved
telecommunications towers.
(7) Telecommunications towers shall not be closer than 500 feet to
another telecommunications tower, such distance being measured
as a horizontal from tower to tower.

procedures to be established by the Danville Borough Council,
and agree to share the cost of such arbitration equally with the
other parties desiring space on the subject tower in the event
that the developer and the other parties do not reach an
acceptable settlement within 30 days of notification to the
Borough; and the tower developer shall be responsible for
prompt reporting of an offer within five days thereof.
(11) Except when located on the roof of a building, a security fence, of
approved design, of not less than eight feet, and no greater than 10
feet, shall completely enclose the telecommunications tower. A

property owner(s) submit in writing to the Borough that they
are waiving their right to this landscaping, or the Zoning
Hearing Board may waive this requirement if there is existing
acceptable vegetation along the property lines.
(13) A minimum of two parking spaces shall be required. Spaces shall

citizens of Danville Borough. The findings are based on evidence
concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses on the
community presented in hearings and in reports made available to the
Borough Council, and on findings incorporated in the cases of City of
Renton v. Playtime Theaters, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986), Young v.
American Mini Theaters, 426 U.S. 50 (1976), and Northern Cinema,
Inc., v. Seattle, 585 P. 2d 1153 (Wash. 1978), and in re: appeal of Bucks,

on the findings found in Report of the Attorney General's Working
Group on the Regulation of Sexually Oriented Businesses, June 6, 1989,
State of Minnesota. The June 6, 1989, Report of the Attorney General's
Working Group on the Regulation of Sexually Oriented Businesses from
the State of Minnesota, and the November 1994, City of New York Adult
Entertainment Study, each summarize a number of studies from around
the country as follows:
Minneapolis
The effects of sexually oriented businesses on the crime rate index is
positive.
There is a close association between adult businesses, crime rates,
and low housing values.
St. Paul
A significant correlation exists between the location of adult
businesses and neighborhood deterioration.
Indianapolis
Real estate appraisers overwhelmingly (80%) felt that an adult
bookstore would have a negative effect on residential property
values within one block of the site.
71% believed there would be a detrimental effect on commercial
property values in the one-block radius.
Major crimes such as criminal homicide, rape, robbery, assault,
burglary, and larceny, occurred at a rate 23% higher in areas with
adult businesses.
The sex-related crime rate, including rape, indecent exposure, and
child molestation, was 77% higher in such areas.
Phoenix
Property crimes were 43% higher in areas with adult businesses.
The sex crime rate was 500% higher in those areas.
Whittier, California
Higher occupancy turnover rates were documented in commercial
and residential areas adjacent to adult businesses.
Numerous reports of excessive noise, drunkenness and
pornographic litter associated with adult businesses were identified.
§ 260-42 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 260-42
1:567
The Minnesota Working Group concluded that a comprehensive
approach is required to reduce or eliminate the impacts of sexually
oriented businesses. Zoning and licensing regulations are needed to
protect residents from the intrusion of "combat zone" sexual crime and
harassment into their neighborhoods.1
The New York City study concluded that numerous studies in other
locations found that adult entertainment uses have negative secondary
impacts such as increased crime rates, depreciation of property
values, deterioration of community character and the quality of urban
life.2
Municipalities typically allow adult uses in heavy commercial and
industrial districts. The New York City study reported that:
A study in the Town of Islip, NY formed the basis of zoning
regulations that allow adult uses only in Industrial I Districts by
special exception.
The Indianapolis, Indiana study recommended that adult uses should
be allowed only by special exception in commercial districts oriented
beyond a neighborhood and not within 500 feet of a residential, school,
church, or park property line, or historic area.3
A study conducted by the Manatee County, Florida, Planning and
Development Department recommended that adult uses be limited
to commercial locations at least 500 feet from a residential district
and 2,000 feet from churches, schools, child-care facilities and public
recreation areas.4
This ordinance adopted in 1992 by Jackson, Mississippi, limits topless
bars and other adult businesses to areas zoned for light industrial
uses and requires distances ranging from 250 feet to 1,000 feet from
residential uses and commercial facilities.
Regulations in many Long Island, New York, communities attempt to
protect residential and commercial areas by allowing adult uses only
in low-visibility industrial districts.5
Recent events and alleged criminal activity at an adult business in
a nearby community document that secondary effects of adult
businesses can affect rural areas as well as urban areas (Hip Hop Club,
Hamlin, PA).
The concern over sexually transmitted diseases is a legitimate health
concern of Danville Borough which demands reasonable regulation of
adult businesses and adult uses in order to protect the health and wellbeing
of the citizens.
Certain employees of sexually oriented business regulated by this
ordinance as adult theaters and cabarets engage in higher incidents
of certain types of sexually oriented behavior at these businesses than
employees of other establishments.
§ 260-42 DANVILLE CODE § 260-42
1:568
Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur at
sexually oriented businesses, including adult bookstores, adult novelty
shops, adult video stores, adult motion-picture theaters, or adult
arcades, and especially those which provide private or semiprivate
booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live sex shows. Offering
and providing such space encourages such activities, which create
unhealthy conditions. Numerous studies and reports have determined
that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where
persons view "adult" oriented films.
Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades, and other
sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within
the premises of such sexually oriented businesses. At least 50
communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in
sexually oriented businesses, including, but not limited to, syphilis,
gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (AIDS), genital
herpes, hepatitis B, non B amebiasis, salmonella infections and
shigella infections; and, the incidence of many of these diseases is on
the increase.
Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are
unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are
unhealthy, and, in part, because of the unregulated nature of the
activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the
facilities to self-regulate those activities and maintain those facilities.
Classifying adult businesses as special exception uses is a reasonable
means of accountability to ensure that operators of adult businesses
comply with reasonable regulations and conditions, and to ensure that
operators do not knowingly allow their establishments to be used as
places of illegal sexual activity or solicitation.
There is convincing documented evidence that adult businesses,
because of their very nature, have a deleterious effect on both the
existing businesses around them and the surrounding residential areas
adjacent to them, causing increased crime, the downgrading of
property values, and the decline of the overall character of the
community. A number of municipal studies, including the 1986 Austin,
Texas study, have demonstrated this.
It is generally recognized that adult businesses, due to their nature,
have serious objectionable operational characteristics, particularly
when they are located in close proximity to each other, thereby
contributing to neighborhood blight and downgrading the quality of
life in the adjacent area. A number of municipal studies, including the
1986 Austin, Texas study, have demonstrated this.
The Borough Council desires to minimize and control these adverse
secondary effects and thereby protect the health, safety and welfare
of the citizenry, protect the citizens from increased crime, preserve
the quality of life, preserve property values and the character of the
surrounding community.
§ 260-42 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 260-42
1:569
Based on the zoning principal established by the courts that all
legitimate uses must be permitted somewhere in the community, adult
uses should be permitted. Nevertheless, such uses must be regulated
in terms of time, place and manner. In other words, the location
and outward operation should be regulated, while remaining "content
neutral" in terms of free speech protected by the First Amendment.
Specific standards for setbacks, visibility and signs must be included
to protect adjoining residential, educational and other uses from the
negative secondary impacts of any adult use.

B. Intent. It is the intent of this section to:
(1) Regulate adult business in order to promote the public health,
safety and welfare by minimizing the secondary effects on the
community which are associated with such businesses, and which
include difficulties for law enforcement, trash disposal, deleterious
effects on business and residential property values, increased
crime (particularly the corruption of morals of minors and
prostitution).
(2) Prevent the concentration of regulated uses in order to minimize
the secondary effects of such uses.
(3) Designate a zoning district where adult businesses are permitted,
and establish reasonable, content-neutral standards applicable to
such uses.
(4) Have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or
restriction on the content of any communicative materials
including sexually oriented or adult materials.
(5) Not totally restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented
materials or adult materials protected by the First Amendment of
the Bill of Rights of the U.S. constitution.
(6) Not deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually
oriented entertainment to their intended market.

to encourage any violation of the Pennsylvania Crimes Code or
Pennsylvania Obscenity Code.

provides a suitable area for the development of such uses away from
areas with concentrated residential development.

behalf, and the parties may waive further action by the Board
as provided in Subsection D. The Board may make, alter and
rescind rules and forms for its procedure, consistent with

thereon to the Board prior to final decision or entry of findings, and
the Board's decision shall be entered no later than 30 days after the
report of the hearing officer. Except for challenges filed under
§ 260-56 DANVILLE CODE § 260-56
1:588
Section 916.1 of the PA Municipalities Planning Code, as
amended,230 where the Board fails to render the decision within the
period required by this subsection or fails to commence, conduct
or complete the required hearing as provided in Subsection D(1),
the decision shall be deemed to have been rendered in favor of
the applicant unless the applicant has agreed in writing or on the
record to an extension of time. When a decision has been rendered
in favor of the applicant because of the failure of the Board to
meet or render a decision as hereinabove provided, the Board shall
give public notice of said decision within 10 days from the last
day it could have met to render a decision in the same manner
as provided in Subsection D(1) of this section. If the Board shall
fail to provide such notice, the applicant may do so. Nothing in
this subsection shall prejudice the right of any party opposing
the application to appeal the decision to a court of competent
jurisdiction.

§ 260-56 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 260-56
1:589
(d) Applications for variances from the terms of the Zoning
Ordinance and flood hazard ordinance233 or such provisions
within a land use ordinance, pursuant to Subsection E(2)
hereof.
(e) Applications for special exceptions under the Zoning
Ordinance or floodplain or flood hazard ordinance or such
provisions within a land use ordinance, pursuant to Section
912.1 of Act 247, as amended.234
(f) Appeals from the Zoning Officer's determination under Section
916.2 of Act 247, as amended.235
(g) Appeals from the determination of the Zoning Officer or
Municipal Engineer in the administration of any land use
ordinance or provision thereof with reference to sedimentation
and erosion control and stormwater management insofar as
the same relate to development not involving applications
under Chapter 220, Subdivision and Land Development.
(2) Variances.
(a) The Board shall hear requests for variances where it is alleged
that the provisions of this chapter inflict unnecessary hardship
upon the applicant. The Board may by rule prescribe the form
of application and may require preliminary application to the
Zoning Officer. The Board may grant a variance, provided that
all of the following findings are made where relevant in a given
case:
[1] That there are unique physical circumstances or
conditions, including irregularity, narrowness or
shallowness of lot size or shape, or exceptional
topographical or other physical conditions peculiar to the
particular property and that the unnecessary hardship is
due to such conditions and not the circumstances or
conditions generally created by the provisions of the
Zoning Ordinance in the neighborhood or district in which
the property is located.
[2] That because of such physical circumstances or
conditions, there is no possibility that the property can be
developed in strict conformity with the provisions of the
Zoning Ordinance and that the authorization of a variance
is therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of this
property.
233. Editor's Note: See Ch. 120, Floodplain Management.
234. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10912.1.
235. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10916.2.
§ 260-56 DANVILLE CODE § 260-56
1:590
[3] That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by
the appellant.
[4] That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the
property is located, nor substantially or permanently
impair the appropriate use or development of adjacent
property, nor be detrimental to the public welfare.
[5] That the variance, if authorized, will represent the
minimum variance that will afford relief and will represent
the least modification possible of the regulation in issue.
(b) In granting any variance, the Board may attach such
reasonable conditions and safeguards as it may deem
necessary to implement the purposes of this Zoning Chapter
and Act 247, as amended.236
(c) Upon approval of a variance, the Board shall direct the Zoning
Officer to issue a permit to the applicant, which permit shall
authorize the applicant to proceed with development in
accordance with the terms of the approved variance.
(d) Variance approvals shall be valid a period of one year from the
date of approval. If the proposed development is not completed
within one year of approval, the applicant shall submit a new
application for a variance and shall require approval thereof.
Exception: If the proposed development is subject to additional
approvals such as planning, engineering or other regulatory
requirements, the variance shall remain valid, provided
progress related to the project has not ceased for more than
180 consecutive days. [Amended 8-11-2015 by Ord. No.
529]
(3) Special exceptions.
(a) Board action. Special exceptions, as enumerated in Article IV,
shall be permitted only upon authorization by the Zoning
Hearing Board. The Board may refer such applications to the
Planning Commission for its review and recommendations. The
Board shall hear and decide requests for special exceptions in
accordance with the standards and criteria set forth herein. In
granting a special exception, the Board may attach such
reasonable conditions and safeguards, in addition to those
expressed in this chapter, as it may deem necessary to
implement the purposes of this Zoning Ordinance and Act 247,
as amended.237
236. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10101 et seq.
237. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10101 et seq.
§ 260-56 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 260-56
1:591
(b) Review criteria. Approval of special exceptions shall be
authorized only if they are found to comply with the following
requirements and other applicable requirements as set forth in
this chapter.
[1] That the use is a permitted special exception as set forth in
Article IV hereof.
[2] That the use is so designed, located and proposed to be
operated that the public health, safety, welfare and
convenience will be protected.
[3] That the use will not cause substantial injury to the value
of other property in the neighborhood where it is to be
located.
[4] That the use shall be compatible with adjoining
development and the character of the zone district where
it is proposed to be located.
[5] That adequate landscaping and screening is provided as
required in § 260-25 and as otherwise provided herein.
[6] That adequate off-street parking and loading is provided
and ingress and egress is so designed as to cause
minimum interference with traffic on abutting streets.
[7] That the use conforms with all applicable regulations
governing the district where located, except as may
otherwise be determined for large-scale development.
(c) Special exceptions: affect of filing an application. When an
application for a special exception has been filed with the
Zoning Hearing Board and the subject matter of such
application would ultimately constitute either a "land
development" as defined in Section 107 or a "subdivision" as
defined in Section 107 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities
Planning Code, Act 247, as amended,238 no change or
amendment of the zoning, subdivision or other governing
ordinance or plans shall affect the decision on such application
adversely to the applicant and the applicant shall be entitled to
a decision in accordance with the provisions of the governing
ordinances or plans as they stood at the time the application
was duly filed; provided, further, that should such an
application be approved by the Zoning Hearing Board, the
applicant shall be entitled to proceed with the submission of
either land development or subdivision plans within a period of
six months or longer or as may be approved by the Zoning
Hearing Board following the date of such approval in
accordance with the provisions of the governing ordinance or
238. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10107.
§ 260-56 DANVILLE CODE § 260-56
1:592
plans as they stood at the time the application was duly filed
before the Zoning Hearing Board. If either a land development
or subdivision plan is so filed within said period, such plan
shall be subject to the provisions of Section 508(1) through (4)
of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, Act 247, as
amended,239 and specifically to the time limitations of Section
508(4)240 which shall commence as of the date of filing such
land development or subdivision plan.
F. Parties appellant before the Board. Appeals under Section 909.1(a)(1),
(3), (4), (7), (8) and (9) of Act 247, as amended, 241 may be filed with the
Board in writing by the landowner affected, any officer or agency of the
municipality or any person aggrieved. Requests for a variance under
Section 910.2 of Act 247, as amended,242 and for special exception
under Section 912.1 of Act 247, as amended,243 may be filed with the
Board by any landowner or any tenant with the permission of such
landowner.244
G. Time limitations.
(1) Filing proceedings with the Board. No person shall be allowed to
file any proceeding with the Board later than 30 days after an
application for development, preliminary or final, has been
approved by an appropriate municipal officer, agency or body if
such proceeding is designed to secure reversal or to limit the
approval in any manner unless such person alleges and proves that
he had no notice, knowledge or reason to believe that such
approval had been given. If such person has succeeded to his
interest after such approval, he shall be bound by the knowledge of
his predecessor in interest. The failure of anyone other than the
landowner to appeal from an adverse decision on a tentative plan
pursuant to Section 709 of Act 247, as amended,245 or from an
adverse decision by a Zoning Officer on a challenge to the validity
of this chapter pursuant to Section 916.2 of Act 247, as
amended,246 shall preclude an appeal from a final approval except
in the case where the final submission substantially deviates from
the approved tentative approval.
(2) Appeals from adverse determinations. All appeals from
determinations adverse to the landowner shall be filed by the
landowner within 30 days after notice of the determination is
issued.

H. Stay of proceedings.
(1) Upon filing of any proceeding referred to in Section 913.3 of Act
247, as amended,247 and during its pendency before the Board, all
land development pursuant to any challenged ordinance, order or
approval of the Zoning Officer or of any agency or body, and all
official action thereunder, shall be stayed unless the Zoning Officer
or any other appropriate agency or body certifies to the Board facts
indicating that such stay would cause imminent peril to life or
property, in which case the development or official action shall not
be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order, which may be
granted by the Board or by the court having jurisdiction of zoning
appeals, on petition, after notice to the Zoning Officer or other
appropriate agency or body. When an application for development,
preliminary or final, has been duly approved and proceedings
designed to reverse or limit the approval are filed with the Board by
persons other than the applicant, the applicant may petition the
court having jurisdiction of zoning appeals to order such persons to
post bond as a condition to continuing the proceeding before the
Board.
(2) After the petition is presented, the court shall hold a hearing to
determine if the filing of the appeal is frivolous. At the hearing,
evidence may be presented on the merits of the case. It shall be the
burden of the applicant for a bond to prove the appeal is frivolous.
After consideration of all evidence presented, if the court
determines that the appeal is frivolous, it shall grant the petition
for a bond. The right to petition the court to order the appellants to
post bond may be waived by the appellee, but such waiver may be
revoked by him if an appeal is taken from a final decision of the
court.
(3) The question whether or not such petition should be granted and
the amount of the bond shall be within the sound discretion of the
court. An order denying a petition for bond shall be interlocutory.
An order directing the responding party to post a bond shall be
interlocutory.
(4) If an appeal is taken by a respondent to the petition for a bond from
an order of the court dismissing a zoning appeal for refusal to post
a bond and the appellate court sustains the order of the court below
to post a bond, the respondent to the petition for a bond, upon
motion of the petitioner and after hearing in the court having
jurisdiction of zoning appeals, shall be liable for all reasonable
costs, expenses and attorney fees incurred by the petitioner.
I. General grant of power. The Zoning Hearing Board shall perform all the
duties and have all the powers prescribed by the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code and as herein more particularly provided.

(1) The Zoning Officer shall administer the Zoning Ordinance in
accordance with its literal terms and shall not have the power to

conform to this chapter. He is authorized to institute civil
enforcement proceedings as a means of enforcing the regulations
of this chapter for which he has designated responsibilities. He
shall examine all applications for permits, issue permits for the
construction, alteration, enlargement and occupancy of all uses
which are in accordance with the requirements of this chapter and
all nonconforming uses, record and file all applications for permits
with accompanying plans and documents and make such reports to
the Planning Commission and the Zoning Hearing Board as may be
required.
(2) Zoning permits for a variance from the requirements of this
chapter and for such special exceptions as may be enumerated in
Article IV hereof shall be issued only upon written order of the
Zoning Hearing Board.

Article IV hereof shall be issued only upon written order of the
governing body. [Added 5-5-2009 by Ord. No. 496]

in the manner set forth in this chapter and as otherwise prescribed by
the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code.
F. Qualifications of the Zoning Officer. The Zoning Officer shall be able to
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the local governing body a working
knowledge of municipal zoning.
G. Registration of nonconforming uses and structures. The Zoning Officer
may identify and register nonconforming uses and structures and shall
identify the reasons for their identification as nonconformances.
H. Issuance of preliminary opinion. In order not to unreasonably delay the
time when a landowner may secure assurance that the ordinance or
map under which he proposes to build is free from challenge, and
§ 260-59 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 260-59
1:597
§ 260-60. Zoning permits; conditional use permits.
recognizing that the procedure for preliminary approval of his
development may be too cumbersome or may be unavailable, the
landowner may advance the date from which time for any challenge
to the ordinance or map will run under Section 914.1 of Act 247, as
amended,252 by the following procedure:
(1) The landowner may submit plans and other materials describing
his proposed use or development to the Zoning Officer for a
preliminary opinion as to their compliance with the applicable
ordinances and maps. Such plans and other materials shall not be
required to meet the standards prescribed for preliminary,
tentative or final approval or for the issuance of a building permit
so long as they provide reasonable notice of the proposed use or
development and a sufficient basis for a preliminary opinion as to
its compliance.
(2) If the Zoning Officer's preliminary opinion is that the use or
development complies with the ordinance or map, notice thereof
shall be published once each week for two successive weeks in a
newspaper of general circulation in the municipality. Such notice
shall include a general description of the proposed use or
development and its location, by some readily identifiable directive,
and the place and times where the plans and other materials may
be examined by the public. The favorable preliminary approval
under Section 914.1 of Act 247, as amended,253 and the time
therein specified for commencing a proceeding with the Board
shall run from the time when the second notice thereof has been
published.
A. Purpose: to determine compliance with the provisions of this chapter.
No person shall erect, alter or convert any structure or building or part
thereof, nor alter the use of any land, subsequent to the adoption of this
chapter, until a zoning permit has been issued by the Zoning Officer.
B. Application for permits. All such applications shall be accompanied by
plans, in duplicate, drawn to scale, showing the actual shape and
dimensions of the lot or lots to be built upon, its assessment map and
parcel number as recorded, the date of official record of any lot or lots
on which construction is proposed, the exact size and location of any
building, sign, parking or loading area or other physical feature existing
or proposed on the lot, the existing and intended use of each building or
part of a building, the number of families, dwelling units, employees,
offices or other appropriate units of occupancy which the building is
designed to accommodate and such other information as may be
necessary to determine compliance with this chapter. One copy of such
plans shall be returned to the owner when such plans shall be
252. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10914.1.
253. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10914.1.

1:598
approved; one copy each of all applications with accompanying plans
and documents shall become a public record after a permit is issued or
denied.
C. Issuance of permits.
(1) It shall be the duty of the Zoning Officer to issue a zoning permit,
provided that he is satisfied that the structure, building, sign,
parking area of premises and the proposed use thereof conform
with all requirements of this chapter and that all other reviews and
actions, if any, called for in this chapter have been complied with
and all necessary approvals secured thereof.
(2) All zoning permits shall be issued in duplicate, and one copy shall
be kept conspicuously on the premises affected and protected from
the weather whenever construction work is being performed
thereon. No owner, contractor, workman or other person shall
perform any building operations regulated by this chapter of any
kind unless a zoning permit covering such operation has been
displayed as required by this chapter, nor shall they perform such
building operations after notification of the revocation of said
zoning permit.
D. Denial of permits. When the Zoning Officer is not satisfied that the
applicant's proposed development will meet the requirements of this
chapter, he shall refuse to issue a zoning permit and the applicant may
appeal to the Zoning Hearing Board for a reversal of the Zoning
Officer's decision.
E. Revocation of permits.
(1) If it shall appear at any time to the Zoning Officer that the
application or accompanying plans are in any material respect false
or misleading or that work is being done upon the premises
differing materially from that called for in the applications filed
with him under existing laws or ordinances, he may forthwith
revoke the zoning permit, whereupon it shall be the duty of the
person holding the same to surrender it and all copies thereof to
said Zoning Officer. After the zoning permit has been revoked, the
Zoning Officer may, in his discretion, before issuing a new zoning
permit, require the applicant to file an indemnity bond in favor of
the municipality with sufficient surety conditioned for compliance
with this chapter and all building laws and ordinances then in force
and in a sum sufficient to cover the cost of removing the building if
it does not so comply.
(2) Any development authorized by a zoning permit shall be completed
within a period of one year of the date of such permit. If such
development is not completed within one year, the zoning permit
shall be automatically revoked, and any future development of the
subject project shall require a new application and the issuance of
a new permit.

1:599
F. Conditional use permits. [Added 5-5-2009 by Ord. No. 496]
(1) Procedure. Conditional uses shall be allowed only upon a
determination by the governing body that they comply with the
standards and criteria set forth herein. The governing body shall
hold hearings on and decide requests for conditional uses in
accordance with the standards and criteria set forth herein. The
hearing shall be conducted by the governing body or the governing
body may appoint any member or an independent attorney as a
hearing officer. The decision shall be made by the governing body.
However, the applicant, in addition to the municipality, may, prior
to the decision of the hearing, waive decision by the governing
body and accept the decision of the hearing officer as final. In
granting a conditional use, the governing body may attach such
reasonable conditions and safeguards, in addition to those
expressed in this chapter, as it may deem necessary to implement
the purposes of this chapter.
(2) Timing.
(a) The governing body shall render a written decision on the
conditional use application within 45 days after the last
hearing before the governing body. Where the application is
contested or denied, each decision shall be accompanied by
findings of fact or conclusions based thereon, together with
any reasons therefor. Conclusions based on any provisions of
any ordinance, rule or regulation shall contain a reference to
the provision relied on and the reasons why the conclusion is
deemed appropriate in the light of the facts found.
(b) Where the governing body fails to render the decision within
the period required by this subsection or fails to commence,
conduct or complete the required hearing as provided in
Section 908(1.2) of the MPC,254 the decision shall be deemed to
have been rendered in favor of the applicant unless the
applicant has agreed in writing or on the record to an
extension of time. When a decision has been rendered in favor
of the applicant because of the failure of the governing body to
meet or render a decision as hereinabove provided, the
governing body shall give public notice of the decision within
10 days from the last day it could have met to render a
decision. If the governing body shall fail to provide such notice,
the applicant may do so.
(c) Nothing in this subsection shall prejudice the right of any party
opposing the application to appeal the decision to a court of
competent jurisdiction. A copy of the final decision shall be
delivered to the applicant personally or mailed to him no later
than the day following its date.

(3) Additional requirements. The governing body may, upon a review of
the application including the environmental assessment, establish
such additional requirements for the development and the
operation of the conditional use as may be required to protect the
public health, safety and general welfare of the community;
provided, however, that such additional requirements shall not be
related to off-site transportation or road improvements.
(4) Administrative procedures.
(a) Application. Application for a conditional use shall be made
directly to the governing body. Applications shall be in
accordance with Subsection B hereof and as otherwise
specified herein. All such applications shall be referred to the
Planning Commission for review; and, no such application shall
be finally authorized until the Planning Commission has
submitted its review findings, or until 30 days after referral to
the Planning Commission, whichever occurs first.
(b) Hearing. No conditional use shall be authorized without a
hearing thereon. Hearings shall be conducted pursuant to
§ 260-56D hereof; provided, however, that such hearings shall
be conducted by the governing body.
(5) Standards and criteria for conditional uses.
(a) General criteria.
[1] That the use is so designed, located and proposed to be
operated that the public health, safety, welfare and
convenience will be protected.

of other property in the neighborhood where it is to be
located.
[3] That the use shall be compatible with adjoining
development.
[4] That adequate landscaping and screening is provided as
required in § 260-25 and as otherwise provided herein.

applications for conditional uses in accordance with
§ 260-60F(7) hereof.255

1:601
(6) Standards.
(a) Traffic. The proposed development shall not be located on a
site where primary access to the site is from a minor street
designed primarily to provide vehicular access to abutting

which will not be injurious to the safe and convenient flow of
vehicular traffic. A traffic plan with estimates of the number of
vehicles shall be submitted to the Borough.
(b) Performance standards. The proposed development will
comply with the performance standards specified in Article VII
hereof and such additional performance standards that shall
be specified by the governing body to protect the health, safety
and welfare of the Borough.
(c) Permits. There shall be provided evidence of all required local,
state and federal permits.
(d) Distance from existing development. No conditional use shall
be nearer to existing development than 1,000 feet or such
greater distance as may be required to assure the health,
safety and welfare of the community, or any lesser distance
specified in this chapter.
(e) Transfer of products and waste. Vehicles used in the transfer of
waste shall be designed to preclude the accidental dumping of
any part of such wastes while in transit; and, transportation
routes shall be designed to minimize traversing densely
populated areas except for waste pickups.
(7) Environmental assessment.
(a) General. All applications for a conditional use must be
accompanied by an environmental assessment as specified
herein; provided, however, that upon the request of the
developer, components of the environmental assessment may
be waived by the governing body when such components are
deemed unnecessary for certain conditional uses.
(b) Purpose. The purpose of the environmental assessment is to
provide the governing body with sufficient information to
determine if the proposed use will be harmful or beneficial to
the Borough; and to determine corrective actions if needed to
mitigate potential adverse environmental impacts.
(c) Assurances. Due to the importance of securing professional,
objective data in the Environmental Assessment, the selection
of the professionals to be engaged in its preparation shall be
subject to the approval of the governing body. The developer
255. Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I).
§ 260-60 DANVILLE CODE § 260-60
1:602
will further provide the governing body with assurances,
adequate to protect the Borough from violations of
noncompliance with measures required to mitigate identified
adverse environmental impacts.
(8) Content of the environmental assessment.
(a) Description of the proposal. Describe the proposed or
recommended actions, its purpose, where it is to be located,
when it is proposed to take place, and its interrelationship with
other projects or proposals, including information and
technical data sufficient to permit assessment of
environmental impact by the Borough.
(b) Description of the environment. Include a comprehensive
description of the existing environment without the proposal
and the probable future environment with the proposal. This
description should focus both on the environmental details
most likely to be affected by the proposal and on the broader
regional aspects of the environment, including ecological
interrelationships. Particular attention should be given to the
potential effects of past or present use of the site as a
repository for toxic or hazardous wastes.
(c) The environmental impact of the proposed activities. Describe
the environmental impacts of the proposed action. These
impacts are defined as direct or indirect changes in the
existing environment, both beneficial or detrimental.
Whenever possible, these impacts should be quantified. This
discussion should include the impact not only upon the natural
environment but upon land use as well. Provide separate
discussion for such potential impacts as man-caused accidents
and natural catastrophes and their probabilities and risks.
Specific mention should also be made of unknown or partially
understood impacts.
(d) Mitigating measures included in the proposed action. Include a
description of measures which are proposed to be taken or
which are required to be taken to enhance, protect, or mitigate
impacts upon the environment, including any associated
research or monitoring.
(e) Any adverse effects which cannot be avoided should the
proposal be implemented. Include a discussion of the
unavoidable adverse impacts described in § 260-60F(8)(c) and
(d) above, and an analysis of who or what will be affected and
the degree of impact.
(f) The relationship between local short-term use of man's
environment and the maintenance and enhancement of longterm
productivity. Describe the local short-term use of the
environment involved in the proposed action in relation to its
§ 260-60 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 260-60
1:603
cumulative and long-term impacts and give special attention
to its relationship to trends of similar actions which would
significantly affect ecological interrelationships or pose longterm
risk to health or safety. Short-term and long-term do
not refer to any fixed time period, but should be viewed in
terms of the various significant ecological and geophysical
consequences of the proposed action.
(g) Any irreversible and irretrievable commitments of resources
which would be involved in the proposed action should it be
implemented. Describe, and quantify where possible, any
irrevocable uses of resources, including such things as
resource extraction, erosion, destruction of archaeological or
historical sites, elimination of endangered species' habitat, and
significant changes in land use.

incurred by the municipality as a result thereof. No judgment shall
commence or be imposed, levied or be payable until the date of the
determination of a violation by the Magisterial District Judge. If the
defendant neither pays nor timely appeals the judgment, the
municipality may enforce the judgment pursuant to the applicable
rules of civil procedure. Each day that a violation continues shall
constitute a separate violation, unless the Magisterial District
Judge, determining that there has been a violation, further
determines that there was a good-faith basis for the person,
partnership or corporation violating this chapter to have believed
that there was no such violation, in which event there shall be
deemed to have been only one such violation until the fifth day
following the date of the determination of a violation by the
Magisterial District Judge, and thereafter, each day that a violation
continues shall constitute a separate violation. All judgments, costs
and reasonable attorney fees collected for the violation of zoning

applications for rehearings on appeals and applications; provided,
however, that for any development, such as a parking lot which is
not subject to Chapter 220, Subdivision and Land Development, but
which requires engineering, the application shall be accompanied
by an additional fee which shall be considered to be a deposit
against the cost of such Borough engineering services. In the event
that such costs shall exceed the amount of the deposit, the
applicant shall be responsible for the payment of such additional
costs; and if said costs are less than the amount of the deposit, the
unused funds shall be returned to the applicant.
B. Fees are intended to cover the costs of advertising and other costs of
administering applications requiring Board action, including but not
limited to stenographic recordings of proceedings. In the event that
actual costs are less than the fee paid with the application, the Borough
shall refund surplus payments in excess of $25.

they shall be held to the minimum requirements for the promotion of the
health, safety morals and general welfare. It is not intended to interfere
with or abrogate or annul other rules, regulations or ordinances, provided
that where this chapter imposes greater restrictions upon the use of
buildings or premises or upon the height or bulk of a building or requires
larger open spaces, the provisions of this chapter shall control; provided,
however, that the regulations and restrictions contained in this chapter
shall not apply to that portion of the Borough of Danville encompassed
within the boundaries of the Danville Flood Urban Renewal Area, as
designated on the Zoning Map of the Borough of Danville, in those instances
where the provisions of this chapter are in conflict with the specific
provisions of the Urban Renewal Plan and Redevelopment Proposal, dated
February 1973, for the Danville Flood Urban Renewal Area, Project No.
PA 641(a); and provided, further, that the preceding exemption shall be
in effect for the duration of the controls of said Urban Renewal Plan and
Redevelopment Proposal.
§ 260-67. Exemptions.
This chapter shall not apply to any existing or proposed building or
extension thereof used or to be used by a public utility corporation if, upon
