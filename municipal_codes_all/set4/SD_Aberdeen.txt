PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Aberdeen, South Dakota. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 2003 Code, as supplemented through November 3, 2008, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 2003 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves that stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Sandra S. Fox, Code Attorney, and Deborah J. Heath, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Karl Alberts, Finance Officer; Adam Altman, City Attorney; and Mary Campton, Compliance and Records Specialist, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Sec. 2-1. - Governmental authority of city vested in council.

Sec. 2-2. - Conflicts of interest. 
(a)  No elected city official may participate in discussing or vote on any issue in which the official has a conflict of interest, nor may any appointed official take or recommend action the result of which is a conflict of interest. Each official shall decide if any potential conflict of interest requires such official to be disqualified from participating in discussion, voting, action, or recommendation. However, no such official may participate in discussing, voting, acting, or recommending action on an issue if the following circumstances apply: 
(1)  The official has a direct pecuniary interest in the matter before the governing body; or 
(2)  At least two-thirds of the governing body votes that an official has an identifiable conflict of interest that should prohibit such official from voting on a specific matter. 
(b)  If an elected official with a direct pecuniary interest participates in discussion or votes on a matter before the governing body, the legal sole remedy is to invalidate that official's vote.

Sec. 2-4. - Decision making by elected or appointed city officers. 
(a)  An elected or appointed city officer may receive and consider relevant information from any source to perform the duties of his or her office. The city officer may rely on his or her own experience and background on any official matters, subject to the applicable law and rule concerning recusal and disqualification of a public officer. 
(b)  Any public hearing or meeting conducted by the city officer regarding any proposed ordinance, resolution, or regulation on any subject is legislative in nature and may be conducted informally to the extent the officer deems necessary to secure public comment on matters of public interest. The formal rules of procedure and evidence do not apply to the conduct of the public hearing or meeting. This provision does not abrogate any open meeting requirements under South Dakota law. 
(c)  "Quasi-judicial function" means an adjudicatory function exercised by a council, board, committee, or department involving the exercise of judgment and discretion in making determinations in controversies. The term includes the functions of interpreting, applying, and enforcing existing rules and laws; granting or denying privileges, rights, or benefits; issuing, suspending, or revoking licenses, permits and certificates; determining rights and interests of adverse parties; evaluating and passing on facts; awarding compensation; fixing prices; ordering action or abatement of action; holding hearings; adopting procedural rules or performing any other act necessary to effect the performance of a quasi-judicial function 
(d)  Any public hearing or meeting conducted by the city officer regarding a quasi-judicial function may be conducted informally to secure the information required to make a decision. The formal rules of procedure and evidence do not apply to the conduct of the public hearing or meeting. If the city officer relies upon any evidence not produced at a public hearing or meeting, the officer shall disclose the evidence publicly and include the information in the public record to afford all parties an opportunity to respond or participate. Failure to make this disclosure may be grounds for the city officer's disqualification for that particular decision, pursuant to the grounds for disqualification in subsection 5 of this section. 
(e)  The city officer may receive input from the public, directly or indirectly, about any matter of public interest. Such contact alone does not require the officer to recuse himself or herself from serving as a quasi-judicial officer in another capacity. The officer is presumed to be objective and capable of making decisions fairly on the basis of the officer's circumstances and may rely on the officer's own general experience and background. An officer's authority, statements, or act ions regarding an issue or a party involved which clearly and convincingly demonstrates prejudice or unacceptable risk of bias may disqualify the officer in a quasi-judicial proceeding.

No permit presuming to give authority to violate or cancel the provisions of this Code shall be valid, except insofar as the work or use which it authorizes is lawful. 
(3)  The issuance or granting of a permit or approval of plans shall not prevent the administrative authority from thereafter requiring the correction of errors in the plans and specifications or from preventing construction operations being carried on thereafter when in violation of this division or of any other ordinance or from revoking any certificate of approval when issued in error.

DIVISION 5. - BOARD OF ETHICS 

Sec. 2-381. - Board of ethics created. 
    There is hereby created a board which shall be known as the board of ethics. The board of ethics shall uphold the conflicts of interest policy adopted by the city council, as amended from time to time, which policy shall be filed in the office of the city finance officer. 
(Ord. No. 17-04-05, 5-24-2017) 
Sec. 2-382. - Qualifications. 
    No member of the board of ethics may be an officer or employee of the city or any other governmental unit of the city, or hold any political party office, or be in a contractual relationship with the city, or receive compensation for services from the city. No member of the board may endorse or engage in any political or campaign activity on behalf of any candidate for city office. 
(Ord. No. 17-04-05, 5-24-2017) 
Sec. 2-383. - Composition; appointment; term; compensation of members. 
    The board of ethics shall consist of five members to be appointed by the mayor and ratified by the city council. Initially, one member shall be appointed to hold office for two years, two for three years, and two for four years. Thereafter, at the first regular meeting of the city council in July of each year, one member or two members, as the case may be, shall be appointed for a term of four years to succeed the retiring member. No member is eligible for reappointment after having served two four-year terms. No member of the board of ethics shall receive a salary. Members may be reimbursed for expenses in accordance with city policy or as approved by the city council. 
(Ord. No. 17-04-05, 5-24-2017) 
Sec. 2-384. - Chairperson; meetings; quorum. 
(a)  The board of ethics shall annually select a chairperson from its members. 
(b)  The board of ethics must give advance notice to the public of all meetings in accordance with state law. The board of ethics may meet in executive session pursuant to state law. The board of ethics shall meet at least annually. 
(c)  Three members of the board of ethics shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business coming before it. 
(Ord. No. 17-04-05, 5-24-2017) 
Sec. 2-385. - Complaints. 
(a)  Any person who is a resident of the city or is doing or attempting to do business with the city may file a complaint with the board of ethics. The complaint shall be in writing, signed, and dated, and include an address and telephone number. All complaints shall be sworn or affirmed before a person authorized to administer oaths and affirmations and filed with the office of the city attorney, except that a complaint against the city attorney shall be filed with the mayor or city manager. Complaints shall describe in detail the act or acts complained of and the specific sections of the conflicts of interest policy that have been allegedly violated. 
(b)  All complaints, and any subsequent filings and proceedings before the board of ethics, shall remain confidential unless the accused elects to make the complaint public or unless the board has issued its report. If the board determines that the complainant (the person who filed the complaint) has violated any confidentiality provisions under the conflicts of interest policy, then the board may immediately dismiss the complaint. Dismissal under this section does not affect the right of the board or any person other than the complainant to initiate a complaint based on the same factual allegations. 
(c)  After an initial review of the complaint, the board of ethics may dismiss any complaint that it finds to be frivolous. A frivolous complaint is one which lacks a rational basis in fact or law. No investigation is required if the board determines that a complaint is frivolous on its face, illegible, too indefinite, does not identify the accused, is unsigned, or is not verified by an oath or affirmation. Any person who files a frivolous complaint with the board shall be civilly liable to the person charged for all costs incurred in defending the charge, including but not limited to costs and attorney's fees. In determining if a complaint is frivolous, the board may consider the following: 
(1)  The timing of the complaint with respect to when the facts supporting the alleged violation became known to the complainant, and with respect to the date of any pending election in which the accused is a candidate or is otherwise involved with that election in any manner, if any; 
(2)  The nature and type of publicity surrounding the filing of the complaint, and the degree of participation by the complainant in publicizing the fact that a complaint was filed with the board; 
(3)  The existence and nature of any relationship between the accused and the complainant before the complaint was filed; 
(4)  If the accused is a candidate for election to office, the existence and nature of any relationship between the complainant and any candidate or group opposing the accused; 
(5)  Any evidence that the complainant knew or reasonably should have known that the allegations in the complaint were groundless; and 
(6)  Any evidence of the complainant's motives in filing the complaint. 
(Ord. No. 17-04-05, 5-24-2017) 
Sec. 2-386. - Powers and duties of the board of ethics.

(b)  The city attorney shall serve as legal counsel to the board of ethics unless a complaint involves a current or former city council member or the city attorney. For a complaint involving a current or former council member or the city attorney, the board shall consult only with outside legal counsel of its own choosing as needed who is not otherwise employed by the city. 
(c)  The board of ethics may appoint an individual to act as its investigator. The individual serving as the investigator for the board shall be an employee of the city police department who is trained in investigatory techniques and shall keep confidential all information received. If a member of the city police department is a complaining party, the accused person, or is a material witness to the investigation, then the board shall appoint and consult with an outside investigator as needed.

An appropriation ordinance making appropriations by department or major organizational unit and authorizing a single appropriation for each program or activity; shall, no later than its first regular meeting in September of the year or within ten days thereafter, introduce the annual appropriation ordinance for the ensuing fiscal year, in which it shall appropriate the sums of money necessary to meet all lawful expenses and liabilities of the city. The ordinance shall specify the function and subfunction as prescribed by the department of legislative audit for which the appropriations are made and the amount appropriated from the proper fund. It is not necessary to appropriate revenue to be expended from an enterprise or trust and agency fund if the fund is not supported or subsidized by revenue derived from the general fund. However, an annual budget for these funds shall be developed and published no later than December 31 of each year; 
(2)  Tax levies and rates. A tax levy ordinance authorizing the property tax levy and setting the tax rates; and 
(3)  Other ordinances. Any other ordinances required to authorize new revenues or to amend the rates or other features of existing taxes or other revenue sources. 
Sec. 2-412. - Amendments after adoption. 
(a)  Supplemental appropriations. If during the fiscal year the city manager certifies that there are available for appropriation revenues in excess of those estimated in the budget, the city council by ordinance may make supplemental appropriations for the year up to the amount of such excess. 
(b)  Emergency appropriations. To meet a public emergency affecting life, health, property or the public peace, the city council may make emergency appropriations. Such appropriations may be made by emergency ordinance in accordance with the provisions of Charter § 2.14. To the extent that there are no available unappropriated revenues or a sufficient fund balance to meet such appropriations, the council may by emergency ordinance authorize the issuance of emergency notes, which may be renewed from time to time, but the emergency notes and renewals of any fiscal year shall be paid not later than the last day of the fiscal year next succeeding that in which the emergency appropriation was made. 
(c)  Reduction of appropriations. If at any time during the fiscal year it appears probable to the city manager/mayor that the revenues or fund balances available will be insufficient to finance the expenditures for which appropriations have been authorized, the manager/mayor shall report to the city council without delay, indicating the estimated amount of the deficit, any remedial action taken by the city manager and recommendations as to any other steps to be taken. The council shall then take such further action as it deems necessary to prevent or reduce any deficit and for that purpose it may by ordinance reduce one or more appropriations. 
(d)  Transfer of appropriations. At any time during the fiscal year the city council may by resolution transfer part or all of the unencumbered appropriation balance from one department or major organizational units. The city manager may transfer part or all of any unencumbered appropriation balances among programs within a department or organizational unit and shall report such transfers to the council in writing in a timely manner.

    The city council shall provide by ordinance the procedures for administering the budget.

Any authorization of payment incurring an obligation in violation of the provisions of the Charter or applicable state law shall be void and any payment so made illegal. A violation of this provision shall be cause for removal of any officer who knowingly authorized or made such payment or incurred such obligation. Such officer may also be liable to the city for any amount so paid. Except where prohibited by law, however, nothing in the Charter shall be construed to prevent the making or authorizing of payments or making of contracts for capital improvements to be financed wholly or partly by the issuance of bonds or to prevent the making of any contract or lease providing for payments beyond the end of the fiscal year, but only if such action is made or approved by ordinance. 
Sec. 2-416. - Capital program.

(2)  Availability of funds; 
(3)  Changes required by the city council; or 
(4)  Changes in the capital program itself.

Pursuant to 16 CFR 681.1, the purpose of this article is also to establish a process by which the city will be able to form a reasonable belief that a consumer report relates to the consumer about whom it has requested a consumer credit report when the city has received a notice of address discrepancy. 
(b)  This article may be referred to as the city's identity theft prevention program or ITPP. 
Sec. 2-459. - Definitions.

(1)  An account that a creditor offers or maintains, primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, that involves or is designed to permit multiple payments or transactions, such as a credit card account, mortgage loan, automobile loan, margin account, cell phone account, utility account, checking account, or savings account; and 
(2)  Any other account that the creditor offers or maintains for which there is a reasonably foreseeable risk to customers or to the safety and soundness of the creditor from identity theft, including financial, operational, compliance, reputation, or litigation risks. 
    Credit means the right granted by a creditor to a debtor to defer payment of debt or to incur debts and defer its payment or to purchase property or services and defer payment therefor. 
    Creditor means any person or entity who regularly extends, renews, or continues credit; any person who regularly arranges for the extension, renewal, or continuation of credit; or any assignee of an original creditor who participates in the decision to extend, renew, or continue credit and includes utility companies and telecommunications companies. For the purposes of this article, the city is a creditor. 
    Customer means a person that has a covered account with a creditor.

The applicant shall also provide any other information necessary for the department providing the service for which the covered account is created. The information shall be entered directly into the city's records system and held in a secure storage area with access limited to those city personnel with the need to know. 
(b)  For each customer account for which the city may now or hereafter provide individual customer access to the customer's account information, such account shall be assigned an account number and personal identification number (PIN) which shall be unique to that account.

Sec. 2-465. - Credit card payments. 
(a)  In the event that credit card payments that are made over the Internet are processed through a third-party service provider, such third-party service provider shall certify that it has an adequate identity theft prevention program in place that is applicable to such payments.

(c)  Time to appeal. Appeals shall be commenced within 15 days of the administrative action or decision by delivering a written notice of appeal with the responsible official or department director either in person or postmarked within 15 days of notification of the action or decision. Such delivery shall be deemed the date of filing of the appeal.

If either party requests a hearing to be closed to the public, the party requesting the closed hearing must present good cause to the hearing examiner that the public interest in having an open hearing is outweighed by the privacy interest involved in a particular case or that a closed hearing is legally required due to the sensitive nature of the evidence to be presented at the hearing;

(7)  The signature of the appellant, the appellant's representative, or the appellant's corporate agent.

Any appellant who is financially unable to pay the processing fee may file a request for a hardship waiver in lieu of the processing fee. 
(2)  Hardship waiver. A request for hardship waiver must be filed simultaneously with the filing of the notice of appeal and include the sworn affidavit of the appellant, together with any supporting documents, demonstrating to the satisfaction of the independent hearing examiner the appellant's financial inability to deposit with the city the full amount of the processing fee.

The hearing examiner shall issue a written order granting or denying a hardship waiver. The order of the independent hearing examiner regarding the hardship waiver shall be mailed by first class mail to the appellant, the appellant's representative, or the appellant's corporate agent.

Failure to comply with any of these subsections shall be deemed to waive the right to an appeal. A waiver of the right to an appeal may be determined by the city attorney prior to assignment of the appeal to a hearing examiner or by the hearing examiner at any time during the proceeding. A determination that the appellant waived the right to an appeal shall be the final decision. 
(g)  Stay pending appeal. If the appellant complies with the jurisdictional prerequisites for an appeal, then the city will take no further action to enforce the fine, penalty, or result until the hearing examiner renders a final decision. The provisions for prior notice and hearing may be dispensed with when, in the opinion of the city manager or department director, immediate action is necessary to summarily abate a dangerous condition on public or private property, there is an imminent threat to life or safety on public or private property, or there is an imminent threat to essential governmental services, such as utilities.

    Full-service restaurant means any restaurant at which a waiter or waitress delivers food and drink offered from a printed food menu to patrons at tables, booths, or the bar. Any restaurant that only serves fry orders or food such as sandwiches, hamburgers, or salads is not a full-service restaurant.

The restaurant shall have a dining room, a kitchen, and the number and kinds of employees necessary for the preparing, cooking, and serving of meals. 
(b)  License application requirements. Documentation: An applicant for a full-service restaurant on-sale license shall provide sufficient documentation to the city with an application form provided by the municipality to prove that the primary source of revenue from the operation of the restaurant will be derived from the sale of prepared food and nonalcoholic beverages and not from the sale of alcoholic beverages. The renewal of an on-sale full-service restaurant license is conditioned upon the applicant satisfying all state requirements for renewal. The supporting documentation concerning the primary source of revenue submitted pursuant to this section is confidential.

(1)  Food and nonalcoholic beverage sales; and

(f)  Only retail, on-sale service permitted. A full-service restaurant on-sale licensee may only serve alcoholic beverages for on-premises consumption in the bar and dining room area of the restaurant. 
(g)  Smoking prohibited. No licensee that has a full-service restaurant on-sale license may allow smoking on the licensed premises. 
(h)  Full-service restaurant license fees. 
(1)  The license fee charged for full-service on-sale restaurant licenses shall be established by resolution of the city at or above the current fair market value of the license. 
(2)  The license fee shall be initially established by resolution within 90 days of the initial adoption of this section. Subsequent changes in the license fee shall not be made for a period of ten years from the effective date of adoption of the ordinance from which this section is derived unless a population growth that is reported by the federal decennial census requires an increase in the fee. 
(i)  Registry of full-service restaurant on-sale licensees. The city will maintain a registry of each on-sale license that is being offered for sale. The burden of registering with the city a license being offered for sale rests on the licensee. The city will provide a copy of the registry to anyone who requests a new on-sale full-service restaurant license. Prior to the issuance of a new license, the applicant shall submit an affidavit showing that there is no on-sale license on the registry or that the applicant is unable to purchase the on-sale license at fair market value and on terms satisfactory to both the potential buyer and seller. 
(j)  Issuance of new full-service restaurant licenses restricted.

Sec. 8-9. - Deer feeding prohibitions. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to discourage high deer densities in the city. The deer population in the city has likely exceeded natural or pre-settlement deer densities as natural predators have been displaced from the city, and there are few natural restrictions on the deer population. High deer densities contribute to the spread of chronic diseases among deer populations, pose a hazard to motorists, cause a reduction in natural plant life and habitat for other animals, and cause damage to vegetation and landscaping installed by residents and commercial landowners. Feeding deer in or near the city increases deer densities and introduces food sources that can be harmful to deer. The city participates in other deer management activities and must take consistent action to protect the residents, environment, and wildlife populations of the city. 
(b)  Deer feeding prohibited. No person within one mile of the corporate limits of the city shall feed or allow the feeding of any deer by placing thereon, or allowing to remain thereon, any unnatural food source that attracts deer. Any apparatus used to feed song birds and backyard birds and utilized in a manner inaccessible to deer, including an unnatural food source placed not less than five feet above the ground, shall not be deemed an unnatural food source. An unnatural food source placed in good faith for the purpose of feeding domesticated pets kept for companionship or by or at the request of a person owning or having responsibility for such pets shall not be deemed an unnatural food source. 
(c)  Deer lawfully kept. This section shall not apply to the feeding of deer lawfully kept within one mile of the corporate limits of the city. 
(d)  Conservation management authorized. Nothing in this section shall be construed to apply to any governmental agency, employee, or authorized agent thereof in the course of his or her employment or agency. Specifically, nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the baiting of deer by authorized government agents in the furtherance of an approved plan to reduce deer population or in furtherance of an approved plan to entice deer out of the urban environment into a less urban and more natural environment. 
(e)  Enforcement. Any peace officer and any employee or agent of the city is authorized to enforce this section. 
(f)  Violation. A violation of this section shall be a Class 2 misdemeanor. Failure to remove or remedy a violation of this section within 24 hours after the first notice from the city shall constitute separate violations of this section as to each 24-hour period thereafter.

    In any proceeding or violation of the provisions of this article relating to any creature, the use of the terms "permit or suffer to run at large" and "to permit or suffer any creature to disturb the peace" shall not be construed as making scienter an element of the offense, and the knowledge or lack of knowledge of the person committing the act or violating this article shall be considered immaterial.

Sec. 8-32. - Animals at large. 
(a)  Definition. Any mammal, reptile, insect, bird or amphibian in the city or in any area controlled by the city shall be deemed to be running at large within the meaning of this article when such creature is not confined on the premises of its owner, or where the owner of the animal is an invitee or guest, or the animal is restrained by: 
(1)  A nonretractable leash no greater than six feet in length, or 
(2)  A retractable leash no longer than 16 feet in length, provided that such retractable leash is retracted to six feet in length whenever the creature is within 32 feet of any other human or creature, or in the hands of some attendant. This provision shall not apply in city-designated off-leash dog parks. 
(b)  Impoundment. It shall be unlawful for any person to permit or suffer to run at large within the limits of the city any dog, cat, or other creature, licensed or unlicensed, and any police officer or animal control officer is hereby authorized and empowered to impound such dog, cat, or other creature found running at large in violation of the provisions of this section.

(a)  No person owning and no person keeping, harboring or having on property occupied by him or her any creature, licensed or unlicensed, confined on the premises or otherwise, shall suffer or permit such creature to disturb the peace and quiet of the neighborhood by persistent or constant barking, howling, whining, snarling or growling or any such sound that disturbs his neighbors. 
(b)  Upon complaint being made to the city police department that any person owns or is keeping or harboring any creature which disturbs the peace as set forth in this section, a law enforcement officer or animal control officer shall be empowered to immediately take possession of said creature and to impound said creature if the owner or caretaker is not present or is unable or unwilling to immediately quiet the creature. The officer may do this if he hears the creature disturbing the peace. If the officer does not hear the alleged disturbance, but the complaining citizen is willing to sign a statement attesting to the disturbance with times and descriptions of such disturbance, the officer may use that statement to judge if the disturbance is severe enough to impound the creature. If the owner or caretaker is not at home, the officer will leave a notice informing him of the impoundment. The owner or caretaker will be responsible for all costs. 
(c)  In addition to the impounding of such creature, the owner of the creature and/or the occupant of the property on which the creature is being kept or harbored during the times that the creature is disturbing the peace shall be subject to a fine as authorized under these ordinances. It is intended that the officer issuing the summons for the offense shall undertake to use a graduated system of penalties such that the total number of offenses within the past three years shall serve as the multiplier of the standard fine in determining the total fine.

(3)  At any time during the course of an investigation, an animal control officer may impound the creature being investigated if that officer determines that the public safety so requires. If the creature is determined to be dangerous, vicious, or unsafe, the creature will be impounded until the conditions in section 8-38 are met or until the animal review board overturns the determination. 
(4)  After making the determination that a creature is dangerous, vicious, or unsafe, the animal control officer will determine which of the following courses of action is appropriate:

ARTICLE II. - FLOOD DAMAGE CONTROL 
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 22-19. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Alluvial fan flooding means flooding occurring on the surface of an alluvial fan or similar landform which originates at the apex and is characterized by: 
(1)  High-velocity flows; 
(2)  Active processes of erosion, sediment transport, and deposition; and 
(3)  Unpredictable flow paths. 
    Apex means a point on the alluvial fan or similar landform below which the flow path of the major stream that formed the fan becomes unpredictable and alluvial fan flooding can occur. 
    Area of shallow flooding means a designated AO, AH, or VO zone on a community's flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with a one percent chance or greater annual chance of flooding to an average depth of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
    Area of special flood hazard means the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. The area may be designated as zone A on the flood hazard boundary map (FHBM). After detailed ratemaking has been completed in preparation for publication of the FIRM, zone-A usually is refined into zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-99, VO, V1-30, VE or V. 
    Base flood means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
    Basement means any area of the building having its floor subgrade, below ground level, on all sides. 
    Critical feature means an integral and readily identifiable part of a flood protection system, without which the flood protection provided by the entire system would be compromised. 
    Development means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavating or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials. 
    Elevated building means a nonbasement building: 
(1)  Built, in the case of a building in zones A1-30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X, and D, to have the top of the elevated floor, or in the case of a building in zones V1-30, VE, or V, to have the bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member of the elevated floor elevated above the ground level by means of pilings, columns (posts and piers), or shear walls parallel to the flow of the water; and 
(2)  Adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during a flood of up to the magnitude of the base flood. In the case of zones A1-30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X, and D, the term "elevated building" also includes a building elevated by means of fill or solid foundation perimeter walls with openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement of floodwaters. In the case of zones V1-30, VE, or V, a building is an elevated building, even though the lower area is enclosed by means of breakaway walls, if the breakaway walls met the standards of section 60.3(e)(5) of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations. 
    Existing construction means for the purposes of determining rates, structures for which the start of construction commenced before the effective date of the FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date. The term "existing construction" may also be referred to as existing structures. 
    Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum the installation of utilities, the construction of streets and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the floodplain management regulations adopted by the city. 
    Expansion to existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed, including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads. 
    Flood or flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
(1)  The overflow of inland or tidal waters; or 
(2)  The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source. 
    Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
    Flood insurance study means the official report provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) that includes flood profiles, the flood boundary floodway map and the water surface elevation of the base flood. 
    Flood protection system means those physical structural works for which funds have been authorized, appropriated, and expended and which have been constructed specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of the areas within a community subject to a special flood hazard and the extent of the depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes hurricane tidal barriers, dams, reservoirs, levees or dikes. These specialized flood modifying works are those constructed in conformance with sound engineering standards. 
    Floodplain or floodprone area means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source. See Flood or flooding. 
    Floodplain management means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage, including, but not limited to, emergency preparedness plans, flood control works and floodplain management regulations. 
    Floodplain management regulations means zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as a floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance and erosion control ordinance) and other applications of police power. The term describes such state or local regulations, in any combination thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and reduction. 
    Floodproofing means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents. 
    Floodway (regulatory floodway) means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
    Functionally dependent use means a use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term "functionally dependent" includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and shipbuilding and ship repair facilities, but does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities. 
    Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure. 
    Historic structure means any structure that is: 
(1)  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of the Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register; 
(2)  Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district; 
(3)  Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the Secretary of the Interior; or 
(4)  Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either: 
a.  By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior; or 
b.  Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs. 
    Levee means a manmade structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control, or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding. 
    Levee system means a flood protection system which consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices. 
    Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable nonelevation design requirement of section 60.3 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations. 
    Manufactured home means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a recreational vehicle. 
    Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
    Mean sea level means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on the community's flood insurance rate map are referenced. 
    New construction means for the purpose of determining insurance rates, structures for which the start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, the term "new construction" means structures for which the start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
    New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum the installation of utilities, the construction of streets and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of the floodplain management regulations adopted by the city. 
    Recreational vehicle means a vehicle which is: 
(1)  Built on a single chassis; 
(2)  400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projections; 
(3)  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and 
(4)  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel or seasonal use. 
    Start of construction (for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act, 16 USC 3501 et seq.) includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, placement or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The term "actual start" means the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns or work beyond the stage of excavation or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation of the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds, not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure means a walled and roofed building including a gas or liquid storage tank, and including a manufactured home, that is principally above ground. 
    Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Substantial improvement means any rehabilitation, addition or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the start of construction of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred substantial damage regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term "substantial improvement" does not, however, include either: 
(1)  Any project for the improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary conditions; or 
(2)  Any alteration of a historic structure provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 
    Variance means a grant of relief to a person from the requirements of this article when specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance therefore, permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this article. (For full requirements see section 60.6 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations.) 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, other evidence of compliance required in section 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), or (e)(5) of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    Water surface elevation means the height, in relation to the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas. 
(Code 1980, § 31-78; Code 2003, § 15-31; Ord. No. 08-02-02, 2-25-2008) 
Sec. 22-20. - Statutory authorization; findings of fact; purpose; objectives. 
(a)  Statutory authorization. The legislature of the state has in SDCL 7-18-14 and 9-36-16 delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the city council does ordain as follows. 
(b)  Findings of fact. 
(1)  The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in the loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base; all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(2)  These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazard which increase flood heights and velocities and, when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. 
(Code 1980, § 31-75; Code 2003, § 15-32; Ord. No. 08-02-02, 2-25-2008) 
Sec. 22-21. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions within specific areas of the city by provisions designed: 
(1)  To protect human life and health; 
(2)  To minimize the expenditures of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities, such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges, located in areas of special flood hazard; 
(6)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the second use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas; 
(7)  To ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and 
(8)  To ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions. 
(Code 1980, § 31-76; Code 2003, § 15-33; Ord. No. 08-02-02, 2-25-2008) 
Sec. 22-22. - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
    In order to accomplish its purposes, this article includes methods and provisions for: 
(1)  Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property, due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protective barriers which help accommodate or channel floodwaters; 
(4)  Controlling filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; and 
(5)  Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas. 
(Code 1980, § 31-77; Code 2003, § 15-34; Ord. No. 08-02-02, 2-25-2008) 
Sec. 22-23. - Interpretation. 
    In the interpretation and application of this article, all provisions shall be: 
(1)  Considered as minimum requirements; 
(2)  Liberally construed in favor of the city; and 
(3)  Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. 
(Code 1980, § 31-80; Code 2003, § 15-35; Ord. No. 08-02-02, 2-25-2008) 
Sec. 22-24. - Warning and disclaimer of liability. 
    The degree of flood protection required by this article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This article does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This article shall not create liability on the part of the city, any officer or employee thereof or the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Insurance Administration for any flood damages that result from reliance on this article or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. 
(Code 1980, § 31-81; Code 2003, § 15-36; Ord. No. 08-02-02, 2-25-2008) 
Sec. 22-25. - Abrogation and greater restrictions. 
    This article is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants or deed restrictions. However, where this article and another ordinance, easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.

Options to purchase or contracts which can be terminated or modified without substantial loss, and contracts for feasibility, engineering, and design studies do not constitute a contractual obligation under this paragraph. Any structure not meeting this definition would then be considered an existing source. 
    Pass-through. A discharge which exits the POTW in quantities or concentrations which, alone or in conjunction with a discharge or discharges from other sources, causes a violation of any requirement of the POTW's SWD permit (including an increase in the magnitude or duration of a violation) or permit which authorizes the land application of sewage sludge. 
    Person. Any individual, partnership, copartnership, firm, company, corporation, association, joint stock company, trust, estate, governmental entity, or their legal representatives, agents or assigns. The singular shall include the plural where indicated and the masculine gender shall include the feminine. 
    pH. The logarithm (base 10) of the reciprocal of the concentration of hydrogen ions expressed in moles per liter of solution. 
    Pollutant. Any dredged soil, solid waste, incinerator residue, sewage, garbage, sewage sludge, munitions, chemical wastes, biological materials, radioactive materials, heat, wrecked or discharged equipment, rock, sand, cellar dirt and industrial, municipal and agricultural waste discharged into water. 
    Pollution. The manmade or man-induced alteration of the chemical, physical, biological and radiological integrity of water. 
    POTW treatment plant. That portion of the POTW designed to provide treatment to wastewater. 
    Pretreatment or treatment. The reduction of the amount of pollutants, the elimination of pollutants or the alteration of the nature of pollutant properties in wastewater to a less harmful state prior to or in lieu of discharging or otherwise introducing such pollutants into a POTW. The reduction or alteration can be obtained by physical, chemical or biological processes, or process changes by other means, except as prohibited by 40 CFR 403.6 (d).

Sec. 54-209. - Applicable standards and procedures. 
(a)  General discharge prohibitions. It shall be unlawful for any person to discharge into any opening into the sanitary sewer or storm sewer system, or into any natural drainage channel, or into any manmade ditch, lateral, pond, lake or lagoon, within the city, or in any area under the jurisdiction of the city, any sanitary sewage, industrial wastes or other polluted water, or other substances as listed below, except where suitable treatment has been provided in accordance with this subdivision. The substances are as follows: 
(1)  Pollutants which create a fire or explosion hazard in the POTW including, but not limited to, wastestreams with a closed cup flashpoint of less than 140 degrees Fahrenheit or 60 degrees centigrade using the test methods specified in 40 CFR 261.21. 
(2)  Pollutants which will cause corrosive structural damage to the POTW but in no case discharges with pH lower than 5.5 or above 10.0. 
(3)  Solid or viscous pollutants in amounts which will cause obstruction to the flow in the POTW resulting in interference. 
(4)  Any pollutant, including oxygen-demanding pollutants (BOD, etc.) released in a discharge at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration which will cause interference or upset to the POTW. 
(5)  Heat in amounts which will inhibit biological activity in the POTW resulting in interference, but in no case heat in such quantities that the temperature at the POTW treatment plant exceeds 40.0 degrees centigrade (104.0 degrees Fahrenheit) unless the approval authority, upon request of the POTW approves alternate temperature limits. 
(6)  Petroleum oil, nonbiodegradable cutting oil or products of mineral oil origin in amounts that will cause interference or pass-through. 
(7)  Pollutants which result in the presence of toxic gases, vapors, or fumes within the POTW in a quantity that may cause acute worker health and safety problems. 
(8)  Any trucked or hauled pollutants, except at discharge points designated by the POTW. 
(9)  Any ashes, cinders, sand, cement, plaster, mud, straw, hay shavings, metals, glass, rags, tar, plastics, wood, paunch manure, excessive manure, excessive hair and fleshings, excessive blood, excessive intestinal contents from livestock, animal hoofs or toenails, or any other animal particles larger than will go through a quarter-inch screen, limeslurry or sludge, acetylene generation sludge or other sludge, chemical residues, paint residues or other solid or viscous substance capable of causing obstruction to the flow in sanitary, or storm sewers or the proper operation of the sewage works or pollution of storm sewers or drainage channels. This section shall not be interpreted to exclude from the city sewer utility those small amounts of any organic item listed in this section generated by the normal home. 
(10)  The concentrated contents of any chemical tanks containing acids, alkalies, heavy metals, or other materials harmful to the sewage works. 
(11)  Any waters or wastes containing suspended solids of such character and quantity that unusual attention or expense is required to handle such materials at the wastewater treatment plant or in the collection system. 
(12)  Any substance which may cause a public nuisance, cause hazard to life or prevent entry into the sewers for maintenance and repair. 
(13)  Any wastewater containing any radioactive wastes or isotopes of such half-life or concentration as may exceed limits established by the city in compliance with applicable state or federal regulations. 
(14)  The admission into the public sanitary sewers of any waters or wastes having an average daily flow greater than five percent of the average dry weather sewage flow of the city or which are discharged at a rate exceeding 500 gallons per minute at any one time shall be subject to review to determine if such waste shall be approved or rejected or whether modification of the quantities and rates of discharge may be required. 
(15)  Any stormwaters into the sanitary sewer system except as allowed by ordinance. 
(16)  Any waste in which the concentration of conventional pollutants is greater than the local surcharge limits (residential strength/normal sewage strength) shall be cause for special review and determination as to whether pretreatment is necessary at its source, whether the waste may be acceptable as is with surcharge being levied, or whether both pretreatment and surcharge will be required. The surcharge shall be in addition to the normal sewer service charge. The local surcharge limits (residential strength/normal sewage strength) are listed under section 54-209(d). 
(17)  Any sanitary sewage into the storm sewer system or into any natural drainage channel or into any manmade irrigation ditch or lateral. 
(18)  Any waste from air conditioners. This wastewater shall be defined to include all discharges of a continually running nature from air conditioning units.

(19)  Any wastewater with objectionable color not removed in the treatment process such as, but not limited to, dye waste and vegetable tanning solutions. 
(20  Any substance which will cause the POTW to violate its SWD permit or receiving water quality standards. 
(21)  Any substance in sufficient quantity, either singly or by interaction with other pollutants, to injure or interfere with any wastewater treatment process, constitute a hazard to humans or animals, create a toxic effect in the receiving waters of the POTW or to exceed the limitation set forth in a categorical pretreatment standard. A toxic pollutant shall include, but not be limited to, any pollutant identified pursuant to section 307(a) of the Act. 
(22)  Any substance which may cause the POTW's effluent or any other product of the POTW such as residues, sludges, or scums, to be unsuitable for reclamation and reuse or to interfere with the reclamation process. In no case shall a substance discharged to the POTW cause the POTW to be in noncompliance with sludge use or disposal criteria, guidelines or regulations developed under section 405 of the Act; any criteria, guidelines, or regulations affecting sludge use or disposal developed pursuant to the Solid Waste Disposal Act, the Clean Air Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, or state criteria applicable to the sludge management method being used. 
(b)  Federal categorical pretreatment standards. Upon the promulgation of the federal categorical pretreatment standards for a particular industrial category, the federal shall immediately supersede the limitations imposed under this division. The city shall notify all affected users of the applicable reporting requirements under 40 CFR 403.12. 
(c)  Modification of federal categorical pretreatment standards. Where the city's wastewater treatment system achieves consistent removal of pollutants limited by federal pretreatment standards, if more stringent than limitations imposed under this division for sources in that category, standards, the city may apply to the approval authority for modification of specific limits in the federal pretreatment standards. "Consistent removal" shall mean the average of the lowest 50 percent of the removal measured according to 40 CFR 403.7(b)(2). The city may then modify pollutant discharge limits in the federal pretreatment standards if the requirements contained in 40 CFR 403.7 are fulfilled and prior approval from the approval authority is obtained. 
(d)  Specific pollutant limitations. No person shall discharge to the sanitary sewer any waters or wastes containing a toxic or poisonous substance in sufficient quantity that would injure or interfere with any sewage treatment process, constitute a hazard to humans or animals, create any hazard in the stream receiving or the wastewater treatment plant effluent or adversely affect the beneficial reuse of the sewage sludge. Individual users contributing to the sanitary sewer system will be limited, when applicable, by federal categorical pretreatment standards that regulate specific industries or by specific pollutant limitation (local limits) as set forth by the city. Individual contributors may also be limited by the wastewater discharge permit issued by the city. Each permit will be issued on an individual basis and may be restrictive, in both the concentration and the mass load of pollutants that a source may contribute. As experience and information indicate, the limitations, as developed, may be adjusted either upward or downward or limitations may be adopted for new pollutants. Individual users shall be limited by the city to prevent the user's daily contribution from exceeding the concentrations set forth in the following tables:

(g)  Accidental discharge prevention plans. Users shall provide protection from accidental discharge of materials which may interfere with the POTW. If deemed necessary by the city, the user shall develop a plan which indicates the operating procedures necessary to implement in the event of an accidental discharge. Facilities and equipment necessary to implement these plans shall be provided and maintained at the owner's or user's expense. Accidental discharge prevention plans, including the operating equipment and the operating procedure shall be submitted to the city within 90 days of the request for the plan. 
As deemed necessary by the city, industrial users that store hazardous waste shall not contribute to the POTW after the effective date of this division (January 19, 1995) unless an accidental discharge prevention plan has been submitted to the city. Submission of such plans shall not relieve the industrial user from complying with all other laws and regulations governing the use, disposal, storage, and transportation of pollutants. 
The city shall evaluate each significant industrial user at least once every two years, and other industrial users as necessary, to determine whether the user needs a plan to control accidental discharges. If the city decides that an accidental discharge prevention plan is needed the plan shall contain, at a minimum, the following elements: 
(1)  Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch discharges; 
(2)  Description of stored chemicals; 
(3)  Procedures for immediately notifying the city of accidental discharges, including any discharge that would violate a prohibition under section 54-209, with procedures for follow-up written notification within five days; 
(4)  If necessary, procedures to prevent adverse impact from accidental spills, including inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants (including solvents), and/or measures and equipment for emergency response. 
(h)  Accidental discharge notification. In the case of any discharge that could cause problems to the POTW including any slug loadings, as defined by section 54-208 of this division, the user shall immediately, upon becoming aware of the discharge, notify the city of the discharge by telephone. The notification shall include: 
(1)  The date, time, location and duration of the discharge; 
(2)  The type of waste including concentration and volume; and 
(3)  Any corrective actions taken by the user. 
Within five days following such a discharge the user shall submit a written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures that will be taken by the user to prevent similar future discharges. 
Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability resulting from the discharge, nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed under this division or other applicable state or federal law. 
Training procedures shall be available advising employees whom to call in the event of a discharge. Employers shall ensure that employees are advised and trained of the emergency notification procedure. 
Notification of changed discharge. All industrial users shall notify the city in advance of any substantial change in the volume or character of pollutants in the discharge, including the listed or characteristic hazardous wastes for which the industrial user has submitted initial notification under 40 CFR 403.12(p). Changes in discharge characteristics includes the addition of process wastestreams not previously indicated on the wastewater discharge permit. The actual discharge of process wastewater from an additional process must be approved by the city at least 90 days prior to discharge. 
(i)  Records retention. Users shall retain and make available upon request of authorized representatives of the city, the state or the EPA all records collected by the user pursuant to this division or any permit or order issued pursuant to this division. 
These records shall remain available for a period of at least five years after their collection. This period shall be extended during any litigation concerning compliance with this division or permit conditions.

If the categorical standard for the industrial user is modified after the BMR is submitted, the user shall make any necessary amendments to information provided as a response to subsection 54-210 and submit them to the city within 60 days after the modified limit is approved. 
(2)  Compliance date report. Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable categorical pretreatment standards or, in the case of a new source, following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any user subject to categorical pretreatment standards shall submit to the city a report indicating the nature and concentration of all pollutants in the discharge from the regulated process which are limited by such standards and the average and maximum daily flow for these process units in the user's facility which are limited by such pretreatment standards or requirements. Where equivalent mass or concentration limits are established by the city for a user, this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long-term production rate. Where a user is subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production, the report shall include the user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. The report shall state whether the applicable pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, what additional O&M and/or pretreatment is necessary to bring the user into compliance with the applicable pretreatment standards. This statement shall be signed by an authorized representative of the industrial user, and certified by a qualified professional. 
(3)  Periodic compliance reports. Any user subject to a categorical pretreatment standard, after the compliance date of such standard, or, in the case of a new source, after commencement of the discharge into the POTW shall submit to the city during the months of June and December, unless required more frequently in the pretreatment standard or by the city, a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the effluent which are limited by such pretreatment standards. In addition, this report shall include a record of all daily flows which, during the reporting period, exceeded the average daily flow reported in the BMR. At the discretion of the city and in consideration of such factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, etc., the city may agree to alter the months during which the above reports are to be submitted. The city may impose mass limitations on users which are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases where the imposition of mass limitations are appropriate. In such cases, the compliance report shall indicate the mass of pollutants regulated by the pretreatment standards in the effluent of the user. These reports shall contain the results of sampling and analysis of the discharge including the flow and the nature and concentration, or production and mass where requested by the city, of pollutants contained therein which are limited by the pretreatment standards. For industrial users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established by the city in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR 403.6(c), the compliance report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long-term production rate. For all other users subject to categorical standards expressed only in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), the compliance reports shall include the user's actual average production rate for the reporting period. 
Significant noncategorical industrial users shall submit to the city at least once every six months (on dates set by the control authority) a description of the nature, concentration, and flow of the pollutants required to be reported by the control authority. 
Reporting requirements for nonsignificant industrial users. The city may require reporting from those industrial users with discharges that are not subject to categorical pretreatment standards and are not otherwise deemed by the city to be significant. 
(i)  Self-monitoring requirements and violation notification. The reports required by this division shall be based on sampling and analysis performed in the period covered by the report, and performed in accordance with the techniques described in 40 CFR, part 136 and amendments thereto. Where 40 CFR 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the administrator determines that part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be performed by using validated analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the city or other persons approved by the administrator. This sampling and analysis may be performed by the city in lieu of the user. Where the city itself collects all the information required for the report the significant industrial user will not be required to submit the periodic compliance reports. 
If sampling performed by an industrial user indicates a violation, the user shall notify the city within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the city within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation, except if the user is not required to resample if (a) the city performs sampling at the user at a frequency of at least once per month, or (b) the city performs sampling at the user between the time when the user performs its initial sampling and the time when the user receives the results of this sampling. 
The periodic compliance reports shall be based upon data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period covered by the report which data is representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period. The city shall determine the frequency of monitoring which is necessary to assess and assure compliance by industrial users with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. If an industrial user subject to the reporting requirement in this section monitors any pollutant more frequently than is required by the city, using the procedures prescribed in this section, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report. 
All reports described in this section shall include the certification statement as set forth in 40 CFR 403.6(a)(2)(ii), and shall be signed by an authorized representative. 
(j)  Hazardous waste notification. Any industrial user, except as specified below, which discharges to the POTW any substance which, if otherwise disposed of would be a listed or characteristic of hazardous waste under 40 CFR, part 261, shall notify the POTW in writing of such discharge. 
All hazardous waste notifications shall include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR, part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other) and a certification that the user has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. 
In addition to the information submitted above, industrial users discharging more than 100 kg of hazardous waste per calendar month to the POTW shall submit a report that contains (to the extent such information is known and readily available to the industrial user) the following: 
(1)  An identification of the hazardous waste constituents contained in the waste; 
(2)  An estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month; and 
(3)  An estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. 
    Industrial users are exempt from the hazardous waste notification requirement during a calendar month in which they discharge 15 kg or less of nonacute hazardous wastes. Discharge of any quantity of acute hazardous waste as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e) requires a one-time notification. 
(k)  Inspection and sampling. The city shall inspect the facilities of any user to ascertain whether the purpose of this division is being met and all requirements are being complied with. SIUs will be sampled and inspected at least annually. Persons or occupants of the premises where wastewater is created or discharged shall allow the city, state EPA or their representative ready access at all reasonable times to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling records examination and copying or in the performance of any of their duties. The city, the state and EPA shall have the right to set up on the user's property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling, inspection, compliance and/or metering operations. Where a user has security measures in force which would require proper identification and clearance before entry into the facility, the user shall make the necessary arrangements with their security personnel so that upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the city enter, without delay, for the purposes of performing their specific responsibilities. 
(1)  Waste sampling. Industrial wastes discharged into the sewer system shall be subject to periodic inspection and determination of character and concentration of such wastes. The determination shall be made as often as may be deemed necessary by the city. Samples shall be collected in such a manner as to be representative of the composition of the wastes. The sampling may be accomplished either manually or by the use of mechanical equipment acceptable to the city. 
Installation, operation and maintenance of sampling facilities shall be the responsibility of the user discharging the waste and shall be subject to the approval of the city. Access to sampling locations shall be granted to the city, state and the EPA at all times. Every care shall be exercised in the collection of samples to ensure their preservation in a state comparable to that at the time the sample was taken. 
(2)  Monitoring facilities. If deemed necessary by the city, each user shall construct and maintain one or more control manholes or access points to facilitate sampling of the user's wastes, including domestic wastes. These access points or manholes shall be maintained by the user so as to be in safe condition, accessible and in proper operating condition at all times. Plans for the installation of the control manholes shall be approved by the city prior to the beginning of construction. Construction shall be completed within 90 days following written notification by the city that the manholes must be installed. 
(3)  Pretreatment requirements. Admission into the sanitary sewer system of any waters or wastes having the following characteristics shall be subject to review and approval by the city: 
a.  A five-day biochemical oxygen demand exceeding 210 mg/l or more; or 
b.  Total suspended solids exceeding 200 mg/l or more; or 
c.  An ammonia concentration exceeding 25 mg/l or more; or 
d.  The waste contains quantities of substances prohibited by section 54-209 of this subdivision; or 
e.  The average daily flow of the facility is greater than five percent of the average daily sanitary sewage flow of the city. 
Where required, the user discharging such wastes shall, at his own expense, install or incorporate such devices needed to pretreat the objectionable wastewaters. Pollutants removed in the course of wastewater pretreatment shall not be discharged to the sanitary sewer. 
Plans, specifications and other pertinent information relating to proposed pretreatment facilities shall be submitted to the city prior to the start of their construction. 
Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided when they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing grease, sand or other prohibited substances. All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by the city and shall be located as to be readily available for inspection and maintenance. 
Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be maintained by the user, at his expense, in continuously efficient operation at all times. Solids or oil accumulations from these treatment devices shall not be discharged or disposed of into the sanitary sewer. 
(m)  Confidential information. Information and data (other than effluent data) about a user obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits and monitoring programs and from inspections shall be available to the public unless the user specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city that the release of such information would divulge information, processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets of the user. Any such request must be asserted at the time of submission of the information or data. When such a confidentiality claim is asserted, the information shall be treated as such until a determination is made by the city. Effluent data shall be available to the public without restriction. 
When the person furnishing a report satisfies the city that such person has made the demonstration required by the paragraph above, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection except by the state or EPA for uses related to this subdivision, the SWD permit or the pretreatment program. Confidential portions of a report shall be available for use by the state or EPA in judicial review or enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Effluent data will not be recognized as confidential information. 
(Code 1980, § 24-72; Code 2003, § 25-208; Ord. No. 11-11-01, 12-21-2011) 
Sec. 54-211. - Administrative enforcement remedies; burden of proof. 
    The burden of proof in any enforcement action by the city against a user is set upon the user. This is due to the self-monitoring and self-reporting requirement set upon the user by this article. 
(1)  Notification of noncompliance. Whenever the city finds that any user has violated or is violating this division, or a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, the city [may] serve upon such user written notice of the violation. Within ten days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction of the violation and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted to the city. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. 
(2)  Consent orders. The city is hereby empowered to enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with the industrial user responsible for the noncompliance. Such orders will include compliance schedules, stipulated fines or remedial actions, and signatures of the city and industry representatives. Consent orders shall have the same force and effect as administrative orders issued pursuant to subsection (4) of this section. 
(3)  Compliance meeting order. The city may order any user which causes or contributes to a violation of this division, wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, to show cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any principal executive, general partner or corporate officer. Whether or not a duly notified industrial user appears as noticed, enforcement action may be pursued as appropriate. 
(4)  Administrative compliance order. When the city finds that a user has violated or continues to violate the provisions of this article or a permit or order issued hereunder, the city may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances be installed and are properly operated, and that compliance with the provisions of this article be achieved. Orders may also contain such other requirements as might be reasonably necessary and appropriate to address the noncompliance, including the implementation of pollution prevention practices and technology, additional self-monitoring, best professional management practices, administrative penalties and stipulated administrative penalties where future violations of this chapter shall result in automatic assessment of penalties. 
(5)  Cease and desist orders. When the city finds that a user has violated or continues to violate this division or any permit or order issued hereunder, the city may issue an order to cease and desist all illegal or unauthorized discharges immediately. 
a.  In an emergency, the order to cease and desist maybe given by telephone. 
b.  In nonemergency situations, the cease and desist order may be used to suspend or permanently revoke wastewater discharge permits. 
c.  The cease and desist order may order the user to take such appropriate remedial or preventative action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and terminating the discharge. 
(6)  Administrative penalty. Notwithstanding any other action in this division, and who is found to have violated any provision of this division, or permits and orders issued hereunder, shall be fined in an amount not to exceed $1,000.00 per violation. Each day on which noncompliance occurs or continues shall be deemed a separate and distinct violation. Such assessments may be added to the user's next scheduled municipal utility bill. Unpaid charges and penalties shall constitute a lien against the individual user's property. Users desiring to dispute such penalties must file a request for a hearing for the city to reconsider the penalty within ten days of being notified of the penalty. Information regarding why the city should reconsider the penalty shall be provided with the request for the hearing. Where the city believes a request has merit, a hearing shall be convened on the matter within 15 days of receiving the request from the user, or such other times as the parties may agree upon. A hearing regarding the amount of an administrative penalty shall be convened only after the user has provided adequate information as to why the penalty should not be assessed. This information must be submitted along with the request for the hearing. 
The hearing officer shall be a duly appointed representative of the city and shall determine if the request for hearing has merit. The sole purpose of the administrative hearing is for the user to provide information not previously provided to the city or to clarify previously submitted information in or to dispute the amount of the penalty. No other administrative enforcement actions by the city will be disputed at this hearing. 
(7)  Emergency suspensions. The city may suspend the wastewater treatment service and/or wastewater permit of a user whenever such suspension is necessary in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge presenting or causing an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons, the POTW or the environment. Any user notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment service and/or the wastewater permit shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the city shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The city shall allow the user to recommence its discharge when the endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings set forth in subsection (8) of this section are initiated against the user. A user which is responsible, in whole or in part, for imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any further occurrence to the city prior to the date of the hearing described in the paragraph above. 
(8)  Termination of permit. As deemed necessary by the city, users proposing or currently discharging to the POTW must obtain a wastewater discharge permit (section 54-210 of this division) from the city. Any user who violates the following conditions of this division or a wastewater discharge permit or order or any applicable state and federal law, is subject to permit termination: 
a.  Violation of permit conditions; 
b.  Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge; 
c.  Failure to report significant changes or wastewater constituents and characteristics; 
d.  Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purposes of inspection, monitoring, or sampling. 
Noncompliant users will be notified of the proposed termination of their wastewater discharge permit and be offered an opportunity to show cause under subsection (3) of this section of this division why the proposed action should not be taken. 
(Code 1980, § 24-73; Code 2003, § 25-209; Ord. No. 11-11-01, 12-21-2011) 
Sec. 54-212. - Judicial remedies. 
    If any person discharges sewage, industrial wastes, or other wastes into the wastewater system contrary to the provisions of this division or any order or permit issued hereunder, the city through the city attorney, may commence an action for appropriate legal and/or equitable relief in the circuit court for Brown County: 
(1)  Injunctive relief. Whenever a user has violated or continues to violate the provisions of this division or permit or order issued hereunder, the city through counsel may petition the court for the issuance of a preliminary or permanent injunction or both (as may be appropriate) which restrains or compels the activities on the part of the user. 
(2)  Civil penalties. Any user who has violated or continues to violate this division or any order or permit issued hereunder, shall be liable to the city for a civil penalty of not more than $1,000.00 plus actual damages incurred by the POTW per violation per day for as long as the violation continues. In addition to the above described penalty, and damages, the city may recover reasonable attorney's fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with the enforcement activities, including sampling, monitoring and analysis expenses. 
The city shall petition the court to impose, assess, and recover such sums. In determining amount of liability, the court shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration, any economic benefit gained by the user through the user's noncompliance, corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice requires. 
(3)  Criminal prosecution. 
a.  Any user who willfully or negligently violates any provision of this subdivision or any orders or permits issued hereunder shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine not to exceed $1,000.00 per violation per day or imprisonment for not more than one year or both. 
b.  Any user who knowingly makes any false statements, representation, or certifications in any application, record, report, plan or other document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this division, or wastewater discharge permit, or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this division shall upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than $1,000.00 per violation per day or imprisonment for not more than one year or both. 
(4)  Annual publication of users in significant noncompliance. The city shall publish, at least annually in the Aberdeen American News, a description of those users which are found to be in significant noncompliance, as defined in section 54-208 of this division, with any provisions of this division or permit or order issued hereunder during the period since the previous publication. 
(Code 1980, § 24-74; Code 2003, § 25-210; Ord. No. 11-11-01, 12-21-2011) 
Sec. 54-213. - Affirmative defenses. 
(a)  Industry treatment upsets. 
(1)  Definition. For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation, or lack of treatment facilities. 
(2)  Effect of an upset. An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with pretreatment standards if the requirements of paragraph (3) below, are met. 
(3)  Conditions necessary for a demonstration of upset. A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, simultaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
a.  An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause of the upset; 
b.  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; 
c.  The user has submitted the following information to the city within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is provided orally, a written submission must follow within five days): 
1.  A description of the discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
2.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; 
3.  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
d.  Burden of proof. In any enforcement proceeding the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
e.  User responsibility in case of upset. The user shall control discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails. 
(b)  Treatment bypass. 
(1)  A bypass of the treatment system is prohibited unless all of the following conditions are met: 
a.  The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage. 
b.  There was no feasible alternative to the bypass including the use of auxiliary treatment or retention of the wastewater. 
c.  The user properly notified the city as described in paragraph (2) below. 
(2)  A user shall orally notify the city of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards or requirements within 24 hours of becoming aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of becoming aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause, the duration of the bypass, including exact times and dates, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue, and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the bypass. If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the city, if possible, at least ten days before the date of the bypass.

Secs. 54-214-54-234. - Reserved. 
Subdivision II. - Pollution Prevention Program 

Sec. 54-235. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this subdivision, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Act or the Act means the Pollution Prevention Act of 1990, 42 USC 13101 et seq. 
    Existing source means any user (as defined in section 54-270) that was connected to the sanitary sewer prior to January 19, 1995. 
    Media transfer means the transfer of pollutants among the environmental media (e.g., transfer of pollutants from water to land.) 
    Multimedia means all environmental media: 
(1)  Land; 
(2)  Water; and 
(3)  Air. 
    Pollutant means any dredged soil, solid waste, incinerator residue, sewage, garbage, sewage sludge, munitions, chemical wastes, biological materials, radioactive materials, heat, wrecked or discarded equipment, rock, sand, cellar dirt and industrial, municipal and agricultural waste discharged into water. 
    Pollution means the manmade or man-induced alteration of the chemical, physical, biological and radiological integrity of water. 
    Pollution prevention means the reduction, avoidance or elimination of the use and or generation of pollutants. In addition, pollution prevention seeks to eliminate pollutant releases to all environmental media: land, air or water. The term "pollution prevention" as defined in the Act as source reduction. 
    Pretreatment program, pretreatment regulations means those regulations as set forth in this division pertaining to the implementation, administration and enforcement of the industrial pretreatment program pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Clean Water Act. 
    Source reduction. 
(1)  The term "source reduction" means any practice which reduces: 
a.  The amount of any hazardous substance, pollutant or contaminant entering any wastestream or otherwise released into the environment, (including fugitive emissions) prior to recycling, treatment or disposal; and 
b.  The hazards to public health and the environment associated with the release of such substances, pollutants, or contaminants. 
(2)  The term "source reduction" includes equipment or technology modifications, process or procedure modifications, reformulation or redesign of products, substitution of raw materials, and improvements in housekeeping, maintenance, training, or inventory control. 
(3)  The term "source reduction" does not include any practice which alters the physical, chemical, or biological characteristics or the volume of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant through a process or activity which itself is not integral to and necessary for the production of a product or the providing of a service. 
    Toxic pollutant means pollutants or combinations of pollutants, including disease-causing agents, which after discharge and upon exposure, ingestion, inhalation or assimilation into any organism, either directly from the environment or indirectly by ingestion through food chains, will, on the basis of information available to the administrator of the EPA, cause death, disease, behavioral abnormalities, cancer, genetic mutations, physiological malfunctions, including malfunction in reproduction or physical deformations in such organisms or their offspring. 
    Wastewater discharge permit means a mechanism used to control pollutant contributions to the wastewater collection and treatment system. This document may contain the information specified in section 54-210. 
(Code 1980, § 24-76; Code 2003, § 25-231(c)) 
Sec. 54-236. - General provisions. 
(a)  Purpose. The Federal Pollution Prevention Act of 1990, 42 USC 13101 et seq., declared that pollution prevention through source reduction and recycling become a national policy. Therefore, this section sets forth requirements for the development and implementation of a pollution prevention program. This program implemented in conjunction with the industrial pretreatment program, will address pollution prevention using two means; pollution reduction at its source and the prevention of pollutant generation. In addition, this section will allow the inclusion of pollution prevention provisions in administrative or civil judicial enforcement actions regarding violations of pretreatment regulations or standards pursuant to this division. The objectives of this subdivision are to: 
(1)  Increase industrial user awareness of the opportunities to reduce or prevent pollution at its source through cost effective changes in production, operation, and raw materials use. 
(2)  Heighten the awareness of industry regarding source reduction. Existing regulations rely on compliance, focus upon treatment and disposal of pollutants rather than source reduction. Existing regulations do not emphasize multimedia management of pollution. 
(3)  Educate users that source reduction is fundamentally different and more desirable than waste management and pollution control. 
(b)  Policy. The city hereby declares it to be a policy that pollution should be prevented or reduced at the source whenever feasible. Pollution that cannot be prevented should be recycled in an environmentally safe manner whenever feasible; pollution that cannot be prevented or recycled should be treated in an environmentally safe manner whenever feasible and disposal or other release into the environment shall be employed only as a last resort and should be conducted in an environmentally safe manner. 
(c)  Applicability. This section shall apply to the city and to persons outside the city who are, by contract or agreements with the city, users of the city wastewater collection and treatment system. Except as otherwise provided herein, a duly authorized representative of the city (wastewater treatment superintendent or pretreatment coordinator) shall administer, implement, and enforce the provisions of this article. 
(Code 1980, § 24-76; Code 2003, § 25-231(a), (b)) 
Sec. 54-237. - Administrative. 
(a)  Program development. The city shall develop the pollution prevention program using the same administrative approaches used in the industrial pretreatment program. Those approaches being: the development of a standard operating procedures manual which implements the purpose of this division; the development of administrative framework and, if necessary, budgetary considerations; the compilation of an inventory of users at which this program will be directed; an endorsement of the program by the city council; and the ability to update this division in the event federal or state regulations are promulgated which affect this division or the program implementation. 
(b)  Program implementation. The city will administer the pollution prevention program in conjunction with the industrial pretreatment program. The program will encourage and, where applicable, mandate recycling, reuse and reduction of pollutant discharges for appropriate users. Thus, eliminating or reducing pollutant loads to the wastewater collection and treatment system, without transferring the pollutants to another environmental media (media transfer). This will be accomplished by: 
(1)  Incorporating pollution prevention questions into wastewater discharge permit applications. 
(2)  Incorporating pollution prevention (source reduction) audits into the annual pretreatment program industrial user compliance inspections and allow the city to formally request from the user information regarding pollution prevention activities as well as other information necessary to implement this program. From these audits the program will identify, where appropriate, measurable goals which will reflect an overall reduction in pollutant contributions. In addition, the audits will identify, where appropriate, pollutant discharges for which technology is available to recycle, reuse or prevent the discharge altogether. 
(3)  Providing users with information and technical assistance regarding, where available, alternative production methods and hazardous waste minimization. 
(4)  Recognizing positive approaches by users which reflect the intent of this article or similar state and federal legislation. 
(5)  Updating the user's wastewater discharge permits to incorporate pollution prevention requirements. 
(6)  Where deemed necessary by the city, requiring the user to develop a pollution prevention (source reduction) plan. This plan would identify the technically feasible and economically practical source reduction and recycling measures the user intends to implement, along with a timetable for making reasonable progress. The plan is based on a systematic review of the company's processes, operations and procedures to determine how to reduce the use of toxic substances and the generation of pollutants that could impact the wastewater collection and treatment system. A pollution prevention plan shall include the following: 
a.  The name and location of the facility. 
b.  The SIC code of the facility. 
c.  Identification of all routinely generated pollutant wastestreams which result from production processes or operations. 
d.  For each wastestream identified in subsection (b)(6)c of this section, the plan shall include all of the following information: 
1.  The flow (in gallons per day) of the wastestream. 
2.  The concentration (in mg/l) of pollutants of the wastestream. 
3.  An evaluation of source reduction approaches available which are potentially viable. This evaluation shall consider the following: 
(i)  Change in raw materials/input materials. 
(ii)  Operational improvement. 
(iii)  Production process change. 
(iv)  Product reformulation. 
e.  A specification of, and rationale for, the technically feasible and economically practicable source reduction measures which will be taken by the generator. The review and plan shall fully document the reason for any rejections to any available source reduction measures. 
f.  An evaluation, and, to the extent practicable, a quantification, of the effects of the chosen source reduction method on emissions and discharges to the environmental media. 
g.  A timetable for making reasonable and measurable progress towards implementation of the selected source reduction measures. 
h.  A certification statement signed by an authorized representative of the company. This certification statement shall state: 
    "I certify under penalty of law that the document and all attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed to ensure that qualified personnel properly gathered and evaluated the information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system, or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the information submitted is to the best of my knowledge and belief, true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment for knowing violations." 
(Code 1980, § 24-77; Code 2003, § 25-232) 
Sec. 54-238. - Enforcement. 
(a)  Program enforcement. The city shall have the authority to require implementation of pollution prevention actions (submission of pollution prevention plans, recycling, reclamation, water conservation, etc.) for users contributing to the wastewater collection and treatment system. Such requirements shall be consistent with the definition of source reduction as defined previously in this chapter. The enforcement remedies shall apply to this division as well. Thus, failure to implement such required actions shall result in penalties and enforcement initiatives consistent with those provided herein. 
(b)  Concurrent pretreatment program enforcement. The city shall have the authority to require implementation of pollution prevention actions as a means of ensuring user compliance with pretreatment regulations. In addition, the city shall have the authority to mandate pollution prevention implementation in cases of enforcement against a user due to pretreatment violations. Instances where such a mandate will be issued are as follows: 
(1)  Recurring patterns of noncompliance with pretreatment standards which are unlikely to be corrected by additional add-on controls or improved operations and maintenance, and elimination or substitution offers the best prospects for permanent return to compliance. 
(2)  Innovative solutions are available to avoid negative cross media impacts which would result from traditional control techniques. 
(3)  Pollution prevention technology is available and is an economically feasible alternative to discharge of pollutants to the environment. 
(4)  Repeated noncompliance with pretreatment reporting requirements, compliance dates and agendas, violation of sampling requirements or other pretreatment requirements as deemed necessary by the city. 
(c)  Pollution prevention mandates. Pollution prevention mandates shall be implemented in the following manner: 
(1)  Pollution prevention settlement conditions can be used to correct a specific pretreatment standard (effluent) violation. 
(2)  Pollution prevention conditions incidental to the correction of the violation. The city shall consider pollution prevention conditions in addition to the specific actions needed to correct the violation. 
(d)  Timelines for implementation of mandated pollution prevention activities. The city's pretreatment enforcement policy calls for expeditious return of the violator to compliance. There shall be no significant extension of the normal time period for returning to compliance due to the implementation of pollution prevention provisions.

ARTICLE IV. - STORM DRAINAGE 

Sec. 54-313. - Purpose; fee; runoff weighting factor. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this article is to establish a charge against real property within the city for the operation, maintenance, and capital expenses of the storm sewer and drainage system. 
(b)  Annual fee; basis. All real property within the city shall be charged an annual fee for the operation, maintenance, and capital improvements of the storm sewer and drainage system. The fee for each such property shall be based on the lot area, a runoff weighting factor, and a unit financial charge, which fee is determined as follows: Storm drainage fee equals the runoff weighting factor multiplied by parcel area (in square feet) multiplied by unit financial charge (in dollars per square foot). 
(c)  Runoff weighting factor, assignment by use table. The runoff weighting factor is determined by the type of land use and indicates the relative volume of stormwater runoff from a land parcel as a function of the percentage of impervious surfaces covering each land parcel. The runoff weighting factor is to be assigned by land use type as shown in the following table: 
Land Use Runoff Weighting Factor by Land Use Type Code Land Use Type Factor 11 Single-family 7.5 12 Duplex 7.5 13 Townhouses 7.5 14 Apartment building (1 to 3 stories) 11.25 15 Apartment building (4 stories or more) 11.25 16 Dormitories 11.25 17 Mobile homes and trailers 11.25 18 Other residential 11.25 19 Estate (single-family, on 30,000 sq. ft. or more) 2.5 21 Apparel and textiles 17.0 22 Wood, furniture, fixtures 17.0 23 Lumberyards 17.0 24 Printing and publishing 17.0 25 Warehouse, indoor storage 17.0

*Quarries are individually calculated with a runoff weighting factor of 0.00 for the actual quarry area. 
(d)  Request for site study, calculation of runoff weighting factor table. Upon written request from a property owner, a detailed site study will be conducted by the public works/city engineering department to determine the runoff weighting factor. This written request shall be submitted to the public works director/city engineer on or before April 30 of the year the fees are charged to the subject land parcel. The engineering department shall calculate the percentage of impervious area for the subject parcel which contributes stormwater runoff to the drainage system of the city. This system includes the storm sewer system, drainageways, and all ditches and waterways within and flowing away from the city. The runoff weighting factor is then determined through utilization of the following table: 
Land Use Runoff Weighting Factor by Impervious Area Percentage Impervious Area 
(in percent) Average Runoff to Rainfall 
Ratio (R**) Runoff Weighting Factor 
(R × 25) 0 0.04 1.00 10 0.19 4.75 15 0.26 6.50 20 0.30 7.50 30 0.38 9.50 40 0.45 11.25 50 0.53 13.25 60 0.60 15.00 70 0.68 17.00 80 0.75 18.75 90 0.83 20.75 100 0.90 22.50  
**These values are derived from the storm equation (Figure 5-20, page 5-49), A Statistical Method for the Assessment of Urban Storm Drainage, EPA, Washington, D.C., January 1979. For low percentage impervious surfaces (0 percent to 20 percent), a linear relationship was assumed between storm equation and empirical data derived from drainage runoff in high depression storage, loose soils, and flat areas. Interpolation of the runoff weighting factor for a given percentage to impervious area not listed in the table in this subsection may be obtained by assuming a linear relationship between the values listed. The public works director/city engineer may direct that the runoff weighting factor for a given parcel is calculated by a detailed site investigation and the use of the table in this subsection, where an obvious departure from the percentage of impervious surfaces of similar land uses exists. A determination of the runoff weighting factor, resulting from a detailed site investigation and use of the table in this subsection, brought about either by the written request of a property owner or by direction from the city, shall be used in the calculation of the storm drainage fee of the subject parcel and shall replace the factor previously derived from the table in subsection (c) of this section, even if the resulting value is higher. 
(e)  Parcel area. The parcel area shall be obtained from the records of the public works director/city engineer's office. 
(f)  Unit financial charge. The unit financial charge shall be as provided in the city fee schedule on file in the office of the finance director.

Sec. 54-315. - Fund established. 
    The drainage fees paid to the city shall be maintained in a separate fund to be known as the storm sewer maintenance fund. This fund shall be used to pay the cost of financing the operation, maintenance or construction of the drainage and storm sewer system. 
(Code 2003, § 25-303; Ord. No. 05-09-07, 9-26-2005) 
Sec. 54-316. - Annual review. 
    The unit financial charge shall be reviewed annually and shall be revised as necessary so that revenues are reasonably in balance with anticipated expenditures. Excess funds may be carried forward from year to year in order to build sufficient funds for large drainage construction projects which are scheduled or programmed for the near future. In addition, funds may be carried over to provide sufficient monies for unanticipated repairs, replacements, or maintenance of the drainage system.

    After the adoption of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, land or structures or the uses of land or structures that would be prohibited under the regulations for the district in which they are located shall be considered as nonconforming. It is the intent of this article to permit these nonconforming uses to continue provided they conform to the following provisions: 
(1)  The order of classification of uses from most restrictive or highest to least restrictive or lowest, for the purposes of this article shall be as follows: 
a.  A-1 agricultural. 
b.  A-2 green belt.

j.  I-2 unrestricted industrial. 
(2)  The substitution of a nonconforming use within a structure, or structure and premises in combination for another nonconforming use within the same structure, or structure and premises in combination, may be permitted only when such substituted use is of a same or more restrictive classification provided that the board of zoning adjustment, after public notice and hearing, deems the proposed use to be no more harmful to the district in question than the existing nonconforming use. In permitting such nonconforming use substitution, the board may require appropriate conditions and safeguards in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. In no case shall such nonconforming use substitution be construed to alter the intent of this chapter. 
(3)  A nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and premises in combination may not be extended, except that the extension of a use to any portion of a building, which portion is, at the time of the adoption of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, primarily arranged, constructed, or designed for such specific nonconforming use, shall not be deemed to be an extension of a nonconforming structure, or structure and premises in combination. 
(4)  When a nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and premises in combination, is in fact, discontinued or abandoned for six consecutive months or for 18 months during any three-year period, the structure, or structure and premises in combination, shall not thereafter be used except in conformance with the regulations of the district in which it is located. 
(5)  No existing structure, or structure and premises in combination, devoted to a nonconforming use shall be constructed, reconstructed or structurally altered, nor shall the structure, or structure and premises in combination, be enlarged except in changing the nonconforming use of the structure, or structure and premises in combination, to a use permitted, under the provisions of this chapter, in the district in which said use is located. 
(6)  An existing structure, or structure and premises in combination, devoted to a nonconforming use, which has been damaged by fire, explosion, tornado, earthquake, or similar noncontrollable cause to an extent of more than 60 percent of its fair market value immediately prior to damage, shall not be rebuilt, altered or repaired except insofar as such structure, or structure and premises in combination, is subject to and in conformance with all of the provisions of this chapter applicable to the district in question. 
(7)  Nothing in this article shall prevent the structural alteration of a structure, or structure and premises in combination, which has been declared unsafe by the public works director/city engineer, provided that the structure, or structure and premises in combination is in no way enlarged or expanded. 
(8)  The provisions of this section shall also apply to nonconforming uses in districts hereafter changed.

a.  Projection shall be subject to the absolute limits of eight feet from the face of a building and two feet from the back of the curb, the maximum projection of a projecting wall sign shall be determined by the distance of the sign from any neighboring property. 
1.  The allowable maximum projection shall be determined by the following formula: 
Projection Formula M = B + I When M = Maximum projection of not more than eight feet B = Base projection (four feet) the allowable projection regardless of location along frontage I = L/(P) (four feet) increase over base projection of not more than four feet F = Property frontage along one street right-of-way N = Number of adjoining properties exclusive of street right-of-way P = F/N (point or area of maximum projection) that point on a property which is the greatest distance from neighboring properties, or any area which is 50 feet or more from any neighboring property L = Proposed sign location measured as the shortest distance from a neighboring property  
2.  Projecting wall signs may project over public right-of-way only where there is no required building setback, and no projection is allowed over the rights-of-way of U.S. Highway 12 or 281.

c.  All roof signs shall be installed or erected in such a manner that there shall be no visible support structure. 
(5)  Wall/roof signs. Wall/roof signs shall meet all requirements of both projecting wall signs and roof signs.

a.  Awnings and canopies may be used by all types of establishments in all surroundings. Only individual cut-out letters and/or symbols may be attached to, painted, stenciled, or otherwise placed on these devices; except that each ground floor activity may display one pedestrian-oriented sign visible from beneath the awning or canopy provided that it does not exceed six square feet in area and is a minimum of seven feet above grade. Awnings and canopies may extend to within one foot horizontally of the curb face and may have a minimum height of seven feet from the lowest point, exclusive of supports and braces, on the canopy or awning to the top of the curb.

(a)  Applicability. This section may be used by any property owner provided that: 
(1)  The standards in this section are met and maintained.

(4)  This section shall apply only to on-premises signs. 
(b)  Items of information. A limitation on the number of items of information displayed on any property makes that signage more legible and allows surrounding properties to make effective use of their signage. The following standards and incentives may be applied in commercial and industrial zoning districts: 
(1)  General application. If ten or fewer items of information are displayed per street frontage and no more than two sign types are displayed (i.e., wall, freestanding sign, 
etc.), the total area of signage allowed may be increased by 30 percent. The individual sign types may be increased by wall signs by 30 percent, all other sign types by 15 percent. 
(2)  Special applications. Certain types of commercial activities because of their size and drawing power can be identified by area identification signs displaying no more than five items of information. 
a.  Shopping center. If only one freestanding sign displaying five or fewer items of information is located on the property, and all other signage is in the form of wall signs which advertise only the name and/or symbols of the tenants, the following incentives shall be provided: 
1.  The freestanding area identification sign may be up to 50 feet high and 1,000 square feet in area. The area of this sign shall not be included in the total area of signage allowed for the property. 
2.  The total sign area allowed may be increased by 20 percent. Only wall signs shall be used. 
b.  Planned commercial area. If each property within the area displays eight or fewer items of information, and the area identification sign displays five or fewer items of information; each property may apply subsection (b)(1) of this section and the area identification sign may be used in conformance with subsection (b)(2)a.1 of this section. 
(c)  Number of signs. If only one sign is displayed per street frontage on a property, the allowable area of the sign may be increased by up to 50 percent. 
(d)  Setback. For each foot a freestanding sign is set back beyond all minimum setbacks, the freestanding sign may be increased in area by one percent per foot and in height by five-tenths percent per foot. The smallest increase in setback from any property line shall be used to determine the allowable size increase. The maximum size increase allowed shall be 80 percent in area and 40 percent in height. 
(e)  Landscaping. For each square foot of landscape gardening installed at the base and properly maintained, the user of a freestanding sign will be permitted a maximum increase of 120 inches as follows: 
(1)  One square foot of area over that normally permitted, to a maximum increase of 50 percent; or 
(2)  Two inches additional height over that normally permitted. 
Each square foot of landscape gardening may be counted only once; however, the square footage may be divided to entitle the user to both bonuses to that point where sufficient total footage may permit increases in both height and area. 
(f)  General provisions. These general provisions shall apply to all parts of this section. 
(1)  The application of this section is optional for the property owner; however, if this option is used by the property owner, the provisions of the section shall be binding on the owner, his or her predecessors and tenants. 
(2)  Variances and/or special exceptions shall not be granted for the terms of section. 
(3)  Signs described in section 60-341(c) and (d) shall not be applied to this section. 
(4)  Any part or all of the parts of this section may be applied cumulatively to any property. The maximum increase shall not exceed 100 percent in area nor 50 percent in height. 
(Ord. No. 1411, § 6, 3-30-1976) 
Sec. 60-343. - Permits, fees and inspection. 
(a)  Unless specifically excluded from these permit requirements, all signs erected within the city and three miles thereof shall require a zoning permit for signs prior to construction.

(1)  The name and address of the applicant; 
(2)  All information required to determine compliance with the provisions of this article; and 
(3)  The name of the person, firm, or corporation erecting the sign. 
(b)  Every applicant, before being granted a permit, shall pay a fee for each sign to be erected. 
(1)  The zoning permit for signs fee shall be as provided in the city fee schedule on file in the office of the finance director. 
(2)  Upon any substantial alteration, replacement, face change or relocation; other than routine maintenance of a sign shall constitute a new sign requiring a zoning permit for signs. 
(3)  If a sign is erected without first obtaining a zoning permit for signs, said sign shall be deemed to be illegal and shall be removed within 14 calendar days of receipt of written notification from the planning and zoning department. 
(c)  Should any sign, for which a permit has been issued, not be erected within 120 days of the issuance of the permit, such permit shall expire and fees previously paid shall not be refunded.

Sec. 60-344. - Legal nonconforming signs. 
(a)  Notification of nonconformance. After the enactment of the ordinance from which this article is derived, the administrator shall, as soon as practicable, survey the zoning jurisdiction and identify the signs which do not conform to the requirements of this article. Upon determination that a sign is nonconforming, the administrator shall use reasonable efforts to so notify either personally or in writing the user or owner of the property on which the sign is located of the following: 
(1)  The sign's nonconformity; and 
(2)  Whether the sign is eligible for characterization either as legal nonconforming or unlawful. 
(b)  Signs eligible for characterization as legal nonconforming. Any sign located within the zoning jurisdiction on the date of adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived, which does not conform with the provisions of this article, is eligible for characterization as a legal nonconforming sign and is permitted, provided it also meets the following requirements: 
(1)  The sign erected under a permit issued of the ordinances in effect at the date of erection. 
(2)  The sign is properly maintained, and is not prohibited or otherwise to be discontinued or removed under the provisions of this article. 
(c)  Loss of legal nonconforming status. A legal nonconforming sign shall immediately lose its legal nonconforming designation if:

(2)  The sign is relocated; 
(3)  The sign is replaced; or 
(4)  Upon the occurrence of situations in subsections (c)(1) through (3) of this section the sign shall be immediately brought into compliance with this article with a new permit secured therefor, or shall be removed. 
(d)  Legal nonconforming sign maintenance and repair. Nothing in this section shall relieve the owner or user of a legal nonconforming sign or owner of the property on which the legal nonconforming sign is located from the provisions of this article regarding safety, maintenance and repair of signs; provided, however, that any repainting, cleaning and other normal maintenance or repair of the sign or sign structure shall not modify the sign structure or copy in any way which makes it more nonconforming or the sign shall lose its legal nonconforming status.
