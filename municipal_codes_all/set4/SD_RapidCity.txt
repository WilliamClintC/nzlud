instance of rezoning, such request(s) shall comply with the procedures set
forth in §
17.54.040. Requests for rezoning that comply with §
17.54.040 shall be deemed to have met the requirements for amendment to the
comprehensive plan.
   A.   Application. An application for a proposed amendment shall be filed
with the Community Development Department. Amendments may be initiated by the
property owner or his or her designated representative or by an appropriate
governmental agency. For amendments initiated by the city’s Planning
Commission, the applicant shall be the city.
      1.   Major street plan. The major street plan within the comprehensive
plan shall take into consideration the practicality and feasibility of the
proposed street extensions. The major street plan shall permit modifications,
without amendments to the comprehensive plan, of proposed street extensions and
alignments in instances where the general intent of the plan is still
fulfilled, where such modifications do not create a disconnected street
alignment with existing development, and where the street alignment is not
shifted onto another property. All other modifications shall be approved after
application and approval as set forth this section.
   B.   Public hearings. Upon application, the city’s Planning Commission shall
hold a public hearing thereon. Notice of the public hearing shall be published

After conducting the public hearing, the city’s Planning Commission shall
submit its recommendation to the Common Council.
   C.   Time limit and notification. The city’s Planning Commission shall act
on all proposed amendments within 60 days of the public hearing. If the city’s
Planning Commission fails to act within 60 days, the application shall be
forwarded to the Common Council as a recommendation for approval, provided
however, that the applicant for approval may waive this requirement in writing
and consent to the extension of the period.
   D.   Standards for plan amendments.  A proposed comprehensive plan amendment
shall be considered on its own merits using the following criteria as a guide:
      1.   Whether the proposed change is consistent with the policies and
overall intent of the comprehensive plan;
      2.   Whether the proposed change is warranted by changed conditions
within the neighborhood surrounding and including the subject property;
      3.   Whether and the extent to which the proposed amendment is compatible
with existing and proposed uses surrounding the subject land;
      4.   Whether and the extent to which the proposed amendment would
adversely affect the environment, services, facilities and transportation;
      5.   Whether and the extent to which the proposed amendment would result
in a logical and orderly development pattern; and
      6.   Whether and the extent to which the proposed amendment adversely
affects any other part of the city, or creates any direct or indirect adverse
effects.
   E.   Comprehensive plan amendment–posting and maintenance of signs. In
addition to the preceding requirements, the petitioner for the comprehensive
plan amendment, or his or her agent or agents, shall be required to post and
maintain an approved sign or signs on the property included in the
comprehensive plan amendment request. The sign or signs shall be posted at
least 7 calendar days prior to the city’s Planning Commission at which the
hearing shall be held and shall be maintained continuously until the
comprehensive plan amendment request has been finally approved or rejected by
the Common Council or withdrawn by petitioner. Approved signs shall be secured
from the Community Development Department. The Community Development Department
shall require a reasonable deposit sufficient to cover the cost of replacement
of the sign or signs and shall determine the number and location of the sign or
signs to be posted on the property included in the comprehensive plan
amendment. This section shall not apply to comprehensive plan amendments
instituted by the city’s Planning Commission.
   F.   Comprehensive plan amendments– notification requirements.  In addition
to the preceding requirements, the petitioner for the comprehensive plan
amendment, or his or her designated agent, shall include postal registration
data that substantiates petitioner’s good faith attempt to mail letters via
first-class mail to all property owners within 250 feet inclusive of dedicated
rights-of-ways of the area described. The mailings shall include the date set
for the hearing before the city’s Planning Commission and contemplated uses,
and shall be on a form provided by the Community Development Department. This
section shall not apply to comprehensive plan amendments instituted by the
city’s Planning Commission. In addition, the Community Development Director may
convene a neighborhood meeting to present and discuss a proposed amendment.
   G.   Fees. In addition to the preceding requirements, a fee set by
resolution of the Common Council shall be paid at the time of filing any
application for a comprehensive plan amendment. If the legal description of a
rezoning application is coterminous with a legal description for a concurrent
comprehensive plan amendment application, there shall be only 1 application
fee.

complaint under this provision, the Commission shall forward the complaint to
the State Division of Human Rights and shall have no further jurisdiction with
regard to the complaint.
   D.   Probable cause. Upon receipt of a response, the Commission shall cause
to be made such investigation into the matter as it determines necessary and
appropriate to determine whether there is probable cause to support the
allegations of discrimination.  The investigator shall be appointed or retained
by the City Attorney.
      1.   If there is no probable cause to support the allegations of
discrimination, the Commission shall dismiss the complaint.
      2.   If the Commission finds probable cause to support the allegations of
discrimination, the Commission shall direct 1 of the following actions:
         a.   Mediation of the complaint with a mediator selected by the City
Attorney, or
         b.   Conference or conciliation with the investigating official
attempting to eliminate the discriminatory or unfair practice.
   E.    Mediation and conciliation .
      1.   If the mediation or conciliation results in an agreement between the
parties, the agreement shall be reduced to writing, signed by both parties, and
adopted by the Commission.

required by §

conferences; to subpoena witnesses to appear, testify and produce records,
books, papers and other documents; to administer oaths; to take testimony; to
receive evidence; to examine and cross examine witnesses; and issue such other
orders as authorized by law.
      4.   All parties shall appear in person at the hearing and may, at their
option, be represented by counsel. All parties may, in accordance with any
order of procedures as may be determined by the Commission, present evidence,
call witnesses and present arguments bearing upon the facts alleged in the
complaint.
      5.   The Commission shall not be bound by the strict rules of evidence
applicable to courts of law or equity, but the right of cross-examination shall
be preserved. The complainant bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of
the evidence the allegations in the complaint. The testimony taken at a hearing
shall be under oath, and the entire proceeding shall be electronically
recorded, stenographically reported, or both.
   H.   Disposition of complaint. Following the hearing, the Commission shall
dispose of the complaint in 1 of the following manners:

not proven by a preponderance of the evidence or that the unlawful act or
practice complained of has been satisfactorily eliminated, rectified, and that
further proceedings are unnecessary, it shall order the dismissal of the
complaint.
      2.   If the Commission determines that the allegations of discrimination
are proven by a
preponderance of the evidence, the Commission shall state its findings of fact
and shall issue and cause to be served upon the respondent an order requiring

judgment of the Commission effectuates the purposes of this chapter.
         A majority vote of all appointed Commissioners shall be necessary for
the Commission to order any affirmative action.  The Commission may not award
monetary compensation other than back pay pursuant to subsection a., costs
pursuant to subsection g., or attorney fees in housing matters pursuant to
subsection h. above.  The Commission shall not award compensation for pain and
suffering, punitive damages, or consequential damages;

provided that in any given month, such allocation need not be even, but to the
extent that it is not, the account which is overfunded shall be entitled to

Improvements Account and 42% to the Vision Account, provided that in any given
month, such allocation need not be exactly according to the ratio, but to the
extent that it is not, the account which is overfunded shall be entitled to

determine. The monies in the Capital Improvements Account shall be used for the
purposes identified in division A. of this section. The monies in the Vision

financed through the use of the Fund under such terms and conditions that the
City Council agrees to.
   A.   Capital Improvements Account. The funds in the Capital Improvements
Account shall be used to finance streets, municipal buildings, information
technology infrastructure and other capital projects or purchases. The City
Council shall approve a 5-year plan for financing projects and purchases out of
this account. The City Council shall be authorized to issue revenue bonds to be
paid from the Fund in order to finance the projects contained in the plan. In
order to facilitate the creation of the 5-year plan there will be a Capital
Improvements Committee to review proposed expenditures and make recommendations
to the City Council.
      1.   Capital Improvements Committee.
         a.   The Committee membership shall consist of 1 Alderman from each
ward of the city. Committee membership shall be as appointed by the Council
leadership. If an Alderman is unable to attend the meeting, the other Alderman
from that ward may attend and vote in that Alderman's place. The Chairperson of

members and shall each have 1 vote. Three members present shall constitute a
quorum of the Committee.

         c.   Capital Improvements Committee meeting shall be scheduled for the
third Friday of each month or an alternate date as may be established by the

shall meet no less than once per quarter. Additional meetings may be called by
the Chairperson at the request of a member of the Committee, the Mayor, or a
department director.

each meeting of the Capital Improvements Committee. Regardless of meeting
frequency, the financial report shall be provided at least quarterly to the
Committee.
         b.   The Chairperson of the Capital Improvements Committee shall
provide an update to the Common Council following each meeting of the
Committee, but in no case less than quarterly.
   B.   Vision Account. The City Council shall by resolution adopt a plan for
projects or programs to be funded, in whole or in part, from the Vision
Account. No portion of the Vision Account shall be used to fund any project or
program not included in the plan. All projects included in the plan shall be
located within the city limits of Rapid City or benefit the city as a whole.
The City Council may use the Vision Account to finance buildings, facilities,
infrastructure or other capital projects, but may not use the Vision Account to
finance ongoing maintenance and operational expenses of the various city
departments, or of any buildings and/or facilities included in the plan. The
City Council shall be authorized to issue revenue bonds to be paid from the
Fund in order to finance the projects contained in the plan. The Vision Account
may be used to fund the operational expenses of economic development projects
or programs.
      1.   Procedure for approval of Vision Account projects.
         a.   The City Council shall adopt a plan for projects to be funded in
whole or in part from the Vision Account.  The Council shall have the
discretion to determine the length (in years) of each plan period, which shall
be set by resolution prior to the solicitation of proposals as provided below.
Projects to be included in the plan shall be identified through the process
outlined in §
3.16.090B.1.b. of this section. At least annually, the City Council shall
review the plan at a public hearing after providing notice thereof. The City
Council may add, remove, alter the scope of, reprioritize projects, or
otherwise amend the plan as it deems appropriate. If a private entity or
organization is approved for funding in future years of the plan, such funding
shall be subject to this provision until such time as an agreement securing the
funds is entered into pursuant to §
3.16.090B.3.c. In the event that revenues allocable to the Fund have been
pledged to secure bonds which are expected to remain outstanding during an
upcoming plan period, such projects are required to remain in the plan.
         b.   The process for determining which projects to include in the plan
are as follows:
            i.   The Mayor will direct that city staff identify and bring
forward projects consistent with the criteria established in §
3.16.090B.2. The Mayor and the city department directors will prioritize those
projects based on factors such as need and cost. The prioritized list of
projects shall be presented to the City Council at the same time as the list of
projects recommended by the citizen committee.
            ii.   Prior to the beginning of any plan period, the Mayor shall
appoint a citizen committee consisting of a chair person and 8 additional
members. The Mayor's appointments are subject to confirmation by the City
Council.  The committee members shall all be citizens of Rapid City. The
purpose of this committee will be to accept and take comments on potential
Vision Account projects other than those projects identified by the Mayor and
city staff pursuant to §
3.16.090B.1.b.i. Upon formation of the committee, the city shall publicly
solicit invitations to make proposals for projects to be considered in the next
plan. No sooner than 30 days from the solicitation of proposals, the committee
shall hold a public hearing to take comment on and discuss the proposals.  The
committee may hold additional public hearings if it deems such additional
hearings necessary. The city shall advertise all hearings, but publication of
such notice in the official newspaper of the city shall not be necessary. Based
on its work, the committee shall prioritize the proposed projects based on the
criteria established in §
3.16.090B.2. and make recommendations to the City Council regarding which
projects if any should be funded. The recommendations of the committee shall be
presented to the City Council for its consideration at the same time as the
recommendations in §
3.16.090B.1.b.i.
            iii.   The process identified in this section shall be the process
for the adoption of all subsequent plans for the Vision Account.
      2.   Criteria for the selection of projects. The plan for the Vision
Account adopted by the City Council, along with the project recommendations
made by staff and/or the citizen committee, shall be based on the goals and
action items identified in the city's Comprehensive Plan and other guiding
documents. The plan shall be developed in conjunction with the long term plans
for the city's other funds and long term budget goals. The purpose of the plan
will be to identify those projects and programs that will provide the greatest
return on investment in terms of meeting the demand for public infrastructure,
facilities and services by systematically managing the selection, scheduling
and financing of eligible projects. When the City Council prepares the plan it
should assess the needs of the city and establish priorities for the use of the
Fund. The City Council is expected to take into consideration all of the funds
and projects being undertaken by the city to ensure that the money in the Fund
is spent in a way that accomplishes the city's long term goals and priorities.
      3.   Additional criteria for Vision Account projects.
         a.   If the proposed project is for a permanent building or structure,
the applicant proposing the project shall include a scope of work and a clear
written statement describing the proposed project in order for the City Council
to evaluate the request. This statement should be accompanied with the
applicant's best estimate of probable project design and construction costs
along with a timeline showing when probable expenditures will be made. A
schedule of various phases of study, planning, design and construction
necessary to accomplish the complete project shall be prepared and made
available to the City Council.
         b.   Any application to fund a permanent structure, building, or
facility shall include an estimate of the project's ongoing operation and
maintenance costs. Unless otherwise agreed to by the city, the entity proposing
said project or program will incur all costs associated with the operations
and/or administration of said project or program.
         c.   If a private organization or entity is approved for funding, they
must enter into a contract with the city which will outline the project scope
and expectations of the city with relation to payments from the Fund prior to
being eligible to receive any monies from the Vision Account. The contract
shall include a timeframe by which the project will be completed or by which
certain benchmarks will be reached. The contract shall include a provision
which allows the city to terminate the agreement and reallocate any funds
committed to the project if the timeframes or benchmarks are not met.

authorize payment.

property, the rural fire protection district must apply the payment to its
indebtedness, unless the district would get charged an early payment penalty,
then the district shall apply the payment at the next debt service payment due
date.  Future notices and information from the rural fire protection district
should reflect all payments made by the city pursuant to this section.

include fire-fighting equipment such as breathing apparatus and portable
radios, firefighting gear, vehicles without tanks or pumps, or vehicles that

(Ord. 6066 (part), 2015)
3.20.040  Notice of proposed annexations to rural fire protection districts.
   Upon receipt of a petition for voluntary annexation that includes property
within a rural fire protection district, city shall promptly provide written

fire protection district shall provide prompt notice to the city, including
documentation of the sale price in a form satisfactory to the Finance Officer.

previous calendar month's tax collections.  The City Finance Officer, or any
person or firm contracted by the City Finance Officer, shall be entitled to
audit the books, ledgers or franchise reports of any hotel, motel or lodging
establishment subject to the terms of this chapter, including the right to
inspect daily reports of such hotels and motels so as to ensure that the
occupancy tax assessed by this chapter is being properly remitted to the city.

of tax monies when due, which relief may be in the form of an action requiring
the offending hotel or motel owner to allow entry upon their property and
access to their records, computers or books so as to verify that the hotel,
motel or lodging establishment is remitting all monies it collects pursuant to

tax remittances are due.  Should the 20th day of the month fall on a Saturday
or a Friday that is a holiday observed by the city, the occupancy tax
remittances shall be due on the last business day immediately preceding the

first business day immediately following the 20th.
   B.   All amounts that are not received on or before the due date will be

pay such tax shall also constitute a violation of this chapter, which may be
punishable by a fine not to exceed $200.  Each day that the payment is overdue
shall constitute a separate offense.  Any unpaid balance under this chapter
shall constitute a lien upon the property owned by the business or user of
space being taxed, shall become a lien against and shall run with the property,
and may be enforced and collected in the same manner as other unpaid real
property taxes and assessments.  The City Finance Officer shall certify all
unpaid amounts or balances to the County Treasurer for collection in the same

permits or licenses, or any renewals thereof, to any business or premise that
fails to conform to the provisions of this chapter, including but not limited

subject to supervision by the state through the state's Department of Revenue,

5.65.020  Initial review of basic cable rates.
   A.   Notice.  Upon the adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter
and the certification of the city by the FCC, the city shall immediately notify
all cable operators in the city, by certified mail, return receipt requested,
that the city intends to regulate subscriber rates charged for the basic
service tier and associated equipment as authorized by the Cable Act of 1992.
   B.   Cable operator response.  Within 30 days of receiving notice from the
city, a cable operator shall file with the city, its current rates for the
basic service tier and associated equipment and any supporting material
concerning the reasonableness of its rates.
   C.   Expedited determination and public hearing.
      1.   If the Common Council is able to expeditiously determine that the
cable operator’s rates for the basic service tier and associated equipment are
within the FCC’s reasonable rate standard, as determined by the applicable
benchmark, the Common Council shall:
         a.   Hold a public hearing at which interested persons may express
their views; and
         b.   Act to approve the rates within 30 days from the date the cable
operator filed its basic cable rates with the city.
      2.   If the Common Council takes no action within 30 days from the date
the cable operator filed its basic cable rates with the city, the proposed
rates will continue in effect.
   D.   Extended review period.
      1.   If the Common Council is unable to determine whether the rates in
issue are within the FCC’s reasonable rate standard based on the material
before it, or if the cable operator submits a cost-of-service showing, the
Common Council shall, within 30 days from the date the cable operator filed its
basic cable rates with the city and by adoption of a formal resolution, invoke
the following additional periods of time, as applicable, to make a final
decision:
         a.   Ninety days if the Common Council needs more time to ensure that
a rate is within the FCC’s reasonable rate standard; or
         b.   One hundred fifty days if the cable operator has submitted a
cost-of-service showing seeking to justify a rate above the applicable
benchmark.
      2.   If the Common Council has not made a decision within the 90- or 150-
day period, the Common Council shall issue a brief written order at the end of
the period requesting the cable operator to keep accurate account of all
amounts received by reason of the proposed rate and on whose behalf the amounts
are paid.
   E.   Public hearing.  During the extended review period and before taking
action on the proposed rate, the Common Council shall hold at least 1 public
hearing at which interested persons may express their views and record
objections.
   F.   Objections.  An interested person who wishes to make an objection to
the proposed initial basic rate may request the Director of Finance to record
the objection during the public hearing or may submit the objection in writing
anytime before the decision resolution is adopted.  In order for an objection
to be made part of the record, the objector must provide the Director of
Finance with the objector’s name and address.
   G.   Benchmark analysis.  If a cable operator submits its current basic
cable rate schedule as being in compliance with the FCC’s reasonable rate
standard, the Common Council shall review the rates using the benchmark
analysis in accordance with the standard form authorized by the FCC.  Based on
the Common Council’s findings, the initial basic rates shall be established as
follows:
      1.   If the current basic cable rates are below the benchmark, those
rates shall become the initial basic cable rates and the cable operator’s rates
will be capped at that level.
      2.   If the current basic cable rates exceed the benchmark, the rates
shall be the greater of the cable operator’s per channel rate on September 30,
1992, reduced by 10%, or the applicable benchmark, adjusted for inflation and
any change in the number of channels occurring between September 30, 1992, and
the initial date of regulation.
      3.   If the current basic cable rates exceed the benchmark, but the cable
operator’s per channel rate was below the benchmark on September 30, 1992, the
initial basic cable rate shall be the benchmark, adjusted for inflation.
   H.   Cost-of-service showings.  If a cable operator does not wish to reduce
the rates to the permitted level, the cable operator shall have the opportunity
to submit a cost-of-service showing in an attempt to justify the initial basic
cable rate above the FCC’s reasonable rate standard.  The Common Council will
review a cost-of-service submission pursuant to FCC standards for cost-of-
service review.  The Common Council may approve initial basic cable rates above
the benchmark if the cable operator makes the necessary showing; however, a
cost-of-service determination resulting in rates below the benchmark or below
the cable operator’s September 30, 1992 rates minus 10%, will prescribe the
cable operator’s new rates.
   I.   Decision.
      1.   By formal resolution.  After completion of its review of the cable
operator’s proposed rates, the Common Council shall adopt its decision by
formal resolution.  The decision shall include 1 of the following:
         a.   If the proposal is within the FCC’s reasonable rate standard or
is justified by a cost-of-service analysis, the Common Council shall approve
the initial basic cable rates proposed by the cable operator; or
         b.   If the proposal is not within the FCC’s reasonable rate standard
and the cost-of-service analysis, if any, does not justify the proposed rates,
the Common Council shall establish initial basic cable rates that are within
the FCC’s reasonable rate standard or that are justified by a cost-of-service
analysis.
      2.   Rollbacks and refunds.  If the Common Council determines that the
initial basic cable rates as submitted exceed the reasonable rate standard or
that the cable operator’s cost-of-service showing justifies lower rates, the
Common Council may order the rates reduced in accordance with subsection G. or
H. of this section, as applicable.  In addition, the Common Council may order
the cable operator to pay to subscribers, refunds of the excessive portion of
the rates with interest (computed at applicable rates published by the Internal
Revenue Service for tax refunds and additional tax payments), retroactive to
September 1, 1993.  The method for paying any refund and the interest rate will
be in accordance with FCC regulations as directed in the Common Council’s
decision resolution.
      3.   Statement of reasons for decision and public notice.  If rates
proposed by a cable operator are disapproved in whole or in part, or if there
were objections made by other parties to the proposed rates, the resolution
must state the reasons for the decision and the Common Council must give public
notice of its decision.  Public notice will be given by advertisement once in
the official newspaper of the city.
   J.   Appeal.  The Common Council’s decision concerning rates for the basic
service tier or associated equipment may be appealed to the FCC in accordance
with applicable federal regulations.
(Ord. 3170 (part), 1994)
5.65.030  Review of request for increase in basic cable rates.
   A.   Notice.  A cable operator in the city who wishes to increase the rates
for the basic service tier or associated equipment shall file a request with
the city and notify all subscribers at least 30 days before the cable operator
desires the increase to take effect.  This notice may not be given more often
than annually and not until at least 1 year after the determination of the
initial basic cable rates.
   B.   Expedited determination and public hearing.
      1.   If the Common Council is able to expeditiously determine that the
cable operator’s rate increase request for basic cable service is within the
FCC’s reasonable rate standard, as determined by the applicable price cap, the
Common Council shall:
         a.   Hold a public hearing at which interested persons may express
their views; and
         b.   Act to approve the rate increase within 30 days from the date the
cable operator filed its request with the city.
      2.   If the Common Council takes no action within 30 days from the date
the cable operator filed its request with the city, the proposed rates will go
into effect.
   C.   Extended review period.
      1.   If the Common Council is unable to determine whether the rate
increase is within the FCC’s reasonable rate standard based on the material
before it, or if the cable operator submits a cost-of-service showing, the
Common Council shall, by adoption of a formal resolution, invoke the following
additional periods of time, as applicable, to make a final determination:
         a.   Ninety days if the Common Council needs more time to ensure that
the requested increase is within the FCC’s reasonable rate standard as
determined by the applicable price cap; and
         b.   One hundred fifty days if the cable operator has submitted a
cost-of-service showing seeking to justify a rate increase above the applicable
price cap.
      2.   The proposed rate increase is tolled during the extended review
period; and
      3.   If the Common Council has not made a decision within the 90- or 150-
day period, the Common Council shall issue a brief written order at the end of
the period requesting the cable operator to keep accurate account of all
amounts received by reason of the proposed rate increase and on whose behalf
the amounts are paid.
   D.   Public hearing.  During the extended review period and before taking
action on the requested rate increase, the Common Council shall hold at least 1
public hearing at which interested persons may express their views and record
objections.
   E.   Objections.  An interested person who wishes to make an objection to
the proposed rate increase may request the Director of Finance to record the
objection during the public hearing or may submit the objection in writing
anytime before the decision resolution is adopted.  In order for an objection
to be made part of the record, the objector must provide the Director of
Finance with the objector’s name and address.
   F.   Delayed determination.  If the Common Council is unable to make a final
determination concerning a requested rate increase within the extended time
period, the cable operator may put the increase into effect, subject to
subsequent refund if the Common Council later issues a decision disapproving
any portion of the increase.
   G.   Price cap analysis.  If a cable operator presents its request for a
rate increase as being in compliance with the FCC’s price cap, the Common
Council shall review the rate using the price cap analysis in accordance with
the standard form authorized by the FCC.  Based on the Common Council’s
findings, the basic cable rates shall be established as follows:
      1.   If the proposed basic cable rate increase is within the price cap
established by the FCC, the proposed rates shall become the new basic cable
rates.
      2.   If the proposed basic cable rate increase exceeds the price cap
established by the FCC, the Common Council shall disapprove the proposed rate
increase and order an increase that is in compliance with the price cap.
   H.   Cost-of-service showings.  If a cable operator submits a cost-of-
service showing in an attempt to justify a rate increase above the price cap,
the Common Council will review the submission pursuant to the FCC standards for
cost-of-service review.  The Common Council may approve a rate increase above
the price cap if the cable operator makes the necessary showing; however, a
cost-of-service determination resulting in a rate below the price cap or below
the cable operator’s then current rate will prescribe the cable operator's new
rate.
   I.   Decision.  The Common Council’s decision concerning the requested rate
increase shall be adopted by formal resolution.  If a rate increase proposed by
a cable operator is disapproved in whole or in part, or if objections were made
by other parties to the proposed rate increase, the resolution must state the
reasons for the decision.  Objections may be made at the public hearing by a
person requesting the Director of Finance to record the objection or may be
submitted in writing at any time before the decision resolution is adopted.
   J.   Refund.
      1.   The Common Council may order refunds of subscribers’ rate payments
with interest if:
         a.   The Common Council was unable to make a decision within the
extended time period as described in subsection C. of this section;
         b.   The cable operator implemented the rate increase at the end of
the extended review period; and
         c.   The Common Council determines that the rate increase as submitted
exceeds the applicable price cap or that the cable operator failed to justify
the rate increase by a cost-of-service showing, and the Common Council
disapproves any portion of the rate increase.
      2.   The method for paying any refund and the interest rate will be in
accordance with FCC regulations as directed in the Common Council’s decision
resolution.
   K.   Appeal.  The Common Council’s decision concerning rates for the basic
service tier or associated equipment may be appealed to the FCC in accordance
with applicable federal guidelines.
(Ord. 3170 (part), 1994)
5.65.040  Cable operator information.
   A.   City may require.
      1.   In those cases when the cable operator has submitted initial rates
or proposed an increase that exceeds the reasonable rate standard, the Common
Council may require the cable operator to produce information in addition to
that submitted, including proprietary information, if needed to make a rate
determination. In these cases, a cable operator may request the information be
kept confidential in accordance with this section.
      2.   In cases where initial or proposed rates comply with the reasonable
rate standard, the Common Council may request additional information only in
order to document that the cable operator’s rates are in accord with the
standard.
   B.   Request for confidentiality.
      1.   A cable operator submitting information to the Common Council may
request in writing that the information not be made routinely available for
public inspection.  A copy of the request shall be attached to and cover all
the information and all copies of the information to which it applies.
      2.   If feasible, the information to which the request applies shall be
physically separated from any information to which the request does not apply. 
If this is not feasible, the portion of the information to which the request
applies shall be identified.
      3.   Each request shall contain a statement of the reasons for
withholding inspection and a statement of the facts upon which those reasons
are based.
      4.   Casual requests which do not comply with the requirements of this
subsection shall not be considered.
   C.   Common Council action.  Requests which comply with the requirements of
subsection B. of this section will be acted upon by the Common Council.  The
Common Council will grant the request if the cable operator presents by a
preponderance of the evidence, a case for nondisclosure consistent with
applicable federal regulations.  If the request is granted, the ruling will be
placed in a public file in lieu of the information withheld from public
inspection.  If the request does not present a case for nondisclosure and the
Common Council denies the request, the Common Council shall take 1 of the
following actions:
      1.   If the information has been submitted voluntarily without any
direction from the city, the cable operator may request that the city return
the information without considering it.  Ordinarily, the city will comply with
this request.  Only in the unusual instance that the public interest so
requires, will the information be made available for public inspection.
      2.   If the information was required to be submitted by the Common
Council, the information will be made available for public inspection.
   D.   Appeal.  If the Common Council denies the request for confidentiality,
the cable operator may seek review of that decision from the FCC within 5
working days of the Common Council’s decision, and the release of the
information will be stayed pending review.
(Ord. 3170 (part), 1994)
5.65.050  Automatic rate adjustments.
   A.   Annual inflation adjustment.  In accordance with FCC regulations, the
cable operator may adjust its capped base per channel rate for the basic
service tier annually by the final GNP-PI index.
   B.   Other external costs.
      1.   The FCC regulations also allow the cable operator to increase its
rate for the basic service tier automatically to reflect certain external cost
factors to the extent that the increase in cost of those factors exceeds the
GNP-PI.  These factors include retransmission consent fees, programming costs,
state and local taxes applicable to the provision of cable television service,
and costs of franchise requirements.  The total cost of an increase in a
franchise fee may be automatically added to the base per channel rate, without
regard to its relation to the GNP-PI.
      2.   For all categories of external costs other than retransmission
consent and franchise fees, the starting date for measuring changes in external
costs for which the basic service per channel rate may be adjusted will be the
date on which the basic service tier becomes subject to regulation or February
28, 1994, whichever occurs first.  The permitted per channel charge may not be
adjusted for costs of retransmission consent fees or changes in those fees
incurred before October 6, 1994.
   C.   Notification and review.  The cable operator shall notify the city at
least 30 days in advance of a rate increase based on automatic adjustment
items.  The city shall review the increase to determine whether the item or
items qualify as automatic adjustments.  If the city makes no objection within
30 days of receiving notice of the increase, the increase may go in effect.
(Ord. 3170 (part), 1994)
5.65.060  Enforcement.
   A.   Refunds.  The city may in accordance with FCC regulation order the
cable operator to refund to subscribers a portion of previously paid rates
under the following circumstances:
      1.   A portion of the previously paid rates have been determined to be in
excess of the permitted tier charge or above the actual cost of equipment; or
      2.   The cable operator has failed to comply with a valid rate order
issued by the city.
   B.   Fines.  If the cable operator fails to comply with a rate decision or
refund order, the cable operator shall be subject to a fine of $1,000 for each
day the cable operator fails to comply.

omission within the provisions of this chapter. Knowledge of the unlawfulness

      Knowledge may be inferred if the prohibited conduct occurred openly, such
that a reasonable person would have observed it based on locations within the

inferred if adequate warnings were given of violations of this chapter and
management chose to ignore those warnings by failing to take reasonable steps,
such as training or other corrective measures, to keep that conduct from
potentially reoccurring. In either case and absent some direct evidence that
management instructed employees as defined herein to perform acts prohibited
under the ordinance, if adult oriented business violations occurred
chronically, then it may be inferred that the licensee knowingly allowed the
act to occur on the premises.

animal control authority a sworn, written complaint on a form approved by the
city’s designated animal control authority.  Upon receipt of the complaint, an
Animal Control Officer shall notify the owner of the animal that a complaint
has been filed and that an investigation into the allegations as set forth in
the complaint will be conducted.  The Animal Control Officer will initiate his
or her investigation within 2 business days after receipt of the complaint.
      3.   At any time during the course of an investigation, the Animal
Control Officer may impound the animal being investigated if the Animal Control
Officer determines that the public safety so requires.
   C.   Investigation.
      1.   The Animal Control Officer shall thoroughly investigate each
complaint to determine if the animal is dangerous or potentially dangerous. 
The Animal Control Officer shall consider all relevant factors, including, but
not limited to severity of injury to the victim, statements from witnesses/
victims, previous aggressive history of the animal, observable behavior of the
animal, and circumstances of the incident.
      2.   At the conclusion of an investigation, the Animal Control Officer
may:
         a.   Find that the animal is neither dangerous nor potentially
dangerous and, if the animal is impounded and not quarantined pending a rabies
evaluation, release the animal to its owner upon payment of any impoundment
fees; or
         b.   Find that the animal is potentially dangerous and order the owner
to comply with the requirements for keeping potentially dangerous animals set
forth in subsection J. of this section, and, if the animal is impounded and not
quarantined pending a rabies evaluation, release the animal to its owner after
the owner has paid all fees incurred for the impoundment and complied with the
relevant parts of subsection J. of this section.  If all impoundment fees have
not been paid and conditions met within 10 business days after the owner
receives notice that the Animal Control Officer has found the animal to be
potentially dangerous, the Animal Control Officer shall cause the animal to be
destroyed. The destruction shall not relieve the owner of the responsibility
for payment of impoundment fees.
         c.   Find that the animal is dangerous and order the animal destroyed
in accordance with subsection K. of this section.
   D.   Notification of Dangerous or Potentially Dangerous Animal Finding.

registered mail of the animal’s designation as a dangerous or potentially
dangerous animal.  In the case of a potentially dangerous animal, the notice
shall state any specific restrictions and conditions for keeping the animal, as
set forth in subsection J. of this section.  The Animal Control Officer also
shall notify the City Attorney and the Police Department of the designation of
any animal as a dangerous or potentially dangerous animal.  The notification
shall describe the animal and specify any requirements or conditions placed
upon the animal or owner.
      2.   The notice shall inform the owner that he or she may request, in
writing, within 5 business days after delivery of the notice, a hearing to

instructions on how to appeal the finding and designation.
   E.   Notification to complainant.  In all cases, the Animal Control Officer
shall notify the complainant of the Animal Control Officer’s finding and
designation within 3 days of making the finding and designation.  Notice to the
complainant shall be made by first class mail, and shall contain instructions
on how to appeal the fording and designation.
   F.   Destruction of unclaimed animal.  If the animal control officer cannot
with due diligence locate the owner of an animal that has been seized pursuant
to this section, the Animal Control Officer shall cause the animal to be
impounded for not less than 5 business days.  If, after 5 business days, the
owner fails to claim the animal, the Animal Control Officer may cause the
animal to be destroyed.
   G.   Dangerous Animal Review Board.
      1.   There is established a Dangerous Animal Review Board which shall

Dangerous Animal Review Board shall be chaired by the head of the city’s
designated animal control authority who shall select 1 individual from each of
the above categories to serve as the remaining members of the Dangerous Animal
Review Board.  The head of the city’s designated animal control authority shall
be a non-voting member, and shall serve as a hearing administrator only.  In no

which that member has a personal or professional interest.
      3.   In the event the head of the city’s designated animal control
authority is unable to perform his or her duties as a member of the Dangerous
Animal Review Board, he or she shall select an alternate to act in his or her
stead.  The alternate shall be a local physician or animal trainer.  The
alternate shall chair the hearing, and select the individuals to serve as the
remaining members of the Dangerous Animal Review Board for that appeal.
      4.   The Dangerous Animal Review Board shall be a voluntary position and
no additional compensation shall be paid to the members thereof by the city.
   H.   Hearing on dangerous or potentially dangerous animal declaration.

hearing before the Dangerous Animal Review Board within 5 business days after
receiving the Animal Control Officer’s determination.  The Dangerous Animal
Review Board shall hold a hearing not less than 3 nor more than 10 business

hearing.  The purpose of the hearing shall be to uphold, overturn or modify the
Animal Control Officer’s fording and determination.  The Chair of the Dangerous
Animal Review Board shall provide notice of the date, time and location of the

after the hearing.
      4.   A determination by the Dangerous Animal Review Board that the animal
is a potentially dangerous animal shall subject the animal and its owner to the
provisions of subsection J. of this section.  A determination that the animal
is a dangerous animal shall result in the dangerous animal being destroyed on
the sixth business day after the owner receives notice of the Dangerous Animal
Review Board’s determination.
      5.   Failure of either the owner or the complainant to request a hearing
within the prescribed time shall result in the Animal Control Officer’s
determination being a final determination.
   I.   Appeal from dangerous or potentially dangerous animal declaration.  If
the Dangerous Animal Review Board determines that an animal is dangerous or
potentially dangerous after a hearing conducted under subsection H. of this
section, that decision shall be final unless the owner or complainant, within 5

dangerous or potentially dangerous, applies to the Circuit Court for any
remedies that may be available.
   J.   Keeping of potentially dangerous animals.  No person may keep within

dangerous animal to be kept on a chain, rope or other type of leash outside its
kennel or pen unless a person capable of controlling the animal is in physical
control or the leash.
      2.   Muzzle.  It is unlawful for any owner or keeper of a potentially
dangerous animal to allow the animal to be outside of its proper enclosure
unless it is necessary for the animal to receive veterinary care or exercise. 
In such cases, the animal shall wear a properly fitted muzzle to prevent it
from biting humans or other animals.  The muzzle shall not interfere with the
animal’s breathing or vision.
      3.   Confinement.  Except when leashed and muzzled as provided in this
section, a potentially dangerous animal shall be securely confined indoors or
confined in a locked pen or other secure enclosure that is suitable to prevent
the animal from escaping.  The enclosure shall include shelter and protection

the animal cannot exit the enclosure on its own.
      4.   Indoor confinement.  No potentially dangerous animal shall be kept
on a porch, patio or in any part of a house or structure that would allow the
animal to exit the building on its own volition.  In addition, no potentially

doors are the only obstacle preventing the animal from exiting the structure.
      5.   Signs.  All owners, keepers or harborers of potentially dangerous
animals shall display in a prominent place on any entrance to their premises a
sign easily readable by the public using the words “Beware of [type of
animal].”
      6.   Sterilization of potentially dangerous animals.  All potentially
dangerous animals shall be permanently altered so that they are unable to
reproduce.  The alteration shall occur prior to the issuance of the potentially
dangerous animal permit.  For male animals, sterilization shall mean
castration.
      7.   Obedience class.  The owner or keeper of a potentially dangerous
animal shall, with the potentially dangerous animal, attend an obedience
training course of a duration not less than 4 weeks.  This must be completed

designated animal control authority to harbor the animal.  The fee for the
permit shall be $100 per year.  The permit for maintaining a potentially
dangerous animal shall be presented to an Animal Control Officer upon demand.
      9.   Tag.  At the time the permit is issued, a red circular tag shall be
issued to the owner of the potentially dangerous animal by the city’s
designated animal control authority.  The tag shall be worn at all times by the
animal, if biologically possible.
      10.   Collar.  At the time the permit is issued, a colorfast, fluorescent
green colored vest of sufficient and standard design as to easily identify the
animal as a potentially dangerous animal shall be issued to the owner of the
potentially dangerous animal.  The vest shall be worn whenever the animal is
outside of the owner’s house to clearly and easily identify it as a potentially
dangerous animal.
      11.   Notification of escape.  The owner or keeper of a potentially
dangerous animal shall notify the city’s designated animal control authority
immediately if the animal escapes from its enclosure or restraint and is at
large.  The immediate notification shall also be required if the animal bites
or attacks a person or domestic animal or livestock.
      12.   Microchip.  Prior to the issuance of a permit, the animal shall
have an identifying microchip implanted, if biologically possible.
      13.   Failure to comply.  It is unlawful and a Class II misdemeanor for
any owner of a potentially dangerous animal to fail to comply with the
requirements and conditions set forth in this section.  Any animal found by an
Animal Control Officer to be in violation of this section shall be immediately
seized and destroyed on the second business day after seizure.  Upon the third
violation by 1 owner, the city’s designated animal control authority shall
refuse to issue that owner any future potentially dangerous animal permits and
shall revoke all outstanding potentially dangerous animal permits issued to
that owner.

transfers ownership, custody or residence of the animal shall, within 10
business days after the change of ownership or residence, provide written
notification to the city’s designated animal control authority of the name,
address and telephone number of the new owner.  It also shall be the
responsibility of the person transferring ownership or custody of the animal to
provide written notification of the animal’s classification as potentially
dangerous to the person receiving the animal.  The previous owner shall furnish
a copy of the notification to the city’s designated animal control authority
along with written acknowledgment by the new owner of his or her receipt of the
notification.  The new owner shall notify the city’s designated animal control
authority and the Police Department of any changes of ownership, custody or
residence of the animal within 3 business days after receiving the required
information from the previous owner.
      2.   Any person receiving an animal classified as potentially dangerous
must obtain the required permit, tag and enclosure prior to acquisition of the
animal.  The new owner shall comply fully with the provisions of this section
pertaining to obtaining bond, payment of fees and maintenance, control and
ownership of a potentially dangerous animal.
   M.   Continuation of potentially dangerous animal declaration.
      1.   Any animal that has been declared potentially dangerous by any
agency or department of the city, another municipality, county or state shall
be subject to the provisions of this section for the remainder of its life
unless the potentially dangerous animal designation is removed in accordance
with subsection M.2. of this section.  The person owning or having custody of
any animal designated as a potentially dangerous animal by any municipality,
county or state government shall notify the city’s designated animal control
authority of the animal’s address and conditions of maintenance within 10 days

the city.
      2.   The owner of any potentially dangerous animal may petition the
Dangerous Animal Review Board for a removal of the potentially dangerous animal
designation after 3 consecutive years during which the owner has received no

the owner’s petition, review the designation of an animal as potentially
dangerous and, if the animal is determined no longer to be potentially
dangerous, the potentially dangerous animal designation shall be removed.
   N.   Police and military animals.  Nothing in this section shall be
construed to limit, affect or apply to the use of animals by law enforcement,
military or rescue organizations.

6.08.190  Animals having bitten or attacked a person–Impoundment, quarantine
and observation–Disposition.
   A.   All impound procedures will be in accordance with the current
Compendium of Animal Rabies Control promulgated by the National Association of
State Public Health Veterinarians, Inc.
   B.   Whenever any dog, cat or other animal bites or attacks a person, the

Animal Control Officer or contracted agent.
   C.   Any animal which bites or attacks a person, shall be quarantined at the
direction of the Animal Control Officer, authorized personnel of the contracted
agent or the Police Department for a period of not less than 10 days, and shall
not be released from quarantine except by written permission of the Animal
Control Officer or authorized personnel of the contracted agent during
quarantine, the animal shall be securely confined and kept from contact with
any other animal or humans other than the caretaker.  If the animal has bitten
or attacked while on the premises of the owner and the owner has a current
rabies vaccination for the animal, the Animal Control Officer or contracted
agent may, if it is determined that the facilities are adequate and the owners
are responsible persons, quarantine the animal on the owner’s premises.  The
quarantined animal must, at all times, be available for inspection during the
quarantine period.  If other confinement is required, the owner shall surrender
the animal for the quarantine period to the animal shelter or shall, at his or
her own expense, place it in a veterinary hospital.
   D.   Any quarantined animal may be reclaimed by the owner if it is showing
no signs known to exist or be present in rabid animals.  Upon physical
examination of animal by a licensed veterinarian, to be conducted within 5 days
after release from quarantine, the quarantine period will be considered
complete; however, the animal will not be declared free of rabies, only that it
is showing no clinical signs or symptoms known to be present in active cases of
rabies.
   E.   If an animal suspected of having rabies or exposed to rabies or an
animal which has bitten a human dies while under quarantine, its head shall be
sent to a competent laboratory for a pathological examination.  The carcass of
any such dead animal shall, upon demand, be surrendered to the Animal Control
Officer or contracted agent who shall also direct the disposition of any animal
found to be infected with rabies or found in violation of §
6.08.100 of this section.  No person shall fail or refuse to surrender any
animal for quarantine or destruction as required herein when a demand is made
therefor by the Animal Control Officer.
   F.   When reports give a positive diagnosis of rabies, the Animal Control
Officer or authorized personnel of the contracted agent may designate an area
as quarantined for a period of 30 days, and upon the indication of the
quarantine no animal capable of transmitting rabies shall be taken into the
area or be permitted to be taken out of the area during the period of
quarantine.
   G.   Any animal that has bitten any person may be euthanized by order of the
Health Officer or a physician or a veterinarian from the Board of Health unless
proof of a current rabies vaccination effected not less than 30 days prior to
the bite is provided within 24 hours of the bite.  Any animal that has bitten
any person may be euthanized by order of the Health Officer if in the Health
Officer’s opinion, based on sound medical judgments, a greater risk to human
life exists by not so doing.  In making such a determination, the Health
Officer shall take into consideration the following facts:
      1.   The history of the animal, including the possibility of its exposure
to rabies;
      2.   The vaccination record of the animal;
      3.   The health of the animal;
      4.   The nature, location and seriousness of the bite;
      5.   The circumstances surrounding the bite, including whether or not the
bite was provoked; and

   It shall be the duty of every physician, or other practitioner, to report to
the Animal Control Officer or authorized personnel of the contracted agent, the
names and addresses of persons treated for bites inflicted by animals, together
with the information as will be helpful in rabies control.
(Ord. 2900 (part), 1991: prior code § 6-28)
6.08.220  Veterinarian’s duty to report suspected rabies cases.
   It shall be the duty of every licensed veterinarian to report to the Animal
Control Officer or contracted agent his or her diagnosis of any animal observed
by him or her as a rabies suspect.  If a veterinarian, during a routine office
examination, discovers a rabies suspect animal, the animal is to be immediately
contained on the premises and the Animal Control Officer or contracted agent is
to be immediately notified.  All quarantined animals shall be reported to the
Animal Control Officer or authorized personnel of the contracted agent.

the Abuse Investigator, the Animal Services Officer, the Shelter Manager or any
other persons of proper authority is authorized to impound any animal within
the city in a violation of any provision of this title.

provision of this chapter shall be taken by the Animal Control Officer and
impounded in the city’s Animal Shelter, and there confined in a humane manner
for a period of not less than 3 days, except as otherwise provided in §
6.08.250 of this chapter and except that, when dogs or other animals are found
running at large, and their ownership is known to the Animal Control Officer,
the dogs or other animals need not be impounded, but the Animal Control Officer
may, at his or her discretion, cite the owners of the dogs or other animals to
appear in court to answer charges of violations of this title.
   B.   Immediately upon impounding any animal, the Animal Control Officer
shall make every possible effort to notify the owner of the animal and inform
him or her of the conditions whereby he or she may regain possession of the
animal.  If a dog or other animal wearing a license tag is impounded, the
Animal Control Officer shall, immediately after impounding the dog or other
animal, and before the same is destroyed or otherwise disposed of, ascertain
the name of the owner from the records of the Animal Control Officer and inform
the owner of the conditions whereby he or she may regain possession of the dog
or other animal.  Any animal impounded and subsequently returned to its owner
shall be implanted with a microchip prior to its release from the custody of
animal control, with the cost of implantation to be borne by the owner.
(Ord. 3329 (part), 1997: Ord. 2900 (part), 1991: prior code § 6-31)
6.08.250  Impoundment–Redemption and destruction.
   A.   Subject to the provisions of subsection C. of this section, the owner
shall be entitled to regain possession of any dog or cat impounded under §
6.08.240 of this chapter, upon compliance with the vaccination and licensing
provisions contained in this title, and upon payment of the fees and charges
provided for in subsection B. of this section.  Any other animal impounded
under the provisions of §
6.08.240 may be reclaimed by the owner upon payment of fees and charges
provided for in subsection B. of this section.
   B.   Any animal impounded under §
6.08.240 of this chapter may be reclaimed as provided for in this section upon
payment by the owner to the city of the impoundment fee for each animal
reclaimed, the fee for microchip implantation, any charges for veterinarian
services rendered and an additional sum for each day each animal has been kept
in the Animal Shelter.  The impoundment fee and the per diem charge for each
day the animal was kept in the Animal Shelter shall be set by resolution of the
Council.  Fees collected pursuant to this section shall be immediately
transmitted to the City Treasurer along with all required reports.  The
impoundment fee set by resolution shall be due the city regardless of whether
the animal is reclaimed, and the city’s Finance Officer shall exercise every
means available for collection against the owner.  In the case of a contracted
Animal Control Agent, fees shall be handled in accordance with the guidelines
set forth by the mutually agreed upon contract or binding instrument.
   C.   Any animal impounded under §
6.08.240 of this chapter and not reclaimed by its owner within 3 days may be
humanely destroyed by the Animal Control Officer or sold.  A fee set by
resolution of the Common Council shall be charged, or in the case of a
contracted agent, the fee is to be determined by agent.  The Animal Control
Officer may destroy any sick or injured or feral animal which has been
impounded without holding it for 3 days, if its condition is such as to make
its earlier destruction necessary or desirable.  All animals destroyed shall be
destroyed by a humane procedure, but not by shooting.
(Ord. 3329 (part), 1997: Ord. 2900 (part), 1991: prior code § 6-32)
6.08.260  Deer baiting prohibited.
   A.   The Common Council finds that the baiting of deer by placing unnatural
food sources upon real property within the city for the purpose of attracting
deer to eat an unnatural food source has the effect of enticing deer from their
natural habitat into an unnatural urban environment, thereby endangering the
deer, resulting in an unnatural growth of the deer population, resulting in an
unnatural loss of the deer’s instinctive avoidance of humans, resulting in
reliance by deer upon the unnatural food source, and also endangering persons
and domestic animals, and resulting in damage to property.
   B.   UNNATURAL FOOD SOURCE. Any amount of grain, fruit, vegetables, nuts,
hay or other similar edible material which has the effect of attracting deer
for the purpose of eating the material.  UNNATURAL FOOD SOURCE” does not
include growing plants or the natural remainders of the growing plants.
   C.   No person being the owner or occupant of any parcel of real property
within the corporate limits of the city shall place thereon, or suffer to
remain thereon, any unnatural food source, nor shall any person place such
unnatural food source upon the real property of another.  It shall be an
affirmative defense to any prosecution hereunder that the unnatural food source
was placed not less than 5 feet above the ground and was not accessible to
deer, or that the unnatural food source was placed in good faith for the
purpose of feeding domestic livestock or pets by or at the request of a person
owning or having responsibility for the domestic livestock or pets, or that the
unnatural food source was placed in good faith for a purpose other than
attracting deer or other wildlife and that the attraction of deer is only an
incidental result.
   D.   Nothing in this section shall be construed to apply to any governmental
agency or to any employee or authorized agent thereof in the course of his or
her employment or agency. Specifically, nothing in this section shall be
construed to prohibit the baiting of deer by authorized governmental agents in
the furtherance of an approved plan to reduce deer population or in furtherance
of an approved plan to entice deer out of the urban environment into a less
urban and more natural environment.
(Ord. 3385, 1997: Ord. 3199, 1995)
6.08.270  Pet waste.
   A.   No person shall allow any animal to defecate on public or private
property other than his or her own.  If the animal does defecate upon public or
private property, the person owning or having possession, charge, custody or
control of the animal shall immediately and thoroughly clean the fecal matter
from the property.
   B.   Any person accompanied by any animal on public or private property
other than his or her own must carry with him or her visible means of cleaning
up any fecal matter left by the animal.  Service animals and animals used in
parades are exempt from the provisions of this section.

   A public nuisance may be abated without civil action by the city or its

specially injurious to him or her or any private nuisance injurious to him or
her in any manner by removing or, if necessary, destroying that which

reasonable notice shall be given to him or her before entering to abate it. The
city may defray the cost of abating a public nuisance, including administrative
costs, by taxing the cost thereof by special assessment against the real
property on which the nuisance occurred. Administrative costs shall be set by
resolution and are applicable to any public nuisance that is abated by the city
or its designee. The administrative costs for a third or subsequent abatement
in 1 calendar year, based upon the date of the abatement, may be set at a
higher amount than administrative costs for a first or second abatement in 1

article of property so abandoned, left or placed on any public or private
property, and if the same is believed to have any value, to keep it and make an

taken up by it.  It shall be the duty of the Department to maintain a place for
the keeping of any such article until the same shall be claimed or otherwise

is bid in excess of the charges or lien of the city, the excess shall be

   In order to maintain a compliance status with the United States
Environmental Protection Agency’s National Ambient Air Quality Standards and to
prevent adverse health effects that result from fugitive emissions and smoke
from wood burning and open burning, it is declared to be the policy of the City
of Rapid City, South Dakota to achieve and maintain the PM10 and PM2.5 National
Ambient Air Quality Standards by controlling fugitive emissions, open burning
and wood burning so as to protect the health and welfare of all the people who
inhabit the city; to limit environmental damage to plant and animal life within
the city; and to promote commercial and industrial development while limiting
environmental degradation; and to educate the residents of the city about air
quality issues. As air travels without regard for political boundaries,
maintaining compliance with federal air quality standards requires cooperation
between the South Dakota Department of Environment and Natural Resources and
the city and county to avoid costly consequences and protect public health in
the area where nonattainment designation is most vulnerable. This policy is to
be achieved and maintained through the development and implementation of
programs of education, air pollution prevention, abatement and control. It is
the purpose of this chapter to provide for a program of fugitive emissions
control by applying reasonably available control technology and solid fuel
smoke abatement.
(Ord. 5958 (part), 2013)
8.34.020  Applicability.
   This chapter shall apply to:
   A.   All areas within the corporate limits of Rapid City located within the

to prevent soil from going off site to public rights-of-way where soil can be
readily reentrained.
(Ord. 5958 (part), 2013)
8.34.050  Reclamation of disturbed areas.
   Landscaping and revegetation shall be completed as soon as grading or
construction has been completed, but in no case later than 14 days after
construction activity has stopped per §
8.50.040, to eliminate or reduce wind and/or water erosion. When landscaping
and/or revegetation cannot be completed immediately due to weather, the exposed
areas can be temporarily stabilized and final landscaping and/or revegetation
can be completed in the next planting season. A written reclamation plan may be
required by the Air Quality Division for sites where there are ongoing problems
with vegetative and structural stabilization.
(Ord. 5958 (part), 2013)
8.34.060  Stabilization of vacant lots.

flushing is not required if it endangers public safety or if water use
restrictions are in effect.
   F.   All vehicles that are transporting fugitive emissions emitting
materials on public roads shall be covered with a tarp to reduce the emissions
or must use a method that is equally effective in reducing the emissions.
   G.   Any material that is deposited, other than street deicing and/or
traction materials, on any paved public roadway on which vehicular travel is
not restricted, that could be reentrained as fugitive emissions shall be
cleaned or removed as soon as possible or no more than 24 hours after
deposition. The cleaning or removal process shall be conducted so that minimal
fugitive emissions are generated.
   H.   Cleaning of Paved Surfaces. Deposited materials shall be cleaned up by
using a vacuum sweeper or other method pre-approved by the Air Quality
Division. Sufficient water shall be used to prevent or minimize fugitive dust
during sweeping activities. The use of a dry mechanical broom or compressed air

increase of juvenile delinquency in the city.  It is a compelling interest and
goal of the city to protect the public from the illegal acts of juveniles
committed after the curfew hour and also to protect the juveniles from improper
influences and from criminal activity that occurs after the curfew hour.  It is
also the intent of this section to help parents control their children.  Need
for the ordinance codified in this section is substantiated by a statistical
report issued by the Police Department of the city completed in April of 1993.

Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday, or after the hour of 11:30 p.m. or
before 5:30 a.m. on any Friday or Saturday, unless accompanied by a parent,
guardian or custodian.
      2.   The foregoing notwithstanding, it shall not be a violation of this
section for a juvenile to be present in a public place if the juvenile can
establish that the presence is necessary to perform an errand or other specific
activity at the direction of the juvenile’s parent, guardian or custodian or to
travel in the most practical and expeditious route from 1 non-public place to
another non-public place at the specific direction of the juvenile’s parent,
guardian or custodian.
      3.   Further, it shall not be a violation of this section for any
juvenile to attend a special function or entertainment sponsored by any church,
school, club or other organization if the juvenile can establish that the
attendance is with the specific permission of the juvenile’s parent, guardian
or custodian.
   D.   Responsibilities of owners of public places.  It is unlawful for any
person, firm or corporation operating or having charge of any privately owned
public place to permit or suffer the presence of a juvenile upon the premises
with the knowledge that the juvenile is in violation of subsection C. of this
section.
   E.   Parents’ responsibility.  It is unlawful for the parent, guardian or
custodian of any juvenile to permit or suffer by negligent or inefficient
control of the juvenile to violate any provision of this section.  It shall not
be a violation of this section for the parent, guardian or custodian of a
juvenile to direct and permit the juvenile to be present in a public place for
the purpose of carrying out a specific errand or other specific business
activity or to participate in a specific activity of any church, school, club
or organization, or to direct and permit a juvenile to travel from one
nonpublic place to another nonpublic place by the most practical and direct
route and means.
   F.   Procedures.  Law enforcement officers are directed to follow the
following procedures in enforcing the ordinance codified in this section:
      1.   A law enforcement officer, upon finding a juvenile in a public place
during the prohibited hours, shall ascertain the name and address of the

occasion, the juvenile shall be taken into custody.  The parent, guardian or
custodian of the juvenile shall be notified to come and take custody of the
juvenile.  If the parent, guardian or custodian cannot be located or fails or
refuses to take custody of the juvenile, the juvenile shall be remanded to the
juvenile authorities.
   G.   Penalty.  A violation of this section shall be punishable by a fine not
to exceed $100 for each offense.
   H.   Construction and severability.  The city does not intend a result that
is absurd, impossible to execute or unreasonable.  It is intended that the
curfew ordinance codified in this section be held inapplicable in such cases,
if any, where its application would be unconstitutional.  Constitutional
construction is intended and shall be given.  The city does not intend to
violate the Constitution of the State of South Dakota or the Constitution of
the United States of America.  Severability is intended throughout and within
the provisions of the curfew ordinance codified in this section.  If any
provision including any exception, part, phrase or term, or the application
thereof to any person or circumstances is held to be invalid, the application
to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby and validity of
the curfew ordinance codified in this section in any and all other respects
shall not be affected.

signal when and as required by this chapter, may make the left turn and the
drivers of all other vehicles approaching the intersection from the opposite
direction shall yield the right-of-way to the vehicle making the left turn.
(Prior code § 28-68)
10.12.120  Through streets and stop intersections.
   A.   The Traffic Engineer, with the approval of the Common Council, may

erecting at every entrance thereto from all intersecting streets, signs
notifying drivers of vehicles to come to a full stop before entering or
crossing the designated streets.  The Traffic Engineer, with the approval of
the Council, may also designate hazardous intersections, by erecting at the
entrance thereto from intersecting streets, signs notifying drivers of vehicles
to come to a full stop before entering or crossing the designated streets.
   B.   Whenever signs have been erected pursuant to this section, it is
unlawful for the driver of any vehicle to fail to come to a full stop in
obedience thereto or to proceed before the main traveled or designated street
is free from oncoming traffic which may affect safe passage.  All such signs
shall be illuminated at night or so placed as to be illuminated by headlights
of an approaching vehicle or by street lights.
(Prior code § 28-69)
10.12.130  Yield intersections.
   The Traffic Engineer, with the approval of the Common Council, may designate

yield right-of-way sign is in place indicating such an intersection, the driver
of a vehicle approaching the sign shall, in obedience to the sign, slow down to
a speed reasonable for the existing conditions, or shall stop if necessary, and
shall yield the right-of-way to any pedestrian legally crossing the roadway on
which he or she is driving, and to any vehicle in the intersection or
approaching on another street so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard. 
The driver, having so yielded, may proceed and the drivers of all other
vehicles approaching the intersection shall yield to the vehicle so proceeding;
provided, however, that, if the driver is involved in a collision with a
pedestrian in a crosswalk or a vehicle in the intersection, after driving past
a yield sign without stopping, the collision shall be deemed prima facie
evidence of his or her failure to yield the right-of-way.
(Prior code § 28-70)

arbitrary exercise of the right-of-way.
(Prior code § 28-73)

of the highway, or in case of a 1-way highway the nearest edge or curb, clear
of any intersection of highways, and shall stop and remain in the position,
unless otherwise directed by a police or traffic officer, until the authorized
emergency vehicle shall have passed.  This section shall not operate to relieve
the driver of an authorized emergency vehicle from the duty to drive with due
regard for the safety of all persons using the highway, nor shall it protect
the driver of any such vehicle from the consequences of his or her reckless
disregard for the safety of others.
(Prior code § 28-74)

   A.   The operator of a motor vehicle on a 2-lane highway or a private road

indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles and pedestrians as provided by this
section.  In the event an official traffic control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable, except as to those provisions which, by their
nature, can have no application.  Any stop required shall be made at a sign or
marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking, the stop shall be made at the signal.
   B.   Green alone or “go.”  A green light alone or “go” shall indicate that:

insufficient time to cross the roadway and no pedestrian shall enter the
intersection or crosswalk under a steady yellow light.
   D.   Steady red alone or “stop.”  A steady red light alone or “stop” shall
indicate that:
      1.   Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall stop before entering the
crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then before
entering the intersection and shall remain standing until green or “go” is
shown alone.  The driver of any vehicle which is stopped as close as
practicable at the entrance to a crosswalk and to the far right side of the
roadway, in obedience to a red or “stop” signal, may make a right turn, but
shall yield the right-of-way to any pedestrian and any other traffic proceeding
as directed by the signal at the intersection, unless the turn is prohibited by
a sign erected at the intersection;
      2.   A pedestrian facing such signal shall not enter the intersection or
crosswalk under a steady red alone or “stop.”

none, then before entering the intersection, and the right to proceed shall be
subject to the rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign.
      2.   Flashing yellow (caution signal).  When a yellow lens is illuminated
with rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles may proceed through the
intersection or past the signal only with caution.
   B.   This section shall not apply to railroad grade crossings.  Conduct of
drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossing shall be governed by
the rules as set forth in §
10.12.190.

but any pedestrian who has partially completed crossing on the Walk signal or
symbolized message shall proceed to a sidewalk while the Don’t Walk signal or
symbolized message is showing.

device or railroad sign or signal, or which attempts to direct the movement of
traffic, or which hides from view or interferes with the effectiveness of any
official traffic control device or any railroad sign or signal.
   B.   No person shall place or maintain nor shall any public authority permit
upon any highway any traffic sign or signal bearing thereon any commercial
advertising.

violations for an immobilized vehicle have not been resolved within 48 hours,
the vehicle may be towed or impounded. All fees and late charges shall be
collected before the owner of the vehicle, or other authorized person, shall be
permitted to repossess or secure the release of the vehicle. In addition to any
penalty, immobilization, and late fees incurred prior to towing of the vehicle,
the owner of a vehicle which has been towed or impounded is responsible for
paying any towing and storage fees.
   E.   Enforcement. The Chief of Police, along with the city’s Traffic
Engineer, shall have authority for implementing the parking enforcement
provisions of this section.
   F.   Unlawful tampering. It is unlawful for any person to remove, attempt to

10.40.330  Appeal of violation notices.
   Any vehicle owner who receives a parking violation notice may appeal the
imposition of a penalty fee within 7 days of receiving the notice of violation.
Failure of the vehicle owner to appeal a notice of violation within 7 days will
constitute a waiver of any appeal for that violation. The filing of an appeal
will toll the imposition of any late fees for that violation. City staff will
initially screen all appeals and will have the authority to administratively
resolve any appeals where it is determined an error has been made, or if it is
determined that dismissing or reducing the violation is in the best interests
of justice. If the appeal is not resolved at the administrative level, the
vehicle owner may choose to have the appeal heard by the Parking Advisory
Board. If an appeal is taken to the Parking Advisory Board an additional fee
will be imposed to help defray the cost of the appeal. The appeal fee will be
established by resolution of the City Council. The Parking Advisory Board may
affirm the violation, dismiss the violation, or reduce the penalties and fees
which have been imposed. If the Board dismisses the parking violation the
appeal fee shall be automatically waived. If the Board affirms the violation in
whole, or in part, the vehicle owner will have 48 hours to pay the outstanding
balance on all fees and costs or a late fee equivalent to the late fee for
violations that are more than 7 days old will be imposed in addition to the
penalty fee. So long as the balance parking fees remains outstanding,
additional late fees consistent with the schedule adopted by the City Council
shall continue to be imposed.

contractor or his or her agent, the repairs are not made. Further, in the case
of an emergency, where in the judgment of the city delay would cause serious
loss or damage, repairs may be made without notices to the contractor.

permits, and in no case later than 30 calendar days after completion of the
work.
   C.   The city reserves the right to extend the warranty period if excessive
problems develop during the initial 2-year period.

(Ord. 5793 (part), 2012)
12.08.030  Work by city.
   If a sidewalk is not constructed, reconstructed or repaired in the manner
and within the time prescribed in the notice given pursuant to §

5793 (part), 2012)
12.08.060  New and existing developments.
   A.   Conformance with sidewalk requirements—exceptions. The construction of
a permanent sidewalk fronting or abutting all streets, highways and avenues
shall be accomplished by the builder, owner or developer of all new or existing
buildings within the city, except in the following circumstances:
      1.   When the Common Council, pursuant to
Chapter 17.50 of this code, approves a planned unit development or planned
residential development incorporating a sidewalk plan unique to the
development;
      2.   When the lot has a frontage in excess of 200 feet per dwelling unit
located on the lot and is in the general agricultural zoning district; however,
if the lot abuts or is adjacent to a lot with existing sidewalk, this exception
shall not apply;
      3.   When the property has frontage along an interstate highway, a
sidewalk will not be required along the interstate;
   B.   Variances granted by Council. The Common Council, in its sole
discretion, may approve a variance from sidewalk requirements.
      1.   Unless otherwise provided by the Common Council in approving the
variance, a variance under this section remains valid only until such time as a
building permit is sought to construct an additional structure or parking lot
on the property, to enlarge by 20% or more an existing structure or parking lot
on the property, or to increase the occupant load by 20% or more, except for in
the urban commercial district where an enlargement shall be defined by a 40%
increase in the square foot gross floor area of a building. If such a building
permit is sought, then sidewalks must be provided or a new variance must be
approved.
      2.   For the purposes of determining what constitutes an expansion or
enlargement of 20%, or 40% if located within the urban commercial district, any
additions or increases since the variance was granted are considered
cumulatively.
      3.   If no work is completed or improvements made on the property within
2 years of receipt of a variance, or if the development plan submitted with the
variance request is replaced or abandoned, then the variance expires.
      4.   The granting of a variance does not limit the City Council’s ability
to order the installation of sidewalk in accordance with the provisions of §
12.08.020.
   C.   All property with existing development on the effective date of these
regulations which is not in compliance with the provisions of these regulations
shall be considered nonconforming and allowed to continue until such time as a
building permit is granted to construct a new structure or parking lot on the
property, to enlarge by 20% or more an existing structure or parking lot on the
property, or to increase the occupant load by 20% or more. For properties with
existing development in the urban commercial district that are located along
pedestrian oriented streets as defined in §
17.04.542, compliance with these regulations is required when a building permit
is granted to construct a new structure or parking lot on the property, or to
enlarge the square foot gross floor area of an existing structure or parking
lot by 40% or more. Nothing in this section shall limit the City Council’s
ability to order the installation of sidewalk in accordance with the provisions
of §
12.08.020.
   D.   Inspection prerequisite to certificate of occupancy—bond. No
certificate of occupancy shall be issued nor shall a water meter be released
until a final inspection by the Building Official confirms that the sidewalks
were installed pursuant to this chapter, a variance was granted, or security in
an amount equal to the estimated cost of construction of the sidewalk was
provided, whereby the sidewalk will be constructed without cost to the city in
the event of default by the builder, owner or developer of the property. All
bonds and other methods of guarantee shall be approved by the City Attorney.
   E.   Application for variance. Any person aggrieved by any decision of the
Building Official under this section may apply in writing to the Common Council
for an exception from the requirements of this section.

within the city.  At a minimum, such additional maps or plats shall be filed
annually, and the utility shall certify the accuracy of all information so
filed.
(Ord. 5793 (part), 2012)
12.12.020  Public rights-of-way—Unlawful obstructions—Exclusions.
   A.   It is unlawful for any person, without legal privilege to do so, to
obstruct any public street, alley, sidewalk, way, place or building, whether
alone or with others and who, after warning by a police officer, persists in so
obstructing the same.
      1.   To OBSTRUCT means rendering impassable without reasonable
inconvenience or hazard.  No person shall be deemed to have violated this
section solely because of a gathering of persons to hear him or her speak or
otherwise communicate or solely because of being a member of the gathering.
      2.   A person in a gathering commits a violation if he or she refuses to
obey a reasonable request or order by a police officer to move.
         a.   To prevent obstruction of a public street, alley, sidewalk,
public way, place or building; or
         b.   To maintain public safety by dispersing those gathered in
dangerous proximity to a fire or hazard.
      3.   A request or order to move addressed to a person whose speech or
other lawful behavior attracts an obstructing audience shall not be deemed
reasonable if the obstruction can readily be remedied by police control of the
size or location of the gathering.
      4.   For the purposes of this section, PUBLIC means affecting or likely
to affect persons in a place to which the public or a substantial group has
access, among such places are included public streets, alleys, places, public
buildings and any places of business or amusement which the buildings, places
of business or amusement are open to the public.
   B.   It is unlawful for any person to loiter, stand or sit in or upon any
public street, alley, sidewalk or crosswalk so as to in any manner hinder or
obstruct the free passage therein or thereon of persons or vehicles passing or
attempting to pass along the same, or so as to in any manner annoy or molest
persons passing along the same.
   C.   It is unlawful for any person to place any goods, wares or merchandise
for exhibition or sale upon any public street, alley, sidewalk or any public
grounds in the city, or place or cause to be placed thereon any goods, wares or
merchandise, or bottles, cans, cases, packages, barrels, or other containers,
at any time for exhibition, sale or any other purpose, or place or cause to be
placed thereon, any advertising sign, bicycle rack, popcorn stand or rack, or
any other moveable property, article or material which in any manner obstructs
or interferes with the free use of such public street, road, alley, sidewalk or
public ground.  A business located within the Original Town of Rapid which is
bordered by Omaha Street on the north, South Street on the south, West
Boulevard on the west and East Boulevard on the east is exempt from this
subsection in conjunction with a special event being conducted within the
Central Business zoning district. A SPECIAL EVENT would be an event that was
authorized by issuance of a special event and/or parade permit approved by the
Chief of Police or designee, a crazy days or other similar promotion organized
by the Rapid City Downtown Association, or a special event being held at Main
Street Square. Under this exception, a business may use the sidewalk area
immediately adjacent to its business for the purposes identified above so long
as the display or merchandise does not unreasonably impair the free use of the
sidewalk or otherwise pose a hazard to public safety. This exception applies 1
hour before the event begins and ends 1 hour after the event has ended. If in
the opinion of law enforcement or the Fire Department, a business using this
exception is impairing the use of the sidewalk or otherwise poses a hazard to
public safety they may be required to cease or alter their activities so that
the impairment is removed or the threat to public safety is abated.
   D.   For purposes of subsections A. through C. of this section, the
placement of tree planters and attached benches upon sidewalks by the owner of
the abutting property, or his or her agent, shall not be construed as an
obstruction; provided that, the sidewalk is approximately 15 feet in width and

will exceed the reasonable capacity of the public space requested;

adjacent or neighboring properties by causing excessive noise or creating a
nuisance;
         i.   The special event will be conducted primarily for the purpose of

party owning land on which a hazardous tree or any part thereof is located for
damages to persons or property caused by the hazardous tree. This provision

   C.   Water Rate Relief Program.
      1.   Residential water users can apply for rate relief on water monthly
meter and unit charges.  Eligibility for this program is based upon criteria
outlined by the State of South Dakota Department of Revenue for the purpose of
the Assessments Freeze for the Elderly and Disabled Program (hereinafter “State
Program”). The Water Rate Relief Program shall be administered through the city
Public Works Department. The Director of Public Works shall have the authority
to establish policies and procedures for administration of the program. In
order to qualify for the program an applicant must meet the following criteria:
         a.   Must either be 65 years of age or older or disabled as defined by
the Social Security Act.
         b.   Income (applicant’s federal adjusted gross income plus any other
income including social security payments) must meet the requirements set by
the State Program.
         c.   Applicant may own, rent, lease, or have a life estate in the
property for which the freeze is applied for. Applicant must physically reside
at the property. The water bill must be in the applicant’s name. If the
residence has multiple units, but is served by only 1 service line or meter,
the residents of the property are not eligible for the program. If each unit
has its own meter, the residents may be eligible for the program if they meet
the other criteria. If the applicant owns or has a life estate in the property,
it must have a fair market value that meets the requirements set by the State
Program. If the applicant rents or leases the property the rent or lease
payment must be less than $900 for a single person or less than $1,200 for a
multiple income household.
      2.   If an applicant qualifies for the program their water and meter
rates will be reduced by 20% for a period of 2 years or until the renewal date
established by the Public Works Director. The applicant must reapply at least
every 2 years, or more frequently as the policies established by the Public
Works Director may require. If the fair market value of the applicant’s
property or the rent paid by them exceeds the threshold amounts, they can still
qualify for the program if they were qualified in the immediately preceding 2
years and remain domiciled in the same residence.
   D.   No funds collected pursuant to charges imposed by subsections A. and B.
of this section shall be spent for other than waterworks expenditures.
   E.   A portion of the funds collected pursuant to charges imposed by
subsections A. and B. of this section shall be spent on construction for water
system replacement, improvement, and expansion/economic development type
projects as defined in §
13.04.010. Funding will be allocated for replacement and improvement type
projects in the water construction department 933. Funding will be allocated
for expansion/economic development projects in department 934.

located in a manner that does not conform to Title 13 of the Municipal Code,
the IDCM, and the Standard Specifications if all of the following conditions
are satisfied:
   A.   In the judgment of the Public Works Director, extraordinary
circumstances exist that make compliance impractical.
   B.   The water or sewer service line must be located within a dedicated
service line easement.
      1.   The easement shall include provisions requiring the owners of the
dominant and all servient tenements to defend, indemnify and hold the city
harmless from all claims related to the non-conforming service line. This
requirement may be waived by the Public Works Director for easements created
prior to January 1, 2007.
      2.   Should the properties be under single ownership, the owner must
enter into a covenant agreement promising to grant the easement if any part of
the property served by the non-conforming service line is ever transferred to a
different owner.
   C.   The applicant of the non-conforming service line shall execute a
covenant agreement consenting to an assessed project to construct public sewer
mains or public water mains.

watertight.
   D.   Interceptors shall be maintained by the owner, at his or her expense,
and shall be continuously operated at all times.
   E.   Failure by the owner to properly clean and maintain interceptors shall
be considered sufficient cause for the Public Works Director to disconnect the
industrial user from the wastewater facilities or to direct that the industrial
user discontinue discharging to the wastewater facilities, or for punitive
actions as provided for in this chapter.
(Ord. 5794 (part), 2012)
13.16.250  Screens required.
   In plants processing fruits, vegetables and similar produce, screens shall
be provided when, in the opinion of the Director, they are necessary to reduce
the concentration of industrial wastes to acceptable levels. Screens shall be
of a type and capacity approved by the Director and shall be located so as to
be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Failure by the
owner to properly clean and maintain these units shall be considered sufficient
cause for the Director to disconnect the industrial user from the facilities or
to direct that the discharge of wastewater to the wastewater facilities be
discontinued, or for punitive actions as provided for in this chapter.
(Ord. 5794 (part), 2012)
13.16.260  Pretreatment facility maintenance.
   Where preliminary treatment, flow measurement, sampling or flow-equalizing
facilities are provided for any industrial wastewaters, they shall be
maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective operation by the owner at
the owner’s expense.
(Ord. 5794 (part), 2012)
13.16.270  Monitoring, sampling, record keeping, reporting, notice, control
manhole and flow measurement requirements.
   A.   Industrial users may be required at their own expense, to install,
calibrate, operate and maintain sampling or monitoring equipment necessary to
determine compliance with this chapter or requirements that may be specified as
a condition of the industrial waste permit or to determine wastewater flows and
characteristics as required to determine sewer use charges.
   B.   Industrial users subject to categorical pretreatment standards shall be
required, and all other industrial users may be required, to take samples of
effluents in accordance with specified methods at the locations, at the
intervals and in such a manner as may be prescribed by the Director, which are
necessary to determine compliance with categorical pretreatment standards and
other requirements contained in the industrial waste permit.
   C.   Categorical industrial users stall be required to keep records as
described in 40 C.F.R. pt. 403.12(n) and amendments thereto. All other
industrial users may be required to keep records designated by the Director.
   D.   Industrial users subject to categorical pretreatment standards shall be
required submit to the Director the reports described in 40 C.F.R. pt. 403.12.
Industrial users subject to categorical pretreatment standards shall also
comply with any additional requirements specified in an applicable categorical
pretreatment standard or elsewhere in 40 C.F.R. pt. 403.12, and amendments
thereto. The Director may prescribe reporting requirements for all other
industrial users as he or she determines to be necessary for the enforcement of
this chapter.
   E.   Industrial users shall notify the Director immediately of any slug
loading.
   F.   If not already required by this section, the Director may require any
industrial user to install, at the owner’s expense, a suitable device for
continuously recording the flow discharged to the City’s wastewater facilities.
The measuring device may be installed on the source of the water to the
industrial plant if that quantity is to be used as the measurement for the
wastewater produced. If sufficient evidence is presented to the Director that
not all water used reaches the sewer, an estimate will be made by the Director
of the proper amount to be deducted to compute the wastewater flow.
   G.   The Director may require an industrial user to install at its own
expense a suitable control manhole to facilitate observation and sampling of
industrial waste. The manhole and any monitoring or measuring devices required
under subsections A. or F. of this section shall be accessible and safely
located and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the
Director. They shall be of such design and construction as to prevent
infiltration by ground and surface waters, or introduction of slugs or solids
to the wastewater facilities. The installation of screens with a maximum
opening of 1 inch, but of sufficient fineness to prevent the entrance of
objectionable slugs or solids, may be required. The facilities shall be so
maintained by the person discharging industrial waste that the Director may
readily and safely measure the flow rate or obtain samples of the flow at all
times.
(Ord. 5794 (part), 2012)
13.16.280  Testing and sampling procedures.
   All measurements, tests, sampling and analysis of the characteristics of
wastewaters discharged to the city’s wastewater facilities shall be determined
in accordance with rules, specified in 40 C.F.R. pt. 136, or in the absence of
40 C.F.R. pt. 136 methods, by methods contained in the latest edition of
Standard Methods of Examination of Water and Wastewater, as published by the
American Public Health Association, and shall be determined at the location
designated by the Public Works Director or his or her designee.
(Ord. 5794 (part), 2012)
13.16.290  Special agreements for unusual strength wastewater.
   No statement contained in this chapter shall be construed as preventing any
special agreement or arrangement between the city and industrial users whereby
an industrial waste may be accepted by the city for treatment subject to
payment by the industrial user of additional charges.
(Ord. 5794 (part), 2012)
13.16.300  Authority to require compliance with federal categorical
pretreatment standards.
   A.   Upon promulgation of the federal categorical pretreatment standards
(authorized by § 307 of the Clean Water Act) for a particular industrial
subcategory, the federal standard, if more stringent than the limitations
imposed under this chapter, or in the absence of the applicable pretreatment
limitations in this chapter, shall become applicable. The Director shall
promptly notify all affected industrial users of the reporting requirements
contained in 40 C.F.R. pt. 403.12 and shall require that the reports be signed
by an officer of the industry who shall certify the completeness and accuracy
of the report.
   B.   The Director shall have the authority to place all affected industrial
users on compliance schedules, receive and analyze reports on progress toward
compliance, and insure that all applicable industrial users install the
facilities necessary to achieve the required levels of treatment specified by
the national categorical standard on or before the deadline specified in the
standard. This authority shall also be applicable to those industrial users who
discharge substances identified as prohibited discharges.
(Ord. 5794 (part), 2012)
ARTICLE IV.  SERVICE CHARGES
13.16.310  Tap fees.
   If it is necessary to tap a sewer at any place other than where a tee tap
been placed, the city will make a tap after a regular sewer connection permit
has been issued and the appropriate fee is paid. The tap fee shall be set by
resolution of the Common Council.
(Ord. 6202 (part), 2017: Ord. 5794 (part), 2012)
13.16.320  Industrial waste permit fees.
   Each permittee shall pay an annual administrative fee effective for all
industrial waste permits in an amount set by resolution of the Common Council.
(Ord. 6202 (part), 2017: Ord. 5794 (part), 2012)
13.16.330  Connection permit.
   Owners of property desirous of discharging to the sanitary sewer, within the
corporate limits of the city, shall have a licensed plumbing contractor or
licensed underground utility contractor make application, in writing, to the
Water and Sewer Department. Such application to state the name of the owner, a
description of the premises, the size of the tap, the kind of service pipe to
be used, and the purpose for which it is to be used. Such application must be
made at least 2 days before the work is to be commenced. A permit shall be
issued after the application is approved by the Director of Public Works or his
or her designee, and payment is made for fees as provided for in this chapter.
(Ord. 5794 (part), 2012)
13.16.340  Connection and re-inspection fees.
   A service line inspection fee shall be payable for all new service lines,
which shall provide an initial field inspection of the private sewer service
line from the sewer stub to the structure, mileage, administrative tracking and
card drawing. Each additional inspection of the private sewer line shall
require the payment of a re-inspection fee. The inspection and re-inspection
fees shall be set by resolution of the Common Council.
(Ord. 6202 (part), 2017: Ord. 5794 (part), 2012)
13.16.350  Sewer construction fees.
   Upon recommendation by the Director, the Common Council may by resolution
impose sewer construction fees on individual properties in certain identified,
unserved areas when properties in such area are benefitted by the installation
of a sewer. All users in such service area shall pay an additional sewer
construction fee prior to connecting to the sewer. This sewer construction fee
shall be in addition to the ordinary tap fees imposed by this chapter. The city
may enter into agreements assigning the cost of installation of sewer water
mains to serve such service areas. The ordinance codified in this section
implements authority granted in SDCL § 9-48-15.
(Ord. 5794 (part), 2012)
13.16.360  Sewer use charge.
   A.   Unit rate. The Common Council shall set by resolution a unit rate that
includes operating, maintenance and capital expenses.
   B.   Meter charge. A total meter charge, based upon the size of the non-
irrigation water meter serving the user, shall be paid for by the customer
served. This total meter charge shall include a charge associated with
operating, maintenance and capital expenses plus a surcharge associated with an
environmental fee. The environmental fee surcharge covers the tax imposed by
the state as an environmental fee upon municipal sewage collection systems. 
The meter charge shall be set by resolution of the Common Council.
   C.   Rate determination. All wastewater and industrial waste discharged to
the wastewater facilities shall be paid for by the customer served. The methods
used for determining the sewer use charge shall be as follows:
      1.   Residential users. All residential wastewater users shall be
assessed a monthly meter charge per subsection B. of this section. The
wastewater flow from residential connections shall be determined each year from
the metered water use for 3 winter months using the water meter readings
showing usage in December, January, and February. A residential user may, upon
application on a form provided by the Public Works Department, petition for the
use of 3 months other than those listed. The Director of Public Works or his or
her designee shall have the discretion to grant such petition for good cause.
Residential users who move to a new residence shall have the use from their
previous residence assigned to them. The average monthly winter use measured in
hundreds of cubic feet, shall be multiplied by the rate set by the Common
Council pursuant to subsection A. of this section and the product will
determine the monthly sewer use charge for the 12-month period commencing April
1 for each year. New residential users, or intermittent users who do not
petition as provided above, shall pay a sewer use charge based on the average
single-family residential water use of 500 cubic feet per month per dwelling
unit served and this volume shall be used until the end of the next averaging
period (December, January and February). For any of the 3 averaging months in
which the meter is not actually read, the amount of 500 cubic feet times the
number of dwelling units shall be inserted for that month to determine the
average for the 3 months. Residents with city sewer service only (i.e., no city
water) will pay a city use charge of 700 cubic feet per month. The resident may
elect to install a potable water meter and radio read as an alternative to the
700 cubic feet per month and be charged per the normal winter use average as
identified within this chapter. Residents experiencing leaks located after the
meter during the sewer usage averaging period will be allowed sewer billing
adjustments until the completion of the next sewer averaging period following
notification by the customer. Sewer usage will be adjusted by taking the
average of the last 3 winter averaging periods, or the minimum billing volume
of 500 cubic feet if the record is less than 3 years. Residential users
irrigating during any of the 3 months from which the sewer rates are determined
will be allowed a rate reduction, as set forth in the previous paragraph. To
receive such an adjustment, a residential user must sign an affidavit provided
by the Public Works Department, affirming that they irrigated during the time
of the sewer charge calculation.
      2.   Commercial and institutional users discharging domestic wastewater.
All commercial and institutional wastewater users shall be assessed a monthly
meter charge per subsection B. of this section. The sewer use charge for
commercial and institutional connections discharging wastewaters similar in
physical, biological and chemical quality to domestic wastewater shall be
determined by multiplying the monthly wastewater volume in units by the rate
established by the Common Council pursuant to subsection A. The wastewater
volume shall be determined from the monthly metered water use unless special
allowances are made or the wastewater is metered as provided herein.
      3.   Industrial users. All industrial wastewater users shall be assessed
a monthly meter charge per Subsection B. of this section. The sewer charge for
industrial connections shall be determined by multiplying the monthly
wastewater volume measured in units by the rate set by the Common Council
pursuant to subsection A. of this section, whenever the BOD concentration is
less than 260 mg/l and the suspended solids concentration is less than 250 mg/
l based on the average of flow proportioned, composite samples, collected at
the times, frequencies and in the manner designated by the Director. Whenever
the BOD concentration exceeds 260 mg/l or the suspended solids concentration
exceeds 250 mg/l, based on the sampling and testing program specified by the
Director, a surcharge will be assessed per pound of BOD and TSS on the portion
of wastes in excess of 260 mg/l BOD or 250 mg/l TSS. The surcharge shall be set
by resolution of the Common Council.
      4.   The rate to be paid for sewer service through lines owned by a
governmental entity other than the city shall be established by contract.
   D.   Non-residential rate adjustments. Non- residential users may receive an
adjustment to their sewer charge for non-irrigation water that is not
discharged to the sanitary sewer. Such an adjustment shall only be made if the
water is not used for irrigation and if the amount of water that is prevented
from being discharged into the sanitary sewer system is metered, or if the
actual sewage flow is metered.
   E.   Sewer Rate Relief Program. Residential sewer users can apply for rate
relief on monthly sewer and unit charges. Eligibility for this program is based
upon criteria outlined by the State of South Dakota Department of Revenue for
the purpose of the Assessments Freeze for the Elderly and Disabled Program
(hereinafter “State Program”). The Sewer Rate Relief Program shall be
administered through the city Public Works Department. The Director of Public
Works shall have the authority to establish policies and procedures for
administration of the program. In order to qualify for the program an applicant
must meet the following criteria:
      1.   Must either be 65 years of age or older or disabled as defined by
the Social Security Act.
      2.   Income (applicant’s federal adjusted gross income plus any other
income including social security payments) must meet the requirements set by
the State Program.
      3.   Applicant may own, rent, lease, or have a life estate in the
property for which the freeze is applied for. Applicant must physically reside
at the property. The sewer bill must be in the applicant’s name. If the
residence has multiple units, but is served by only 1 service line, the
residents of the property are not eligible for the program. If the applicant
owns or has a life estate in the property, it must have a fair market value
that meets the requirements set by the State Program. If the applicant rents or
leases the property the rent or lease payment must be less than $900 for a
single person or less than $1,200 for a multiple income household.
      4.   If an applicant qualifies for the program their sewer and meter
rates will be reduced by 20% for a period of 2 years or until the renewal date
established by the Public Works Director. The applicant must reapply at least
every 2 years, or more frequently as the policies established by the Public
Works Director may require. If the fair market value of the applicant’s
property or the rent paid by them exceeds the threshold amounts, they can still
qualify for the program if they were qualified in the immediately preceding 2
years and remain domiciled in the same residence.
   F.   Monitoring. All categorical and significant industrial users shall, at
their own expense, monitor their wastewater discharge to determine their sewer
use rate. Any other industrial user choosing to monitor its discharge may do so
at its own expense.
   G.   Exempt from monitoring. All minor industrial users shall be exempt from
self-monitoring for the purposes of this section.
   H.   Wastewater volume measurement.
      1.   Any industrial user may choose to measure the actual wastewater flow
in lieu of basing the wastewater use charges on the metered water. In such
cases, the conditions set forth herein shall apply.
      2.   Any industrial user receiving non- metered water shall either
install water meters for all non-metered sources or provide wastewater flow
measurement in accordance to the conditions set forth herein.
      3.   All meters for non-metered water sources and wastewater flow
measurement devices shall be installed in accordance with plans and
specifications approved by the Director. All costs for design and installation
shall be borne by the owner. The owner shall guarantee the city access to the
meter or meters for periodic meter reading.
   I.   Review of each user’s wastewater service charge. If an industrial user
has completed in-plant modifications which would change the user’s wastewater
characteristics or flows, the user can request that the Director adjust the
industrial user’s surcharge rate. The Director’s decision can be appealed to
the City Council in a manner designated in §
13.16.400.
(Ord. 6202 (part), 2017: Ord. 6149 (part), 2016: Ord. 5939, 2013: Ord. 5871,
2012: Ord. 5794 (part), 2012)
13.16.370  Annual contracts.
   Industrial users may enter into annual contracts for sewer surcharges based
on historical wastewater charges tied to water use or units of production. This
alternative must be requested by the industry and the contract must be approved
by the Director.
(Ord. 5794 (part), 2012)
13.16.380  Billing.
   The sewer use billing shall be monthly and shall be based on the rates
determined in §
13.16.360. The sewer use bill shall be submitted with the monthly water bill
and the provisions of §§
13.08.470 and
13.08.500 shall apply.
(Ord. 5794 (part), 2012)
13.16.390  Use of fees.
   A.   All connection fees, tap fees and re-inspection fees paid to the city
pursuant to this chapter shall be deposited into the wastewater enterprise
fund, shall be separately accounted for, and shall be used for the purpose of
providing funds for amortizing sewer bonds, wastewater facility capital
improvements or wastewater facility operation.
   B.   All sewer use charges, industrial user permit fees and connection fees
shall be deposited in the wastewater enterprise fund and used for the purpose
of providing funds for payment of wastewater facilities bonds, construction and
completion of wastewater facility improvements and for the payment of
operation, maintenance and repair of the wastewater facilities.

absorption system will operate both properly and in an environmentally sound
manner. Soil observation pits may be required prior to the installation of any
onsite wastewater system.
   B.   SOIL OBSERVATION PITS are excavated pits that are necessary to
determine the level of the seasonal high water table and/or the depth of
impermeable substratum. Soil observation pits shall be excavated prior to any
required percolation tests, to determine whether the soils are suitable to
warrant percolation tests and, if suitable, at what depths percolation tests
shall be conducted. A soil observation pit evaluation showing a dry condition,
estimated or measured to be at least 4 four feet below the bottom of a proposed
absorption system during the wettest months, may be considered adequate
evidence that the maximum seasonal ground water table and the bedrock layer
will be sufficiently below the bottom of the proposed absorption system.
Underground utilities must be located before soil observations are undertaken.
   C.   Soil borings shall be made in a manner that will provide a continuous
sample of the soil profile without mixing the soil from different depths. Hand
augers may be used, provided that the hole remains open and does not slump.
Partial substitution for soil observation pits may be made using soil borings.
Soil borings shall be made to a depth of 8 feet.
   D.   Soil observation pits shall be excavated at the site of each proposed
absorption system for the purpose of determining the suitability and
distribution of soil types present at the site. At minimum, 1 soil observation
pit or 3 soil borings shall be dug to provide evaluation of the soil profile of
the area of the proposed absorption system. The hole may be terminated when
ground water or bedrock is encountered.
      1.   A soil observation pit shall be excavated to a minimum depth of 4
feet below the bottom of the soil absorption system, and shall be 24 to 36
inches wide, unless digging is impractical due to bedrock, water or seasonal
wetness.
      2.   The location of the soil observation pit or the soil borings for
disposal fields shall be located at either end of the disposal field, within or
no further than 15 feet beyond the boundaries of the disposal field.
      3.   In addition, the following depths shall be reported for a complete
evaluation of the pit: seasonal high water table, observed water table, and
impermeable substratum.
      4.   The depth to the limiting zone shall be measured from the existing
ground surface to the top of the limiting zone. In the case of disturbed
ground, depth to the limiting zone shall be measured from the preexisting
natural ground surface or the existing ground surface, whichever is lowest.
      5.   The onsite wastewater system installer must request an observation
from the Director during the normal duty day, at least 48 hours before the date
and time the soil observation pit will be ready for evaluation. These
evaluations must be scheduled during normal observation hours and in
conjunction with the observation schedule of the Director having jurisdiction.
   E.   It is recommended that the sides of the soil observation pit be stepped
and sloped to prevent caving-in, and to allow safe access to the upper portion
of the pit. It is also recommended that persons involved with the soil
evaluation not enter into portions of a soil observation pit, which have been
excavated, to depths greater than 5 feet below the surrounding ground surface.
It is the responsibility of persons performing or witnessing soil evaluation to
comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations
governing occupational safety.
(Ord. 5794 (part), 2012)
13.20.230  Ground water determination.
   An adequate number of observations, excavations, or borings shall be made by
the onsite wastewater system installer to clearly establish the elevation of
the ground water table in accordance with the procedure outlined above. The
ground water table determination should be made when the ground water table is
at its highest level. The results of each observation and pertinent information
shall be recorded on the onsite wastewater system construction permit
application. The location of the ground water table observations shall be
indicated on the preliminary site plan.
   A.   Wet season determinations. The ground water table elevation
determination shall be made when the water table is highest; this occurs
usually during the months of April through July. In making this determination,
it is necessary to bore or dig an adequate number of holes of convenient size
in the proposed disposal area to a depth of 8 feet below the surface. All water
table observations should be made no sooner than 24 hours after excavation, and
shall be witnessed by the Director unless otherwise waived. 
   B.   Dry season determinations. Although the ground water table is more
accurately measured in the wet season, data may be available to predict the
maximum ground water table elevation during the wet season. To make a dry
season determination, the applicant shall dig a 10-foot observation pit in the
location of the proposed absorption area. All water table observations should
be made no sooner than 24 hours after excavation, and shall be witnessed by the
Director unless otherwise waived. 
(Ord. 5794 (part), 2012)
13.20.240  Field evaluation.
   The Director may require that a field evaluation be done on the proposed
site. A field evaluation, if required, shall consist of verifying the items
described in items A. through C. below:
   A.   Identifying lot lines, lot improvements, required setbacks, and
easements;
   B.   Viewing soil observation pits and percolation holes; and
   C.   Verifying all other pertinent information related to the approval
process for an onsite wastewater system construction permit.
(Ord. 5794 (part), 2012)
13.20.250  Site evaluations during the platting stages.
   During developmental stages, site evaluations may be required prior to
approval of platting changes. This would include, but not be limited to:
   A.   Percolation tests may be required for each individual lot;
   B.   It may be required that reserve areas or soil observations be completed
prior to platting approval; and
   C.   All other pertinent information as required by the Director.
(Ord. 5794 (part), 2012)
ARTICLE IV.  SENSITIVE REGIONAL AREAS
13.20.260  Sensitive regional areas—Scope.
   Certain areas have been identified as sensitive regional areas, which are
deemed particularly sensitive to the detrimental effects of nutrients,
pathogenic organisms, organic chemicals and other substances that may be
present in effluent from onsite wastewater system, and which are in need of
special protection from such effects due to the unique and irreplaceable value
of the resource, such as a public water supply, fisheries habitat and/or public
recreation area. Standards for siting and design of onsite wastewater systems
of this manual are established to enhance the wastewater treatment capability
of onsite wastewater system, and thereby reduce the potential for adverse
effects to critical resources. In areas designated as sensitive regional areas,
the standards of this manual shall supersede minimum standards wherever
applicable. The city will adopt the same areas as sensitive regional areas that
have been identified by the South Dakota Department of Environment and Natural
Resources. When specific evidence suggests questionable subsurface conditions
exist, additional hydrological, geological, engineering or other information
provided by a registered professional engineer or geologist may be required to
be submitted by the applicant. The final determination shall be made by the
Director.
(Ord. 5794 (part), 2012)
13.20.270  Alterations in sensitive areas.
   No alteration of a building served by an onsite wastewater system, which
will result in an increase in flow or change in type of wastewater discharged,
shall be approved in a sensitive regional area, unless after such improvements
to the building on the lot satisfies, to the maximum extent possible, all
design and siting requirements of the regulations in effect at the time of an
onsite wastewater system construction permit application. If the lot does not
satisfy all current requirements, the alteration may only be approved if the
onsite wastewater system is brought into complete compliance with all local
ordinances.
(Ord. 5794 (part), 2012)
13.20.280  Design criteria for sensitive regional areas for new or repaired
onsite wastewater systems.
   Upon review of the onsite wastewater system construction permit application,
the Director may require that:
   A.   The lot sizes be larger than the minimum district lot sizes, in order
to protect the public health;
   B.   Due to the sensitivity of the aquifer recharge areas locally, a form of
secondary treatment may be required in the aquifer recharge areas or areas
where the ground water table is a concern;
   C.   When an existing onsite wastewater system has been previously installed
in a 100-year floodplain, then the new or repaired system shall meet or exceed
the requirements of this manual and all local ordinances. The system as
approved by the Director shall be designed to minimize or eliminate
infiltration of floodwaters into the system, and discharge of the system into
the floodwaters;
   D.   A registered professional engineer or soil scientist shall perform the
percolation tests or other soil evaluations, due to the lot being located in
one of the areas classified as a sensitive regional area;
   E.   The onsite wastewater system shall be designed by a registered
professional engineer;
   F.   The septic tank will be required to be a multi-compartmental or
multiple tanks with a combined minimum capacity of 1,500 gallons;
   G.   Horizontal separation distances from onsite wastewater systems and
other pertinent ground features shall be 1.5 times the minimum distances
required in § 
13.20.170;
   H.   All new, repaired or upgraded onsite wastewater systems within a
sensitive regional area will be required to meet, at minimum, the requirements
listed in § 
13.20.300 for calculating the design flow;
   I.   Drainfields in the sensitive regional areas, whether absorption trench
systems or beds are used, may not be allowed to receive credit reductions when
they are being sized unless certified by a registered professional engineer;
   J.   Onsite wastewater systems shall not be permitted in highly permeable
soils (percolation rate faster than 5 minutes per inch), except where the site
evaluation has demonstrated that surface and ground water quality will be
protected;
   K.   Existing systems may be required to be retrofitted with an effluent
filter;
   L.   Existing onsite wastewater systems, which conform to this Chapter, ARSD
Chapter 74:53:01, and all applicable local ordinances, shall be permitted to
remain as installed, unless the onsite wastewater system is found to be in
noncompliance.
(Ord. 5794 (part), 2012)
ARTICLE V.  DESIGN FLOW DETERMINATION
13.20.290  System sizing.
   The onsite wastewater system shall be designed to accommodate additional
capacity if any or all of the following can be reasonably anticipated:
   A.   The construction of additional bedrooms such as where levels of new
homes may be finished at a later time;
   B.   The installation of water-using devices; or
   C.   Other factors likely to affect the operation of the onsite wastewater
system.
(Ord. 5794 (part), 2012)
13.20.300  Design flow.
   A.   The average design flow shall be used to size soil treatment systems.
The estimated average design flow for any dwelling shall provide for at least 3
bedrooms. For multi-family dwellings, the average design flow shall consist of
the sum of the average design flows for each individual unit. These design
flows are listed in Table 1b:
   TABLE 1b
 
Number of Bedrooms Flow Volume (gpd)
                   Class I Class II
3                  360     450
4                  480     600
5                  600     750
6                  720     900
 
   B.   These design flows are based on the following formulas:
      1.   Classification I. Classification I dwellings correspond with the
minimum standards allowed by ARSD § 74:53:01:31.
      2.   Classification II. Classification II dwellings are those with more
than 2 of the following water-use appliances: automatic washer, dishwasher,
water conditioning unit, whirlpool bath, multi head showers, or self-cleaning
humidifier in furnace. The average design flow for Classification II dwellings
is determined by multiplying the number of bedrooms by 150.
(Ord. 5794 (part), 2012)
13.20.310  Wastewater flow capacity requirements of residential and non-
residential establishments.
   A.   All individual or small onsite wastewater treatment systems shall be
designed to have a capacity at least equal to the anticipated maximum daily
flow. For existing facilities where the average daily flow is measured, the
anticipated maximum daily wastewater flow shall be assumed to be 150% of the
average daily flow as the basis for the design of the system. In other cases,
the anticipated maximum daily flow capacity shall be determined according to
the type of facility as set forth in Table 2.

ARTICLE VI.  SEPTIC TANKS
13.20.340  Design and construction requirements for septic tanks.
   A.   The minimum design and construction requirements for septic tanks are
as follows:
      1.   a.   Septic tanks shall be watertight and constructed of durable
materials designed to withstand expected physical loads. Such tanks shall be
capable of supporting a static vertical load of at least 1,000 pounds per
square foot, when bedded and backfilled to the top of the tank. The septic
tank, including baffles or tees, shall be constructed of materials resistant to
acid, decay, and corrosion.
         b.   Prefabricated, coated metal tanks shall meet the requirements of
the Plumbing Code, ARSD  § 20:54:03:03. Coated metal tanks are not permitted
for wastewater systems when the usage will be longer than 7 years. Concrete
septic tanks shall be constructed of Portland type II sulfate-resistant cement,
with a minimum strength of 3,000 pounds per square inch. The walls, floors, and
covers of concrete septic tanks poured onsite shall be at least 3-1/2 inches
thick, with reinforcing bars and welded wire mesh. Fiberglass or plastic septic
tanks shall have a minimum wall thickness of 1/4-inch. All special reinforced
precast concrete, concrete block, plastic, or fiberglass septic tanks shall
meet the minimum static vertical load requirement of 1,000 pounds per square
foot, when bedded and backfilled to the top of the tank. The interior of
concrete block septic tanks shall be surfaced with 2 1/4-inch coats of Portland
cement-sand plaster, and shall have mortar joints. Septic tank keyways or
construction joints shall be made watertight by grouting with cement or
corrosion-resistant sealants (Note: For number 1. above, under the requirements
of this manual, metal tanks, concrete block tanks or concrete tanks that are
poured onsite are no longer considered acceptable types of septic tanks. All
tanks shall be precast concrete tanks. Fiberglass or plastic septic tanks are

   The pretreated effluent from a septic tank shall be distributed to the
absorption field using the following criteria:
   A.   On relatively flat terrain, where the elevation difference of the
ground surface does not exceed 6 inches in any direction within the absorption
field, the septic tank effluent may be directed to the absorption field through
a system of interconnecting distribution pipes;
   B.   On slightly sloping terrain, where the elevation difference of the
ground surface does not exceed 28 inches in any direction within the absorption
field, the septic tank effluent may be distributed by a distribution box,
provided the final ground surface elevation of the lowest trench is at least 1
foot higher than the invert elevation of the outlets of the distribution box.
The inverts of all outlets shall be at the same elevation as measured from a
liquid surface, which is at least 4 inches above the distribution box floor.
The inlet pipe invert shall be at least 1 inch higher than outlet inverts. Each
absorption line shall be connected separately to the distribution box and shall
not be subdivided. When the septic tank effluent is pumped to the distribution
box, either a baffle wall shall be installed in the distribution box, or the
pump discharge shall be directed against a wall of the box on which there is no
outlet. The baffle shall be secured to the box and shall extend at least 1 inch
above the crown of the inlet pipe. The distribution box shall be watertight
with a removable cover, constructed of durable materials resistant to corrosion
or decay, and shall have sufficient capacity to handle the maximum daily flow
rate; and
   C.   On sloping terrain, where the elevation difference of the ground
surface exceeds 28 inches in any direction within the absorption field, a
serial distribution system shall be installed. The serial distribution system
shall be connected with drop boxes or closed pipe relief lines, in such a
manner that each trench is completely filled with septic tank effluent to the
full depth of the gravel before effluent flows to succeeding trenches. The drop
boxes or relief lines shall be placed on an undisturbed section of ground. The
first drop box or relief pipe arrangement encountered shall not have the crown
of the outlet pipe at its highest point above the invert of the septic tank
outlet. At each drop box or relief arrangement, the invert of the inlet pipe
shall be between 1 and 2 inches higher than the invert of the outlet pipe to
the succeeding trench. The slope of the trench between the invert of the outlet
and the invert of the inlet of successive drop box or relief pipe arrangements
shall be 1 inch per 100 feet. When septic effluent is delivered to the drop box
by a pump, the pump discharge shall be directed against a baffle wall or
against a wall of the box on which there is no outlet. The drop box shall be
watertight with a removable cover, constructed of durable materials resistant
to corrosion or decay, and shall have sufficient capacity to handle the maximum
daily flow rate.

(Ord. 5965 (part), 2013)
ARTICLE II.  STORMWATER DRAINAGE UTILITY FEE
13.26.020  Stormwater drainage utility fee.
   A.   The purpose of this section is to establish the annual charge against
real property within the city for the operation, maintenance, and capital
expenses of the stormwater drainage system.
   B.   All real property within the contiguous territory of the city shall be
charged the annual fee for the operation, maintenance, and capital improvements
of the stormwater drainage system. The fee for each such property shall be
based on the lot area, a runoff weighting factor, and a unit financial charge,
and which fee is determined as follows: stormwater drainage utility fee equals
the runoff weighting factor multiplied by parcel area (in square feet)
multiplied by unit financial charge (in dollars per square foot).
      1.   Runoff weighting factor.
         a.   The runoff weighting factor is determined by the type of land use
and indicates the relative volume of storm water runoff from a land parcel as a
function of the percentage of impervious surfaces covering each land parcel.
The runoff weighting factor is to be assigned by land use type as shown in
Table I:
 
TABLE I
Land Use Type Runoff Weighting Factor
Church                                                           11.25
Commercial service or retail                                     18.75
Dwelling, multiple                                               11.25
Dwelling, single-family (lot area less than 30,000 square feet)  7.5
Dwelling, single-family (lot area of 30,000—60,000 square feet)5.75
Dwelling, single-family (lot area of 60,001—100,000 square feet3.5
Dwelling, single-family (lot area greater than 100,000 square    2.5
feet)
Group home                                                       11.25
Industrial                                                       17.0
School                                                           11.25
Undeveloped or vacant lot                                        1.0
Other use not included above                                     Use Table II
 
         b.   Upon written request from a property owner, a detailed site study
will be conducted by the Department of Public Works to determine the runoff
weighting factor. The Department of Public Works shall calculate the percentage
of impervious area for the subject parcel which contributes stormwater runoff
to the stormwater drainage system of the city. The runoff weighting factor is
then determined through utilization of Table II.
 
TABLE II
Percentage Impervious Area Runoff Weighting Factor
0%   1.0
10%  4.75
15%  6.5
20%  7.5
30%  9.5
40%  11.25
50%  13.25
60%  15.0
70%  17.0
80%  18.75
90%  20.75
100% 22.5
 
         c.   Interpolation of the runoff weighting factor for a given
percentage of impervious area not listed in Table II may be obtained by
assuming a linear relationship between the values listed.
         d.   The Public Works Director or his or her designee may direct that
the runoff weighting factor for a given parcel is calculated by a detailed site
investigation and the use of Table II, where an obvious departure from the
percentage of impervious surfaces of similar land uses exists.
         e.   A determination of the runoff weighting factor, resulting from a
detailed site investigation and use of Table II, brought about either by the
written request of a property owner or by direction from the Public Works
Director or his or her designee, shall be used in the calculation of the
stormwater drainage utility fee of the subject parcel and shall replace the
factor previously derived from Table I.
      2.   Parcel area. Parcel area is to be obtained from the records of the
County Department of Equalization.
      3.   Unit financial charge. The unit financial charge shall be
established by resolution of the City Council.
(Ord. 5965 (part), 2013)
13.26.030  Collection.

Officer and submitted to the County Auditor for collection in the same manner
as municipal taxes for general purposes.
(Ord. 5965 (part), 2013)
13.26.040  Fund established.
   A.   The stormwater drainage utility fees paid to the city shall be
maintained in a separate fund to be known as the Stormwater Drainage Utility
Fund. This fund shall be used to pay the cost of financing the operation,
maintenance and construction of the stormwater drainage system. Excess funds
may be carried forward from year to year in order to build sufficient funds for
large drainage construction projects which are scheduled or programmed for the
near future.  In addition, funds may be carried over to provide sufficient
monies for unanticipated repairs, replacements, maintenance or expansion of the
stormwater drainage system.
   B.   A minimum of 25% of the revenue raised by the stormwater drainage
utility fees shall be used for the annual operations and maintenance costs of
the city’s stormwater drainage system. The remainder of the revenue not
allocated to operations and maintenance shall be allocated to capital
improvement projects.
(Ord. 5965 (part), 2013)
13.26.050  Annual review.
   The unit financial charge shall be reviewed annually and shall be revised as
necessary so that revenues are reasonably in balance with anticipated
expenditures.

laws. Permits presuming to give authority to violate or cancel the provisions
of this code or any other ordinance shall not be valid. Certain exemptions that

approval of a violation of the provisions of this code, the Adopted
Construction Codes, or other city ordinances. Inspections presuming to give
authority to violate or cancel the provisions of this code, the Adopted
Construction Codes, or other city ordinances shall not be valid.

ARTICLE I. STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND METHODS
15.32.010  Statutory authorization.
   A.   The legislature of the state has in its state statutes delegated the
responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to
minimize flood losses.
   B.   The City of Rapid City elects to comply with the requirements of the
National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (P.L. 90-488, as amended). The National
Flood Insurance Program, established in the aforesaid act, provides that areas
of the city having a special flood hazard be identified by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency and that floodplain management measures be applied
in such flood hazard areas. The National Flood Insurance Program was broadened
and modified with the passage of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 and
other legislative measures. It was further modified by the National Flood
Insurance Reform Act of 1994. The National Flood Insurance Program is
administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, a component of the
U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
(Ord. 5922 (part), 2013: prior code § 9-100(a))
15.32.020  Findings.
   A.   The special flood hazard areas of Rapid City are subject to periodic
inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
   B.   These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in areas of special flood hazards which cause an increase in flood heights and
velocities, and by the occupancy of special flood hazard areas by uses
vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately
elevated, floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage.
(Ord. 5922 (part), 2013: prior code § 9-100(b))
15.32.030  Purpose of provisions.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions to specific areas by provisions designed:
   A.   To protect human life and health;
   B.   To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   C.   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   D.   To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   E.   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   F.   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard in such a manner as to minimize
future flood blight areas; and
   G.   Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is located in
an area of special flood hazard.
(Ord. 5922 (part), 2013: prior code § 9-100(c))
15.32.040  Methods of reducing flood losses.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter uses the following:
   A.   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in erosion or in flood
heights or velocities;
   B.   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   C.   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which accommodate floodwaters;
   D.   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase flood damage; and
   E.   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other
lands.
(Ord. 5922 (part), 2013: prior code § 9-100(d))

the structure before the start of the improvement or before the damage
occurred. Only the value of the structure is pertinent, the value of site
improvements such as pools, accessory structures, and landscaping are not
included. The market value for any structure shall be equal to the current
year’s equalized, assessed value as shown by the records of the Pennington
County Director of Equalization.
      33.   MEAN SEA LEVEL. Means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance
Program, the North American Vertical Datum 1988 (NAVD), to which base flood

the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of
construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or
other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The ACTUAL START
means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a
site, such as the pouring of slab or footings; the installation of piles; the
construction of columns; or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the
placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does
not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling, nor does
it include the installation of street and/or walkways; nor does it include
excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundation, or the erection of
temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of
accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds, not occupied as dwelling units

improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of the
market value of the structure either:
            i.   Before the improvement or repair is started; or
            ii.   If the structure has been damaged and is being restored, the
value before the damage occurred. For the purpose of this definition,
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT is considered to occur when the first alteration of any
wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the
structure.
         b.   The term does not however include either:
            i.   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which have been
identified by the local code enforcement or building official and which are the
minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
            ii.   Any alteration of a historic structure, provided the
alteration would not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
“historic structure.”

prohibited by this chapter. (For full requirements, see 44 C.F.R. § 60.6 of the
National Flood Insurance Program regulations.)
      47.   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with the community’s floodplain management regulations. A
structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other
certifications or other evidence of compliance required in 44 C.F.R. §§ 60.3(b)
(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4) or (e)(5) of the National Flood
Insurance Program regulations is presumed to be in VIOLATION until a time as
that documentation is provided.
      48.   WATERCOURSE. The channel and banks of an identifiable watercourse.
The WATERCOURSE does include adjoining floodplain areas. The flood-carrying
capacity of a WATERCOURSE refers to the flood-carrying capacity of the channel
(except in the case of alluvial fans, where a channel is not typically
defined).
      49.   WATERCOURSE ALTERATION. Any realignment or diversion of a channel,
stream, ditch, river, or watercourse, whether the water flows continuously or
intermittently.
      50.   WATER SURFACE ELEVATION. The height, in relation to the North
American Vertical Datum 1988 (NAVD), of floods of various magnitudes and
frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

expert, the Commission shall determine the specific flood hazard at the site
and shall evaluate the suitability of the proposed use in relation to the flood
hazard.
   D.   Factors upon which the decision of the Planning Commission or Common
Council shall be based. In passing upon the applications, the Planning
Commission and Common Council shall consider all relevant factors specified in
other sections of this chapter and:
      1.   The danger to health, safety, welfare and property due to increased
flood heights or velocities caused by encroachments;
      2.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands or
downstream to the injury of any person or property;
      3.   The proposed water supply and wastewater systems and the ability of
these systems to prevent disease, contamination and unsanitary conditions;
      4.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of the damage on the individual occupant, both
present and future;
      5.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community;
      6.   The requirements of the facility for a waterfront location, where
applicable;
      7.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which
are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
      8.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing, anticipated, or
other proposed developments in the foreseeable future;
      9.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for the area;
      10.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
      11.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
transportation of the floodwaters expected at the site;
      12.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, streets and bridges; and
      13.   Such other factors which are relevant to the purpose of this
chapter.
   E.   Conditions attached to variances.
      1.   Upon consideration of the preceding factors and the purposes of this
chapter, the Planning Commission or Common Council may attach such conditions
to be granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of
this chapter.
      2.   Conditions for variances:
         a.   Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a lot of 1/2 acre or less in size contiguous to
and with surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base
level, providing subdivisions 1. through 13. of subsection D. of this section
have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the 1/2 acre, the
technical justifications required for issuing the variance increase.
         b.   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of
historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
historic structure, and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the
historic character and design of the structure.
         c.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated regulatory
floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would
result.
         d.   Variances shall only be issued upon determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary deviation from the requirements of this
chapter.
         e.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
            i.   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
            ii.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
            iii.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization
of the public as identified in subsection D. of this section or conflict with
existing local laws or ordinances.
         f.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be notified in
writing that:
            i.   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the
base flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood
insurance; and
            ii.   Such construction below the base flood level increases risks
to life and property.
      3.   Among such conditions without limitation because of specific
enumeration may be included:
         a.   Modification of waste disposal and water supply facilities;
         b.   Limitations on period of use and operation;
         c.   Imposition of operational controls, sureties and deed
restrictions;
         d.   Requirements for construction of channel modification dikes,
levees, and other protective measures;
         e.   Floodproofing safeguard. Floodproofing safeguards such as the
following shall be designed consistent with the flood protection elevation for
the particular area, flood velocities, durations, rare of rise, hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic forces and other factors associated with the regulatory flood. The
Planning Commission shall require that the applicant submit a plan or document
certified by the registered professional engineer that the floodproofing
safeguards are consistent with the regulatory flood protection elevation and
associated flood factors for the particular area. The following floodproofing
safeguards may be required without limitation because of specific enumeration:
            i.   Anchorage to resist flotation and lateral movement;
            ii.   Installation of watertight doors, bulkheads and shutters, or
similar methods of construction;
            iii.    Reinforcement of walls to resist water pressures;
            iv.   Use of paints, membranes or mortars to reduce seepage of
water through walls;
            v.   Addition of mass or weight to structures to resist flotation;
            vi.   Installation of pumps to lower water levels in the structure;
            vii.   Pumping facilities or comparable practices for subsurface
drainage systems for building to relieve external foundation wall and basement
flood pressures;
            viii.    Construction of water supply and waste treatment systems
so as to prevent the entrance of floodwaters;
            ix.    Construction to resist rupture or collapse caused by water
pressure or floating debris;
            x.   Installation of valves or controls on sanitary and storm
drains which will permit the drains to be closed to prevent backup of sewage
and storm waters into the buildings or structures. Gravity draining of basement
may be eliminated by mechanical devices;
            xi.   Location of all electrical equipment, circuits and installed
electrical appliances in a manner which will assure they are not subject to
flooding and to provide protection from inundation by the regulatory flood;
            xii.   Location of any structural storage facilities for chemicals,
explosives, buoyant materials, flammable liquids, or other toxic materials
which could be hazardous to public health, safety and welfare in a manner which
will assure that the facilities are situated at elevations above the height
associated with the regulatory flood protection elevation or are adequately
floodproofed to prevent flotation of storage containers, which could result in
the escape of toxic materials into floodwaters;
            xiii.   Such other safeguards that the Planning Commission and/or
Common Council shall determine necessary.
   E.   Overriding recommendation of Planning Commission. It shall take a
majority vote of the entire membership of the Common Council to override the
recommendation of the Planning Commission.

   I.   Violation and penalty. Whoever, being the owner or agent of the owner
of any land located within the platting jurisdiction of the city, transfers or
sells the land without having the land platted or replatted, as may be required
by this title and does so before the plat or replat has been approved by the
Director or City Council, as applicable, and recorded in the office of the
Register of Deeds, shall forfeit and pay a penalty of $500 for each portion of
land so transferred or sold. The description by metes and bounds in the
instrument of transfer or other document used in the process of selling or
transferring shall not exempt the transaction from the penalties. The city may
enjoin the transfer, sale or agreement by an action for injunction or may
recover the aforesaid penalty by a civil action in any court of competent
jurisdiction. Furthermore, the city will not issue building permits for
construction on any lot so platted and shall file a building permit restriction
against the deed to the property within the corporate limits of the city.

   C.   Approval criteria. The layout plan application process is not required
and is used to provide information to the applicant regarding the design of the
subdivision and future application processes. A layout plan is not approved by
the Director or DRT and therefore there are no approval criteria. The applicant
can resubmit revised layout plans to the Director.

16.08.110  Vacation of easements.
   A.   Description.  A vacation of easement is a process used to eliminate all
or a portion of an easement for utilities, drainage, access, non-access,
planting screens or any other easement designated on a plat.  The vacation of
easement is reviewed by the DRT and approved by the Director.
   B.   Review.
      1.   The prospective applicant shall meet with the Department’s staff to
discuss the proposed vacation. Staff shall determine the type of easement
application(s) that are required and provide the necessary application
information. Generally, vacation of easement applications can be classified
into 3 categories:
         a.   Vacation of utility easement. The applicant receives a sample
utilities letter from the Department.  The applicant sends out the utility
letter and vacation instrument to all utility companies in order to determine
the impact of the proposed vacation on utilities.  The utility companies shall
be instructed within the letter to respond directly to the Department.
         b.   Vacation of drainage easement. The applicant submits a drainage
report prepared by a licensed professional engineer. The report shall determine
the impact of the proposed vacation on the existing and future drainage. A site
plan may be required.
         c.   Vacation of access, non-access, planting screen or other
easements. An application for vacation of an access, non-access, planting
screen, or other vacation easement shall be signed by all affected property
owners requesting the easement vacation.
      2.   The applicant shall submit the required application, fees, the
specified number of copies of the vacation of easement exhibit and other

vacation instrument shall include the book and page number of the original
document dedicating the easement. Upon receipt of a complete application, the
Director shall provide all information to DRT. The DRT team shall have 13
working days from receipt of the application to complete their review and to
approve, deny, or suspend the application. Applications not acted on within 13
working days of submittal (approved, denied or suspended) shall be deemed
approved.  The exhibit shall be approved by the Director and recorded at the
Pennington County Register of Deeds. The approval, denial, or suspension shall
be provided to the owner and/or designated agent.
   C.   Suspended timelines. If the Director determines that the application
for the vacation of easement does not contain the specified and required
information, the review timeline shall be suspended and the owner and/or
designated agent shall be notified of the deficiency. When complete and
sufficient information is provided by the owner and/or designated agent, the
review timeline shall be re-engaged, with an additional 3 working days added to
the remaining balance of the review timeline.  Applications suspended for more
than 90 consecutive days shall be denied by the Director. Applicants may appeal
to the City Council for extensions, providing that the appeal is heard within
90 days of the suspension.
   D.   Appeal of suspended timelines.  When the owner and/or designated agent
do not concur with the Director regarding the information required for the
vacation of easement an appeal can be filed to the City Council. The City
Council may approve or deny the vacation of easement plat document in its
entirety, upon the applicant’s request, with consideration being given to the
disputed item(s).
   E.   Approval criteria. The Director or City Council as applicable shall
approve a vacation of easement provided that the utility companies consent to
the vacation of the easement and/or the City Engineer determines that the
drainage is not adversely affected, and/or the vacation of the easement does
not alter a recorded easement without the prior approval of the easement
holder.
(Ord. 5772 (part), 2012)
16.08.120  Vacation of public right-of-way and vacation of section line
highway.
   A.   Description. A vacation of public right-of-way or vacation of section
line highway is used to eliminate public rights-of-way that are no longer
needed for public improvements or access. The vacation requires the approval of
a resolution by City Council including an exhibit showing the area to be
vacated.
   B.   Review.  The owner or the designated agent shall submit an application
which includes the legal description of the property for which the vacation is
requested and which is signed by the property owner along with 4 copies of a
vacation instrument marked “Exhibit A” prepared by a licensed professional land
surveyor. The vacation instrument shall include book and page number of the
original plat dedicating right-of-way if applicable. A petition for right-of-
way vacation or vacation of section line highway must be signed by property
owners whose property adjoins that part of the street, alley or public ground
to be vacated. The petition for vacation must be notarized. The applicant shall
send out utility letters and the vacation instrument to all utility companies
in order to determine the impact of the proposed vacation on utilities. The
utility companies are notified within the letter that they are to reply
directly to the Department.  Upon receipt of the vacation instrument and the
letters from the utility companies, the Director and DRT shall have 15 working
days to complete their review and provide a recommendation and resolution
prepared by the City Attorney’s office to the Planning Commission. The Planning
Commission will review the resolution and DRT recommendations and forward a
recommendation to the City Council for their consideration.  The resolution is
set for hearing at the following City Council meeting with formal action being
taken at the next regularly scheduled meeting (approximately 30 days after
Planning Commission).  The vacation of right-of-way and/or vacation of section
line highway petition is a public hearing requiring publication of legal notice
once each week for at least two successive weeks with the City Council taking
formal action on the petition not less than 10 days from expiration of such
publication. This publication requirement will result in formal action being
taken by the City Council approximately 30 days following the action taken by
the Planning Commission.
   C.   Suspended timelines. If the Director determines that the application
for the vacation of public right-of-way does not contain the specified and
required information, the review timeline shall be suspended and the adjacent
landowner or landowners, as applicable, shall be notified of the deficiency. 
When complete and sufficient information is provided by the owner or designated
agent, the review timeline shall be re-engaged, with an additional 3 working
days added to the remaining balance of the review timeline.  Incomplete
applications will not be placed on the Planning Commission agenda. Applications
suspended for more than 90 consecutive days shall be denied by the Director.
The adjacent landowner or landowners may appeal to the City Council for
extensions, providing that the appeal is heard within 90 days of the
suspension.
   D.   Appeal of suspended timelines.  When the owner or designated agent does
not concur with the Director regarding the information required for the
vacation of public right-of-way, an appeal can be filed to the City Council. 
The City Council may approve or deny the vacation of public right-of-way, upon
the applicant’s request, with consideration being given to the disputed item
(s).
   E.   Approval criteria. The Public Works Committee shall recommend and the
City Council shall approve the vacation of public right-of-way provided the
exhibit and supporting documents comply with the following approval criteria:
      1.   The vacation serves the interest of the city by removing maintenance
or liability risks;
      2.   The property interest being vacated is no longer necessary for city
operations;
      3.   The land to be vacated is no longer necessary for the public use and
convenience;
      4.   The vacation will not create any landlocked properties;
      5.   The vacation will not render access to any parcel unreasonable; and
      6.   The vacation will not reduce the quality of public services to any
parcel of land.
   F.   Zoning.  Notwithstanding any provision in this section to the contrary,
the zoning on any property vacated by the city shall be changed without further
action as of the effective date of the vacation to that zoning of the property
to which ownership of the vacated property attaches as a result of such
vacation by the city. When possible, a separate consolidation plat application
to replat the vacated area into a larger usable piece of land should be
submitted by the landowner receiving the vacated parcel.

identification signs, not to exceed 9 square feet in area, shall be permitted. 
Such signs shall indicate nothing other than the name and/or address of the
premises and the name of the management.  Such signs shall be flush with the

   G.   Maximum lot coverage.
      1.   Maximum lot coverage or building coverage is the portion of net
residential land area taken up by buildings.  It is obvious that if buildings
cover too large a percentage of land, insufficient outdoor space will remain
for various uses conducive to health, and this lack of space may also result in
inadequate arrangements for circulation.
      2.   The maximum lot area which may be covered by main buildings shall be
as follows:
 
Residential Structures                           Maximum Net Building Coverage

17.14.050  Usable open space.
   A.   An important factor in establishing the desirability of a residential
area is the amount of open space provided.  Open space should provide a general
feeling of openness and privacy; should provide adequate daylight, sunlight and
air for all dwellings; and usable space outside the dwelling for gardens,
children’s play and adult recreation.

   A.   All uses. No structure (temporary or permanent), fill (including fill
for roads and levees), deposit, obstruction, storage of materials or equipment,
or extraction of sand, gravel or other materials, or other use may be allowed
as a special exception use which, acting alone or in combination with existing
or future uses within the significant reach increases flood heights more than 1
foot.  Consideration of the effects of a proposed use shall be based on a
reasonable assumption that there will be an equal degree of encroachment
extending for a significant reach on both sides of the stream.  In addition,
all floodway special permit uses shall be subject to the standards contained in
building codes, other zoning requirements and building requirements for the
flood fringe building district.
   B.   Fill.
      1.   Any fill proposed to be deposited in the floodway must be shown to
have some beneficial purpose and the amount thereof not greater than is
necessary to achieve that purpose, as demonstrated by a plan submitted by the
owner showing the uses to which the filled land will be put and the final
dimensions of the proposed fill or other materials.
      2.   The fill or other materials shall be protected against erosion by
rip-rap, vegetative cover or bulkheading.
   C.   Structures(temporary or permanent).
      1.   Structures shall not be for human habitation.
      2.   The Council may require any or all of the following:
         a.   Structures of a low flood damage potential type construction;
         b.   That structure or structures, if permitted, be constructed and
placed on the building site so as to offer the minimum obstruction to the flow
of floodwaters;
         c.   Whenever possible, structures to be constructed with the
longitudinal axis parallel to the direction of floodflow;
         d.   So far as practicable, structures be placed approximately on the
same floodflow lines as those of neighboring structures;
         e.   Structures be firmly anchored to prevent flotation which may
result in damage to other structures, restriction of bridge openings and other
narrow sections of the stream or river; and
         f.   Service facilities, such as electrical and heating equipment, be
constructed at or above the regulatory flood protection elevation for the
particular area, or floodproofed.
   D.   Applications to contain evacuation plans. All applications for a
conditional use permit shall contain plans to provide for evacuation.
   E.   Legal description. If any special exception is granted under Chapters
17.10 through 17.48 of this code, a copy of the special exception shall give
the exact legal description of the property and shall state that the property
is located in a flood-prone area and shall contain a statement of the number of
feet that the lowest nonfloodproof floor of the proposed structure will be
below, the regulatory flood protection elevation and a statement that the
actuarial flood insurance rates increase as the first floor elevation decreases
and a copy of the document be recorded with the parcel or parcels of land
covered by the special exception in the office of the register of deeds for the
county in which the property is located and a copy of the special exception
shall be filed with the office of the city’s Finance Officer for forwarding to
the Federal Insurance Administrator in the city’s annual report.

code Appendix A, Art. IV (§ 13 (D)))
17.28.050  Grant of encroachment–Limitations.
   Any grant of encroachment by the city on 1 side of a stream shall not
constitute a waiver to allow encroachment on the other side of the stream.
(Prior code Appendix A, Art. IV (§ 13 (E)))
17.28.060  Warning and disclaimer of liability.
   The degree of flood protection required by the ordinance codified herein is
considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering and
scientific methods of study.  Larger floods may occur on rare occasions.  Flood
heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes such as ice jams and
bridge openings restricted by debris.  The ordinance codified herein does not
imply that areas outside the floodplain districts or land uses permitted within
the districts will be free from flooding or flood damages.  The ordinance
codified herein shall not create liability on the part of the city or any
officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance
thereon or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
(Prior code Appendix A, Art. IV (§ 13 (F)))
17.28.070  Camping prohibited.

prohibition applies to all tent, trailer or recreational vehicle camping of any
duration and at all times of the year.

ARTICLE I.  DEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENTS AND STANDARDS FOR CONDITIONAL USES,
PLANNED DEVELOPMENT OVERLAY DISTRICTS, PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT ZONING
DISTRICTS, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXCEPTIONS
17.50.010  General provisions.
   A.   Purpose. In order to accomplish the general purpose of this title it is
necessary to give special consideration to certain uses because they are unique
in nature, require large land areas, are potentially incompatible with existing
development, or because the effects of the uses cannot definitely be foreseen.
      1.   The conditional uses set out in this article shall be subject to
compliance with the regulations in this article and with the procedure for
authorizing conditional uses as set forth in §
17.54.030.
      2.   The Planned Development Overlay District allows the Planning
Commission to approve an application containing amendments to the development
standards in the underlying zone district chapter. The Planned Development
Overlay District shall not be used to add additional land uses that are not
listed as permitted uses or conditional uses within the underlying zone
district. As applicable an application for a conditional use permit and Planned
Development Overlay District may be combined into the same application provided
the underlying zone district lists the proposed use or uses as a conditional
use. Planned Development Overlay Districts shall be subject to compliance with
the regulations in this article and with the procedure for authorizing
conditional uses as set forth in §
17.54.030 as applicable.
      3.   The Planned Unit Development Zoning District allows for the rezoning
of property to allow land uses and development standards not listed within any
of the specific zone districts within this title. Planned Unit Development
applications shall be subject to compliance with the regulations in this
article and with the procedure for rezoning property as set forth in §
17.54.040 as applicable.
      4.   The administrative exceptions section applies to all zone districts
allows the Director to approve applications for minor amendments to the
development standards in all zoning districts within this title. Administrative
exceptions shall be subject to compliance with the regulations in this article.
   B.   The uses set out in this article shall also be subject to compliance
with the regulations for building in the flood fringe building district if the
lands concerned lie within the flood fringe building district.
(Ord. 6282 (part), 2019: Ord. 5881, 2013; Prior code Appendix A, Art. V (§ 1
(part)))
17.50.020  Townhouses–General requirements.
   A.   Townhouses may be permitted in LDR-2, MDR, HDR zoning districts and in
the LDR- 1 zoning district within a planned development. If the requirements of
§
17.50.030 are met, townhouses shall be permitted uses within LDR-2, MDR and HDR
zoning districts.  Otherwise, townhouses may be permitted as a conditional use
or within a planned development.
   B.   In the LDR-1 and LDR-2 zoning districts, there shall be no more than 2
attached dwelling units on any townhouse development lot.
   C.   In the MDR and HDR zoning districts, there shall be no more than 12
attached dwelling units on a townhouse development lot.
   D.   Prior to issuance of a building permit, the area upon which a group of
attached townhouses are to be constructed must be a platted lot which shall be
referred to as a townhouse development lot.
   E.   Proposed individual townhouse lot lines for a group of townhouses shall
be submitted on a site plan and approved prior to issuance of a building
permit.  Following the start of construction, the final location of individual
townhouse lots shall be determined and platted.
   F.   In order to permit openings in exterior walls, each townhouse structure
and its appendage and projections shall have a minimum 6-foot setback from
individual townhouse lot lines which are not common to other individual
townhouse lots, unless approved otherwise in a planned development or in a
conditional use permit.
   G.   Townhouses shall have a 6-foot exterior maintenance easement on either
side of a common lot line to provide adequate room for maintenance, repair and
alterations.
   H.   Townhouses shall conform to city’s Building and Utility Codes.
(Ord. 6292 (part), 2018: Ord. 3760 (part), 2001: Prior code Appendix A, Art. V
(§ 1 (A)(I)))
17.50.030  Townhouses–Standard requirements.
   A.   Minimum lot size. There shall be no minimum lot size of a townhouse
development lot or an individual townhouse lot.  However, all applicable
setback, density and open space requirements of this article must be met.
   B.   Front yard setback. The front yard setback shall comply with the
requirements of the underlying zoning district.
   C.   Side yard setback. A group of townhouses shall have a minimum side yard
setback of 8 feet for single-story structures and 12 feet for 2-story
structures, measured from the property line of the townhouse development lot to
the group of townhouses.
   D.   Rear yard setback. A group of townhouses shall have a rear yard setback
of 25 feet, measured from the property line of the townhouse development lot to
the group of townhouses.
   E.   Lot width. An individual townhouse lot shall have a minimum width of 16
feet.
   F.   Lot area. Individual townhouse lots shall have land area in addition to
the area upon which the structure is built.  This land area shall, at a
minimum, meet open space requirements for individual townhouse lots.
   G.   Density. Maximum density for townhouses located in LDR-2, MDR and HDR
zoning districts shall be 4,000 square feet of land area for each townhouse
unit located on the townhouse development lot.
   H.   Maximum coverage. Main and accessory buildings shall not cover more
than 40% of the townhouse development lot.
   I.   Open space requirements. Individual townhouse lots shall have a minimum
of 300 square feet of open space.  A townhouse development lot shall have a
total of 600 square feet of open space per unit overall.  Open space does not
include driveways, parking or service areas.
   J.   Height regulations. No building shall exceed 2½ stories or 35 feet.
   K.   Off-street parking. Two off-street parking spaces shall be provided for
each townhouse.
(Ord. 6292 (part), 2018: Prior code Appendix A, Art. V (§ 1 (A)(II)))
17.50.040  Townhouses–Procedure.
   A.   If a proposed townhouse development meets all of the requirements
listed in §
17.50.030, a building permit may be issued, provided all other applicable city
codes are met.
   B.   Procedure.
      1.   The standard requirements for lot area, density, lot coverage and
open space for individual townhouse lots may be reduced if, in the opinion of
the Planning Commission and the Common Council, variation of these particular
requirements will encourage the development of previously platted smaller land
parcels and/or permit innovative land development which is consistent with the
intent of this article. Any variation from the standard requirements will
require special review and the conditional use procedure shall be followed.
      2.   If the conditional use permit procedure is utilized, density should
not exceed 1 dwelling unit per 2,250 square feet. The requirements of open
space on individual townhouses lots may be waived, but the overall open space
requirements of 600 square feet per unit for the townhouses development lot
shall remain. The Planning Commission and the City Council may also allow an
individual townhouse lot to consist of only the townhouse structure and minimum
setback, if a determination is made that common open space is adequate in size
and appropriate in location.
      3.   In order to permit adequate review proposal, the petitioner shall
submit the following information on a site plan at a scale no greater than 1
inch equals 50 feet:
         a.   Location and proposed setbacks of all structures including
accessory structures;
         b.   Off-street parking facilities including parking spaces, loading/
unloading areas and traffic circulation areas and curbs cuts;
         c.   Landscaping plans;
         d.   Location of all common areas and designated open space;
         e.   Location of proposed lot lines;
         f.   Location, width, grade of all proposed public and private
streets;
         g.   Topography at a maximum of 5-foot contour intervals;
         h.   Proposed grading plans;
         i.   Location of proposed fencing; and
         j.   Documentation of ownership and maintenance responsibility of
common open space, structures, facilities, private streets, drainage and
utility easements.
      4.   This information shall be reviewed by the Department, Building
Official, Fire Marshal and Public Works Department in order to determine the
appropriateness of a proposed conditional use for a townhouse project.
   C.   Townhouses, may also be permitted within planned developments.  The
requirements of §§
17.50.020 and
17.50.030 may be altered if the proposed townhouses are part of an approved
planned development.
(Ord. 6282 (part), 2019: Ord. 5114, 2005: Ord. 3760 (part), 2001: prior code
Appendix A, Art. V (§ I (A)(III)))
17.50.050  Planned Development Overlay District (PD).
   A.   Purpose. The planned development overlay shall replace the following
planned development ordinance designations in effect prior to May 11, 2012:
      1.   Planned development designation (PDD);
      2.   Planned residential development (PRD);
      3.   Planned unit development (PUD);
      4.   Planned commercial development (PCD);
      5.   Planned light industrial development (PLID); and
      6.   Planned industrial development (PID).
   B.   Intent. The intent of the planned development overlay (PD) is to permit
greater flexibility and promote development that is more economically efficient
while being compatible with adjacent land uses than would otherwise normally be
allowed by the underlying zoning district.  It is further intended:
      1.   To allow deviations from the minimum, maximum, or location criteria
from the underlying zoning district standards;
      2.   To simplify and enhance the development review and approval process
by allowing a conditional use permit application and planned development
application to be processed as a single application;
      3.   To promote compatibility with adjacent land use and available public
facilities; and
      4.   To provide optional methods of land development and encourage
imaginative design.
   C.   General provisions.
      1.   All provisions of any existing PDD, PRD, PUD, PCD, PLID and/or PID
approved by the city prior to May 11, 2012 shall remain in effect.
      2.   Any major amendment to an approved PRD, PUD, PCD, PLID and/or PID
shall follow the procedures outlined in §
17.50.050.F.
      3.   Property owners may request and be granted a revocation of any PDD
approved prior to May 11, 2012 by the Director provided it was not approved in
conjunction with a rezoning application. Revocation of a PDD approved in
conjunction with a rezoning application may be approved by the Planning
Commission following the procedures outlined in §
17.50.050.F.
      4.   A request for a conditional use may be included within the submittal
of a final planned development application. When requesting a conditional use
within a planned development application the more restrictive requirements
shall apply.
      5.   Where a conflict exists between an approved planned development and
the regulations of the underlying zoning district, the approved planned
development shall prevail.
   D.   Definitions.
      1.   DEVELOPMENT REVIEW TEAM. The DEVELOPMENT REVIEW TEAM (DRT) is
composed of city staff and representatives of outside agencies that have an
interest in or would be affected by a proposed PD application. The Director
shall maintain a list of current members and may revise the list. The Director
or designee within the Department will select members from the DRT list and
forward PD applications to the selected members for review and comment. Copies
of the list are available for inspection in the office of the Director.
      2.   PLANNED DEVELOPMENT DESIGNATION (PDD). A procedure designating a
property as a planned development by the Director prior to approval of an
initial or final planned development. A PDD indicates that the city
acknowledges there are sufficient factors associated with the property that a
future planned development may be warranted but provides no assurance that an
initial or final planned development application will be approved. PLANNED
DEVELOPMENT DESIGNATIONS shall have no expiration period. A PDD is optional and
not required prior to submittal of an initial or final development plan.
      3.   INITIAL PLANNED DEVELOPMENT. An INITIAL PLANNED DEVELOPMENT is a
preliminary development plan submitted for a planned development and may be
used for projects with several phases. An INITIAL PLANNED DEVELOPMENT may be
formally acted upon by the Planning Commission after review by the DRT. An
initial development plan can be filed concurrently with a final planned
development. An INITIAL PLANNED DEVELOPMENT is optional and not required prior
to submittal of a final planned development.
      4.   FINAL PLANNED DEVELOPMENT. A FINAL PLANNED DEVELOPMENT is a detailed
development plan that is formally acted upon by the Planning Commission after
review by the DRT. An approved final development plan shall be approved prior
to issuance of building permits unless the development proposal complies with
the underlying zoning district requirements or is approved by City Council.
   E.   Planned development designation application requirements.
      1.   Information required for a planned development designation.

posted on the site not less than 7 days before the Planning Commission hearing.
Approved signs shall be provided by the Department and include a reasonable
deposit sufficient to cover the cost of replacement of the sign. The sign shall
be maintained on the site until the Planning Commission has approved the
initial or final planned development or until the City Council’s action on an
appeal is final or the petition is withdrawn.
      5.   Criteria for review. In reviewing applications for an initial
planned development and/or final planned development, the following findings
shall be considered in a recommendation for approval or denial:
         a.   There are certain conditions pertaining to the particular piece
of property in question because of its size shape, or topography;
         b.   The application of these regulations to this particular piece of
property would create a practical difficulty or undue hardship;
         c.   Exceptions to the underlying zoning district, if granted, would
not cause undue hardship to the public good or impair the purposes and intent
of these regulations;
         d.   A literal interpretation of this chapter would deprive the
applicant of rights that others in the same district are allowed;
         e.   Any adverse impacts will be reasonably mitigated; or
         f.   The requested exception to the underlying zoning district
standards is an alternative or innovative practice that reasonably achieves the
objective of the existing standard sought to be modified.
   G.   Initial and final planned development amendments.
      1.   A major amendment to an initial or final planned development shall
require approval of the Planning Commission or City Council, as applicable,
following the process outlined above in §
17.50.050.F.
      2.   Minor amendments shall be submitted to the Director on a revised
initial or final planned development plan showing the requested changes.  Minor
amendments that may be approved administratively by the Director include:
         a.   An increase in overall density, intensity or area of use less
than 20%;
         b.   Any proposed change in the approved phasing plan;
         c.   A decrease in setbacks less than 20%;
         d.   An increase in height of buildings less than 20%;
         e.   A decrease in the size of designated open spaces or recreation
areas less than 20%;
         f.   A decrease in the number of parking, loading, or unloading spaces
less than 20%;
         g.   A decrease in the amount of landscaping less than 20%;
         h.   A change in the street pattern which would not adversely impact
adjacent property;
         i.   Changes in the location and number of curb cuts;
         j.   Changes in items such as location of landscaping, fencing, fire
access lanes, parking, loading, or unloading spaces, trash and service areas,
signage and sidewalk location which the Director determines to be insignificant
in nature; and
         k.   Any other proposed change deemed by the Director to be a minor
change to the approved planned development.
   H.   Administrative dissolution of planned developments.
      1.   A planned development may be dissolved administratively if the
reason the planned development was needed is mitigated due to redevelopment of
the property to meet current zoning district requirements, if zoning
regulations change such that the property becomes compliant, or if the property
is rezoned to a district where the property is in compliance. However, if a
planned development was approved in conjunction with a rezoning application,
then it cannot be administratively dissolved.
      2.   Subsection H.1. shall also apply to any PRD, PUD, PCD, PLID and/or
PID in effect prior to May 11, 2012.

17.50.060  Planned Unit Development (PUD) Zoning District.
   A.   Purpose. The purpose of the Planned Unit Development (PUD) Zoning
District is to provide a process for the creation of a zoning district that
allows for a mix of land uses and development standards that would not
otherwise be permitted within the conventional zoning districts of this
chapter. Once approved by City Council a PUD secures the land use and
development standards for the property as a separate and unique zoning
district. A PUD may be approved for a range of project sizes including but not
limited to large scale projects with multiple lots and a mix of land uses or
for a small-scale single lot project which requires flexibility because of
unique circumstances or to promote unique design.
   B.   Intent. The intent of the Planned Unit Development (PUD) regulations is
to permit greater flexibility of use and, consequently, more creative and
imaginative design for development than generally is possible under
conventional zoning regulations. It is further intended:
      1.   To promote more economical and efficient use of land;
      2.   To provide flexible zoning entitlements for projects that may be
subdivided and developed in multiple phases;
      3.   To establish a method for providing future connections between
existing and proposed developments in order to achieve an integrated community
with common open space, transportation, transit, and public services networks;
and
      4.   To allow for innovative development projects.
   C.   Definitions.
      1.   DEVELOPMENT REVIEW TEAM.  The DEVELOPMENT REVIEW TEAM (DRT) is
composed of city staff and representatives of outside agencies that have an
interest in or would be affected by a proposed PUD application. The Director
shall maintain a list of current members and may revise the list. The Director
or designee within the Department will select members from the DRT list and
forward PUD applications to the selected members for review and comment.
      2.   PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT (PUD). A zoning district designation for a
tract of land controlled by one or more landowners, which is developed under a
plan for either residential, commercial/retail, industrial, public,
agricultural, open space, or recreation uses or a combination thereof.
      3.   PUD CONCEPT PLAN. A preliminary development plan submittal to be
reviewed by the development review team prior to the preparation and submittal
of a PUD zoning document. The PUD CONCEPT PLAN is designed to aid the city and
applicant in preparing a complete PUD zoning document application.
      4.   PUD ZONING DOCUMENT. A zoning entitlement document to be reviewed by
the Planning Commission and approved by the City Council. The PUD ZONING
DOCUMENT is not an overlay district and once approved is the official zoning
district designation for the property. An approved PUD ZONING DOCUMENT is
recorded at the County Register of Deeds and is used to guide the future
subdivision and development of the property.
   D.   PUD concept plan application requirements and approval process.
      1.   PUD concept plan submittal requirements.  A completed application
form shall be submitted with the PUD concept plan. The PUD concept plan shall

17.50.070  Administrative exceptions.
   A.   Purpose. The purpose of the administrative exception process is to
allow for the administrative approval of minor deviations from the zoning
district standards, development standards, and area regulations within all
zoning districts. An administrative exception is a form of relief granted to a
landowner when the strict application of a particular regulation would result
in peculiar, exceptional, or practical difficulties upon the property owner.
Such relief shall only be granted provided there will be no substantial
detriment to the public health, safety, and welfare of the present and future
inhabitants of the city.
   B.   Intent. The intent of the administrative exception process is to allow
the Director to approve minor variations from the zoning ordinance. It is
further intended that minor variations to the code may be approved to address:
      1.   A property constraint such as lot configuration or lot area;
      2.   A topographic, geological, hydrological, or environmental factor;
      3.   A non-conforming issue for pre-existing structures;
      4.   A new construction issue caused by survey or construction error; and
      5.   A new construction proposal that is innovative and/or would not
cause substantial detriment to the public good or significantly impair the
purposes and intent of these regulations.
   C.   General provisions. The Director is authorized by the City Council to
approve minor exceptions provided the application complies with the process
outlined within this section. In no circumstance shall the Director approve a
minor modification that results in a change in permitted land uses that would
require the approval of a conditional use permit or rezoning of the property.
      1.   The Director is authorized to grant deviations of up to 20% of any
minimum or maximum zoning district standards, development standards, and area
regulations including but not limited to:
         a.   Development density or intensity;
         b.   Building lot coverage;
         c.   Lot frontage, lot depth, and lot area;
         d.   Building floor area, setback and height;
         e.   Parking, loading and unloading spaces;
         f.   Landscape standards; and
         g.   Fence height and setback.
      2.   The Director is also authorized to grant deviations from any
specific location and/or material requirements prescribed in this chapter
including but not limited to:
         a.   A change in the requirement for screen fence and/or open style
fence;
         b.   A building material type or amount;
         c.   Location and height of fencing;
         d.   Location of landscaping and landscape buffer;
         e.   Location of trash and service areas;
         f.   Location of parking areas, access lanes, and loading stalls;
         g.   Location of sidewalk, pedestrian and bicycle facilities;
         h.   Location of utility cabinets and appurtenances; and
         i.   Any other location and/or building material requirement which the
Director determines to be insignificant in nature.
      3.   In the Urban commercial district, the Director is authorized to
grant deviations under subsections C.1. and 2. and is authorized to grant other
exceptions as identified in
Chapter 17.66 when an exception is supported by the adopted comprehensive plan.
   D.   Application requirements. To initiate an application for an
administrative exception, an application shall be submitted to the Department
and include the following:
      1.   An application form signed by the property owner or authorized
representative and fee;
      2.   A written narrative explaining and justifying the request; and
      3.   A site plan drawn to scale showing all property lines with
dimensions, location of buildings and other structures, north arrow, street
numbers, lot and/or parcel number, locations of setback lines or other
dimensional requirements from which the administrative exception is sought.
   E.   Approval process. Upon receipt of a complete application and the
required information, the Director shall have 7 working days from receipt of
the application to complete the review and to recommend approval, denial, or
suspension of the application. If the Director determines that the application
does not contain the specified and required information, the review timeline
shall be suspended and the applicant shall be notified of the deficiency. When
complete and sufficient information is provided by the applicant, the review
timeline shall be re-engaged, with an additional 3 working days added to the
remaining balance of the review timeline. The Director shall approve the
application, approve the application with conditions, or deny the application.
An administrative exception may be approved by the Director upon determination
that 1 or more of the following findings exists:
      1.   There are certain conditions pertaining to the particular piece of
property in question because of its size shape, or topography;
      2.   The application of these regulations to this particular piece of
property would create a practical difficulty or undue hardship;
      3.   Exceptions, if granted, would not cause undue hardship to the public
good or impair the purposes and intent of these regulations;
      4.   A literal interpretation of this chapter would deprive the applicant
of rights that others in the same district are allowed;
      5.   Any adverse impacts will be reasonably mitigated; or
      6.   The requested exception is an alternative or innovative practice
that reasonably achieves the objective of the existing standard sought to be
modified.
   F.   Appeals. The decision of the Director to approve the application with
conditions or deny any application under the administrative exception review
process may be appealed to the Board of Adjustment following the application
procedures in §
17.54.020.
   G.   Documentation of approval.  The Director shall note the terms of the
approved exception directly on the amended plan and affix his or her signature
and the date of approval.

   B.   Administration. The provisions of this section apply to the Rapid City
Sign Code.
      1.   The Building Official is authorized and directed to enforce all the
provisions of this code.
      2.   The Building Official shall have the power to render interpretations
of this code and to adopt and enforce rules and supplemental regulations in
order to clarify the application of its provisions. The interpretations, rules
and regulations shall be in conformance with the intent and purpose of this
code.
      3.   The Building Official may deputize inspectors or employees as may be
necessary to assist in carrying out the administration and enforcement of this
code.
      4.   When it is necessary to make an inspection to enforce the provisions
of this code, or when the Building Official has reasonable cause to believe
that there exists a sign or a condition which is contrary to, or in violation
of this code, the Building Official may enter the premises at reasonable times
to inspect or to perform duties imposed by this code, provided credentials be
presented to the occupant and entry requested, if premises are occupied.  If
premises are unoccupied, the Building Official shall make a reasonable effort
to locate the owner or other person having charge or control of the premises
and request entry. If entry is refused, the Building Official shall have
recourse to the remedies provided by law to secure entry.
      5.   Whenever the work is being done in contrary to the provisions of
this code, or other pertinent laws or ordinances implemented through the

notice in writing served on any persons engaged in doing or causing the work to
be done. Work must then be stopped until otherwise authorized by the Building
Official.
      6.   This code shall not be construed to relieve from or lessen the
responsibility to any person owning, operating or controlling any sign or sign
structure for any damages to persons or property caused by defects, nor shall
the city be held as assuming any such liability by reason of the inspections
authorized by this code or any permits issued under this code.
      7.   All provisions of the laws and ordinances of the city and the state
shall be complied with, whether specified herein or not. In the event that
portions of this section conflict with other portions, or portions of this
section conflict with state or federal law, the more restrictive requirement
shall apply. In addition, compliance with this code does not presume to give
authority to violate, cancel or set aside any of the provisions of the building
code, municipal code or other local law, or ordinance regulating construction
or the performance of construction in the city.
   C.   Enforcement.
      1.   The Building Official may declare any sign unlawful if it is not
properly maintained, if it is not structurally sound, if it has been abandoned,
if it was erected without a proper permit, if it does not qualify as a legal
non-conforming sign and violates some provision of this code, or if it is in
violation of any other provision of the city code, state law or federal law.
      2.   Upon determining that a sign is unlawful, the Building Official
shall prepare a written notice and order which shall describe the sign and
specify the violation involved and shall state that if the sign is not removed,
or the violation is not corrected within a specified period of time as
determined by the Building Official, the sign shall be removed in accordance
with the provisions of this section. The owner of the building, structure,
premises, or sign shall be responsible for the cost of removing the sign or
sign structure.
      3.   Service of the notice and order shall be made upon all persons
entitled thereto either personally or by mailing a copy of the notice and order
by certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, to each such
person at their address as it appears on the last equalized assessments roll of
the county or as known to the Building Official. If no address of any such
person so appears or is known to the Building Official, then a copy of the
notice and order shall be mailed, addressed to the person, at the address of
the premises where the unlawful sign is located. The failure of any such person
to receive the notice and order shall not affect the validity of any
proceedings taken under this section. Service by certified mail in the manner
herein provided shall be effective on receipt of mailing.

sign; changing light bulbs; performing routine maintenance and upgrades on a
sign’s wiring or electrical systems; or installing energy saving technology or
maintaining or replacing the digital components or digital modules on existing

adjusting the mounting methods as necessary, so long as the change does not
require any other changes or modifications to the sign structure in addition to
the device being installed.
      2.   One construction sign shall be allowed per lot. The sign shall not
exceed 32 square feet in area, and shall not be erected until a building permit
has been issued. The sign shall be removed within 14 days after the issuance of

viewed from any public property or to other adjacent property. Determination of
intent and design shall be based upon the size, location, orientation and

message to patrons of the property upon which they are located, rather than to
persons viewing the sign from any public property or from adjoining property,
and the extent to which reasonable measures have been taken to limit the
conveying of a message to persons viewing the sign from any public property or
from adjoining property. Specifically, design and intent shall be determined by
a good faith standard and with an intent that this exemption shall not be used

a message to patrons of the premises upon which such sign is located. Nothing
herein shall be construed as exempting the signs from any other provision of
this code or any other ordinance, law, rule or regulation;

      1.   Any sign that is internally illuminated, or which displays
electronic variable messages through light emitting diodes, liquid crystal
display, plasma image display, or any other light emitting mechanism must be
equipped with automatic dimming technology that automatically adjusts the
display’s brightness based upon ambient light conditions. The brightness level
for signs shall not exceed a brightness level of 0.3 foot candles above ambient
light as measured using a foot candle (Lux) meter at a preset distance
depending on sign area, measured as follows:
 
Area of Sign Sq. ft. Measurement Distance (ft.)
10  32
15  39
20  45
25  50
30  55
35  59
40  63
45  67
50  71
55  74
60  77
65  81
70  84
75  87
80  89
85  92
90  95
95  97
100 100
 
      2.   For signs with an area in square feet other than those specifically
listed in the table (i.e., 12 square feet, 400 square feet, etc.), the
measurement distance may be calculated with the following formula: The square
root of the product of the sign area and 100.
         Example using a 12-square-foot sign:
         Measurement Distance =  (12 sq. ft. x 100) = 34.6
      3.   The brightness measurement shall be performed as follows:
         a.   At least 30 minutes after sunset or 30 minutes before sunrise,
the Building Official shall measure and determine the sign’s brightness by
aiming a foot-candle meter directly at the sign. The measurement will be taken
as close as possible to the above prescribed distance from the sign face being
measured.
         b.   After the sign brightness has been determined, the Building
Official shall contact the sign owner or the owner’s agent to schedule a time
to measure and determine the ambient light conditions with the electronic
messaging center off or while displaying all black copy. The ambient light
reading shall be taken with the same foot-candle meter at the same location
used to establish the sign’s brightness.
         c.   Once the 2 light readings have been determined, the second
measurement reading shall be subtracted from the first measurement reading. To
be in compliance with this standard, the difference of the two readings shall
be 0.3 foot-candles or less.
   O.   Existing digital, LED or video type signage. Existing off-premises
signs and public purpose signs displaying variable messages through the use of
internal illumination technology or through light emitting diodes, liquid
crystal displays, plasma image displays, or any other similar light emitting
technology may only display static messages. Full motion images, graphics or
video are prohibited. Static copy on these signs may be changed at a minimum
interval of 8 seconds.
   P.   Sign benches. Sign benches displaying off-premises advertising may be
located only on commercial premises. The display area on any sign bench shall
not exceed 12 square feet. No more than 3 sign benches shall be located on any
premises. Sign benches must be located within a 50-foot radius of each other.

      7.   Rules. The Historic Sign Review Committee may adopt bylaws and rules
in accordance with the authority granted by this section.
      8.   Permit issuance.  If the Historic Sign Review Committee approved an
application for a sign which meets the criteria established by this section,
then a sign permit may be issued. In order to ensure compliance with the

stipulations that must be met before a sign permit may be issued by the city.
If the Historic Sign Review Committee denies an application for a sign which
does not meet the criteria established by this section, the applicant shall be
notified in writing as to the reasons for denial. Decisions of the Historic
Sign Review Committee may be appealed to the City Council.
      9.   Register of Historic Signs. The Committee may create a Register of
Historic Signs. The Committee may add signs to the Register that are lettered
or symbolic messages
         a.   Affixed to or associated with historic buildings, or
         b.   Signs that otherwise merit inclusion on the register due to the

   S.   Miscellaneous signs. The following sign requirements are intended to
provide exceptions or qualify and supplement the other requirements of this
code:
      1.   A permit may be issued to a business, public entity, or a civic,
charitable or fraternal organization for a temporary banner, pennant, sandwich
board sign or air gas filled figure. A temporary sign shall not exceed 15 feet
in height. A permit may be issued up to twice a year to the same business or
organization and shall be issued for a maximum duration of 30 days. The permit
may authorize temporary signage at multiple locations throughout the city. The
fee for this permit will be calculated in the same manner as the permit fee for
on on-premises sign permit.
      2.   The City Council may authorize the placement of banners on public
light poles and structures which promote the city, any educational institutions
within the city, or which promote community events, activities and
celebrations. Such banners may not convey a commercial message, but may
identify sponsors. The City Council may impose conditions upon which its
authorization to mount banners under this section has been given, including the
length of time the banner(s) may be located in the authorized location. The
City Council may also establish rules and administrative procedures for the
mounting of banners under this section and may further enter into agreements
with public or private groups to mount and maintain banners on light poles or
other public structures within the city.
      3.   Public or private institutions, school, nonprofit membership
organizations, and philanthropic institutions that are educational, cultural,
religious or recreational in nature and located in a zoning district that does
not otherwise provide for on-premises signage may display on-premises signs.
However, such sign or part thereof shall not contain a commercial advertising
message. The signs shall comply with the following:
         a.   One on-premises ground sign shall be allowed per street frontage.
The maximum height and area of the sign shall be based on its distance from the
street frontage based on the following table:
 
Distance from Street Frontage Maximum Height Maximum Area
0 to 50 ft.                   8 ft.          32 sq. ft.
50 to 200 ft.                 15 ft.         64 sq. ft.
Over 200 ft.                  20 ft.         120 sq. ft.
 
         b.   One on-premises wall sign shall be allowed per street frontage.
The maximum area for the signs is based on the distance from the street
frontage and is identical to the area allowed for on-premises ground signs. The
height of the wall sign is dependent on the height of the building and is not
subject to the restrictions on height for on-premises ground signs. If a wall
sign is directly adjacent to a walking or other paved surface, it must be at
least 8 feet from the lowest part of the sign to the surface grade;
         c.   Signs shall not be placed within a required sight triangle or a
required parking area; and
         d.   Electric signs shall comply with §
17.50.080K.
      4.   For home businesses or occupations located in residential zoning
districts, the total area of wall signs or ground signs is 1 square foot for
each dwelling unit. Wall signs or ground signs for all residential entities on
the premises must also meet the following:
         a.   A maximum of 1 such sign per street frontage is allowed;
         b.   The maximum height of the sign shall be 5 feet; and
      5.   Wall signs or ground signs for a commercial use in a residential
district or a home occupation may be 1 square foot in size per commercial use
or home occupation.
      6.   Miscellaneous signs shall not be located within any clear sight
triangle as set forth by city’s Municipal Code.
      7.   In addition to any applicable requirements of §
17.50.080N., the light from any light source intended to illuminate a
miscellaneous sign, or emanating from an internally illuminated miscellaneous
sign, shall be so shaded, shielded, directed or of such an intensity that the
brightness shall not adversely affect surrounding or facing premises, nor
adversely affect safe vision of pedestrians or operators of vehicles moving on
public or private streets, driveways or parking areas. If a miscellaneous sign
is located in a residential zoning district, any illumination will be turned
off from 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m.
   T.   Joint identification signs.
      1.   A JOINT IDENTIFICATION SIGN is defined as a sign designed to
identify multiple business located in a specific area that has been designated
as a development complex by the Director or their designee regardless of
whether said establishments occupy separate structures or are under separate
ownership.
      2.   A DEVELOPMENT COMPLEX is defined as a shopping center or 3 or more
businesses in close proximity to each other that are part of a common
development where joint identification signs will be allowed. The factors to
consider in determining if a shopping center or 3 or more businesses in close
proximity to each other are part of a common development are the layout of the
site, the ownership of the land and whether or not the businesses share access,
customer parking areas or other common areas. It is not required that the lots
within a development complex be under common ownership if other factors which
support the finding that a shopping center or grouping of 3 or more businesses
are part of a common development are present. If the area being designated as a
development complex for purposes of allowing a joint identification sign
contains lots that are under separate ownership, all the lot owners must
consent to the designation.
      3.   In addition to a sign permit, an applicant requesting to designate
an area as a development complex must submit information relating to the
factors described in §
17.50.080.T.2. The Director or their designee will review the information
submitted and in addition to determining whether or not the proposed joint
identification sign is in compliance with the requirements of the code
pertaining to joint identification signs, will determine whether or not to
designate the requested area as a development complex. Any person or group
aggrieved by the decision of the Director or their designee to designate an
area as a development complex may appeal such decision to the City Council. The
time for appealing this determination shall be limited to 7 days. The Building
Official cannot issue a sign permit until the time for appeal has expired.
      4.   Joint identification signs will be treated as on-premises signs for
all businesses located within the development complex whether or not they are
located on the same legally described parcel as the sign. Joint identification
signs can only identify those businesses or activities that are located within
the development complex.
      5.   Each development complex shall be permitted 1 monument sign per
public street frontage. For purposes of this section, a MONUMENT SIGN is
defined as a freestanding sign not erected on 1 or more poles or other similar
supports but erected to rest on the ground or on a base designed as an
architectural unit with the sign. Individual on-premises ground signs will not
be allowed for business located within the development complex. There shall be
a minimum distance of 100 feet between joint identification signs. Each
business will be allowed to have on-premises wall signs as allowed under this
code.
      6.   Joint identification signs will be allowed to have a maximum area of
100 square feet or 1 square foot of sign for each 2 linear feet of street
frontage of the development complex, whichever is greater. Provided that the
total area of all signs on each frontage shall not exceed 200 square feet.
      7.   The maximum height of a joint identification sign shall be 15 feet.
      8.   Joint identification signs must be located on property that has been
designated as part of the development complex. No joint identification sign can
be located closer than 10 feet from any external boundary of the development
complex.
   U.   Non-conforming signs. Any sign which was legal at the time it was
constructed is a legal non-conforming sign. A legal non-conforming sign which
is moved, relocated, structurally altered, or damaged by more than 50% of the
sign’s value at the time the damage occurs, must be brought in to full
compliance with all requirements of the Rapid City Municipal Code. Any legal
non-conforming sign which is structurally altered and is not brought into
compliance with all requirements of the Rapid City Municipal Code shall be
deemed unlawful by the Building Official and removed in accordance with §
17.50.080C. of this Rapid City Municipal Code or any other applicable
regulations related to unlawful signs.
   V.   Severability. If any section, sentence, clause, phrase or other portion
of this section is held invalid or unconstitutional by any court of competent
jurisdiction, it shall in no way affect the validity of any remaining portions
of this section.
   W.   Variances. Applications for variances for sign height, sign area, sign
setback, sign spacing, and total number of signs within this section, §§
17.50.090 and
17.50.100 are subject to the review and approval process requirements outlined
in §§
17.50.050,
17.50.060,
17.50.070, and
17.54.020 as applicable.
   X.   Replacement of condemned signs. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this section, any off-premise sign which is removed under the eminent domain
authority of any governmental unit as a part of a publicly funded construction
project may be replaced in accordance with the following requirements:
      1.   Prior to removal, the governmental unit proposing to relocate the
off-premise sign shall make an application to the Building Official for
permission to relocate an off-premise sign. The governmental unit applying for
permission to relocate an off-premise sign shall provide on its application its
certification that the sign is being removed pursuant to its eminent domain
authority for the purpose of undertaking the construction of a publicly funded
construction project, the location, size, and a description of the existing
off-premise sign, and all information required for applications for new off-
premise signs for the proposed location of the new sign. The governmental unit
is not required to supply off-premise sign credits to make the application
under this section.
      2.   Upon receipt of the application from a governmental unit, the
Building Official shall review the application for completeness. The Building
Official shall have the request placed upon the next available Public Works
agenda.
      3.   Prior to the next available Public Works agenda, the Building
Official shall make an on-site inspection of the off-premise sign. If the
Building Official determines that the off-premise sign that is the subject of
the application for relocation is an illegal sign, he or she shall proceed in
accordance with the provisions of this section regarding the removal of illegal
signs. No illegal sign may be relocated. If the Building Official determines
that the sign is not an illegal sign, he or she shall report that fact to the
Public Works Committee.
      4.   Upon receipt of the application for relocation of the off-premise
sign and the report of the Building Official, the Public Works Committee shall
recommend to the Council whether to authorize the relocation of the off-premise
sign.
      5.   Upon receipt of the recommendation of the Public Works Committee,
the Council may authorize the removal and relocation of the off-premise sign.
The decision of the Council is final.
      6.   Any off-premise sign relocated under the authority of this section
shall be constructed in such a manner as to comply with the requirements of
this section pertaining to the size, height, and all structural requirements of
this section and all other provisions of the Rapid City Municipal Code
regulating the construction of structures.
      7.   Upon the approval of the application for relocation, the
governmental unit or the owner of the relocated sign may apply for a
conditional use permit as required by Title 17 of the Rapid City Municipal
Code. No sign authorized to be relocated under the provisions of this section
shall be constructed until all the requirements of Title 17 are met.
   Y.   Substitution of noncommercial speech for commercial speech.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this section to the contrary, any
lawfully erected off-premises or other sign displaying a commercial message
may, at the option of the owner, display a noncommercial message. The
noncommercial message may occupy the entire sign face or any portion thereof.
The sign face may be changed from commercial to noncommercial messages, or from
1 noncommercial message to another, as frequently as desired by the owner of
the sign, in compliance with the rest of this section, provided that the sign
is not a prohibited sign or sign-type and provided that the size, height,
setback, dimensional and other criteria contained in this section are
satisfied.
   Z.   Penalty. In addition to any administrative actions or remedies
authorized by this code, a violation of this section shall be subject to the
city's general penalty provision, §
1.12.010 of this code.

17.50.090  Off-premises signage.
   A.   Off-premises signage.
      1.   Off-premises signs, where permitted, shall be regulated by the

      2.   The owner of an off-premises sign is required to obtain a sign
building permit pursuant to §
17.50.080 prior to building a new off-premises sign or making structural
alterations to an existing off-premises sign.
      3.   If any zoning district requires a conditional use permit for an off-
premises sign, prior to a sign building permit being issued pursuant to §
17.50.080, approval of the conditional use permit must be obtained. A
conditional use permit is required for any new off-premises sign. A conditional
use permit is not required for any work to an existing or approved off-premises

above the finished grade below it. The lowest point of an off-premises sign
which extends over an area intended for vehicular use shall not be less than 14
feet above the finished grade below it.
      4.   For off-premises signs which are located within 100 feet of the

   D.   Off-premises sign credit system.
      1.   Off-premise sign credit system. After March 22, 2013, off-premises
sign credits shall be issued by the city’s Building Official to those owners of
off-premises signs who have completely removed a previously existing, lawfully
erected off-premise sign and all associated structures. Any outstanding sign
credits issued by the city prior to adoption of this section will remain valid
and can be used in an identical manner to sign credits that are issued under
this section. All sign credits, including those previously issued are subject
to the provisions of this section, §§
17.50.080  and
17.50.090 of this code.
      2.   Requirements prior to issuance of credit. The process for issuance
of off-premise sign credits is as follows:
         a.   The owner of the sign completes an application for an off
premises sign credit.
         b.   The owner of the sign provides proof to the Building Official
that the sign for which a credit is sought was lawfully erected and in
existence prior to the adoption of this section.
         c.   The Building Official determines the sign is not currently a
prohibited sign as defined by this code and otherwise conforms to all
applicable federal, state or local laws and regulations.
         d.   If the Building Official is satisfied that the first 3
requirements are met, a certificate of eligibility for an off-premises sign
credit shall be issued. Certificates of eligibility for off-premise sign credit
shall expire and become null and void 21 days after they are issued.
         e.   The Building Official, or their designee, confirms by on-sight
inspection that the off-premises sign has been completely removed and that the
certificate of eligibility for off-premise sign credit has not expired. No
request for inspection shall be made to the Building Official until the
structure has been completely removed. The Building Official, or their
designee, shall make an inspection within 2 working days of a request for
inspection.
         f.   An off-premise sign credit may not be issued if there are more
than 20 sign credits outstanding.
      3.   Off-premise sign credit basis. The number of off-premises sign
credits that may be issued for removal of an existing off-premises sign is
determined as follows:
         a.   For any existing off-premises sign which complied with §
17.50.090B.5. the Building Official may issue 1 off-premises sign credit. For
any existing off-premises sign which did not comply with §
17.50.090B.5., the Building Official may issue 2 off-premises sign credits. If
the face of the existing off-premises sign being removed is smaller than the
maximum size for sign faces established in this code, the sign credit will only
authorize construction of a new off-premises sign which is the same size as the
one which is removed. In all other situations, an off-premises sign credit will
authorize construction of an off-premises sign with a face as large as the
maximum size legally allowed at the time the credit is used.
         b.   The square footage permitted by 1 off-premise sign credit may not
be transferred or added to the square footage of another off-premise sign
credit.
      4.   Transferability of sign credits; notice of transfer required. Off-
premise sign credits are freely transferable through legal means; however, a
transferee shall provide written notice of the transfer to the city by
registered mail, return receipt requested, within 90 days following the
transfer of the credit(s) or the sign credit(s) shall be void.
      5.   Usage. Off premise sign credits may only be used to erect a new off-
premise sign if the proposed new sign is in full compliance with all
requirements of the Rapid City Municipal Code and all applicable federal, state
or local laws and regulations. The city has no obligation to guarantee that a
sign credit may be utilized within the city during the life of the credit.
      6.   Sunset date for sign credit. An off-premises sign credit shall not
exist in perpetuity. An off-premises sign credit shall terminate 2 decades
after it has been issued unless utilized within 20 years from the date of
issuance by the Building Official or unless the same has become void by
operation of the provisions of this section.  This section shall not apply to
sign credits issued prior to June 9, 2011.
      7.   The city shall maintain a list of all unused off-premises sign
credits and their expiration dates.
   E.   Alteration of existing off-premises signs.
      1.   Notwithstanding any other provision of this code, any legal non-
conforming off-premise sign may be reconstructed by the current permit holder
in the same location as it currently exists so long as the alterations or
reconstruction of the sign bring it into compliance with all of the provisions
of the City Code with the exception of any spacing requirements between signs.
A sign building permit is required to make the alterations allowed by this
subsection E.1.
      2.   Whenever any off-premise sign is structurally altered, the current
permit holder of the sign shall be eligible for off-premise sign credits as
follows:
         a.   The current permit holder of the sign completes an application
for an off-premise sign credit;
         b.   The current permit holder of the sign provides proof to the
Building Official that the sign for which a credit is sought was lawfully
erected and in existence prior to the adoption of this section;
         c.   The Building Official determines the sign is currently not a
prohibited or unlawful sign as defined in this code;
         d.   The Building Official issues a certificate of eligibility for off
premise sign credit. Certificates of eligibility for off-premise sign credit
shall expire 21 days after it is issued;
         e.   The Building Official confirms, by on-sight inspection, that the
sign has been brought into compliance with all the provisions of the city's
Sign Code with the exception of any spacing requirements between signs and that
the certificate of eligibility for off-premise sign credit has not expired. No
request for inspection shall be made to the Building Official until the
alterations to the sign have been fully completed. The Building Official shall
make an inspection within 2 working days of a request for inspection; and
         f.   Upon compliance with all provisions of this subsection, the
Building Official shall issue 2 off-premise sign credits to the current permit
holder of the sign.
   F.   Conditional use permit requirements for off- premises signs.
      1.   Submittal requirements. In addition to the requirements set forth in

the subject lot shall be located in the parking lot or within 20 feet of the
parking lot.
         d.   Landscaping proposed to be located in the right-of-way between
the property line and the street section may be applied to the requirements of
the landscape ordinance in an amount not to exceed 25% of the total landscaping
points required as determined pursuant to the formula in the landscape
ordinance.
      8.   Lighting. All parking areas except single-family residential shall
be provided with lighting when evening usage is anticipated. The lighting shall
be arranged so as to provide security and to reflect light toward the parking
area.
      9.   Bond for completion. When the required off-street parking area
cannot be paved at the time of issuance of the certificate of occupancy, the
Chief Building Official shall require a surety in an amount equal to the
estimated cost of paving and improvements which will provide for and secure
through an improvements agreement the paving completion within 1 paving season.
All bonds and other methods of guarantee shall be approved by the City
Attorney.
   H.   Parking for persons with disabilities.
      1.   Provision of parking. In addition to the general requirements for
parking provided for under subsection G. of this section, accessible parking
facilities for persons with disabilities shall be provided in accordance with
this subsection. Accessible parking for a particular building must be located
on the shortest accessible route of travel from adjacent parking to an
accessible entrance. If there are multiple accessible entrances to the
building, the accessible spaces must be dispersed and located closest to the
accessible entrances. For parking facilities which do not serve a specific use
or building, the accessible parking shall be located on the shortest accessible
route to the nearest accessible pedestrian entrance to the parking facility.
Accessible spaces may be provided off-site in accordance with this chapter as
long as accessibility is not jeopardized.
      2.   Accessible route. A minimum of 1 accessible route meeting the
requirements of this section must be provided between the building’s accessible
entrance and the accessible parking spaces, passenger loading zones, and public
streets or sidewalks. An accessible route shall meet the following
requirements:
         a.   To the maximum extent feasible, it shall coincide with the route
for the general public;
         b.   It shall have a minimum clear width of 36 inches. If an
obstruction turnaround is required then the minimum clear width must be
provided as shown in Figures H.2(b)-1 and H.2(b)-2 of the technical drawings on
file in the Department;
         c.   Passing spaces are required if the accessible route is less than
60 inches wide. Passing spaces shall be at least 60 inches by 60 inches and
spaced at no more than 200-foot intervals. A T-intersection of 2 walks is an
acceptable passing space (see Figure H.2(c)-1 of the technical drawings on file
in the Department);
         d.   A minimum of 80 inches of vertical headroom along the route must
be provided. If less than 80 inches of vertical headroom exists in any area
adjoining the accessible route, then barriers must be provided to warn blind or
visually- impaired individuals (see Figures H.2(d)-1, and H.2(d)-2 of the
technical drawings on file in the Department);
         e.   The ground surface of the accessible route shall be stable, firm
and slip resistant. The accessible route may not include stairs, steps, or
escalators. Changes in level of less than 1/4- inch do not require edge
treatment. Changes in level between 1/4- and 1/2-inch shall be beveled with a
slope no greater than 1:2. Changes in level greater than 1/2-inch shall require
a ramp at least 36 inches wide and complying with all other ramp requirements
(subsection H.3 of this section). Surface treatments involving carpeting or
grating must meet specific ADA requirements;
         f.   An accessible route with a running slope of greater than 1:20 is
a ramp and shall have a maximum slope of 1:12 and a minimum width of 36 inches
and shall comply with all other ramp requirements (subsection H.3 of this
section). Nowhere along the accessible route shall the cross slope exceed 1:50;
         g.   Curb ramps must be provided wherever an accessible route crosses
a curb. Slope of curb ramps must be the least possible with a maximum slope for
new construction of 1:12 and a maximum rise for any run of 30 inches. Curb
ramps and exterior ramps to be constructed in areas which preclude the use of a
1:12 slope may have reduced slopes and rises as follows: (a) a slope between 1:
10 and 1:12 is allowed for a maximum rise of 6 inches; and (b) a slope between
1:8 and 1:10 is allowed for a maximum rise of 3 inches. A slope steeper than 1:
8 is not allowed (see Figures H.2(g)-1 through H.2(g)-4 of the technical
drawings on file in the Department). The minimum clear width of a ramp shall be
36 inches. Ramps shall have level landings at the top and bottom of each ramp
and each ramp run. These landings shall: (a) be twice as wide as the ramp run
leading to it; (b) landing length shall be at least 60 inches clear; (c) if
ramps change directions then the landing size shall be 60 by 60 inches; (d) if
a doorway is located at a landing then the area in front of the doorway shall
comply with 4.13.6 of ADA. Handrails shall be provided in compliance with 4.8.5
of ADA if a ramp run has a rise greater than 6 inches or a horizontal
projection greater than 72 inches.
      3.   Ramps. The least possible slope shall be used for any ramp. The
maximum rise for any run shall be 30 inches. The maximum slope for any new ramp
shall be 1:12 unless otherwise allowed by this code. Curb ramps and other
exterior ramps constructed in areas where space limitations prevent a 1:12
slope may have slopes and rises as follows: (a) a slope between 1:10 and 1:12
is allowed for a maximum rise of 6 inches; (b) a slope between 1:8 and 1:10 is
allowed for a maximum rise of 3 inches. No slope steeper than 1:8 is allowed. 
The minimum clear width of a ramp shall be 36 inches. Ramps shall have level
landings at the top and bottom of each ramp and each ramp run. These landings
shall: (a) be twice as wide as the ramp run leading to it; (b) landing length
shall be at least 60 inches clear; (c) if ramps change directions then the
landing size shall be 60 by 60 inches; (d) if a doorway is located at a
landing, the area in front of the doorway shall comply with 4.15.6 of ADA.

Notes:
1. The required number of accessible spaces for out-patient medical facilities
shall be 10% of the total number of parking spaces.
2. The required number of accessible spaces for facilities that specialize in
treatment or services for persons with mobility impairments shall be 20% of
the total number of parking spaces.
 
      5.   Signage. Accessible parking spaces shall be designated as reserved
by a sign showing the symbol of accessibility (see Figure H.5-1 of the
technical drawings on file in the Department). Van accessible parking shall
include this symbol of accessibility sign plus an additional van-accessible
sign mounted below the symbol of accessibility sign. (see Figure H.5-2 of the
technical drawings on file in the Department). Such signs must be located so
they cannot be obscured by a vehicle parked in the space and so they are
visible from the driver’s seat of the vehicle parked in the space. Such signs
must be located on a permanent supporting post or on an adjacent wall.
      6.   Parking spaces.
         a.   Accessible parking spaces. Accessible parking spaces must be a
minimum of 96 inches in width. Parking access aisles shall be part of an
accessible route to the building or facility entrance. Two accessible parking
spaces may share a common access aisle. Parking spaces may not exceed a 1:50
slope in all directions. Accessible parking spaces may be angled as long as all
other requirements specified in this section are met (see Figure H.6a-1 of the
technical drawings on file in the Department). Access aisles adjacent to
accessible spaces shall be a minimum of 60 inches in width. The spaces shall be
18 feet in length.
         b.   Van-accessible parking spaces. Van-accessible spaces shall be a
minimum of 96 inches wide and 18 feet in length, and shall be served by an
access aisle a minimum of 96 inches wide. The access aisle for a van-accessible
space must be located on the driver’s right-hand side of the van as it would be
parked in the space. The minimum vertical clearance for van-accessible spaces
and vehicle routes between van-accessible spaces and the site entrance/exit
shall be 98 inches. A sign alerting van users to the presence of the wider
aisle is required, but the space is not restricted to vans. Parking spaces may
not exceed a 1:50 slope in all directions. Van-accessible parking spaces may be
angled as long as all other requirements specified in this section are met (see
figure H.6b-2 of the technical drawings on file in the Department). A van-
accessible space and an accessible space may share an access aisle as long as
that aisle is at least 96 inches wide.
         c.   Parking access aisles. Parking access aisles must be part of the
accessible route to the building and must comply with the accessible route
requirements (subsection H.2 of this section). Vehicle overhang may not reduce
the required width of an accessible route.
         d.   Universal parking. An alternative to the provision of separate
van-accessible spaces is the provision of universal parking. Universal parking
spaces shall be 132 inches wide, with a 60- inch-wide access aisle. These
stalls do not have to be signed separately for van-accessibility, but do need
to meet signage requirements set forth in subsection H.5 of this section.
      7.   Protruding objects. Objects projecting from walls, with their
leading edges between 27 inches and 80 inches above the finished floor, shall
protrude no more than 4 inches into walks, passageways or aisles (see Figure
H.7-1 of the technical drawings on file in the Department). Objects mounted
with their leading edges at or below 27 inches above the finished floor may
protrude any amount (see Figures H.2d-1 and H.7-1 of the technical drawings on
file in the Department). Freestanding objects mounted on posts or pylons may
overhang a maximum of 12 inches, from 27 inches to 80 inches above the ground
or finished floor. Protruding objects shall not reduce the clear width of an
accessible route or maneuvering space (see Figure H.7-2 of the technical
drawings on file in the Department).
      8.   Passenger loading zones. Passenger loading zones shall provide an
access aisle at least 60 inches wide and 20 feet long, adjacent and parallel to
the vehicle pull-up space. If there are curbs between the access aisle and the
vehicle pull-up space, then a curb ramp complying with subsection H.3 of this
section shall be provided. Vehicle standing spaces and access aisles shall be
level with surface slopes, not exceeding 1:50 (2%) in all directions. Any
loading zone must maintain a minimum of 114 inches of vertical headroom. This
114-inch clearance is also required along at least 1 vehicle route from the
passenger loading zone to the site entrance and exit. For purposes of this
chapter, valet parking areas shall meet the same requirements as passenger
loading zones.
      9.   Addition of accessible parking in existing parking lot. Whenever a
parking facility, which does not meet the requirements of subsections H.4, H.5
or H.6 of this section, is re-striped, or when existing parking markings are to
be repainted, such parking markings shall be altered to conform to the
requirements of subsections H.4. H.5 or H.6 of this section. If the entity
providing the parking facility is required to eliminate 1 or more parking
spaces to comply with this provision, such elimination shall be permitted
without requiring a variance to the parking requirements.
         a.   This provision shall apply only to parking facilities providing
for 4 or more parking stalls.
         b.   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require the
reconstructions of any parking lot to achieve the requisite slope required in
the construction of a new parking facility.
   I.   Residential requirements. New single-family residential off-street
parking shall consist of a driveway, garage, or combination thereof. The
parking areas shall be paved to accommodate at least 2 off-street parking
spaces of 9 feet by 18 feet each. The hard surface improvements on driveways
must begin at the street or curb line, and either extend to the garage or
parking slab or a minimum of 50 feet. All portions of the required paving for
parking shall be outside of the public right-of-way.

occupy more of the lot than allowed for under the district lot coverage
provisions.  Further, vehicle and/or trailer parking/storage pads shall be
graveled or hard surfaced to eliminate dust, mud or weeds. Vehicles which are
to remain stationary for more than 72 hours shall not serve as temporary or
permanent sleeping quarters for any person.
      2.   Parking Conflicts.  Off-street parking stalls required for passenger
vehicles shall not be occupied by recreational vehicles, travel trailers or
hauling trailers, resulting in increased on-street parking.
      3.   Clear Sight Triangle. At no time shall a motor vehicle, recreational
vehicle, travel trailer or hauling trailer be parked in the boulevard, across a
sidewalk, or within the 10-foot clear sight triangle as described in §

right-of-way are clearly and visibly delineated;
         c.   To ensure that those established and acceptable ingress and
egress points are clearly delineated;
         d.   To screen trash containers/ facilities from public view;
         e.   To enhance the environmental and aesthetic conditions which exist
in the Black Hills area;
         f.   To protect and conserve the value of property;
         g.   To reduce the amount of stormwater runoff from paved areas;
         h.   To reduce the level of carbon dioxide and return pure oxygen to
the air;

   D.   Areas where landscaping is required. Landscaping is required in all
industrial, commercial and multiple-family zoning districts; however,
landscaping is not required for single-family homes located within multifamily
zoning districts. Landscaping is not required in general agricultural, park
forest, mobile home residential, low density residential I and low density
residential II districts. Landscaping in the urban commercial district is
required pursuant to §
17.66.060. The provisions of subsection E of this section shall be followed in
determining the amount of landscaping required.
   E.   Required landscape installation.
      1.   Landscape requirements.
         a.   A minimum of 50% of the required landscaping shall be located in
the parking lot or within 20 feet of the parking lot for all zoning districts
except light industrial and heavy industrial. A maximum of 25% of the required
landscaping may be within the public right-of-way. Arterial or collector street
right-of-way landscaping shall be limited to shrubs, ground cover or turf. This
section does not apply to the urban commercial district.
         b.   All required landscaping shall comply with the intent and purpose

with shrubs, groundcover and/or mulch covering at the base.
      2.   Determining required amount of landscape material.
         a.   Point system. The amount of material shall be based on a point
system. The square footage of the developed portion of the lot not covered by a
building shall equal the required number of points (unless exempted under
subsection b below.)
         b.   Calculation. If calculation of the required landscape points in
accordance with this section results in a total point requirement of 50,000 or
more, and at least 25% of the total perimeter of the developed portion of the
property abuts or is within 75 feet of a public roadway, and the property is
located in an industrial zoning district, the property qualifies for either of
the following 2 options:
            1)   Option no. 1. Irrigated Landscape Design.
               a)   A lateral zone of evenly spaced vegetation resulting in a
70% buffer (as measured at mature plant spread) shall be required along
property lines which are within 75 feet of rights-of-way and residential zoning
districts. All vegetation must be planted within 25 feet of the lot line or
within 25 feet of easements which are adjoining to the lot line.
               b)   A minimum of 25% of lineal feet of the vegetation must be
medium trees or larger. Medium trees must have at least a 25-foot mature
spread.
               c)   A drip irrigation system with an automated controller is
required to irrigate all woody landscape material where either gravel or native
grass is to be located around the vegetation.
               d)   The use of a water-saving sprinkler system with an
automated controller is required where turf grass is to be planted around the
vegetation buffer.
            2)   Option no. 2. Nonirrigated Landscape Design.
               a)   A lateral zone of evenly spaced vegetation resulting in a
100% buffer (as measured at mature plant spread) shall be required along
property lines within 75 feet of rights-of-way and residential zoning
districts. All vegetation must be planted within 25 feet of the lot line or
within 25 feet of easements adjoining to the lot line.
               b)   A minimum of 25% of lineal feet of the vegetation must be
medium trees or larger. Medium trees must have at least a 25-foot mature
spread.
         c.   Point values. Trees and shrubs contribute greatly to the quality
of the community’s environment through carbon dioxide absorption and oxygen
generation, air purification by precipitation of dust particles, reduction of
heat by transpiration and aesthetic qualities. The extent of the preceding
positive contributions are a function of the size of the tree rather than the
size of the planting area in which the tree is planted. Because of the
contributions made by trees and shrubs, to the objectives of these regulations,
points shall be given in accord with the schedule which follows.

   F.   Applicability new development areas.
      1.   Applicability new development. The requirements and standards for
the installation and maintenance of landscape elements and site improvements as
set forth herein shall apply to all developing commercial, industrial and
multifamily areas within the city as per the zoning ordinance. All new
development or construction which involves the creation of a building or a
parking area or the paving of a parking area shall be in full compliance with
the provisions of these regulations.
      2.   Existing development areas– nonconformance–compliance required. All
property with existing development on the effective date of these regulations
which is not in compliance with the provisions of these regulations shall be
considered nonconforming and allowed to continue until such time as a building
permit is granted to enlarge by 20% or more a structure or parking lot on the
property or increase the occupant load by 20% or more. Compliance with these
regulations for existing development in the urban commercial district is
required pursuant to §
17.66.060. A plan showing existing and new development, and the existing and
proposed landscaping shall be submitted in accordance with subsection G of this
section.
   G.   General requirements.
      1.   Installation. All landscaping shall be installed in a sound
workmanship-like manner according to accepted good planting and xeriscaping
procedures and according to the approved plan. If at the time of final
inspection all the requirements of these regulations have not been completed in
a satisfactory manner, a certificate of occupancy shall not be issued unless
the builder or owner has provided a monetary security guarantee (see subsection
J. of this section, security guarantee). All required landscaping shall be
installed as per plans submitted.
         a.   Trees used in parking lots shall be placed far enough back from
the curb to accommodate the overhang of the automobile; otherwise, the front
bumper of the car will hit the tree trunk.
         b.   The parking lot shall be screened with shrubs or other barriers.
This will reduce visual clutter caused by parked cars, and will make the
building more attractive.
         c.   When planters are used in parking lot interiors, a surface area
shall be made available for aeration and water infiltration commensurate with
the mature spread of the utilized tree types. This will help ensure that the
tree remains healthy and vigorous.
         d.   Interior parking lot trees shall be deciduous shade trees. These
will grow larger, be hardier and provide greater aesthetic and environmental
benefits in an interior parking lot situation. Conifers and ornamentals are of
greatest value in providing fence foliage in perimeter and buffer areas.
         e.   Fruit-bearing trees shall not be located where vehicular and
pedestrian traffic exists.  This will reduce the maintenance of these trees.
         f.   Curb stops or some form of physical barrier shall be installed
around plant material located within the parking lot. This will reduce the
possibility of damage to the plant material.  Stormwater runoff from the
parking lot area may be collected and directed in such a manner as to provide a
source of water for landscaping.
         g.   Trees shall be located such that mature height and spread will
not interfere with overhead power lines.
         h.   Evergreen trees shall be avoided in areas where the mature trees
will create hazardous interruption of views to oncoming traffic or where they
will create hazardous snow drifting on the parking area or public right-of-way.
         i.   The use of turf in and around landscaping materials is
discouraged. The use of mulches or low water groundcovers can help retain
moisture in the soil and reduce total water needs for the landscaped area.
         j.   Irrigation systems shall be of a drip, bubble or a low trajectory
nature to maximize efficiency in water usage.
         k.   The plant types selected shall be suited to the conditions of the
location to minimize maintenance and irrigation needs. A list of hardy native
plant materials is available through the Department.
      2.   Sight distance for landscaping. Landscaping may not obstruct the
required sight triangles as provided in §
17.50.335, except as follows:  Trees may be allowed in the required site
triangle if the tree is located more than 30 feet from the intersection of the
curb lines and the trees shall have a minimum of 40-foot spacing between trees;
provided that the canopy of the tree is 10 feet or more above grade.
      3.   Maintenance. The owner of the building or property shall be
responsible for the maintenance of all landscape areas. The areas shall be
maintained so as to present a healthy, neat and orderly appearance at all times
and shall be kept free from refuse and debris.  Maintenance shall include the
replacement of all dead plant materials.
      4.   Planting criteria.
         a.   Trees (deciduous). Planted for the required landscaping under
this section shall be a minimum of 1 1/2-inch caliper 12 inches above grade
measured immediately after planting. Trees shall be of a species having an
average mature spread of crown of greater than 15 feet.
         b.   Trees (evergreen). Trees shall be a minimum height of 4 feet.
         c.   Groundcovers. Groundcovers other than grass shall be planted in
such a manner as to present a finished appearance and reasonably complete
coverage within 1 year after planting.
         d.   Shrubs. Shrubs shall be a minimum of 1 foot in height when
measured immediately after planting.
         e.   Lawn grass. Grass areas shall be planted in species normally
grown as permanent lawns in Rapid City. Native grasses may also be used.
         f.   Synthetic lawns or plants. Synthetic or artificial lawns or
plants shall not be used in lieu of plant requirements in this section.
   H.   Plan approval.
      1.   Preparation of plan. It is recommended that the plan be prepared by
a landscape architect, architect, landscaper or person of related profession.
      2.   Plans required. Two copies of the plans showing proposed landscape
development and maintenance procedures, including figures to show compliance
with these regulations shall be submitted to the Building Inspection Department
at the time a building permit is requested.  The Building Inspection Department
shall route the proposed plans to the Planning Department for their approval.
The plans shall consist of:
         a.   A plot plan drawn to scale normally of not less than 1 inch
equals 30 feet including dimensions and distances and clearly delineating any
existing and proposed landscape development. The plot plan shall also include
drawings of the entire off-street parking area and the locations of the
proposed building.
         b.   In addition to indicating those areas to be landscaped, the plot
plan shall indicate the types, locations and sizes of all landscaping materials
to be used. The irrigation system shall be detailed showing the layout of the
system, system components and water delivery specifics.
         c.   These plans must be approved prior to issuance of a building
permit.
   I.   Exceptions. The Zoning Board of Adjustment shall have the power to
grant variances in special cases where there are unusual and practical
difficulties or unnecessary hardships created in meeting the requirements of
these regulations. The guidelines to be used in determining whether a variance
should be granted are as follows:
      1.   That the hardships or difficulties of meeting the requirements of
these regulations are peculiar to that property, and not general in character;
      2.   Financial hardship due to meeting the requirements of these
regulations is not sufficient to show unnecessary hardship, unless the
financial difficulties amount to confiscation of property.
   J.   Security guarantee.
      1.   If at the time of final inspection all the requirements of the
landscape regulations are not completed in a satisfactory manner and approved
by the Building Official or his or her designee, a certificate of occupancy
shall not be issued unless the builder or owner has entered into an agreement
with the city for improvements and provided a monetary security guarantee in an
amount equal to the estimated cost of installation and establishment of the
required improvements whereby the improvements will be made and installed
without cost to the city in the event of default of the owner.
      2.   If a security guarantee is being used, the required improvements
shall be installed within 9 months from the date of issuance of an occupancy
permit. All required landscaping shall be installed as per plans submitted. All
bonds and other methods of guarantee shall be approved by the City Attorney.
   K.   Enforcement. These regulations shall be a minimum standard and shall
apply to the incorporated area of the city. The Building Official or his or her
designated representative shall be the enforcing official. The enforcing
official is charged with the duty of administering the provisions of these
regulations as provided for in
Chapter 17.54 of this code.

A, Art. VII (§ 1))
17.54.020  Variances.
   The purpose of the variance is to modify the strict application of the
specific requirements of this title in the case of exceptionally irregular,
narrow, shallow or steep lots or other exceptional physical conditions, whereby
the strict application would result in practical difficulty or unreasonable
hardship which would deprive an owner of the reasonable use of his or her land.
The variance shall be used only where necessary to overcome some obstacle which
is preventing an owner from reasonably using his or her property as the zoning
ordinance intended.
   A.   Application. A property owner may apply to the Board of Adjustment for
a variance. A fee shall be paid by the property owner at the time of
application for each application submitted.  The fee amount shall be set by
resolution of the City Council.
   B.   Public hearing—publication and mailing of notice.
      1.   Upon receipt of an application and fee, the Board shall hold a
public hearing, having first given 7 days’ notice. The notice of the time and
place of the hearing shall be published in a daily paper of general
circulation. The Board shall consider and decide applications for variances
within 30 days of the public hearing and in accordance with the standards
provided in this section and in applicable state law.
      2.   Adjacent property owner notification. Public notice shall be sent to
all owners of property adjacent to or within 250 feet of the perimeter of the
property, inclusive of public right-of-way.  Notice shall be sent by first
class mail at least 7 days prior to the public hearing. When adjacent property
is owned by a subdivision or condominium association, notification may be sent
to the management company or board of such association. The city may require
the applicant to sign a certified affidavit prior to the public hearing as
evidence to document compliance with the requirements of this section. The city
may decide to perform the adjacent property owner mailing and shall notify the
applicant in writing prior to scheduling the public hearing.
   C.   Criteria for variances. In granting a variance, the Board may consider
the following criteria:
      1.   Variances may be granted where special circumstances or conditions
(such as lot size or dimension, topography or existing building location),
fully described in the findings of the Board, do not apply generally in the
district;
      2.   Variances shall not be granted to allow a land use otherwise
excluded from the particular district in which requested;
      3.   For reasons fully set forth in the findings of the Board, the
aforesaid circumstances or conditions are such that the strict application of
the provisions of this title would deprive the applicant of reasonable use of
his or her land. Mere loss in value shall not constitute a deprivation of
reasonable use so as to justify a variance;
      4.   Variances granted under the provisions of this section should be the
minimum adjustment necessary for the reasonable use of the land; and
      5.   The granting of any variance is in harmony with the general purposes
and intent of this title and will not be injurious to the neighborhood,
detrimental to the public welfare, or in conflict with the city’s Comprehensive
Plan.
   D.   Requirements for the granting of a variance. Before the Board shall
have the authority to grant a variance, the person claiming the variance has
the burden of showing, and findings must be made, that:
      1.   The granting of the variance will not be contrary to the public
interest;
      2.   There are special conditions attached to the property that do not
generally apply to other properties in the same district;
      3.   Owing to special conditions, the literal enforcement of this title
will result in unreasonable hardship;
      4.   By granting the variance contrary to the provisions of this title,
the spirit of this title and the city’s Comprehensive Plan will be observed;
and
      5.   By granting the variance, substantial justice will be done.
   E.   Unreasonable hardship.
      1.   The Board may not find an unreasonable hardship unless the alleged
hardship:
         a.   Is located on or associated with the property for which the
variance is sought; and
         b.   Comes from circumstances peculiar to the property, not from
conditions that are general to the neighborhood.
      2.   The Board may not find an unreasonable hardship if the hardship is
self- imposed or economic.
   F.   Special conditions. Special conditions exist only if they relate to the
hardship complained of and deprive the property of privileges granted to other
properties in the same district.
   G.   Additional requirements. Additional requirements may be imposed on the
applicant, as a condition for granting a variance that will:
      1.   Mitigate any harmful effects of the variance; or
      2.   Serve the purpose of the standard or requirement that is waived or
modified.
   H.   Court review of Board. Within 30 days of the Board’s decision, any
person aggrieved by a decision of the Board may present to a court of competent
jurisdiction a verified petition for a writ of certiorari as allowed by South
Dakota codified law.
(Ord. 6296, 2019: Ord. 5886 (part), 2013; Ord. 3833 (part), 2002: Ord. 3713,
2001: prior code Appendix A, Art. VII (§ 2))
17.54.030  Conditional use permits.
   The following procedures are established to integrate properly conditional
use permits with other land uses located in the district. These uses shall be

under the following procedures:
   A.   Application process and submittal requirements. The procedures of this
section shall be followed in making application for approval of a conditional
use permit or for an amendment to a conditional use permit.
      1.   Application process. The owner and/or designated agent shall submit
the required application, number of copies of the conditional use permit, and
the appropriate supporting documents to the Department for review. Upon receipt
of a complete application and the required information, the DRT shall complete
its review and provide a recommendation to be forwarded to the Planning
Commission with or without stipulations. Upon review by the DRT, if determined
that the application is incomplete, the applicant will be notified in writing
of the deficiencies and the application will not be scheduled for a public
hearing before the Planning Commission until such time as the deficiencies in
the application have been corrected. If a decision by the DRT is contested by
the applicant, an appeal can be filed with the City Council. Once the
application is complete, the recommendation shall be provided to the owner and/
or designated agent and the Director shall place the application and
recommendation on the next available Planning Commission agenda, with
consideration for the required public notice. The Planning Commission will
review the application and DRT recommendations and formally act on the
application. The Planning Commission’s final decision may be appealed to the
City Council.
      2.   Submittal requirements. The applicant shall submit a dimensioned
site plan drawn to scale including building setbacks, approach locations and
internal traffic circulation, parking, loading and unloading dock areas with
truck turning radii, landscaping, fencing, retaining walls, signage, lighting,

days of operation, number of employees, average daily peak trips generated,
type of equipment or processes used, description, location, and quantity of
hazardous materials (existing and used), list of regulatory agencies, contact
name, phone number and their inspection frequency. City staff may require
additional information or technical studies such as drainage studies,
construction plans, address plats, and development agreements.
      3.   Notification. Notification of surrounding property owners, tenants
and interested parties shall be accomplished by posting a sign on the property
and by mailing notices of public hearing to neighboring property owners.
         a.   Posting of sign. A sign noting the fact that a conditional use
permit approval, on-sale liquor establishment approval or major amendment is
pending shall be posted on the site not less than 7 days before the public
hearing before the Planning Commission. The sign shall be maintained on the
site until the Common Council has taken action on the request or the petition
is withdrawn. Approved signs shall be secured from the Department who shall
require a reasonable deposit sufficient to cover the cost of replacement of the
sign or signs and who shall determine the number and location of the sign or
signs to be posted on the site addressed in the petition for conditional use
permit.
         b.   Adjacent property owner notification. Public notice shall be sent
to all owners of property adjacent to or within 250 feet of the perimeter of
the property inclusive of public right- of-way. Notice shall be sent by first
class mail at least 7 days prior to the public hearing. When adjacent property
is owned by a subdivision or condominium association, notification may be sent
to the management company or board of such association. The city may require
the applicant to sign a certified affidavit prior to the public hearing as
evidence to document compliance with the requirements of this section. The city
may decide to perform the adjacent property owner mailing and shall notify the
applicant in writing prior to scheduling the public hearing.
         c.   Publication. The notice of the time and place of the Planning
Commission hearing shall be published in a daily paper of general circulation
at least 7 days and not more than 15 days prior to the hearing date.
   B.   Fees. A fee shall be paid at the time of filing an application for a
conditional use permit or major amendment for a conditional use permit;
provided, however, that, if a permit has previously been issued, and all
conditions for the permit have been met throughout the term thereof, the
renewal fee may be waived at the discretion of the Directors. The fee amount
shall be set by City Council by resolution.
   C.   Planning Commission to review and act at public hearing. The city’s
Planning Commission at a public hearing shall review and act upon all
conditional use permit applications. The action of the city’s Planning
Commission shall be final except in the event of an appeal being filed in which
case the procedures outlined in §
17.54.030F. shall be followed.
   D.   Restrictions.  In the exercise of its approval, the Planning Commission
may impose such conditions regarding the location, character or other features
of the proposed use and existing and proposed buildings and structures as it
may deem advisable in the furtherance of the general purposes of this title. 
Unless otherwise approved by the Planning Commission, the conditional use
permit shall be approved for the property, and not for use by the original
applicant only.
   E.   Criteria for review. In reviewing applications for a conditional use
permit, due consideration shall be given to the following:
      1.   The location, character and natural features of the property;
      2.   The location, character and design of adjacent buildings;
      3.   Proposed fencing, screening and landscaping;
      4.   Proposed vegetation, topography and natural drainage;
      5.   Proposed pedestrian and vehicular access, circulation and parking,
including that related to bicycles and other unpowered vehicles and provisions
for handicapped persons;
      6.   Existing traffic and traffic to be generated by the proposed use;
      7.   Proposed signs and lighting;
      8.   The availability of public utilities and services;
      9.   The objectives of the adopted comprehensive plan and the purpose of
the ordinance codified herein;
      10.   The overall density, yard, height and other requirements of the
zone in which it is located;
      11.   The effects of noise, odor, smoke, dust, air and water pollution
and the degree of control through the use of clarifiers, screening, setbacks
and orientation; and
      12.   The degree to which conditions imposed will mitigate any probable
adverse impacts of the proposed use on existing adjacent uses.
   F.   Appeal procedures.  Any person or party has the right to appeal the
decision of the Planning Commission regarding any conditional use permit
application. Appeals must be made in writing and submitted to the Director by
close of business on the seventh full calendar day following action by the
Planning Commission. Appeals shall be reviewed and acted upon by the Common
Council in accordance
with the requirements of this section. The action of the Common Council shall
occur only after having given a 7-day prior notification in a daily newspaper
of general circulation.
   G.   Issuance of permit. Upon completion of the necessary application,
hearing and approval of the Planning Commission and after the expiration of the
appeals time period, the Building Official shall issue the building permit
subject to all applicable rules, regulations and conditions.
   H.   Validity of plans. All approved plans, conditions, restrictions and
rules made a part of the approval of the Planning Commission shall constitute
certification on the part of the applicant that the proposed use shall conform
to the regulations at all times.
   I.   Amendments. The conditions of approval of a conditional use permit may
be amended. Amendments are considered major or minimal and are addressed in the
following manner.
      1.   Major amendments must be reviewed by the Planning Commission, under
the provisions of subsection A. through E. of this section. A major amendment
is required when:
         a.   Another conditional use is proposed;
         b.   A change to specific stipulations approved by the Planning
Commission in the initial approval or a subsequent amendment that would
specifically prohibit the approval of a minor amendment;
         c.   The structure and site is substantially enlarged. A structure or
site is considered to be substantially enlarged when the gross square footage
increases by more than 20%; or
         d.   The Director determines that the proposed change is major and
requires public hearing review.
      2.   Minimal amendments must be reviewed and approved by the Director. A
minimal amendment includes minor amendments and administrative exceptions
listed in §§
17.50.050.G.2.,
17.50.060.G, and
17.50.070. The Director shall determine that the proposed modification to the
site will not have a significant adverse impact on neighboring properties, the
street network or the appearance of the property in approving a minimal
amendment. The Director shall consider the criteria outlined in subsection E.
of this section to determine if the proposed modifications still meet the
requirements of a conditional use permit.
   J.   Revocation of conditional use permit. A conditional use permit may be
revoked only for cause, consisting of failure to maintain the standards
required for the initial conditional use permit. A notice of intent to revoke a
conditional use permit shall be given in writing 30 days prior to actual
revocation and shall specify the area or areas of continued failure to meet
requirements and maintain conditions the city may have imposed. If, during that
period, proof of compliance is made by the holder of the conditional use
permit, the conditional use permit shall be continued in force. If a hearing
has been requested following receipt of notice of intent to revoke, the
Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing on the matter and make a final
determination on the revocation.
   K.   Expiration and extension of time period.
      1.   Expiration. A conditional use permit shall automatically expire if:
         a.   The primary use for which it was granted has ceased for a period
of 2 years or more; or
         b.   The primary use proposed under the conditional use permit has not
been undertaken and completed according to the terms and conditions of the
conditional use permit within 2 years of the approval of the conditional use
permit. A conditional use permit is considered approved upon the effective date
of the Planning Commission or Common Council’s action, resolution or ordinance
relating thereto.
      2.   Extension of period. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection
K.1. of this section, the Planning Commission, may as part of the original
conditional use permit or as a major amendment to the conditional use permit
extend the period of the conditional use permit where it is warranted in light
of the relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to the size and
phasing of the development, economic cycles and market conditions. All
conditional use permits approved prior the effective date of the ordinance
codified in this subsection shall be exempt from the provisions of this
section.

17.54.080  Procedures for historic preservation.
   A.   Administration. The Common Council hereby appoints the Director or his
or her designee (collectively the “Director”) to administer these procedures.
   B.   Applicability. Any historic project as defined in §
17.04.358 that requires a permit shall be subject to these procedures, except
as otherwise provided.  No permit can be issued by the city unless the
applicant has completed the following review process and the Director has first
authorized the issuance of a permit in accordance with this section. The
Secretary of Interior’s Standards for the Treatment of Historic Property shall
be applied to historic preservation review within this section. Additional
guidance concerning the standards can be found in the methods, policies,
technical notes, preservation briefs, and guidelines used by the National Park
Service, as well as guidelines established by the President’s Advisory Council
on Historic Preservation (ACHP).  Additionally, the Common Council may adopt by
resolution additional design guidelines for historic properties.
   C.   Pre-application conference. The applicant shall confer with the
Director regarding historic preservation review procedures and the project’s
conformance with the Secretary of Interior’s Standards for the Treatment of
Historic Property and with pertinent city ordinances and resolutions. The
Director will provide information regarding grants and tax credits for historic
properties, such as the Deadwood Fund Grant program, Federal Rehabilitation Tax
Credit program, or State Property Tax Moratorium program.
   D.   Application.  Following the pre-application conference, the applicant
shall submit a complete application for historic preservation review to the
Director. The application must clearly depict the proposed project and its
impacts on surrounding properties through the use of such means as building
elevations, construction plans, drawings, illustrations, photographs, or other
means necessary to allow the city to adequately assess the conformity of the
proposed project with the Secretary of Interior’s Standards for the Treatment
of Historic Property and pertinent city ordinances and resolutions. The
Director shall advise the applicant of required submissions and determine the
completeness of an application. The Director may require additional materials
necessary for the review.
   E.   Review. Upon receipt of a complete application, the Director shall
determine the level of review required for approval.
      1.   Administrative review of certain projects. Administrative review may
be performed and approval granted for projects which SHPO and city have agreed
in writing do not constitute adverse effects; such projects for administrative
approval shall be adopted by the Common Council by separate resolution. A draft
resolution shall be presented to the HPC for its comment and recommendation;
thereafter, the resolution and HPC’s comments and recommendation shall be
forwarded to the Council for its final decision. All other projects will be
referred to SHPO for review per subsection E.2. below. The Director shall not
administratively approve a demolition permit for a historic property. The
Director reserves the right to withhold administrative approval of any
application and to refer any project to SHPO for review and comment. Under this
subsection, the Director may take the following actions:
         a.   Administrative determination of no adverse effect. The Director
may approve an application if he or she determines that the project will have
no adverse effect on historic property. In reviewing permits for interior
changes, the Director shall consult the information within the National and/or
State Registers for the property in determining whether the project may have an
adverse effect. If the Director approves the application, the applicant may
proceed with the improvements, provided the necessary permits have been
approved by the city.
         b.   Administrative determination of adverse effect. Administrative
approval cannot be issued if the Director determines the project may have an
adverse effect on historic property. The Director shall notify the applicant in
writing of his or her findings of potential adverse effect. The applicant may:
(1) withdraw the application, (2) modify and resubmit the application, or (3)
elect to continue with the review process as discussed below.
      2.   Initial SHPO review. Where the Director determines that a project
has the potential for an adverse effect on historic property and where the
applicant has not withdrawn or resubmitted the application, the Director shall
prepare a summary report of the project that describes any potential adverse
effects and send the project file, including the summary report and
application, to SHPO for an initial review. SHPO will review the project file
and make a written determination to the Director, as follows:
         a.   SHPO determination of no adverse effect. Where SHPO issues a
written determination that the project will not have an adverse effect upon
historic property, the Director may approve the project. If the Director
approves the project, the applicant may then proceed with the improvements,
provided the necessary permits have been approved by the city.
         b.   SHPO determination of potential adverse effect. Where SHPO issues
a written determination that the project has or may have an adverse effect upon
historic property, or if the Director believes that further review is
appropriate, the Director shall not approve the project, and the procedures
discussed in subsections E.3., 4., and 5. shall be followed.
      3.   Commission review and public hearing. The Director shall prepare a
case report for the Commission and SHPO. The applicant shall provide additional
information to staff for inclusion in the case report, including information
related to feasible and prudent alternatives and planning which has occurred to
mitigate any adverse effect on historic property.  The burden is on the
applicant to show that approval should be granted. The Director shall submit
the project file, including the application, the case report, and the written
SHPO determination of potential or actual adverse effect, to the Commission for
a public hearing. The Commission shall:
         a.   Comment on the case report by agreeing, disagreeing, or declining
to comment on the case report’s findings; and/or
         b.   Determine, based upon all relevant factors, whether there are
feasible and prudent alternatives to the proposed project and whether the
project includes all possible planning to minimize harm to historic property,
in compliance with the requirements of SDCL 1-19A-11.1.
The Commission may also offer additional comments, including suggestions or
alternatives to minimize any adverse effect to historic property. 
      4.   Final SHPO review.  After Commission review and public hearing, the
Director shall send the project application, case report, and the Commission’s
determination, findings, and comments to SHPO for its final determination. SHPO
will review the record and will issue any final comments to the city for
approval or denial of the project application. SHPO may offer its opinion
whether, based upon all relevant factors, there is no feasible and prudent
alternative to the project and the project includes all possible planning to
minimize harm to historic property. Any comments from SHPO under this section
will be in writing.
      5.   Final city action following case report.  After receipt of the final
written SHPO comments, as described in subsection E.4., the Director may take
the following actions:
         a.   Final Director approval. If at any time the Director receives a
written determination of no adverse effect by SHPO, the Director may approve
the project application and the applicant may proceed with obtaining required
city permits. If the Director grants approval of the project application after
Commission review, he or she shall promptly report approval of the project
application to the Commission. 
         b.   Final Director denial. Where the city has received a written
determination of adverse effect by SHPO, the Director shall deny the project
application and provide written notice to the applicant of denial. The
applicant may (i) accept the denial, (ii) resubmit a revised application, or
(iii) appeal to the Common Council in writing submitted to the Director by
close of business on the 10th full calendar day following mailing of written
notice.
            i.   If the applicant seeks review of the matter by the Common
Council, the Director shall forward the following to the Council: project
application; case report; the Commission’s determination, findings, and
comments; and SHPO’s determinations, findings, and comments.
            ii.   Common Council approval.  If the Common Council determines
that, based upon all relevant factors, there is no feasible and prudent
alternative to the project and the project includes all possible planning to
minimize harm to historic property, the application shall be approved. No
permit may be issued by the city until 10 business days after SHPO has received
notice as required by state law of the Council’s determination with a complete
record of factors considered. Thereafter, the applicant may proceed with
obtaining required city permits.
            iii.   Common Council denial.  No permit shall be issued if the
Common Council determines that the application shall be denied because feasible
and prudent alternatives exist or because the project has not included all
possible planning to minimize the harm to historic property. In this case, the
Director shall timely provide notice of the denial to the applicant, the
Commission and SHPO.
   F.   Conformity with the approvals given. All work performed pursuant to
these historic preservation review approval procedures of this section shall
conform to the provisions of the approval.
   G.   Exemptions from historic preservation review. The following projects
shall be exempt from historic preservation review:
      1.   A sign permit approved in accordance with the applicable ordinances
and by the appropriate reviewing body;
      2.   Projects which do not require a building permit or other
construction permit required by the city, including, but not limited to, some
landscaping, fencing, and painting projects;
      3.   The routine maintenance and repairs of an exterior feature of a
building, which does not involve a substantive change, as determined by the
Director, in its design, material, or outer appearance;
      4.   The installation, replacement, and repairs and routine maintenance
and repairs of public infrastructure, except for buildings, such as, traffic
control devices, utilities, street lights, sidewalks, streets, alleys, public
parking areas, driveways, drainage structures, and the like. Infrequent, large
scale infrastructure improvements, however, that are exempt from these zoning
provisions for historic preservation review may be subject to SHPO review in
accordance with the requirements of SDCL § 1-19A-11.1; and
      5.   In any case where the Building Official determines that there are
emergency conditions dangerous to life, health, or property, the Building
Official shall order the remedying of these conditions without review approval.
   H.   Prevention of deterioration by neglect. Any owner of a historic
property or a property within an established historic district shall not allow
the deterioration of the property by intentional neglect if the deterioration
is damaging or destroying historic property. Where appropriate, the Commission
may request a meeting with the owner in order to discuss the condition of the
property and the means to restore its condition. Such neglect shall constitute
a violation of this section and be subject to penalties discussed in this code,
including the general penalty provision found in §
1.12.010. Each day that a violation continues to exist shall constitute a
separate offense.  The city may take any other action to prevent deterioration
by neglect permissible under state law and city ordinance.

standards shall apply:
   A.   Pedestrian oriented development. To ensure that all new development in
the district is pedestrian and bicycle friendly while encouraging creativity
and allowing a wide range of choice, the following standards shall be met:
      1.   Ground floor windows. Blank walls on the ground level of buildings
are limited in the district in order to connect activities occurring within a
structure to the adjacent sidewalk area, encourage surveillance of the street,
and avoid a monotonous pedestrian environment. Street-facing facades on the
ground level of buildings shall meet the following standards:
         a.   The required amount of ground floor window area shall be 45% or
more of the wall area measured between 2 and 8 feet in height above the
finished grade. The windows shall be transparent.
         b.   On lots with more than 1 street frontage, the standard shall be
met on the frontage of the street that has the highest classification to the
Rapid City Major Street Plan. If 2 or more streets have the same classification
as per the Infrastructure Design Criteria Manual, the applicant may choose on
which street to meet the standard in subsection a.
      2.   Building face variation. The setback and/or materials of street-
facing building facade shall vary substantially every 50 feet. Change in
material color is not considered a substantial change. The same material used
in a different pattern is not considered a substantial change. Columns,
pilasters, or other building articulation constituting a substantial change
shall be greater than 12 inches in depth to be considered a substantial change.
      3.   Location of the main entrance. The main entrance shall face the
street lot line. Where there is more than 1 street lot line, the entrance may
face either street lot line or the corner.
      4.   Lighting. Four or more fixtures of downtown, pedestrian-scale
lighting shall be provided on the primary building frontage or front yard per
each 50 feet of building frontage. On a corner lot, all yards that abut a
street may be used to meet this standard. Fixtures shall be adequately spaced
to create even light distribution.
      5.   Other pedestrian elements. Two of the following additional
pedestrian elements shall be provided on the parcel on the primary building
frontage or front yard. On a corner lot, all yards that abut a street may be
used to meet these standards:
