provisions set forth below, is established, pursuant to the home rule powers granted the
city by Article IV, Section 1, and Article XI, Section 2 of the Oregon Constitution and by
Sections 4 and 5 of the Sandy City Charter.
B. A civil infractions procedure has been established for the purpose of decriminalizing

out of said violations.
(Ord. 22-79 § 1, 1979.)
1.18.020 Definitions.
For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions apply:
A. City Infractions. An offense against the city in the form of a violation of any
provision of the Sandy Municipal Code which provides no specific penalty or provides a
penalty other than imprisonment. All infractions shall be handled in accordance with the
procedures established by this chapter. When an infraction is of a continuing nature, a
separate infraction will be deemed to occur on each calendar day the infraction
continues to exist and separate citations may be filed for each such infraction.
B. Forfeiture; Forfeiture Schedule. The only penalty to be imposed for an infraction is
a monetary penalty called a forfeiture. The municipal court shall, however, possess the
additional enforcement powers set forth in Section 1.18.040. The appropriate forfeiture
to be assessed for a specific infraction will be determined from the forfeiture schedule in
Section 1.18.050. The procedure prescribed by this chapter shall be the exclusive
procedure for imposing forfeiture; however, this section shall not be read to prohibit in
any way any other alternative remedy set out in ordinances covered by this infraction
procedure which is intended to abate or alleviate ordinance violations, nor shall the city
be prohibited from recovering, in a manner prescribed by law, any expense incurred to it
in abating or removing ordinance violations pursuant to said ordinances.
C. Person. The term "person," as used in this chapter, shall be construed to include any
person, firm, partnership, corporation, or association of persons.

with a civil infraction and setting a date for said person to appear before the municipal
court to answer said complaint.
2. The city manager or his designated representative shall prescribe the form of the

representative, the date on which the citation was issued, and the name of the
complainant;
d. The scheduled forfeiture for the alleged infraction;
e. The time and place at which the person cited is to appear in court.

designated representative that he swears that he has reasonable grounds to believe,
and does believe, that the person cited committed the infraction.
5. The summons shall also contain notice to the person cited that a civil complaint will
be filed in the municipal court of Sandy.

personally appearing to answer at the time and place specified therein, except an
answer may be made by mail or personal delivery within ten days of the date of the
receipt of the summons as provided in divisions 2 and 3 of this subsection.
9
2. If a person alleged to have committed an infraction admits the infraction or otherwise
desires to pay the forfeiture without appearing in municipal court, he may complete the
appropriate answer on the back of each summons and forward the summons to the
municipal court. A check or money order in the amount of the forfeiture for the infraction
alleged as shown on the face of the summons shall also be submitted with the answer.
3. If the person alleged to have committed the infraction denies part or all of the
infraction, he may request a hearing by completing the appropriate answer on the back
of the summons and forwarding the summons to the municipal court. Upon receipt, the
answer shall be entered and a hearing date established by the municipal court. The
municipal court shall notify the person alleged to have committed the infraction by mail,
of the date of the hearing.
4. The court may, in any case, after notice, require the cited person to appear for a
hearing.

the municipal court without a jury.

the complaint.
a. Oral Evidence. Oral evidence shall be taken only on oath or affirmation.
b. Hearsay Evidence. Hearsay evidence may be used for the purpose of supplementing
or explaining any direct evidence, but shall not be sufficient in itself to support a finding
unless it would be admissible over objection in civil actions in courts of competent
jurisdiction in this state.
c. Admissibility of Evidence. Any relevant evidence shall be admitted if it is the type of
evidence on which responsible persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious
affairs, regardless of the existence of any common law or statutory rule which might
make improper the admission of such evidence over objection in civil actions in courts
of competent jurisdiction in this state.
d. Exclusion of Evidence. Irrelevant and unduly repetitious evidence shall be excluded.
3. The defendant shall have the right to present evidence and witnesses in his favor, to
cross-examine witnesses who testify against him and to submit rebuttal evidence.

public expense. If defense counsel is to appear, written notice shall be provided to the
municipal court ten days prior to the hearing date, excluding weekends and holidays.
10
5. The city shall have the burden of proving the alleged ordinance infraction by a
preponderance of the evidence.
6. After due consideration of the evidence and arguments presented at the hearing, the
court shall determine whether the infraction as alleged in the complaint has been
established. When the infraction has not been established, an order dismissing the
complaint shall be entered in the municipal court records. When a determination is
made that an infraction has been established or if an answer admitting the infraction has
been received, or the forfeiture otherwise paid by the defendant, an appropriate order
shall be entered in the municipal court records.
7. Unless otherwise provided by ordinance, upon a finding that an infraction has
occurred, the court shall assess the forfeiture shown on the schedule established in
accordance with this chapter plus court costs.
8. There shall be no administrative appeal or legal review from a determination by the
municipal court of an infraction violation.(Ord. 22-79 § 4, 1979.)
1.18.040 Enforcement.

provided in this chapter, the municipal court may enter a default judgment for the
scheduled forfeiture applicable to the charged infraction, or it may issue a warrant for
the arrest of the cited person for reason of his nonappearance, or it may do both of the
above actions.
B. After a hearing and determination by the municipal court that an infraction has
occurred, the court shall assess the scheduled forfeiture applicable to the determined
infraction.
C. Delinquent forfeitures and those brought to default judgment which were assessed
for infractions occurring on real property or for improper use of real property may be
held as city liens against said real property and collected in the same manner as other
such debts owing to the city.
D. Nothing in this section shall limit the city from revoking or denying any city license or
permit held or desired by a person owing a forfeiture to the city.
E. Nothing in this section shall limit the inherent power of the municipal court to impose

Chapter 2.30
CRIMINAL HISTORY RECORD CHECKS
2.30.010  Purpose.
In order for the City of Sandy government to operate effectively, persons selected for
employment or as a public service volunteer with the City of Sandy, Sandy Fire District,
Boring Fire District and the Oregon Trail School District must have the highest degree of
citizen and public trust and confidence.
All City of Sandy employees and public service volunteers represent the City to its
citizens. Many City, Fire District and Oregon Trail School District employees and
volunteers have responsibilities to regulate and maintain public health and safety. Most
City, Fire District and Oregon Trail School District employees and volunteers,
contractually, have access to public funds and property, and possess access to
privileged and proprietary information submitted to the City, the Fire District and the
Oregon Trail School District in confidence. Additionally, City, Fire District and Oregon
Trail School District employees and volunteers may be required to operate publiclyowned
vehicles.
SECTION 2.30.020  Criminal record check required.
All applicants for employment and appointed volunteers with the City of Sandy, Sandy
Fire District, Boring Fire District and the Oregon Trail School District will be required to
authorize the City to conduct a criminal offender information check through the OSP
LEDS system. Additionally, applicants will authorize the City to conduct a check of their
driving record and status. The criminal history and driving record/status authorization
form will be presented to the Sandy Police Department at the time the records checks
are conducted. Authorization forms will be returned to the requesting entity after the
records check has been conducted.
SECTION 2.30.030  Procedure.
A member of the Police Department who is trained and authorized to perform criminal
history (using the appropriate LEDS authorization coding) and driving record/status
checks will conduct the check on the prospective employee or volunteer and orally
report to the City of Sandy, Sandy Fire District, Boring Fire District or the Oregon Trail
School District the applicants record, the hard copy of which will then be shredded. A
11
request for a written criminal history report from OSP Identification Services Section can
be made by the employing agency after paying the applicable fee for this service.
SECTION 2.30.040  Retention of Criminal Record Checks.
The written criminal history report (if one is requested from the OSP Identification
Services Section) on persons who are not hired as an employee or appointed as a
volunteer will be retained in accordance with the requirements of OAR 166-200-
0090(21) for a period of three years and thereafter will be destroyed by shredding. The
criminal history report of applicants and volunteers with a criminal history that are hired
or appointed, will become a part of the confidential personnel file of that employee or
volunteer. Access to confidential personnel files is limited to persons who have an
official need to access such files.
SECTION 2.30.050  Use of Criminal Record Checks.
Applicants for employment or appointment as a volunteer who have a felony criminal
history, or a history of conviction of a misdemeanor involving moral turpitude or theft,
will be closely examined by selecting officials to determine if the applicant possesses
the required degree of citizen and public trust and confidence. Each employment or
volunteer selection will, however, be made on an individual, case-by-case basis, taking
into account the applicants qualifications, the requirements of the particular job or
volunteer post applied for, and the results of the criminal history check. Factors such as
the age of an offender at the time of the offense, the type offense and subsequent
rehabilitation, and the public sensitivity of the position under consideration, must be
taken into account in evaluating a criminal history report. Hiring or appointing a
volunteer with a criminal history record will require a positive recommendation by the
selecting official and the approval of the appropriate City, Fire District or School District
elected official or governing body, after full disclosure and consideration of the criminal
history and the applicant.

of penalty.

A writ of review under ORS 34.010 to 34.102 is the exclusive means to contest a final
decision of the city council under 2.90.050, and must be filed within 60 days of the
29
notice provided under 2.90.050. The owner of the real property that is the subject of the
claim under this chapter is a necessary party in such a proceeding.
2.90.110 Private cause of action.
If the city councils removal, modification, or waiver of a land use regulation reduces the
value of other property adjacent to a property that is the subject of a claim under this
chapter, the adjacent property owner(s) are granted a cause of action in a court of
competent jurisdiction to recover from the claimant the amount of the reduction. In any
such action, the adjacent property owner(s) are entitled to all fees and costs incurred,
as well as any sum that a court, including any appellate court, may deem reasonable as
attorney fees. This section does not create a cause of action against the City.
2.90.120 Compensation by other.
An individual or entity other than the City may compensate the claimant for any
diminution in value established under this chapter, in lieu of the City removing,
modifying or waiving the land use regulation causing the diminution. A contract between
the City, the claimant and the individual or entity providing the compensation is a
condition precedent to compensating a claimant under this subsection, and must be
approved by the city attorney.
2.90.130 Severability.
If any phrase, clause, or other part or parts of this chapter are found invalid by a court of
competent jurisdiction, the remaining phrases, clauses and other part or parts will
remain in full force and effect.
2.90.140 Applicable state law, no independent rights.
For all claims filed the applicable state law is those portions of ORS Chapter 197 added
by Ballot Measure 37, or as amended, modified or clarified by subsequent amendments
or rules adopted by the Oregon Legislature or Oregon administrative agencies. Any
claim that has not been processed completely under this chapter will be subject to any
such amendments, modifications, clarifications or other state actions. This chapter is
adopted solely to address claims filed under the ORS Chapter 197 provisions added by
Ballot Measure 37. This chapter does not create any rights independent of those
provisions.

(Ord.03, 2017)
(Tax on the Sale of Marijuana and Marijuana-Infused products
(Repealed with Ord. 04, 2016))
3.32.010 General Provisions and Procedures
A. When the City provides services or benefits to specific property, the City may, in
addition to any other right or remedy lawfully available to it, assess that property for the
costs of services or benefits relating to it, and make an assessment lien on the
property. The assessment must be recorded with the City in its lien docket and must
be recorded with Clackamas County. The assessment lien is a public record. From the
date of entry of the assessment, the sum entered is a lien upon the land. These
assessment liens will have priority over all other liens and encumbrances except as
may otherwise be provided by state statute and shall accrue interest at the interest rate
established by City Council resolution.
B. Before any charge may become an assessment lien under the terms of this section,
written notice of the proposed assessment must be mailed or given to the owner of the
property shown in the Clackamas County Tax Records. Notice shall be sent or given
not less than thirty (30) days prior to recording in the City lien docket and with
Clackamas County. If the notice is mailed, it shall be certified, return receipt requested.
Failure of an owner to receive actual notice of the proposed assessment will not in any
way affect the validity of the underlying charge or the lien resulting therefrom. An owner
may waive in writing the notice required pursuant to this paragraph.
C. If the owner wishes to challenge the validity or amount of the proposed assessment,
they may do so by filing a written objection with the City Council setting out with
particularity the basis for the objection. The objection must be received by the City not
more than twenty (20) days after the date of the notice referred to in subsection (B),
unless the Council waives the timing requirement for good cause. The objection will
then be scheduled for a hearing at which time the owner may present such evidence as
deemed necessary to show that the amount or validity of the assessment is in error. If
the Council agrees with the owner, the Council shall then adjust the assessment to the
extent necessary and direct the City Recorder to record the corrected assessment in the
City lien docket and with Clackamas County. While an objection is pending before
Council, no assessment shall be made a lien on the City's lien docket. An owner may
waive in writing the right to object to an assessment. (Ord. 03, 2017.)

(Ord. 99-03 (part), 1999.)
5.05.030 Payroll and self-employment tax imposed.
To carry out the purposes set forth herein, an excise tax is imposed and levied on every
person, firm, corporation or association doing business within the boundaries of the
local transit area, which employs one or more employees, or contracts orally or in
writing with any commission merchant or commission employee. For the same
purposes, a tax is imposed on each individual's net earnings from self-employment and
hereinafter shall be included when there is a reference to payroll and self-employment
tax. The amount of the tax shall be .006 (0.6 percent) of the total payroll expense of
each taxpayer or of the individual's net earnings from self-employment as the case may
7
be. The payroll and self-employment tax shall be in full force and effect from and after
January 1, 2000, and shall apply to payroll expense and net earnings from selfemployment
incurred after that date. This tax is imposed for the provision of public
transportation services within the local transit area in order to provide for the business
community to carry a share of the costs of local government in return for the benefits
and opportunities available because of the city government and services. (Ord. 99-03
(part), 1999.)
5.05.040 Apportionment of tax.
The payroll and self-employment tax applies to the payrolls of employees either working
or being paid within the local transit area or doing business within the local transit area
unless a portion of or all of the payroll is subject to a like type tax by TriMet. If an
employer employs or pays some individuals for work performed within the local transit
area and employs or pays some individuals for work performed outside of the local
transit area who are subject to TriMet tax, then the tax shall apply only to the payroll
covering employees working or being paid within the local transit area who are not
subject to TriMet tax. If any employee spends part of his working hours within the city
and part outside of the city, the fraction or percentage of the payroll of that employee to
be taxed shall be determined as follows:
A. If the employee's compensation depends on the amount of sales or volume of repair
work or other services done, only the payroll attributable to sales made or services done
in the local transit area shall be subject to the payroll tax.
B. If the employee is paid on any other basis, the fraction or percentage of the payroll
concerning that employee to be taxed shall equal the fraction or percentage of the
employee's working hours spent in the local transit area. The same apportionment is
applicable to net earnings from self-employment if any of such earnings are subject to
the TriMet payroll and self-employment tax.(Ord. 99-03 (part), 1999.)
5.05.050 Alternate method of apportioning tax.
Any taxpayer may, at the taxpayer's sole option, propose an alternate method to the
methods of apportioning the payroll tax set out in the preceding section of this chapter.
If, due to the circumstances of the taxpayer's business, the methods set out in the
preceding section result in more of the taxpayer's payroll being taxed than can
reasonably be attributed to the connection of the taxpayer and the employees,
commission merchants or commission employees within the local transit district, and if
the proposed alternate method does provide for a reasonably accurate proportion of the
taxpayer's payroll to be subject to the tax, the collector may approve the alternate
method and the amount of payroll and self-employment tax owed by the taxpayer shall
be the amount determined by the alternate method. (Ord. 99-03 (part), 1999.)
5.05.060 Fixed percentage.
If the collector finds that the percentage of any taxpayer's payroll required to be
apportioned to business done in the local transit area remains stable with little variation,
the collector may notify the taxpayer that a fixed percentage has been established and
8
that the percentage does not have to be calculated when each return is filed. If the
taxpayer objects within thirty days of receiving such notice, the fixed percentage shall
not be put into effect and the percentage shall continue to be determined as before. If
the taxpayer does not object, such fixed percentage shall remain in effect until changed
by action of the collector, or changed by the taxpayer as follows: At any time the use of
the fixed percentage may be discontinued, at the sole option of the taxpayer, by the
taxpayer giving thirty days notice to the collector. Each taxpayer whose payroll tax is
determined by use of a fixed percentage under this section has a continuing duty to
notify the collector immediately of any significant change in conditions which would
change the proportion of the payroll reasonably attributable to business done or work
done in the local transit district. The collector may change or discontinue the use of a
fixed percentage at any time. (Ord. 99-03 (part), 1999.)
5.05.070 Employer located outside of local transit district.
Employers located outside of the local transit area are subject to the payroll and selfemployment
tax if any employee, commission merchant or commission employee of the
employer does business in the local transit area in any way designated in Section
5.05.020. Each such employer shall contact the city collector to obtain forms and shall
file all returns required by this chapter. (Ord. 99-03 (part), 1999.)
5.05.080 Exceptions.
A. Wages which are excluded as remuneration paid under ORS 267.380.
B. Any payroll of any employer subject to the TriMet payroll or self-employment tax.
(Ord. 99-03 (part), 1999.)
5.05.090 Nature of the tax.
The tax imposed by this chapter is a tax on persons, firms, corporations and
associations doing business in the local transit area. It is not a tax on employees. The
payroll and self-employment tax shall not be withheld by the employer from the
employee's compensation. (Ord. 99-03 (part), 1999.)
5.05.100 Date due, returns, payments, prepayments and extensions.
A. Taxpayers shall comply with the following requirements concerning returns,
payments, prepayments and extensions.
B. Taxes shall be determined for:
1. Payroll: each quarter of the calendar year, and the tax due for each quarter of the
calendar year shall be paid on or before April 30, July 31, October 31, and January 31.
2. Self-employment (this applies to the business owner only; taxes for employees must
be reported as payroll, above): annually, and the tax due for each calendar year shall be
paid on or before April 15th of the following year.
9
Each taxpayer shall file a return, on a form to be furnished by the collector, and file the
same along with payment of the tax, on or before the date payment is due.
C. Extensions for filing may be granted by the collector for good and sufficient cause
shown, such as events outside the control of the taxpayer and which could not have
been avoided by prudent business practices. Such extensions shall be for not more
than thirty days. If the collector grants an extension under this subsection, the taxpayer
shall pay interest at the rate of one and one-half percent per month on the payroll and
self-employment tax due and shall pay no other penalty or late charge.
(Ord. 99-03 (part), 1999.)
5.05.110 Rebates.
A. The collector may request approval from the city council to grant tax rebates or
credits based on the financial performance of the transportation fund, giving due
consideration to projected operating expenses and prudent reserves.
B. Rebates will be returned to taxpayers on a pro-rata basis less costs of administration
of such rebates and any incentive charges.
(Ord. 99-03 (part), 1999.)
5.05.120 Collector's duties.
The collector shall have the following duties in connection with the payroll and selfemployment
tax:
A. Keep accurate records of all returns and of all sums received for payroll and selfemployment
tax. Such records shall contain the names and addresses of each
taxpayer, and the dates and amounts of payments. The nature of installment payments
shall be indicated on the records. The collector shall keep the original returns on file for
a period of not less than three years after filing;
B. Enforce the provisions of this chapter;
C. Prepare forms and instructions for the returns and payments required by this chapter;
D. Examine returns, and, for any returns appearing to be incorrect, make inquiries,
investigations and adjustments in the amount of tax due;
E. Where necessary to determine accurate figures for determining the amount of tax
due, examine books, records and information stored in computers of any taxpayer,
provided that each city officer or employee acting under this chapter shall identify
himself or herself and request the information desired. If the officer or employee is
refused admission to any place of business or refused access to any records or
computer memory, the collector or employee shall leave the premises and shall seek an
appropriate court order, with the assistance of the city attorney, to obtain access to the
information needed;
10
F. The collector may delegate duties assigned to the collector in this chapter to any
officer or employee under the collector's supervision, provided that the collector shall
approve the form of all returns and written instructions;
G. The collector shall prepare pamphlets for distribution to the public, clearly explaining
the payroll and self-employment tax and the returns and payments required;
H. The collector shall perform all of the other duties assigned to the collector by this
chapter.
(Ord. 99-03 (part), 1999.)
5.05.130 Penalties and interest.
A. Original Delinquency. Any operator who has not been granted an extension of time
for filing a return or remittance of tax due and who fails to remit any tax imposed by
Section 5.05.030, et seq. prior to delinquency, shall pay a penalty of ten percent of the
amount of tax due in addition to the amount of the tax.
B. Continued Delinquency. Any operator who has not been granted an extension of time
for filing a return or remittance of tax due, and who failed to pay any delinquent
remittance on or before a period of thirty days following the date on which the
remittance last became delinquent, shall pay a second delinquency penalty of fifteen
percent of the amount of the tax due plus the amount of the tax and the ten percent
penalty first imposed.
C. Fraud. If the collector determines that the failure to file a return or that the
nonpayment of any remittance due under Section 5.05.030, et seq., is due to fraud or
intent to evade the provisions thereof, a penalty of twenty-five percent of the amount of
the tax shall be added thereto in addition to the penalties stated in subsections A and B
of this section.
D. Interest. In addition to the penalties imposed, any operator who fails to remit a tax
imposed by Section 5.05.030, et seq., shall pay interest at the rate of one and one-half
percent per month or a fraction thereof, on the amount of the tax due, exclusive of
penalties, from the date on which the remittance first became delinquent until paid.
E. Penalties Merged with Tax. Every penalty imposed and such interest as accrues
under provisions of this section shall be merged and become a part of the tax herein
required to be paid. Payments shall first be applied to penalties imposed, then to
interest accrued, then taxes due.
F. Attorney Fees. In the event it becomes necessary for an enforcement of the
provisions of this chapter for the city of Sandy to incur attorney fees expense and cost,
the tax payer shall be assessed any such expense and/or cost and it shall be due and
owing upon billing and shall bear interest at the rate of one and one-half percent per
month.
11
G. Imposition of Civil Penalties. An imposition of any civil penalties, interest, fees, or
costs by this section shall not be a bar for any prosecution under Section 5.05.240.
(Ord. 99-03 (part), 1999.)
5.05.140 Failure to file, failure to pay, underpayment.
The following rules apply when a taxpayer fails to file a return, fails to pay the payroll
and self-employment tax when due or pays less than the amount due:
A. If a taxpayer fails to make a return, the collector shall prepare an estimate of the
amount of payroll and self-employment tax due from the taxpayer, based on the best
information available to the collector. The collector may make investigations to assist in
making the estimate. The collector may consider the number of employees, the wages
or other compensation customarily paid in the type of business, the volume of business
done and customary commissions or bonuses paid to employees in the same type of
business, and any other relevant matters. The collector may estimate the compensation
customary in the business by comparing returns filed by other taxpayers in the same
business or similar businesses. When the collector estimates the payroll and selfemployment
tax, the amount of the interest and late charge provided by this chapter
shall be added to the taxes due. The collector shall notify the taxpayer of the amount
due. Such notification shall be in writing and shall contain a brief description of the
method and estimated figures used in arriving at the estimated tax. Any taxpayer may
dispute the amount of the estimated tax by filing, within thirty days of notification of the
estimated tax, a tax return accompanied by payment of the entire balance due, together
with interest and late charge due. Such return shall be processed like any late return,
and shall establish the payroll tax liability of the taxpayer in place of the estimated tax
prepared by the collector. The collector may, however, later determine that the amount
shown on the return is insufficient, so there is a deficiency, in the same manner as in
the case of other returns.
B. If the collector determines, by examining available evidence that the amount of
payroll and self-employment tax paid by any taxpayer is less than the amount required
by this chapter, the collector shall notify the taxpayer of the deficiency. The collector
may use any of the methods authorized by Sections 5.05.010, et seq., of this chapter to
determine whether a deficiency exists and to determine the amount of such deficiency.
The collector shall thereupon notify the taxpayer of the deficiency. Such notice shall be
in writing and shall state not only the amount of the deficiency, but also the methods
and estimates used in arriving at the amount of deficiency. If the taxpayer does not
object within thirty days of the date of receiving such notice, the taxpayer shall be
deemed to have accepted the revised figures for payroll tax liability. If the taxpayer does
file a written objection within the time specified, the taxpayer shall pay the tax, together
with penalties and interest, under protest, and may thereupon, pursue administrative
and judicial remedies as provided by ordinance and by state law, to seek a refund.
C. If the collector finds that any taxpayer has overpaid, the collector shall notify the
taxpayer of the taxpayer's overpayment and shall refund the amount of the overpayment
to the taxpayer in accordance with Section 5.05.180.
12
D. When the collector notifies any taxpayer of any estimated tax, alleged overpayment
or refund, the collector shall include in the notice clear instructions on how, when and
where the taxpayer may protest or appeal the decision.
E. If a taxpayer or any person, firm, association or corporation required by this chapter
to pay a tax or to file a return shall fail to file any return for any year, such failure to file
shall constitute a continuing offense against the city and the collector may proceed to
estimate and collect the payroll and self-employment tax at any time. In all other cases,
no increase shall be made in any taxpayer's payroll tax liability unless the first notice of
such increase is received by the taxpayer within three years of the time the return was
first due.
(Ord. 99-03 (part), 1999.)
5.05.150 Tax as debt-Termination of taxable period and immediate assessment of
tax.
A. Every tax imposed upon employers measured by wages paid to employees and upon
self-employed persons measured by net earnings from self-employment, and all
increases, interest and penalties thereon shall become, from the time such liability is
incurred, a personal debt, due the city, from the person or persons liable therefor.
B. If the collector finds that the taxpayer designs to depart quickly from the state or to
remove his property therefrom, or to do any other act tending to prejudice or to render
wholly or partially ineffectual proceedings to collect the tax for any past quarter or the
tax quarter then current, unless such proceedings be brought without delay, the
collector shall declare the current taxable period for such taxpayer immediately
terminated and shall cause notice of such finding and declaration to be given the
taxpayer. Simultaneously, the collector, on the basis of the best information available to
it, shall assess a tax for such terminated period and for the preceding tax quarter (if no
return has been filed therefor, whether or not the time otherwise allowed by law for filing
such return and paying the tax has expired), and shall assess additional tax for any
quarters open to assessment under provisions of the applicable law. The collector shall
give notice to the taxpayer of all taxes so assessed. Such taxes shall thereupon
become immediately due and payable as soon as the notice and findings are issued to
the taxpayer or mailed to his last known address. In any proceeding in court brought to
enforce payment of taxes made due and payable by virtue of the provisions of this
section, the findings of the collector, made as provided in this section, whether made
after notice to the taxpayer or not, shall be for all purposes presumptive evidence of the
taxpayer's design, and the certificate of the collector if the mailing or issuing of the
notice and findings specified in this section is presumptive.
(Ord. 99-03 (part), 1999.)
5.05.160 Penalty for failure to file tax report and remit taxes due.
A. Any tax that is not paid within 30 days after it is due, or within five days, in the case
of taxes that may be immediately due pursuant to Section 5.05.150, is delinquent,
unless the taxpayer has secured the payment of the amount due by bond, deposit, or
13
otherwise and the collector, in its sole discretion, has approved the security for the
payment.
B. The city may seek any and all remedies available to it Oregon law, or the citys
charter or ordinances, to collect delinquencies under this chapter.
C. Without limiting the remedies available to the city, the city may: (1) issue a citation to
the delinquent taxpayer in accordance with Sandy Municipal Code Chapter 1.18; (2)
submit any delinquent amount to a collection agency; or (3) in accordance with Sandy
Municipal Code Chapter 3.30, refuse to issue or renew a business license or other
permit to any delinquent taxpayer. If the city submits the delinquent amount to a
collection agency, the city may add a reasonable fee to the delinquent amount to
compensate the city for any collection agency fees the city may incur, but only in
accordance with ORS 697.105. (Ord. 2019-22, 2019.)
5.05.170 Discontinuing business in the local transit district.
Whenever any person, firm, corporation or association subject to the payroll and selfemployment
tax ceases to do business in the local transit area, due either to going out
of business or to moving all of the business out of the local transit area, the person, firm
or corporation shall file forthwith the payroll tax return and pay the tax required by this
chapter, regardless of the time of year. Taxes shall be due and payable only for the
actual payroll expense for the part of the year during which the taxpayer did business in
the local transit area. Each officer, partner or owner of any taxpayer failing to comply
with the terms of this section shall be jointly and severally liable personally for any
unpaid amounts of the tax due under this section. The personal liability provided in the
preceding sentence shall not be applied to a person solely because of ownership of a
minority of stock in a corporation or ownership of any minority interest not involving
control of the business entity. (Ord. 99-03 (part), 1999.)
5.05.180 Refunds.
A. When any amount of any payroll and self-employment tax, penalty or interest has
been overpaid, the taxpayer who made the overpayment shall be reimbursed under the
terms of this section. If the collector determines that an overpayment has been made,
the collector shall make the refund whether a claim for the refund has been filed or not.
Any taxpayer may make a claim for the refund by filing a statement signed by the
taxpayer or by a person with actual knowledge of the facts, stating the reasons for the
claim for refund. The collector shall examine each such claim, and may require
additional information and evidence from the taxpayer. The collector may make an
investigation to determine the facts as to whether a refund is due. Such investigation
may include examining the books, records and information in computer storage of the
taxpayer.
B. If any sum is due from the taxpayer to the city for any reason, the amount of the
refund shall be applied first to offset the sum owed by the taxpayer to the city. Any
balance remaining thereafter may, at the option of the taxpayer, be held by the collector
to apply on future payroll tax payments. Any sum not used for such offset and not held
14
at the taxpayer's request to apply on future payroll tax payments, shall be returned to
the taxpayer as soon as practicable. The collector shall notify the taxpayer in writing of
the collector's decision approving a claim for refund, denying the claim or approving a
refund for a smaller amount than the taxpayer claimed. If the collector shall deny all or
part of the refund claim, the taxpayer may, within thirty days, file a written protest. If the
taxpayer fails to file such written protest within thirty days, the taxpayer shall be deemed
to have waived any objections to the action of the collector. Any taxpayer who has filed
a written protest in accordance with this section may pursue the administrative remedies
and judicial remedies available under city ordinances and state law, to obtain review of
the decision denying all or part of the refund. Any action by the collector under this
section, except an action fully approving a claim for refund, shall be accompanied by a
set of clear instructions on how to file an administrative appeal or court action and shall
make it clear that failure to file a timely administrative appeal or court action will cause
the collector's decision to stand.
(Ord. 99-03 (part), 1999.)
5.05.190 Sale or other transfer of business.
A. If any owner or group of owners acting together, transfer a majority of ownership
interest or controlling interest in any business entity that is subject to the payroll and
self-employment tax, the seller or transferor must furnish to the buyer or transferee a
complete record of payments, accompanied by receipts, showing past payments of the
payroll expense tax for the past three years or the period of time since the business was
subject to the tax, whichever period is shorter. The buyer and seller, or transferor and
transferee, must also furnish written evidence to the collector that the steps described in
at least one of the following paragraphs have been taken;
B. The seller has filed a payroll and self-employment tax return covering the period up
to the date of sale of the business entity, accompanied by payment of all payroll and
se]f employment tax accrued to the date of sale. This is due not later than ten days after
the sale is closed by transfer of ownership, regardless of the payment schedule; or
C. The buyer or transferee has filed a written agreement with the city, undertaking to
pay all payroll taxes to become due, including those accrued during the part of the year
before the sale or transfer; or
D. The buyer has furnished evidence to the city that the funds of the business entity are
sufficient and will be sufficient to pay all payroll and self-employment tax anticipated to
be due when the next payment is due, that the business entity has acknowledged its
responsibility to pay such taxes and that there are no past due payroll expense taxes,
penalties or interest payments owed to the city by the business entity; or
E. A cash deposit or bond with a corporate surety has been filed with the collector,
sufficient to cover the amount of payroll and self-employment tax anticipated to become
due for the payroll expenses before the transfer; or
15
F. The buyer or seller has prodded an alternative means of assuring that the payroll and
self-employment tax for the period before the sale will be paid, and such alternative
means is reasonably sufficient, in the judgment of the collector, to insure the payment of
the tax when due.
(Ord. 99-03 (part), 1999.)
5.05.200 Receivers, trustees, executors, administrators, guardians, conservators
and others.
If control of any employer subject to the payroll and self-employment tax passes to any
trustee, receiver, executor, administrator, guardian, conservator or other personal
representative or fiduciary, such personal representatives or fiduciary shall have all the
duties of the employer under this chapter. (Ord. 99-03 (part), 1999.)
5.05.210 Right of privacy.
Except when disclosure is required by law or in connection with the collecting and
enforcing the payroll and self-employment tax, no city officer or employee shall disclose
to any person outside of the collector's office any information learned from any return or
other information filed by any taxpayer under this chapter. City officers and employees
enforcing this chapter and collecting taxes shall not seek information that is irrelevant to
the payroll and self-employment tax. (Ord. 99-03 (part), 1999.)
5.05.220 Computer records of taxpayers.
The following rules apply to taxpayers who have records stored in temporary or
permanent memory in any computer.
A. In lieu of any return or report required by this chapter, any taxpayer may submit a
printout from a computer containing all of the information required in the return, in a
format approved by the collector.
B. Whenever the collector has the authority or the duty to examine any books and
records of any taxpayer, the collector shall also have the authority or duty to examine
relevant information stored in any computer used by the taxpayer. The taxpayer need
not permit the collector or any city employee to operate the computer, but the taxpayer
shall furnish to the collector an employee or other person authorized by the taxpayer to
operate the computer, permitting readouts and printouts as requested or determined by
the collector. The duties and powers of the collector may be exercised by any person
working under the supervision of the collector.
(Ord. 99-03 (part), 1999.)

the City may require. The City may demand of any dealer such additional data as is
deemed necessary in support of any such certificate, and failure to supply such data will
constitute a waiver of all right to exemption claimed by virtue of such certificate. This
City may, in a case where it believes no useful purpose would be served by filing of an
export certificate, waive the certificate.
3) Any motor vehicle fuel carried from the City in the fuel tank of a motor vehicle

upon satisfaction by the applicant of all conditions contained in the Standard Practice
Instruction No. 400-5 of Portland General Electric Company dated November 14, 1969,

BINGO AND LOTTO
5.28.010 Permitted when.
Charitable, fraternal and religious organizations which are located within the city and
which comply with the provisions of Subsection 2 of Section 2 of D-Eng. HB 2341 may
30
engage in bingo or lotto when no person other than the organization or a player profits
in any manner from the operation of the lottery. Bingo or lotto means a game played
with cards bearing lines of numbers, in which a player covers or uncovers a number
selected from a container, and which is won by a player who is present during the game

sequence or pattern. As used in this section, "charitable, fraternal or religious

eleemosynary, humane, patriotic, religious, philanthropic, recreational, social,
educational, civic, fraternal or other nonprofit purposes, and who is also exempt from
payment of federal income taxes because of its charitable, fraternal or religious
purposes. The fact that contributions to an organization profiting from the contest do not
qualify for charitable deductions for tax purposes or that the organization is not
otherwise exempt from payment of federal income taxes pursuant to the Internal
Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, constitutes prima facie evidence that the
organization is not a bona fide charitable, fraternal or religious organization. (Ord. 11-77

continue shall constitute a separate offense.

penalty prescribed for violation of a substantially similar offense prescribed by Oregon
Revised Statutes.

or relocation of any utility facility, including but not limited to any excavation and
restoration required in association with such construction, demolition, installation,
replacement, repair, maintenance or relocation.

5
days of the later of: (1) the effective date of this Chapter, or (2) the expiration of a
valid franchise from the City, unless a new franchise is granted by the City pursuant
to subsection E of this section12.02.070.
B. License Application. The license application shall be on a form provided by the City,
and shall be accompanied by any additional documents required by the application to
identify the applicant, its legal status, including its authorization to do business in Oregon,
a description of the type of utility service provided or to be provided by the applicant, and

application fee or deposit set by resolution of the City Council in an amount sufficient to
fully recover all of the Citys costs related to processing the application for the license.
D. Determination by City. The City shall issue, within a reasonable period of time, a
written determination granting or denying the license in whole or in part. If the license is
denied, the written determination shall include the reasons for denial. The license shall
be evaluated based upon the provisions of this Chapter, the continuing capacity of the
rights of way to accommodate the applicants proposed utility facilities and the applicable
federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations and policies.
E. Franchise Agreements. If the public interest warrants, the City and utility operator
may enter into a written franchise agreement that includes terms that clarify, enhance,
expand, waive or vary the provisions of this Chapter, consistent with applicable state and
federal law. The franchise may conflict with the terms of this Chapter with the review and
approval of City Council. The franchisee shall be subject to the provisions of this Chapter
to the extent such provisions are not in conflict with any such franchise.
F. Rights Granted.
1. The license granted hereunder shall authorize and permit the licensee, subject to
the provisions of the City code and other applicable provisions of state or federal
law, to construct, place, maintain, repair and operate utility facilities in the rights of
way for the term of the license.
2. Any license granted pursuant to this Chapter shall not convey equitable or legal
title in the rights of way, and may not be assigned or transferred except as
permitted in subsection K of this section.
3. Neither the issuance of the license nor any provisions contained therein shall
constitute a waiver or bar to the exercise of any governmental right or power, police
power nor regulatory power of the City as may exist at the time the license is issued
or thereafter obtained.
6
G. Term. Subject to the termination provisions in subsection M of this section, the license
granted pursuant to this Chapter will remain in effect for a term of five years. The City

H. License Nonexclusive. No license granted pursuant to this section shall confer any
exclusive right, privilege, license or franchise to occupy or use the rights of way for
delivery of utility services or any other purpose. The City expressly reserves the right to
grant licenses, franchises or other rights to other persons, as well as the Citys right to
use the rights of way, for similar or different purposes. The license is subject to all
recorded deeds, easements, dedications, conditions, covenants, restrictions,
encumbrances, and claims of title of record that may affect the rights of way. Nothing in
the license shall be deemed to grant, convey, create, or vest in licensee a real property
interest in land, including any fee, leasehold interest or easement.
I. Reservation of City Rights. Nothing in the license shall be construed to prevent the
City from grading, paving, repairing and/or altering any rights of way, constructing, laying
down, repairing, relocating or removing City facilities or establishing any other public
work, utility or improvement of any kind, including repairs, replacement or removal of any
City facilities. If any of licensees utility facilities located in a right of way interfere with the
construction, repair, replacement, alteration or removal of any rights of way, public work,
City utility, City improvement or City facility, except those providing utility services in
competition with a licensee, licensees facilities shall be removed or relocated as provided
in subsections12.02.090 C, D and E of this Chapter, in a manner acceptable to the City
and consistent with industry standard engineering and safety codes.
J. Multiple Services.
1. A utility operator that provides or transmits or allows the provision or transmission
of utility services and other services over its facilities is subject to the license and
privilege tax requirements of this Chapter for the portion of the facilities and extent
of utility services delivered over those facilities.
2. A utility operator that provides or transmits more than one utility service over its
facilities is not required to obtain a separate license or franchise for each utility
service, provided that it gives notice to the City of each utility service provided or
transmitted and pays the applicable privilege tax for each utility service.
K. Transfer or Assignment. To the extent permitted by applicable state and federal laws,
the licensee shall obtain the written consent of the City prior to the transfer or assignment
of the license. The license shall not be transferred or assigned unless the proposed
transferee or assignee is authorized under all applicable laws to own or operate the utility
system and the transfer or assignment is approved by all agencies or organizations
required or authorized under federal and state laws to approve such transfer or
assignment. If a license is transferred or assigned, the transferee or assignee shall
become responsible for all facilities of the licensee at the time of transfer or assignment.
A transfer or assignment of a license does not extend the term of the license.
7

subsection B of this section and the application fee required in subsection C of this
section. The City shall review the application as required by subsection D of this section
and grant or deny the license within ninety days of submission of the application. If the
City determines that the licensee is in violation of the terms of this Chapter at the time it
submits its application, the City may require that the licensee cure the violation or submit
a detailed plan to cure the violation within a reasonable period of time, as determined by
the City, before the City will consider the application and/or grant the license. If the City
requires the licensee to cure or submit a plan to cure a violation, the City will grant or
deny the license application within ninety days of confirming that the violation has been
cured or of accepting the licensees plan to cure the violation.
M. Termination.
1. Revocation or Termination of a License. The City Council may terminate or revoke
the license granted pursuant to this Chapter for any of the following reasons:
a. Material violation of any of the provisions of this Chapter;
b. Material violation of any provision of the license;
c. Misrepresentation in a license application;
d. Failure to pay taxes, compensation, fees or costs due the City after final
determination of the taxes, compensation, fees or costs;
e. Failure to restore the rights of way after construction as required by this
Chapter or other applicable state and local laws, ordinances, rules and
regulations;
f. Failure to comply with technical, safety and engineering standards related to
work in the rights of way; or
g. Failure to obtain or maintain any and all licenses, permits, certifications and
other authorizations required by state or federal law for the placement,
maintenance and/or operation of the utility facilities.
2. Standards for Revocation or Termination. In determining whether termination,
revocation or some other sanction is appropriate, the following factors shall be
considered:
a. The egregiousness of the misconduct;
8
b. The harm that resulted;
c. Whether the violation was intentional;
d. The utility operators history of compliance; and/or
e. The utility operators cooperation in discovering, admitting and/or curing the
violation.
3. Notice and Cure. The City shall give the utility operator written notice of any
apparent violations before terminating a license. The notice shall include a short
and concise statement of the nature and general facts of the violation or
noncompliance and provide a reasonable time (no less than twenty and no more
than forty days) for the utility operator to demonstrate that the utility operator has
remained in compliance, that the utility operator has cured or is in the process of
curing any violation or noncompliance, or that it would be in the public interest to
impose a penalty or sanction less than termination or revocation. If the utility
operator is in the process of curing a violation or noncompliance, the utility operator
must demonstrate that it acted promptly and continues to actively work on
compliance. If the utility operator does not respond or if the City manager or
designee determines that the utility operators response is inadequate, the City
manager or designee shall refer the matter to the City Council, which shall provide
a duly noticed public hearing to determine whether the license shall be terminated
or revoked.
12.02.070 Construction and Restoration.
A. Construction Codes. Utility facilities shall be constructed, installed, operated and
maintained in accordance with the permit conditions and all applicable federal, state and
local codes, rules and regulations. When a utility operator, or any person acting on its
behalf, does any work in or affecting the rights of way, the utility operator shall, at its own
expense, promptly restore the rights of way as directed by the City consistent with the
permit, applicable City codes, rules and regulations.
B. Construction Permits.
1. No person shall perform any work on utility facilities within the rights of way without
first obtaining all required permits. The City shall not issue a permit for the
construction, installation, maintenance or repair of utility facilities unless the utility
operator of the facilities has registered and applied for and received the license
required by this Chapter, or has a current franchise with the City, and all applicable
fees have been paid. Utility operators are not required to obtain a permit for service
drops to customer premises or routine maintenance or repairs where such drops,
repairs or maintenance do not require cutting, digging, breaking of, or damage to,
the right of way.
9
2. In the event of an emergency, a utility operator with a license pursuant to this
Chapter or its contractor may perform work on its utility facilities without first
obtaining a permit from the City, provided that, to the extent reasonably feasible, it
attempts to notify the City prior to commencing the emergency work and in any
event applies for a permit from the City as soon as reasonably practicable, but not
more than two business days after commencing the emergency work. In the event
an act of God, extreme weather or similar circumstances beyond the utility
operators control prevents the utility operator from applying for a permit as
required in the previous sentence, the utility operator will not be in violation of this
Chapter so long as it applies for the permit as soon as reasonably practicable. As
used in this subsection, emergency means a circumstance involving (a) an
unscheduled outage affecting one or more current customers of the licensee, or
(b) danger to public safety that must be addressed within twenty-four (24) hours in
order to protect the public. Emergency also includes situations where the failure
of licensee to act would result in (a) or (b) within twenty-four (24) hours.
3. Applications for permits to construct utility facilities shall be submitted upon forms
to be provided by the City and shall be accompanied by drawings, plans and
specifications with the level of detail required by the City.
4. Prior to issuance of a construction permit, the applicant shall pay a permit fee in
an amount to be determined by resolution of the City Council.
5. If satisfied that the applications, plans and documents submitted comply with all
requirements of this Chapter, the Public Works Director shall issue a permit
authorizing construction of the utility facilities, subject to such further conditions,
restrictions or regulations affecting the time, place and manner of performing the
work as they may deem necessary or appropriate.
6. Except in the case of an emergency, the permittee shall notify the Public Works
Director not less than two business days in advance of any excavation or
construction in the rights of way.
7. All construction practices and activities shall be in accordance with City
standards, the permit and approved final plans and specifications for the utility
facilities. The Public Works Director and their representatives shall be provided
access to the work site and such further information as they may require to
ensure compliance with such requirements.
8. All work which does not comply with the permit, the approved or corrected plans
and specifications for the work, or the requirements of this Chapter, shall be
removed at the sole expense of the permittee unless otherwise approved by the
Public Works Director. The City is authorized to stop work in order to assure
compliance with the provision of this Chapter unless an emergency or threat to
public safety is deemed to exist, in which case the Public Works Director is
authorized to allow the utility operator to perform such work as he or she deems
10
necessary to remedy the emergency or threat to public safety, after which the
utility operator must stop work.
9. The permittee shall promptly complete all construction activities so as to
minimize disruption of the city rights of way and other public and private property.
All construction work within the rights of way, including restoration, must be
completed by the date specified in the construction permit unless an extension or
an alternate schedule has been approved by the appropriate city official.
C. Performance Surety.
1. The City may require a performance bond or other form of surety acceptable to the
City equal to at least one hundred percent of the estimated cost of the work within
the rights of way of the City be provided before construction is commenced.
2. In the event a performance bond or other form of surety acceptable to the City is
required, it shall:
a. remain in force until one year after substantial completion of the work, as
determined in writing by the City, including restoration of rights of way and other
property affected by the construction; and
b. guarantee, to the satisfaction of the City:
i. Timely completion of the work;
ii. That the work is performed in compliance with applicable plans, permits,
technical codes and standards;
iii. Proper location of the facilities as specified by the City; and
iv. Restoration of the rights of way and other property affected by the work.
D. Injury to Persons or Property. A utility operator shall preserve and protect from injury
or damage other utility operators facilities in the rights of way, the public using the rights
of way and any adjoining property, and take other necessary measures to protect life and
property, including but not limited to buildings, walls, fences, trees or facilities that may
be subject to damage from the permitted work. A utility operator shall be responsible for
all injury to persons or damage to public or private property resulting from its failure to
properly protect people and property and to carry out the work.
E. Restoration.
1. When a utility operator, or any person acting on its behalf, does any work in or
affecting any rights of way, it shall, at its own expense, promptly restore such ways
or property to the same or better condition as existed before the work was
undertaken, in accordance with the permit, applicable federal, state and local laws,
codes, ordinances, rules and regulations.
11
2. If weather or other conditions beyond the utility operators control do not permit the
complete restoration required by the City, the utility operator shall temporarily
restore the affected rights of way or property. Such temporary restoration shall be
at the utility operators sole expense and the utility operator shall promptly
undertake and complete the required permanent restoration when the weather or
other conditions no longer prevent such permanent restoration. Any
corresponding modification to the construction schedule may be subject to
approval by the City.
3. If the utility operator fails to restore rights of way or property as required in this
Chapter, the City shall give the utility operator written notice and provide the utility
operator a reasonable period of time not less than ten days, unless an emergency
or threat to public safety is deemed to exist, and not exceeding thirty days to
restore the rights of way or property. If, after said notice, the utility operator fails
to restore the rights of way or property as required in this Chapter, the City shall
cause such restoration to be made at the expense of the utility operator. To the
extent the restoration requires the City to move, alter or perform any work on or to
the utility operators facilities, the City will use qualified personnel or contractors
consistent with applicable state and federal safety laws and regulations.
F. Inspection. Every utility operators facilities shall be subject to the right of periodic
inspection by the City to determine compliance with the provisions of this Chapter and all
other applicable state and City codes, ordinances, rules and regulations. Every utility
operator shall cooperate with the City in permitting the inspection of utility facilities upon
request of the City. The utility operator shall perform all testing of compaction and paving,
or permit the City to perform any such testing at the utility operators expense, required
by the City to determine that the restoration of the right of way complies with the terms of
this Chapter and applicable state and City codes, ordinances, rules and regulations.
G. Coordination of Construction. All utility operators are required to make a good faith
effort to both cooperate with and coordinate their construction schedules with those of the
City and other users of the rights of way.
1. Prior to January 1st of each year, utility operators shall provide the City with a
schedule of known proposed construction activities for that year in, around or that
may affect the rights of way.
2. Utility operators shall meet with the City annually, or as determined by the City, to
schedule and coordinate construction in the rights of way.
3. All construction locations, activities and schedules within the rights of way shall be
coordinated as ordered by the Public Works Director, to minimize public
inconvenience, disruption, or damages as much as reasonably possible.
12.02.080 Location of Facilities.
12
A. Location of Facilities. Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the City, whenever any
existing electric utilities, cable facilities or communications facilities are located
underground within a right of way of the City, the utility operator with permission to occupy
the same right of way shall locate its facilities underground at its own expense. This
requirement shall not apply to facilities used for transmission of electric energy at nominal
voltages in excess of 35,000 volts or to pedestals, cabinets or other above-ground
equipment of any utility operator. The City reserves the right to require written approval
of the location of any such above-ground equipment in the right of way.
B. Interference with the rights of way. No utility operator or other person may locate or
maintain its facilities so as to unreasonably interfere with the use of the rights of way by
the City, by the general public or by other persons authorized to use or be present in or
upon the rights of way. All use of the rights of way shall be consistent with City codes,
ordinances, rules and regulations.
C. Relocation of Utility Facilities.
1. A utility operator shall, at no cost to the City, temporarily or permanently remove,
relocate, change or alter the position of any utility facility within a right of way,
including relocation of aerial facilities underground, when requested to do so in
writing by the City.
2. Nothing herein shall be deemed to preclude the utility operator from requesting
reimbursement or compensation from a third party, pursuant to applicable laws,
regulations, tariffs or agreements, provided that the utility operator shall timely
comply with the requirements of this section regardless of whether or not it has
requested or received such reimbursement or compensation.
3. The City shall provide written notice of the time by which the utility operator must
remove, relocate, change, alter or underground its facilities. If a utility operator
fails to remove, relocate, alter or underground any utility facility as requested by
the City and by the date reasonably established by the City, unless such failure is
caused by circumstances that are not in the utility operators control, including but
not limited to acts of God, extreme weather, and the failure of another utility
operator to complete work in the necessary time period where such work is a
prerequisite to the utility operators removal or relocation activities, the utility
operator shall pay all costs incurred by the City due to such failure, including but
not limited to costs related to project delays, and the City may cause the utility
facility to be removed, relocated, altered or undergrounded at the utility operators
sole expense using qualified personnel or contractors consistent with applicable
state and federal safety laws and regulations. Upon receipt of a detailed invoice
from the City, the utility operator shall reimburse the City for the costs the City
incurred within thirty days.
D. Removal of Unauthorized Facilities.
13
1. Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the City Manager, within thirty days
following written notice from the City or such other time agreed to in writing by the
City, a utility operator and any other person that owns, controls, or maintains any
abandoned or unauthorized utility facility within a right of way shall, at its own
expense, remove the facility and restore the right of way.
2. A utility system or facility is unauthorized under any of the following circumstances:
a. The utility facility is outside the scope of authority granted by the City under the
license, franchise or other written agreement. This includes facilities that were
never licensed or franchised and facilities that were once licensed or franchised
but for which the license or franchise has expired or been terminated. This does
not include any facility for which the City has provided written authorization for
abandonment in place.
b. The facility has been abandoned and the City has not provided written
authorization for abandonment in place. A facility is abandoned if it is not in use
and is not planned for further use. A facility will be presumed abandoned if it is
not used for a period of one year. A utility operator may overcome this
presumption by presenting plans for future use of the facility.
c. The utility facility is not constructed or installed in accordance with the permit
or is in a location not permitted by the construction permit, license, franchise or
this Chapter.
d. The utility operator is in violation of a material provision of this Chapter and
fails to cure such violation within thirty days of the City sending written notice
of such violation, unless the City extends such time period in writing.
E. Removal by City.
1. The City retains the right and privilege to cut or move the facilities of any utility
operator or similar entity located within the rights of way of the City, without notice,
as the City may determine to be necessary, appropriate or useful in response to a
public health or safety emergency. The City will use qualified personnel or
contractors consistent with applicable state and federal safety laws and regulations
to the extent reasonably practicable without impeding the Citys response to the
emergency.
2. If the utility operator fails to remove any facility when required to do so under this
Chapter, the City may remove the facility using qualified personnel or contractors
consistent with applicable state and federal safety laws and regulations, and the
utility operator shall be responsible for paying the full cost of the removal and any
administrative costs incurred by the City in removing the facility and obtaining
reimbursement. Upon receipt of a detailed invoice from the City, the utility operator
shall reimburse the City for the costs the City incurred within thirty days. The
obligation to remove shall survive the termination of the license or franchise.
14
3. The City shall not be liable to any utility operator for any damage to utility facilities,
or for any consequential losses resulting directly or indirectly therefrom, by the City
or its contractor in removing, relocating or altering the facilities pursuant to
subsections B, C or D of this section or undergrounding its facilities as required by
subsection A of this section, or resulting from the utility operators failure to remove,
relocate, alter or underground its facilities as required by those subsections, unless
such damage arises directly from the Citys negligence or willful misconduct.
F. Plans and Facilities Mapping. Upon request of the City the utility operator shall
provide as-constructed plans in a form acceptable to the City showing the location of all
its utility facilities in the rights of way after initial construction if such plans materially
changed during construction. The utility operator shall provide a utility system plan or
Geographic Information System data depicting utility systems located in public rights-ofway
upon request of the City, but not more than once per year.
12.02.090 Leased Capacity.
A utility operator may lease capacity on or in its systems within the City to others,
provided that, upon request, the utility operator provides the City with the name and
business address of any lessee. A utility operator is not required to provide such
information if disclosure is prohibited by applicable law or a valid agreement between the
utility operator and the lessee.
12.02.100 Maintenance.
A. Every utility operator shall install and maintain all facilities in a manner that complies
with applicable federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations and policies. The utility
operator shall, at its own expense, repair and maintain facilities from time to time as may
be necessary to accomplish this purpose.
B. If, after written notice from the City of the need for repair or maintenance, a utility
operator fails to repair and maintain facilities as requested by the City and by the date
reasonably established by the City, the City may perform such repair or maintenance
using qualified personnel or contractors at the utility operators sole expense. Upon
receipt of a detailed invoice from the City, the utility operator shall reimburse the City for
the costs the City incurred within thirty days.
12.02.110 Vacation.
If the City vacates any right of way, or portion thereof, that a utility operator uses,
the utility operator shall, at its own expense, remove its facilities from the right of way
unless the City reserves a public utility easement, which the City shall make a reasonable
effort to do provided that there is no expense to the City, or the utility operator obtains an
easement for its facilities. If the utility operator fails to remove its facilities within thirty
days after a right of way is vacated, or as otherwise directed or agreed to in writing by the
City, the City may remove the facilities at the utility operators sole expense. Upon receipt
of an invoice from the City, the utility operator shall reimburse the City for the costs the
City incurred within thirty days.
12.02.120 Privilege Tax.
15
A. Every person that uses utility facilities in the City to provide utility service, whether or
not the person owns the utility facilities used to provide the utility services, shall pay the
privilege tax for every utility service provided using the rights of way in the amount
determined by resolution of the City Council.
B. Privilege tax payments required by this section shall be reduced by any franchise fee
payments received by the City, but in no case will be less than zero dollars.
C. Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the City, the tax set forth in subsection A of
this section shall be paid quarterly, in arrears, for each quarter during the term of the
license within forty-five days after the end of each calendar quarter, and shall be
accompanied by an accounting of gross revenues, if applicable, and a calculation of the
amount payable. The utility shall pay interest at the rate of nine percent per year for any
payment made after the due date.
D. The calculation of the privilege tax required by this section shall be subject to all
applicable limitations imposed by federal or state law.
E. The City reserves the right to enact other fees and taxes applicable to the utility
operators subject to this Chapter. Unless expressly permitted by the City in enacting such
fee or tax, or required by applicable state or federal law, no utility operator may deduct,
offset or otherwise reduce or avoid the obligation to pay any lawfully enacted fees or taxes
based on the payment of the privilege tax or any other fees required by this Chapter.
12.02.130 Audits.
A. Within thirty days of a written request from the City, or as otherwise agreed to in
writing by the City:
1. Every provider of utility service shall furnish the City with information sufficient to
demonstrate that the provider is in compliance with all the requirements of this
Chapter and its franchise agreement, if any, including but not limited to payment
of any applicable registration fee, privilege tax or franchise fee.
2. Every utility operator shall make available for inspection by the City at reasonable
times and intervals all maps, records, books, diagrams, plans and other
documents, maintained by the utility operator with respect to its facilities within the
rights of way or public utility easements. Access shall be provided within the
Portland metropolitan area unless prior arrangement for access elsewhere has
been made with the City.
B. If the Citys audit of the books, records and other documents or information of the
utility operator or utility service provider demonstrate that the utility operator or provider
has underpaid the privilege tax or franchise fee by three percent or more in any one year,
the utility operator shall reimburse the City for the cost of the audit, in addition to any
interest owed pursuant to subsection 12.02.130.C of this Chapter or as specified in a
franchise.
16
C. Any underpayment, including any interest or audit cost reimbursement, shall be paid
within thirty days of the Citys notice to the utility service provider of such underpayment.
12.02.140 Insurance and Indemnification.
A. Insurance.
1. All utility operators shall maintain in full force and effect the following liability
insurance policies that protect the utility operator and the City, as well as the Citys
officers, agents, and employees:
a. Comprehensive general liability insurance with limits not less than:
i. Three million dollars ($3,000,000.00) for bodily injury or death to each
person;
ii. Three million dollars ($3,000,000.00) for property damage resulting from
any one accident; and
iii. Three million dollars ($3,000,000.00) for all other types of liability.

d. Comprehensive form premises-operations, explosions and collapse hazard,
underground hazard and products completed hazard with limits of not less than
three million dollars ($3,000,000.00).
2. The limits of the insurance shall be subject to statutory changes as to maximum
limits of liability imposed on municipalities of the state of Oregon. The insurance
shall be without prejudice to coverage otherwise existing and shall name, or the
certificate of insurance shall name, as additional insureds the City and its officers,
agents, and employees. The coverage must apply as to claims between insureds
on the policy. The policy shall provide that the insurance shall not be canceled or
materially altered without thirty days prior written notice first being given to the City.
If the insurance is canceled or materially altered, the utility operator shall obtain a
replacement policy that complies with the terms of this section and provide the City
with a replacement certificate of insurance. The utility operator shall maintain
continuous uninterrupted coverage, in the terms and amounts required. The utility
operator may self-insure, or keep in force a self-insured retention plus insurance,
for any or all of the above coverage.
17
3. The utility operator shall maintain on file with the City a certificate of insurance, or
proof of self-insurance acceptable to the City, certifying the coverage required
above.
B. Financial Assurance. Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the City, before a
franchise granted or license issued pursuant to this Chapter is effective, and as necessary
thereafter, the utility operator shall provide a performance bond or other financial security,
in a form acceptable to the City, as security for the full and complete performance of the
franchise or license, if applicable, and compliance with the terms of this Chapter, including
any costs, expenses, damages or loss the City pays or incurs because of any failure
attributable to the utility operator to comply with the codes, ordinances, rules, regulations
or permits of the City. This obligation is in addition to the performance surety required by
subsection 12.02.080.C of this Chapter.
C. Indemnification.
1. Each utility operator shall defend, indemnify and hold the City and its officers,
employees, agents and representatives harmless from and against any and all
liability, causes of action, claims, damages, losses, judgments and other costs and
expenses, including attorney fees and costs of suit or defense (at both the trial and
appeal level, whether or not a trial or appeal ever takes place) that may be asserted
by any person or entity in any way arising out of, resulting from, during or in
connection with, or alleged to arise out of or result from the negligent, unsafe or
wrongful acts, omissions, failure to act, or other misconduct of the utility operator
or its affiliates, officers, employees, agents, contractors, subcontractors, or lessees
in the construction, operation, maintenance, repair, or removal of its facilities, and
in providing or offering utility services over the facilities, whether such acts or
omissions are authorized, allowed, or prohibited by this Chapter or by a franchise
agreement. The acceptance of a license under section 12.02.070 of this Chapter
shall constitute such an agreement by the applicant whether the same is
expressed or not. Upon notification of any such claim the City shall notify the utility
operator and provide the utility operator with an opportunity to provide defense
regarding any such claim.
2. Every utility operator shall also indemnify the City for any damages, claims,
additional costs or expenses assessed against or payable by the City arising out
of or resulting, directly or indirectly, from the utility operators failure to remove or
relocate any of its facilities in the rights of way or public utility easements in a timely
manner, unless the utility operators failure arises directly from the Citys
negligence or willful misconduct. The City shall attempt to mitigate the damages
for which the utility operator could be responsible under this subsection by
attempting to limit its liability in public contracts for delay damages in the event that
the delay is caused by a force majeure event that prevents a utility operator from
removing or relocating its facilities in accordance with the schedule provided by
the City.
12.02.150 Compliance.
18
Every utility operator shall comply with all federal and state laws and regulations, including
regulations of any administrative agency thereof, as well as all applicable ordinances,
resolutions, rules and regulations of the City, heretofore or hereafter adopted or
established during the entire term of any license granted under this Chapter.
12.02.160 Confidential/Proprietary Information.
If any person is required by this Chapter to provide books, records, maps or information
to the City that the person reasonably believes to be confidential or proprietary (the
confidential information), the City shall take reasonable steps to protect the confidential
or proprietary nature of the confidential information, to the extent permitted by Oregon
Public Records Laws, provided that all documents are clearly marked as confidential by
the person at the time of disclosure to the City. The City will provide, prior to the release
of any such confidential information, written notice to the person asserting confidentiality
and allow an opportunity for the person to provide a written response to the request,
provided that such response is given to the City within the time the City is required by law
to respond to the request. The person asserting confidentiality shall bear the burden to
show that part or all of the requested confidential information is exempt from disclosure.
The City shall not be required to incur any costs to protect such document, other than the
Citys routine internal procedures for complying with the Oregon Public Records Law and
the notice requirement in the preceding sentence.
12.02.170 Violation - Penalty
A. Any violation of the provisions of this Chapter or the license shall be a civil infraction
that may be subject to a penalty of not more than Five Hundred Dollars for each offense.
In determining the penalty, the following factors shall be considered:
a. The egregiousness of the violation;
b. The harm that resulted;
c. Whether the violation was intentional;
d. The utility operators history of compliance with this Chapter or the license;
and/or
e. The utility operators cooperation in discovering, admitting and/or curing the
violation.
A separate and distinct offense shall be deemed committed each day on which a violation
occurs or continues.
B. Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed as limiting any judicial or other remedies
the City may have at law or in equity, for enforcement of this Chapter.
19
12.02.180 Severability and Preemption.
A. The provisions of this Chapter shall be interpreted to be consistent with applicable
federal and state law, and shall be interpreted, to the extent possible, to cover only
matters not preempted by federal or state law.
B. If any article, section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, term, provision, condition
or portion of this Chapter is for any reason declared or held to be invalid or unenforceable
by any court of competent jurisdiction or superseded by state or federal legislation, rules,
regulations or decision, the remainder of this Chapter shall not be affected thereby but
shall be deemed as a separate, distinct and independent provision, and such holding shall
not affect the validity of the remaining portions hereof, and each remaining section,
subsection, clause, phrase, term, provision, condition, covenant and portion of this
Chapter shall be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law. In the event
any provision is preempted by federal or state laws, rules or regulations, the provision
shall be preempted only to the extent required by law and any portion not preempted shall
survive. If any federal or state law resulting in preemption is later repealed, rescinded,
amended or otherwise changed to end the preemption, such provision shall thereupon
return to full force and effect and shall thereafter be binding without further action by the
City.
12.02.190Application to Existing Agreements.
To the extent that this Chapter is not in conflict with and can be implemented
consistent with existing franchise agreements, this Chapter shall apply to all existing
franchise agreements granted to utility operators by the City.
Chapter 12.04
PUBLIC IMPROVEMENT PROCEDURES1
12.04.010 Initiation of proceedings.
Whenever the city council shall deem it necessary, upon its own motion or upon the
petition of the owners of at least sixty percent of the property to benefit specifically from
the improvement, to construct, alter, repair, improve, widen or extend any street, alley,
sidewalk, parking, curbing or any part thereof, or to construct, alter or install street
lights, or to construct, improve or repair any sanitary or storm sewer or water line or any
part thereof, or to acquire, establish, construct or reconstruct any off-street motor
vehicle parking facility, or to construct, reconstruct, repair or equip a park, playground or
other recreational facility, or to construct, alter or install broadband infrastructure,
including but not limited to fiber optic facilities, for which it is anticipated that special
assessments will be levied, it shall by motion direct the city engineer or engineer
retained by the city to make an investigation of such project and to submit a written
report with the city administration. Such report shall contain the following:
A. A map or plat showing the general nature, location and extent of the proposed
improvement and the land to be assessed for the payment of any part of the cost
thereof;
20
B. Preliminary plans, specifications and estimates of the work to be done; provided,
however, that where the proposed project is to be carried out in cooperation with any
other governmental agency, the engineer may adopt the plans, specifications and
estimates of such agency;
C. An estimate of the probable cost of the improvement, including any legal,
administrative and engineering costs attributable thereto;
D. An estimate of the unit cost of the improvement to the specially benefited properties;
E. A recommendation as to the method of assessment to be used to arrive at a fair
apportionment of the whole or any portion of the cost of the improvement to the
properties specially benefited;
F. The description and assessed value of each lot, parcel of land, or portion thereof, to
be specially benefited by the improvement, with the names of the owners or reputed
owners thereof and, when readily available, the names of the contract purchasers
thereof;
G. A statement of outstanding assessments against property to be assessed.
(Ord. 7-74 § 1, 1974.)
12.04.020 Action on engineer's report.
After the report from the engineer has been filed with the city manager, the city council
may thereafter by motion approve the report, modify the report and approve it as
modified, require the engineer to supply additional or different information for such
improvement, or it may abandon the improvement. (Ord. 14-74 § 3 (part), 1974; Ord. 7-
74 § 2, 1974.)
12.04.030 Resolution and notice of hearing.
After the city council has approved the engineer's report as submitted or modified, the
council shall, by resolution, declare its intention to make such improvements, provide
the manner and method of carrying out the improvement and shall direct the city
recorder to give notice of such improvements by posting at the city hall and at two
places within the benefited area, and by mailing copies of such notice to the owners to
be assessed for the costs of such improvement. Said notice shall contain the following:
A. A statement describing the proposed improvement, the area to be served, and the
intention of the council to make such an improvement;
B. That the engineer's report is on file at city hall and may be examined during normal
business hours, or other specified times;
C. That the council will hold a public hearing on the proposed improvement on a
specified date, which shall not be earlier than ten days following the mailing of notices,
21
at which time objections and remonstrances to such improvement will be heard by the
council;
D. The estimated total cost of the project or the cost of that portion of the project to be
financed by assessments to benefiting properties.
(Ord. 7-74 § 3, 1974.)
12.04.040 Hearing and action on improvements.
If, prior to or during the hearing regarding the formation of local improvement district for
any reason other than to correct danger to public health, written objections are received
from owners, representing two-thirds of the area to be assessed, the improvement
proceedings shall be abandoned and shall not be subject to a further hearing for at least
three months. If the city council finds, however, that a danger to public health exists
which will be corrected by the creation of a local improvement district, no right of
remonstrance shall exist from owners within the area to be assessed. A "danger to
public health" is defined to mean a condition which is conducive to the propagation of
communicable or contagious disease producing organisms and which presents a
reasonably clear possibility that the public generally is being exposed to disease caused
physical suffering or illness, including a condition such as:
A. Impure or inadequate domestic water;
B. Inadequate installation for the disposal and treatment of sewage, garbage or other
contaminated or putrefying waste;
C. Inadequate improvements for drainage of surface water and other fluid substances.
The council, after receiving objections from owners representing not more than twothirds
of the area to be assessed where a danger to public health is not found, may
adopt or amend the engineer's report and adopt the same by resolution. If the council
finds that a danger to public health exists, it may adopt or amend the engineer's report
and adopt the same by resolution. Having by resolution created a local improvement
district, the council shall direct the city engineer or an engineer retained by the city to
prepare detailed plans, specifications and cost estimates for the proposed improvement.
(Ord. 8-86 § 1, 1986: Ord. 7-74 § 4, 1974.)
12.04.050 Manner of doing work.
The council may provide in the improvement authorizing resolution that the construction
work may be done in whole, or in part, by the city, by a contract, by any other
governmental agency, or by any combination thereof. (Ord. 7-74 § 5, 1974.)
12.04.060 Call for bids.
The city council, in its discretion, may direct the city manager to call for bids for
construction of all, or any part of the improvement project on the basis of the councilapproved
engineer's report at any time after passage of said improvement authorizing
resolution and the contracts shall be let to the lowest responsible bidder, provided that
22
the city council shall have the right to reject all bids when they are deemed
unreasonable or unsatisfactory. Said contracts shall provide for the bonding of all
contractors for the faithful performance of any contract let under its authority, and the
provisions thereof in case of default shall be enforced by action in the name of the city.
If the council finds, upon opening bids for the work of such improvement, that the lowest
responsible bid is fifteen percent in excess of the engineer's estimate, it shall provide for
holding a hearing of objections to proceeding with the improvement on the basis of such
bid, and it shall direct the city recorder to publish one notice thereof in a newspaper of
general circulation in the city. Notice shall state the purpose, date, time and place of
said hearing. After the hearing, the council shall determine whether said bid shall be
accepted or rejected. (Ord. 14-74 § 3 (part), 1974; Ord. 7-74 § 6, 1974.)
12.04.070 Method of assessment and alternative methods of financing.
A. The council, in adopting a method of assessing the cost of the improvement, may:
1. Use any just and reasonable method to determine the extent of an improvement
district consistent with the benefit derived;
2. Use any just and reasonable method of apportioning the sum to be assessed among
the benefited properties;
3. Authorize payment by the city of all or part of the cost of an improvement when in the
opinion of the council the topographical or physical conditions, unusual or excessive
public travel or other character of the work involved warrants only partial payment or no
payment of the cost by the benefited property.
B. Nothing contained in this section shall preclude the council from using other means
of financing improvements, including federal and state grant-in-aid, sewer and/or water
charges or fees, revenue bonds, general obligation bonds or other legal means of
finance. If other means of financing are used, the council may levy special assessments
according to benefits derived to cover any remaining part of the cost.
(Ord. 13-94 § 1 (part), 1994: Ord. 15-75 § 1, 1975: Ord. 7-74 §§ 7, 9, 1974.)
12.04.080 Final assessment ordinance.
A. If the council caused the public improvement to be made and the actual cost has
been determined, upon completion of the project the council shall determine whether
the benefited property shall bear all or a portion of the cost. The actual cost of the
project shall include interim financing costs. The recorder or other person designated by
the council shall prepare the proposed final assessment for each lot within the
assessment district and file the assessments in the recorder's office.
B. Notice of the proposed final assessment shall be published and mailed or personally
delivered to the owner of each lot proposed to be assessed at the address shown on
the Clackamas County tax assessor's rolls. The notice shall state the amount of the
proposed final assessment on the property and fix a date by which time any objections
23
shall be filed with the recorder and the date and time set for the public hearing at which
the council will hear objections. An objection shall state the grounds for the objection.
C. At the hearing the council shall consider the objections and may adopt, correct,
modify or revise the proposed final assessment against each lot in the district according
to special and peculiar benefits accruing to it from the improvement.
(Ord. 13-94 § 1 (part), 1994: Ord. 15-75 § 2, 1975: Ord. 7-74 § 8, 1974.)
12.04.090 Notice of assessment.
A. Within ten days after the ordinance levying final assessments has been passed, the
recorder shall send a notice of final assessment to the owner of the assessed property
by registered or certified mail and publish notice of the assessment twice in a
newspaper of general circulation in the city. The first publication of notice shall be not
later than twenty days after the date of assessment ordinance.
B. The notice of final assessment shall include the name of the property owner, a
description of the assessed property, the amount of the final assessment and the date
of the assessment ordinance and shall state that interest will begin to run on the final
assessment and the property will be subject to foreclosure unless the owner either
makes application to pay the final assessment in installments within ten days after the
date of the first publication of notice or pays the final assessment in full within thirty days
after the date of the assessment ordinance.
(Ord. 13-94 § 1 (part), 1994.)
12.04.100 Lien record and foreclosure proceedings.
A. After passage of the final assessment ordinance, the recorder shall enter into the
docket of liens a statement of the amount assessed on each lot, parcel of land or
portion of land, description of the improvement, names of property owners and the date
of the final assessment ordinance. Upon entry in the lien docket, the amounts shall
become liens and charges on the lots, parcels of land or portions of land that have been
assessed for improvement.
B. Assessment liens of the city shall be superior and prior to all other liens or
encumbrances on property insofar as state law permits.
C. The city may enter a bid on property being offered at a foreclosure sale. The city bid
shall be prior to all bids except those made by persons who would be entitled under
state law to redeem the property.
(Ord. 13-94 § 1 (part), 1994: Ord. 20-80 § 1, 1980: Ord. 6-76 § 1, 1976: Ord. 7-74 § 11,
1974.)
12.04.110 Errors in assessment calculations.
Claimed errors in the calculation of assessments shall be called to the attention of the
recorder, who shall determine whether there has been an error. If there has been an
error, the recorder shall recommend to the council an amendment to the assessment
ordinance to correct the error. On enactment of the amendment, the recorder shall
24
make the necessary correction in the docket of liens and send a correct notice of
assessment by registered or certified mail. (Ord. 13-94 § 1 (part), 1994: Ord. 7-74 § 12,
1974.)
12.04.120 Supplemental assessments.
If a supplemental assessment is required pursuant to Section 12.04.170 of this chapter,
the council may declare the insufficiency by motion and prepare a proposed
supplemental assessment. The council shall set a time for hearing objections to the
supplemental assessment and direct the city recorder to publish one notice in a
newspaper of general circulation in the city. After the hearing, the council shall make a
just and equitable supplemental assessment by ordinance, which shall be entered in the
docket of liens as provided by Section 12.04.100. Notice of the supplemental
assessment shall be published and mailed, and collection of the assessment shall be
made in accordance with Sections 12.04.090 and 12.04.100. (Ord. 13-94 § 1 (part),
1994.)
12.04.130 Rebates.
If a rebate is required pursuant to Section 12.04.170 of this chapter, the council shall
ascertain and declare the excess by ordinance. When declared, the excess amounts
must be entered on the lien docket as a credit on the appropriate assessment. If an
assessment has been paid, the person who paid it or that person's legal representative
shall be entitled to payment of the rebate credit. (Ord. 13-94 § 1 (part), 1994: Ord. 7-74
§ 14, 1974.)
12.04.140 Remedies.
A. Subject to curative provisions of Section 12.04.160 and rights of the city to reassess
as provided in Section 12.04.170, proceedings for writs of review and equitable relief
may be filed not earlier than thirty days nor later than sixty days after filing written
objection as provided by Section 12.04.080.
B. A property owner who has filed a written objection with the recorder before the public
hearing may have the right to apply for a writ of review based on the council's exercising
its functions erroneously or arbitrarily or exceeding its jurisdiction to the injury of a
substantial right of the owner, if the facts supporting the claim have been specifically set
forth in the written objections.
C. A property owner who has filed a written objection with the recorder before the public
hearing may begin an action for equitable relief based on a total lack of jurisdiction on
the part of the city. If notice of the improvement was not sent to the owner and if the
owner did not have actual knowledge of the proposed improvement before the hearing,
the owner may file a written objection alleging lack of jurisdiction with the recorder within
thirty days after receiving notice or knowledge of the improvement.
D. A provision of this section shall not be construed to lengthen the period of
redemption or to affect the running of a statute of limitation. A proceeding on a writ of
review or for equitable relief shall be abated if proceedings are begun and diligently
25
pursued by the council to remedy or cure alleged error or defects.
(Ord. 13-94 § 1 (part), 1994: Ord. 7-74 § 10, 1974.)
12.04.150 Abandonment of proceedings.
The council may abandon proceedings for improvements made under this chapter at
any time before final completion of the improvements. If liens have been placed on
property under this procedure, they shall be canceled, and payments made on
assessments shall be refunded to the person who paid them or to that person's legal
representatives. (Ord. 13-94 § 1 (part), 1994: Ord. 7-74 § 15, 1974.)
12.04.160 Curative provisions.
A. An improvement assessment shall not be rendered invalid by reason of:
1. Failure of the engineer's report to contain all information required by Section
12.04.010;
2. Failure to have all information required in the improvement resolution, assessment
ordinance, lien docket or notices required to be published and mailed;
3. Failure to list the name of or mail notice to an owner of property as required by this
chapter;
4. Any other error, mistake, delay, omission, irregularity or other act, jurisdictional or
otherwise, in the proceedings or steps specified, unless it appears that the assessment
is unfair or unjust in its effect on the person complaining.
B. The council shall have authority to remedy and correct all matters by suitable action
and proceedings.
(Ord. 13-94 § 1 (part), 1994: Ord. 7-74 § 16, 1974.)
12.04.170 Reassessment.
When an assessment, supplemental assessment or reassessment for an improvement
made by the city has been set aside, annulled, declared void, or its enforcement
restrained by a court of this state or by a federal court having jurisdiction, or when the
council doubts the validity of the assessment, supplemental assessment, rebate or any
part of it, the council may make a reassessment in the manner provided by state law.
(Ord. 13-94 § 1 (part), 1994: Ord. 7-74 § 13, 1974.)
12.04.180 Bancroft Act.
The provisions of Oregon Revised Statutes Sections 223.205 through 223.300
commonly known as the "Bancroft Bonding Act," together with amendments or future
amendments thereof, are adopted and made a part hereof by reference. (Ord. 13-94 §
2, 1994; Ord. 7-74 § 17, 1974.)
12.04.190 Segregation of assessments-Fees.
Whenever an application has been made under the provisions of the Bancroft Bonding
26
Act as herein adopted, and the application has been accepted and the payment of the
assessment has been in fact financed by such procedure, the lien of such assessment
may be segregated upon the following terms and conditions:
A. The property for which the segregation is to be made shall have been assessed as a
unit and entered accordingly in the docket of liens;
B. There shall be no delinquent installments of principal or interest on the assessment
of the entire parcel;
C. Written application shall be made to the city in such form as may be required, and
such applications shall be accompanied by the fees established as hereafter provided.
The written application must be submitted by the owner, mortgagee, or lienholder of a
parcel of real property that was formed from the partition or other division of the larger
tract of real property against which the assessment was originally levied. No
apportionment shall be granted unless the applicant filed a true copy of the deed,
mortgage, or instrument creating the new parcel or parcels;
D. Apportionment of the assessment shall be made by the city recorder and approved
by resolution of the city council. In accomplishing apportionment, the installments
remaining unpaid shall be prorated among the smaller parcels so that each parcel shall
be charged with the percentage of the remaining installment payments equal to the
percentage of the unpaid assessment charged to the parcel upon apportionment;
E. In order to help defray the costs of investigation, preparing legal descriptions,
calculating an equitable division of the assessment and making lien docket entries, the
city council may by resolution establish and from time to time amend a schedule of fees
to be paid with any application filed under this section. Such fees shall not be
refundable if the application is disapproved or the applicant withdraws his application.
(Ord. 13-94 § 4, 1994; Ord. 9-84 § 1, 1984.)
Chapter 12.08

If, at the time of application, the applicant indicates to the building official that he desires
to construct a sidewalk in a different location in the sidewalk area than is provided for in
this chapter, the building official shall notify the applicant that the matter may be
presented to the planning commission. If the applicant desires to have the matter
presented to the planning commission, he shall file a request for a variance and the
administrative office shall schedule a public hearing before the planning commission.

of buildings or sidewalks, it would be impractical or undesirable from a planning
viewpoint to require sidewalk to be placed as provided in Sections 12.08.080, 12.08.090
and 12.08.100, the planning commission shall determine that a permit be granted for a
variance. If the planning commission finds that such conditions do not exist, the request
for a variance shall be denied. (Ord. 8-73 § 6, 1973.)
12.08.070 Expense of construction.
All sidewalk, driveway and curb construction pursuant to a permit required by this
chapter shall be made and done at the sole expense of the owner of the property
contiguous to such construction, and such construction shall include the cost of laying
drain pipe in connection with the driveway, and also the reasonable cost and expense of
supervision and inspection by the city. The city shall be held harmless from all such
expenses or any part thereof. Thereafter, such owner shall keep said construction in
good condition and repair. The building official shall have general supervision over
sidewalk construction. (Ord. 8-73 § 7, 1973.)
12.08.080 Sidewalk areas.

12.08.090 Residential sidewalks.
The sidewalk areas in residential districts of the city are designated and established for
the use of the public in the following manner:
A. Except as provided in subsection B of this section, the first five feet in width outward
from the street line or property line is reserved for the use of the city and other utilities in
laying water, sewer, electric, gas and telephone lines, or such other uses as the city
may determine from time to time. Subject to such use, the area shall be available for
pedestrian travel, beautification of surroundings, or such other use by the owner or
occupant of the abutting property as may be authorized by the city. The next five feet in
width of the sidewalk area is reserved as the portion over which shall be constructed
and laid the main walkway for pedestrian travel.
B. In any block where an existing sidewalk does not conform to the requirements of
subsection A of this section, any additional sidewalk constructed along an extension of
the line of such nonconforming sidewalk in the same block shall be aligned with the
existing sidewalk.
(Ord. 8-73 § 9, 1973.)
12.08.100 Commercial zones.
The entire width of the sidewalk area is designated as the area upon which shall be
constructed the main walkway for pedestrian travel, subject, however, to such other
uses, such as planting strips, as may be determined and authorized by the city from
time to time, with the outer six inches being the curb. (Ord. 8-73 § 10, 1973.)
12.08.110 General specifications.

The city council will receive application for advance financing from developers, which

a. The benefiting property owner shall pay advance financed reimbursement calculated
as follows:
b. The total actual cost of the advance financed public improvement, increased by nine
percent annual simple interest, or such other percentage that the city council may, from
time to time, set by resolution, multiplied by a percentage of front footage owned by the

improvement, or by such other methodology as is approved by the city council. Future
interest rate changes shall not apply ex post facto to previously executed
reimbursement agreements.
c. Advance financing reimbursements for odd shaped lots shall be individually
established and consistent with the benefit received by the lot and the reimbursement
required of other lots in the area. If inequities are created through the strict
implementations of the above formulas, the city council may modify its impact on a
case-by-case basis.
C. Collection. The advance financed reimbursement is immediately due and payable by
the benefiting property owners upon their application for connection to an advance
financed water, sanitary sewer or storm sewer system or their connection and use of
advance financed street and sidewalk improvements. If connection is made without the
above-mentioned permits, then the advance financed reimbursement is immediately
due and payable upon the earliest date that any such permit was required, or in the
case of advance financed and street and sidewalk improvements, when connection and
use is commenced. No permit for connection shall be issued until the advance financed
reimbursement is paid in full. Whenever the full and correct advance financed
reimbursement has not been paid and collected for any reason, the city manager shall
report to the city council the amount of the uncollected reimbursement, the description
of the real property to which the reimbursement was due and the name or name of the
benefiting property owners. The city council, by motion, shall then set a public hearing
and shall direct the city manager to give notice of that hearing to each of those
benefiting property owners, together with a copy of the city manager's report concerning
the unpaid reimbursement, either in person or by certified mail. Upon public hearing, the
city council may accept, reject or modify the city manager's report; and if it finds that any
reimbursement is unpaid and uncollected, the city council, by motion, may direct the city
manager to docket the unpaid and uncollected reimbursement in the city record of liens;
and upon completion of the docketing, the city shall have a lien against the described
land for reimbursements, interest and the city's actual cost of serving notice upon the
benefiting property owners. The lien shall be enforced in the manner provided by
Oregon Revised Statutes Chapter 223.

advance financed reimbursements collected by the city pertaining to their advance
financed public improvements. Such reimbursements shall be delivered to the
38
developer for a period of twenty years from and after the date the applicable advance
financing agreement has been executed. Such payments will be made by the city within
ninety days of receipt of the advance financed reimbursements. The city shall incur no
liability for its failure to remit advance financed reimbursements pursuant to the
requirements of this section. (Ord. 19-96 § 1, 1997: Ord. 20-93 § 1 (part), 1993.)

agreement or resolution. (Ord. 20-93 § 1 (part), 1993.)
12.14.120 Advance financed reimbursements on public improvements funded by
the city.
In the event the city is the developer for the construction at its own expense of public
improvements for which advance financing reimbursements are permissible pursuant to
this chapter, the city may, pursuant to the direction of the city council, authorize
advance financing agreements which include terms at variance with the terms otherwise
required by this chapter. The city council may authorize lower interest rates, may permit
installment payments and may extend the time period during which advance financed
reimbursements may be required. (Ord. 20-93 § 1 (part), 1993.)

building permit, shall expire by limitation and become null and void if work authorized by
these permits is not commenced within one hundred twenty days from the date of such
permits, or if the work authorized by such permits is suspended or abandoned at any
time after work is commenced for a period of one hundred twenty days. The applicant or
applicants shall agree to conform to the rules and regulations of the city, now or
hereafter in effect, as a condition for the use of water. (Ord. 38-75 § 1, 1975: Ord. 10-73
§ 2, 1973.)
13.04.020 Application-Inspection of premises.
No application for the use of water shall be granted until the premises where the water
is to be supplied has been examined in person by the public works superintendent.
(Ord. 10-73 § 3, 1973.)
13.04.030 Restriction on water use.
No person supplied with water from the city mains will be entitled to use it for any
purpose other than that stated in his or her application. No user of water will be entitled
to supply water in any way to other persons or families, except upon special written
permit from the city council. (Ord. 10-73 § 4, 1973.)
13.04.040 Connection.
The materials for the connection from the main to and including the curb cock will be
supplied by the city, and said materials, including the meter, shall be and remain the
2
property of the city. All tapping of water mains and pipes shall be done by the public
works superintendent, or under his supervision. The meter shall be placed at the curb
line, or at the property line, at the option of the public works superintendent, and shall
be in a substantial concrete box with a cover, the cost of which box and cover shall be
included in the cost of connection. The city may use such meter as the council may, by
resolution or motion, from time to time provide. Service pipes and connections are those
pipes and connections which bring the water from the main to the property line. All
service pipes and connections shall be laid two feet below the street grade, with the
exception of installation of meters. All service pipes and connections shall be under the
exclusive control of the city council, and no person, other than the public works

service connection to any premises is abandoned or no longer in use, a new service
shall be required, as needed, upon application of the occupant and upon payment for a
new connection in the regular manner. (Ord. 38-75 § 2, 1975: Ord. 10-73 § 5A, 1973.)

All private service pipes from the property line shall be property installed and at all times
maintained in good order by the owner. Outside pipes shall be placed at least two feet
underground, and inside pipes shall be placed or protected so as to prevent freezing.
Just inside the basement a stopcock and waste cock, of approved pattern, protected
from the frost, must in all cases be placed in a convenient location, by means of which
the pipes in the building may be drained when necessary during freezing weather. If the
building is not provided with a basement, a stop and waste cock must be placed near
the outside wall thereof. Additional stop and waste cocks must be placed at sags and
bends in pipes when they cannot otherwise be drained. (Ord. 10-73 § 6, 1973.)
13.04.060 Leaks-Excavation by public works superintendent.
Where there is a leak under the street and it is doubtful whether the water comes from a
break in the city mains or from the private meter, the public works superintendent will
make the excavation to determine which it is from. If the leak is found in the main, the
city will make all repairs free of charge. If the leak is from the meter to the property
served, the owner, lessee or agent will be notified either in person or by letter; it will be

meter provided for each place to be supplied. (Ord. 10-73 § 8, 1973.)
3

Water will not be furnished where there are defective or leaking faucets, closets or other
fixtures, or where there are water closets or urinals without self-closing valves, or tanks
without self-acting float valves, and when such may be discovered the supply may be
shut off. (Ord. 10-73 § 9, 1973.)
13.04.090 Plumber-Prohibited actions.
No plumber or other person will be allowed to make any alteration in any conduit, pipe
or other fixture connecting with the city mains, or to connect pipes when they have been
disconnected, or to turn water off or on the premises without permission from the public
works superintendent. (Ord. 10-73 § 10, 1973.)
13.04.100 Plumber-Report of work done.
Plumbers or persons doing any work by which additional water may be drawn from the
city mains, or by which there is a change in the kind or classification of service used,

water office as soon as completed, or within twenty-four hours thereafter. (Ord. 10-73 §
11, 1973.)
13.04.110 Interrupted service.
The water may at any time be shut off from the mains, without notice, for repairs or
other necessary purposes, and the city will not be responsible for any consequent
damages. Water for steam boilers will not be furnished by direct pressure from the
mains. Tanks for holding an ample reserve supply of water shall always be provided by
the owner of the boiler. While water is temporarily shut off from the mains, the hot-water
faucets should be kept open by the occupant of the premises to allow the steam to
escape from the water heaters, and should damage result to the meter by reason of
steam or hot water, the owner shall be charged for repairs. (Ord. 10-73 § 12, 1973.)
13.04.120 Access.

these reports. (Ord. 10-73 § 14, 1973.)
13.04.140 Records of public works superintendent.
The public works superintendent shall, as a part of his duties, number all premises
where water is furnished by the city, and shall furnish a record of such to the
administrative office. He shall also keep an accurate record of all mains and pipes laid
4
by him or under his direction and belonging to the city, and shall, not oftener than once
a month, if the council so requests, make a written report of the condition of the water
system, or any part thereof, together with such recommendations as the said
superintendent sees fit to include. (Ord. 10-73 § 15, 1973.)
13.04.150 Use of fire hydrants.
It is unlawful for any person to operate, alter, change, remove, disconnect, connect with,
or interfere in any manner with any fire hydrant owned or used by the city without first
obtaining written permission from the city. The provisions of this section shall not apply
to the Sandy Rural Fire Protection District No. 72. (Ord. 10-73 § 16, 1973.)
13.04.160 Fire protection service.
Fire protection pipes to be used in case of fire will be allowed within and without
buildings on the following conditions:
A. When the owner of a building desires, or when the building code calls for a certain
size pipe to supply water to a wet or dry sprinkler system without hose connections,
such pipe or pipes may be covered by an approved proportional meter or a detector
check. The owner or agent of such building shall agree in writing that water supplied
through this service will not be used for any purpose except for extinguishing a fire. If at
any time it is found that those connections have been added to the system or that
registration is recorded on the meter or detector check, the immediate installation of a
compound meter will be required by the city water department.
B. No charge shall be made for water used in the extinguishing of fires if the owner or
agent reports such use to the city water department in writing within ten days of such
usage. A minimum service charge shall be billed each month to the owner or agent of
the property supplied.
(Ord. 10-73 § 17, 1973.)
13.04.170 Use of private water and city water.
Owners of buildings desiring to use both a city water supply and a supply of water other
than that furnished by the city water system may obtain city water at meter rates upon
the following conditions and not otherwise. Under no circumstances shall a physical
connection, direct or indirect, exist or be made in any manner, even temporarily
between the city water supply and that of a private water supply. Where such
connection is found to exist, or where provision is made to connect the two systems by
means of a spacer or otherwise, the city water supply shall be shut off from the
premises without notice. In case of such discontinuance, service shall not be
reestablished until satisfactory proof is furnished that the cross-connection has been
completely and permanently severed. (Ord. 10-73 § 18, 1973.)
13.04.180 Water for building purposes on meter basis.
If the owner or agent of any premises applies for a permanent service and the meter
has been installed, water shall be furnished for building purposes at meter rates, to be
charged against the premises. A charge for water shall be billed to said owner or
5
occupant when the meter registers at least five hundred cubic feet, or as soon as the
building is occupied. (Ord. 10-73 § 19, 1973.)
13.04.190 Ownership, damage and registration of meters.
All meters of the city water system are the property of the city, and any repairs to said
meters shall be made by the city. If a meter is burned out by hot water or damaged by
the carelessness or negligence of the owner or occupant of the premises, the city water
department will repair the meter, and the cost of such repairs shall be charged against
the owner of the property and if not paid within thirty days, shall then become a lien
against said property. When a meter fails to register accurately, the charge shall be
either based on the average quantity of water used, as shown by the meter when in
order, or if there is no such average consumption, then the minimum rate of the city
shall apply. If freezing or snowing weather shall make reading of the meters
impracticable, an estimated reading shall be made by the city water department during
the time such conditions exist. Estimated readings for other just conditions affecting
reading of a meter shall be made only on approval of the water department. (Ord. 10-73
§ 20, 1973.)
13.04.200 Services outside the city.
A. Excess water of the city, as determined by the council, may be served to individual
users, companies or water districts outside the city boundaries, under such rates,
charges and rules as the council may from time to time prescribe, or as outlined under
special contracts. All regulations now or hereafter that affect the users inside the city
shall apply to users outside the city, except as provided by the council. Service to users
outside the city shall at all times be subject to the prior superior right of the people of the
city to said water. The city shall have the right to refuse to sell water to consumers who
do not comply with the requirement of this section.
B. The city may require annexation prior to service extension if such annexation is
practical and in the best interest of the city. If annexation is not required, the owner must
enter into an agreement for future annexation to the city, upon the city's request in an
agreement form, satisfactory to the city attorney. The water service extension will be
installed to city standards. A person or persons requesting service extension will bear all
costs of the extension of the service, including, but not limited to, the cost of public lines
and any oversizing as specified by the public works director. A water service connection
will be provided only for a permitted use as identified in the Clackamas County
Development Code and the City Comprehensive Plan. The extension of water service
facilities shall follow an approved shadow plat design for future extension of
infrastructure for the site, which meets the satisfaction of the city. No service extension
shall conflict with existent natural hazards and/or goals criteria.
(Ord. 5-93 § 1, 1993: Ord. 10-73 § 21, 1973.)

favorable laboratory and field evaluation report by an "approved testing laboratory,"
recommending such approval.
C. "Backflow prevention device (type)" shall mean any approved device used to prevent
backflow into a potable water system. The type of device used should be based on the
degree of hazard either existing or potential.
9
D. "Contamination" shall mean the entry into or presence in a public water supply of any
substance which may be deleterious to health and/or quality of the water.
E. "Cross-connection" shall mean any unprotected actual or potential connection or
structural arrangement between a public or a consumer's potable water system and any
other source or system through which it is possible to introduce into any part of the
potable system any used water, industrial fluid, gas, or substance other than the
intended potable water with which the water, industrial fluid, gas, or substance other
than the intended potable water with which the system is supplied. By-pass
arrangements, jumper connections, removable sections, swivel or changeover devices
and other temporary or permanent devices through which or because of which
"backflow" can or may occur are considered to be cross-connections.

remodeled buildings. (Ord. 9-82 § 1 (part), 1982.)
13.06.040 Use of backflow prevention devices.
A. No water service connection to any premises shall be installed or maintained by the
city unless the water supply is protected as required by state law and regulation and this
chapter. Service of water to any premises shall be discontinued by the city if a backflow
prevention device required by this chapter is not installed, tested and maintained,
or if it is found that a backflow prevention device has been removed, by-passed, or if an
unprotected cross-connection exists on the premises. Service will not be restored until
such conditions or defects are corrected.
B. The customer's system should be open for inspection and tests at all reasonable
times to authorized representatives of the city to determine whether cross-connections
or other structural or sanitary hazards, including violations of these regulations, exist.
When such a condition becomes known, the director shall deny or immediately
discontinue service to the premises by providing for a physical break in the service line
until the customer has corrected the condition(s) in conformance with the state and city
statutes relating to plumbing and water supplies and the regulations adopted pursuant
thereto.
C. An approved backflow prevention device shall also be installed on each service line
to a customer's water system at or near the property line or immediately inside the
building being served; but, in all cases, before the first branch line leading off the
service line.
D. Backflow prevention devices shall be installed under circumstances including but not
limited to the following:
1. Premises having an auxiliary water supply;
11
2. Premises having cross-connections that are not correctable, or intricate planning
arrangements which make it impractical to ascertain whether or not cross-connections
exist;
3. Premises where entry is restricted so that inspections for cross-connections cannot
be made with sufficient frequency or at sufficiently short notice to assure that crossconnections
do not exist;
4. Premises having a history of cross- connections being established or reestablished;
5. Premises on which any substance is handled under pressure so as to permit entry
into the public water supply, or where a cross-connection could reasonably be expected
to occur. This shall include the handling of process waters and cooling waters;
6. Premises where materials of a toxic or hazardous nature are handled in such a way
that if back siphonage should occur, a serious health hazard might result;
7. The following types of facilities will fall into one of the above categories where a
backflow prevention device is required to protect the public water supply. A backflow
prevention device shall be installed at these facilities unless the city determines that no
hazard exists:
a. Hospitals, mortuaries, clinics,
b. Laboratories,
c. Metal plating industries,
d. Piers and docks,

h. Petroleum processing or storage plants,
i. Radioactive material processing plants or nuclear reactors,
j. Facilities with fire service lines as specified by Oregon State Health Division,
k. Others specified by the city.
E. The type of protective device required shall depend on the degree of hazard which
exists:
12
1. An air-gap separation or a reduced- pressure-principle backflow prevention device
shall be installed where the public water supply may be contaminated with sewage,
industrial waste of a toxic nature, or other contaminant which could cause a health or
system hazard.
2. In the case of a substance which may be objectionable but not hazardous to health, a
double check valve assembly, air-gap separation, or a reduced-pressure- principle
backflow prevention device shall be installed.
F. Backflow prevention devices required by this chapter shall be installed under the
supervision, and with the approval, of the city.
G. Any protective device required by this chapter shall be approved by the director.
H. These devices shall be furnished and installed by and at the expense of the
customer.
I. It shall be the duty of the customer-user at any premises where backflow prevention
devices are installed to have certified inspections and operational tests made at least
once per year. In those instances where the director deems the hazard to be great
enough, he may require certified inspections at more frequent intervals. These
inspections and tests shall be at the expense of the water user and shall be performed
by a certified tester approved by the director. It shall be the duty of the director to see
that these timely tests are made. The customer-user shall notify the director in advance
when the tests are to be undertaken so that the director or a representative may witness
the tests if so desired. These devices shall be repaired, overhauled or replaced at the
expense of the customer-user whenever said devices are found to be defective.
Records of such tests, repairs and overhaul shall be kept and copies sent to the
director.
J. No underground sprinkling device will be installed without adequate backflow
prevention devices.
K. Failure of the customer to cooperate in the installation, maintenance, testing or
inspection of backflow prevention devices required by this chapter or by state law shall
be grounds for the termination of water service to the premises.

facilities where it is reasonable to anticipate intermittent cross-connections, or as
determined by the director, shall be protected by the installation of one or more
13
backflow prevention devices at the point of service from the public water supply or any
other location designated by the city.
C. Inspections shall be made at the discretion of the director of all buildings, structures,
or improvements for the purpose of ascertaining whether cross-connections exist. Such
inspections shall be made by the city.
(Ord. 9-82 § 1 (part), 1982.)
13.06.060 Liability.
This chapter shall not be construed to hold the city responsible for any damage to
persons or property by reason of the inspection or testing herein, or the failure to
inspect or test or by reason of approval of any cross-connections. (Ord. 9-82 § 1 (part),
1982.)
13.06.070 Penalties.
Any person who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects, refuses to comply with, or resists
the enforcement of any of the provisions of this chapter or the rules and regulations as

subject to this ordinance, shall provide sufficient management of post-development
runoff from the 2-year, 5-year 10-year, and 25-year frequency storms such that the
discharge rates of post-development storm water runoff do not exceed the predevelopment
rates. In certain cases, depending on the capacity of downstream
drainage facilities, (or in cases where the storm drainage system receiving runoff from
the site is only designed to accept street runoff only), a higher standard of retention
and/or detention may be required by the City.
13.18.30 Area of application.
A. Exemptions:
1. Developments such as subdivisions of planned unit developments with city-approved
storm water management systems that meet the standards of this ordinance.
2 Single-family dwellings on legal lots of record
28
3. Areas of the city, as determined by the director, where flow control is not needed or
desirable.
Water quality treatment facilities may be required for land use developments, under any of
the following conditions.
A. Any portion of the development site is within the FSH overlay district.
B The development may otherwise cause significant degradation of water quality in the
receiving stream as a result of erosion, sedimentation or transport of water-born pollutants
without detention or treatment.
C. The development site has an existing or proposed impervious surface area greater than
5,000 square feet.
D. The development involves impervious parking or storage areas, fuel storage or
dispensing areas; vehicle storage, wash, maintenance or dismantling areas; or
mechanical equipment storage or maintenance areas.
E. The development involves site expansion.
F. Infiltration is proposed for storm water management.
13.18.40 Acceptable storm water quality facilities.
The following storm water quality treatment methods and facilities are acceptable to the
City:
A. Detention and sedimentation: Detention of storm water runoff allows for the
settling of fine particles and sediment, and the pollutants associated with these
particles.
B. Filtration: Filtration of storm water is provided by flowing water through various
types of media, such as vegetation, sand or synthetic materials, which absorb and filter
out pollutants.
C. Retention/Infiltration: Retention or infiltration facilities allow for temporary storage
and disposal of storm water by allowing the water to percolate into the ground.
D. Oil and Water Separation: Various types of commercially-available oil and water
separators that use sedimentation, separate chambers, baffles, plates and or physicalchemical
processes to separate water from oil products.
Different types of storm water facilities can be combined to meet the performance
standard. Other storm water quality facilities not included in the above list may be
approved by the city engineer. Design and performance criteria for acceptable storm
29
water quality facilities are contained in Storm water Management Manual, City of
Portland, (September, 2002).
13.18.50 General design standards.
A. The location of the facility shall be consistent with applicable standards of the
Sandy Development Code.
B. The facility shall be designed by a registered Professional Engineer.
C. On-site or off-site storm water management facilities shall be located as close as is
practicable to the development, and storm water management facilities shall avoid a
negative impact on nearby streams, wetlands, groundwater, and other water bodies.
D. Direct storm water discharges to stream channels, seasonal drainages and active
waterways are to be avoided. Where soil conditions permit and where runoff velocities
and erosive forces can be minimized or eliminated storm water discharges should travel
overland to take maximum advantage of infiltration opportunities.
E. All local, state, and federal permit requirements related to implementation of storm
water management facilities must be met by the owner/operator prior to facility use.
F. Discharges from on-site facilities shall be conveyed via an approved drainage facility
or storm water conveyance.
G The quality of storm water leaving the site after development shall be equal to or
better than the quality of storm water leaving the site before development, to the
maximum extent practicable, based on the following criteria:
1. Water quality control facilities required for development shall be designed, installed
and maintained in accordance with the Storm water Management Manual, which is
based on achieving at least 70% removal of the Total Suspended Solids (TSS) from the
flow entering the facility for the design storm specified in the Storm water Management
Manual.
2 Land use activities that may be pollution sources shall be required to implement
additional Best Management Practices for pollution control, including but not limited to,
those management practices specified in the Storm water Management Manual.
3. Facilities shall be designed to safely conduct the less frequent, higher flows through
or around facilities without damage to the facilities.
4. Storm water for any parcel created after the effective date of this Chapter shall be
fully treated on-site or within the original parcel from which the new parcel was created,
or in a privately developed off-site facility with sufficient capacity, as determined by the
City.
30
13.18.60 Storm water quality treatment performance standard.
All developments shall treat 80 percent of the average annual volume of storm water
runoff for the site. This standard can be met by installing storm water quality treatment
facilities to satisfy the following design criteria:
A. Detention based storm water quality control: The required design volume for
detention-based control is equal to the entire runoff volume that would occur from a site
with a 1.2inch, 12-hour storm. The draw-down time for the entire volume must be
greater than or equal to 48 hours. For the lower half of the detention volume, the drawdown
time must be greater than 36 hours. Additional design criteria for inlet and outlet
spacing and design, as well as guidelines for calculating volumes, are contained in the
Public Works Department Standards.
B. Flow-through based storm water quality control: the required design flow rate for
treatment is the runoff that would be produced from a rainfall intensity of 0.2 inches/hour
for on-line facilities, and 0.11 inches/hour for off-line facilities. This rate must be
maintainable for a minimum of three hours. Additional design criteria for flow calculation,
as well as specific treatment criteria for various types of storm water facilities (e.g.,
infiltration and storm water filters), are contained in the Public Works Standards.
C. Combination detention based on flow-through based storm water quality control:
Detention facilities may be combined with flow-through facilities. The applicant must
demonstrate that the combined system could sufficiently treat storm water runoff for the
runoff produced by the flow-through treatment rates of 0.2 inches/hour (on-line
facilities), occurring for a three-hour period.
Storm water quality facilities selected for the site shall be appropriate to treat expected
storm water pollutants based on the intended use of the site under full build-out
conditions.
13.18.70 Pretreatment for storm water infiltration systems.
When proposed for use as a storm water quality facility, infiltration systems shall include
appropriate pretreatment to remove pollutants expected from the intended use of the
site under full build-out conditions.
13.18.80 Review procedures.
Review of storm water management plans is not a limited land use decision and shall be
processed in the same manner as a building permit.
13.18.90 Approval or denial of storm water management plan.
After receipt of a complete storm water management plan, the director may order a
technical review of the plan by a qualified professional consultant- selected by the City.
The cost of any such review shall be borne by the applicant.
31
A. Following completion of the technical review of the plan, the director shall:
1. Approve the application and indicate on the plans in writing if the plan as submitted
conforms to the applicable technical guidelines. The City of Portland Storm water
Management Manual shall be the recognized authority; or
2. Return the plan to the applicant for required revisions.
B. The approved plan shall not be changed, modified, or altered without authorization
room the director and shall be constructed as planned.
1. Such approval shall be a condition of subdivision or site plan approval.
13.18.100 Submission requirements.
The application shall provide sufficient information to evaluate the applicants intent to
include on-site storm water quality controls in order to reduce or eliminate the discharge
of sediments and other storm water pollutants to the storm sewer or natural drainage

home court, park or subdivision".
35
H. Multiple-family unit (MFU) shall be as defined in SMC 17.10.30 B (6) as a "Multi-
Family Dwelling ".
I. Open Drainage way shall mean a natural or constructed path, ditch or channel which
has the specific function of transmitting natural stream water or storm water from a point
of higher elevation to a point of lower elevation.
J. Person responsible shall mean the owner, agent, occupant, lessee, tenant, contract
purchaser or other person having possession or control of property or the supervision of
an improvement on the property.
K. Runoff Control shall mean any measure approved by the Director that reduces storm
water runoff from land surfaces on which development exists.
L. Single Family Dwelling (SFD) shall be as defined in SMC 17.10.30 B (1) as "dwelling,

2,750 square feet of impervious surface area for purposes of this chapter. The term
SFD shall be inclusive of those units identified as detached single-family residences,
(attached, detached, zero-lot line), unit ownerships, and condominiums, and etc.
M. Storm Drainage Facilities shall mean any structure(s) or configuration of the ground
that is used or by its location becomes a place where storm water flows or is
accumulated including, but not limited to, pipes, sewers, gutters, manholes, catch
basins, ponds, open drainage-ways and their appurtenances. Tickle Creek, No-Name
Creek, their tributaries and creeks excluded by action of the Council are not storm
drainage facilities.
N. Stormwater shall mean water from precipitation, surface or subterranean water from
any source, drainage and non-septic waste water.
13.20.030 Findings
A. The City provides a valuable public service by providing storm drainage facilities for
the collection and disposal of storm water discharged from properties and public rightof-
ways within the City. The storm drainage facilities constitute a public utility owned
and operated by the City. The utility exists for the benefit of any person within the City
who desires public storm drainage facilities available for the diversion, collection and/or
disposal of storm drainage and other runoff water from the person's property and
represents a municipal service in a developed urban environment which is essential to
the public health, safety and welfare.
B. Persons who use the public storm drainage facilities ought to be charged fees that
reflect the costs of the use relative to the management, maintenance, extension and
construction of the public storm drainage facility as a public utility in the City.
C. Accordingly, the structure of the storm drainage utility is intended to be a fee for
service and not a charge against property. Although this structure is intended to
36
constitute a service fee, even if it is viewed as a fee against property or against the
person responsible, as a direct consequence of ownership of that property, the utility's
fee structure should allow the person responsible to have the ability to control the
amount of the fee. Similarly, the utility fee structure should reflect the actual cost of
providing the service. The actual costs ma3y include all costs the utility might incur were
it in private ownership.
D. Persons using water from the City potable water facilities use substantial amounts of
water for irrigating lawns and gardens, washing structures, sidewalks, driveways and
parking lots, and for other activities which result in the discharge of runoff into the public
storm drainage facilities. These uses of water demonstrate a substantial relationship
between persons' use of these water facilities and their use of the public storm drainage
facilities.
13.20.040 Stormwater management policies
A. The City shall maintain public storm drainage facilities located on City property, City
right-of-way or City easements. Public storm drainage facilities to be managed by the
City include, but are not limited to;
1. Open drainageways, swales and detention ponds when located on City property, City
right-of-way or City easement;
2. Piped drainage systems and related appurtenances which have been designed and
constructed expressly for use by the general public and accepted by the Director;
3. Roadside drainage ditches and swales along improved and unimproved City streets;
4. Flood control facilities (levees, dikes, overflow channels, detention basins, retention
basins, dams, pump stations, groundwater recharging basins, etc.) that have been
designed and constructed expressly for use by the general public and accepted by the
City.
5. Stormwater management, conveyance, treatment and detention facilities serving
multiple single-family residences under separate ownership.
B. Storm drainage facilities not to be maintained by the City include, but are not limited
to:
1. Stormwater management facilities not located on City property, City right-of-way, or
City easement;
2. Private parking lot stormwater management facilities;
3. Roof, footing, and area drains;
37
4. Stormwater management facilities not designed and constructed for use by the
general public;
5. Driveway approach culverts;
6. Stormwater management, conveyance, treatment and detention facilities serving
sites under single ownership.
13.20.050 Establishment of a stormwater utility fee.
There is established a stormwater utility fee to be paid by the account holder for each
developed property within the corporate limits of the city. Such fee shall not be imposed
in amounts greater than that which is necessary, in the judgment of the council, to
provide sufficient funds to properly acquire, construct, equip, operate, maintain and
repair the citys storm sewer systems. Fees for users shall be based upon impervious
surface area and individual mitigation efforts, if any. The council, by resolution, shall
establish the amount and effective date of the fee and may, from time to time, by
resolution change the amount of the fee.
13.20.060 Use of stormwater utility fee.
There is established a stormwater fund, and all stormwater utility fees collected by the
city shall be paid into the fund. Such revenues shall be used for the acquisition,
construction, operation, maintenance and repair (including renewal, replacement and
improvement) of the citys stormwater management system. To the extent that the fees
collected may not be sufficient to properly meet the expenses of the stormwater
management system, the cost of same may be paid from other city funds as may be
determined by the council, but the council may order the reimbursement to such fund if
additional stormwater utility funds are collected thereafter. The fees collected by virtue
of this chapter shall not be used for general or other governmental purposes of the city
except to pay for the equitable share of the cost of accounting, management and other
administrative costs attributable to the stormwater management system.
13.20.070 Calculation of stormwater utility fee.
A. The amount of the monthly stormwater utility fee shall be determined by resolution
approved by the council based upon the amount of impervious surface per location.
B. All single-family residential users shall be deemed to have two thousand seven
hundred fifty square feet of impervious surface area.
C. Whenever a non-single-family residential stormwater utility customer takes measures
to mitigate the effect of storm water flow from the impervious surface of their site, the
public works director, shall upon written request determine the percent of impervious
surface which has been reduced, eliminated or mitigated and a proportional reduction in
the stormwater utility fee shall be made, but in no event shall the fee be reduced more
than thirty-three percent.
38
D. The stormwater utility fee shall not be imposed on impervious surfaces of a public
street, road or highway.
13.20.080 Initiation of utility service.
Utility service will not be initiated for a new account, for a new account holder, or for the
reinstatement of an existing account in which service has been terminated, without a
written request from the account holder providing information deemed necessary by the
finance director and the payment of a deposit, if any, in an amount and under terms and
conditions determined by the council.
13.20.090 Billings and collection.
A. The stormwater utility fee shall be billed and collected with the monthly city utility bill.
B. Stormwater utility fees as hereinbefore provided shall be collected monthly and if not
paid on or before thirty days after the date of billing, said charges shall be deemed to be
delinquent.
C. The collection of service charges when delinquent and enforcement of payment
thereof may be accomplished by withholding the delivery of water to any premises or
occupant served by the stormwater management system when such a delinquency as
defined in subsection B of this section exists.
D. Any charge due hereunder which is not paid when due may be recovered from the
account holder in an action at law by the city.
E. The stormwater utility fee shall be due when the account holder receives service from
the stormwater management system.
F. For purposes of this section any site with impervious surface coverage is considered
to be served by the stormwater management system
13.20.100 Administration.
A. The public works director shall be responsible for the administration of this chapter
(except for the billing and collection of funds), to include the development of
administrative procedures, maintenance programs, capital improvements, operations
and maintenance standards, and related activities.
B. The finance director shall be responsible for the billing and collection of funds.
13.20.110 Violations.
A. Any customer that violates any of the provisions in this chapter shall be subject to an
enforcement action using any of the remedies and sanctions that are authorized in this
chapter or state law. The director shall determine which enforcement action to take to
address the violation.
B. When the director finds that a customer has violated or continues to violate any
provision of this chapter, a stormwater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or
39
any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the director may serve upon that
customer a written notice of violation. Within ten days of the receipt of this notice, an
explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention
thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the customer to the
director. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the customer of liability for any
violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this
section shall limit the authority of the city to take any action, including emergency
actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation.

15.04.110 Plans and permits.
A. Issuance. The building official shall review the application, plans, specifications,
5
computations and other data filed by an applicant for a permit. Such plans may be
reviewed by other city of Sandy departments to verify compliance with any applicable
laws under their jurisdiction. If the building official finds that the work described in
application for a permit and the plans, specifications, and other data filed therewith
conform to the requirements of this code and other pertinent laws and ordinances, and
that the fees have been paid, the building official shall issue a permit therefore to the
applicant. When the building official issues the permit where plans are required, the
building official shall enforce in writing or stamp the plans and specifications
"REVIEWED." Such reviewed plans and specifications shall not be changed, modified
or altered without authorization from the building official, and all work regulated by this
code shall be done in accordance with the reviewed plans. The building official may
issue a permit for the construction of part of a building or structure before the entire
plans and specifications for the whole building or structure have been submitted or
reviewed, provided adequate information and detailed statements have been filed
complying with all pertinent requirements of this code. The holder of a partial permit
shall proceed without assurance that the permit for the entire building or structure will be
granted.
B. Retention of Plans. One set of reviewed plans, specifications and computations shall
be retained by the building official for a period of not less than ninety days from date of
completion of the work covered therein, and one set of reviewed plans and
specifications shall be returned to the applicant, with said set being kept at the site of
the building or work at all times during which the work authorized thereby is in progress.
C. Validity of Permit. The issuance or granting of a permit or approval of plans,
specifications and computations shall not be construed to be a permit for, or an
approval of, any violation of any of the provisions of this code or of any other ordinance
of the jurisdiction or any other federal, state or local law, statute, rule, regulation or
ordinance. The issuance of a permit based on plans, specifications and other data shall
not prevent the building official from thereafter requiring the correction of errors in such
plans, specifications and other data, or from preventing building operations being
carried on thereunder when in violation of this code or any other ordinances of the city
of Sandy.
D. Expiration of Plan Reviews. Applications for which no permit is issued within one
hundred eighty days following the date of the application shall expire by limitation, and
plans and other data submitted for review may thereafter be returned to the applicant or
destroyed by the building official. The building official may extend the time for action by
the applicant for a period not exceeding one hundred eighty days on request by the
applicant showing that circumstances beyond the control of the applicant have
prevented action from being taken. No application shall be extended more than once. In
order to renew action on an application after expiration, the applicant shall resubmit
plans and pay a new plan review fee.
E. Permit Expiration, Extension and Reinstatement. Every permit issued by the building
official under the provisions of this code shall expire by limitation and become null and
6
void if the building and/or work authorized is not commenced within the time limitations
set forth in this section. Every permit issued by the building official shall expire by
limitation and become null and void if the building or work authorized by such permit is
not commenced within one hundred eighty days from the date of permit, or if the
building or work authorized by such permit is suspended or abandoned at any time after
the work is commenced for a period of one hundred eighty days. The work shall not be
considered suspended or abandoned where the permittee has pursued activities
deemed by the building official to indicate the intent to start and complete the project.
The building official may require the permittee to document these activities. Every
permit issued by the building official shall expire by limitation and become null and void
twenty-four months after the date of permit issuance. If the building or work authorized
by such permit has not received final inspection approval prior to the permit expiration
date, all work shall stop until a new permit is obtained for the value of the work
remaining unfinished. Exception: At the time of permit issuance, the building official may
approve a period exceeding twenty-four months for completion of work when the
permittee can demonstrate that the complexity or size of the project makes completing
the project within twenty-four months unreasonable. Any permittee holding an unexpired
permit may apply for an extension of the time within which work is to be completed
under that permit when the permittee is unable to complete work within the time
required by this section for good and satisfactory reasons. The building official may
extend the time for action by the permittee for a period not exceeding one hundred
eighty days or written request by the permittee showing that circumstances beyond the
control of the permittee have prevented work from being completed. No permit shall be
extended more than once. When a permit has expired, the permit can be reinstated and
the work authorized by the original permit can be recommended, provided the following
are met:
1. The building code under which the original permit was issued and other laws that are
enforced by the building official have not been amended in any manner, which affects
the work authorized by the original permit;
2. No charges have been made or will be made in the original plans and specifications
for such work;
3. The original permit expired less than one year from the request to reinstate;
4. The fee for a reinstated permit shall be one-half the amount required for a new
permit. Where the request for reinstatement does not comply with the preceding criteria,
a new permit, at full permit fees, shall be required.
F. Work without a Permit/Investigation Fees. Whenever any work for which a permit is
required by this code has been commenced without first obtaining such permit, a
special investigation shall be made before a permit may be issued for such work. An
investigation fee, in addition to the permit fee, may be collected whether or not a permit
is then or subsequently issued. The payment of such investigation fee shall not exempt
7
any person from compliance with all other provisions of this code nor from any penalty
prescribed by law.
G. Not Transferable. A permit issued to one person or firm is not transferable and shall
not permit any other person or firm to perform any work thereunder.
H. Suspension/Revocation. The building official may, in writing, suspend or revoke a
permit issued under the provisions of this code whenever the permit is issued in error on
the basis of incorrect information supplied, or if its issuance (or activity thereunder) is in
violation of any ordinance or regulation of any other provisions of the city code.
I. Inspections. It shall be the duty of the permit holder or authorized agent to request all
inspections that may be necessary or otherwise required in a timely manner, provide
access to the site, and to provide all equipment as may be deemed necessary or
appropriate by the building official. The permit holder shall not proceed with construction
activity until authorized to do so by the building official. It shall be the duty of the permit
holder to cause the work to remain accessible and exposed for inspection purposes.
Any expenses incurred by the permit holder to remove or replace any material
requested for proper inspection shall be the responsibility of the permit holder or his
agent. Work requiring a permit shall not be commenced until the permit holder has
posted or otherwise made available an inspection record card such as to allow the
building official to conveniently make the required entries thereon regarding inspection
of the work. This card shall be maintained available by the permit holder under final
approval has been granted by the building official.

Chapter 15.10
DERELICT BUILDINGS AND STRUCTURES
15.10.010 Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to establish an enforcement program to address the
problem of derelict, abandoned, and vacant buildings or structures within the City in
order to protect the public health, safety, and welfare of the community through the
required maintenance of unkempt, unsightly, unsafe, unsanitary, and otherwise
improperly maintained structures.
The program is intended to protect the City from blight, deterioration, and decay as a
result of properties in a condition or state that potentially would have an adverse effect
on the value, utility, and habitability of property within the City. In addition to the obvious
hazards which these conditions pose to the public health, safety, and welfare, they
specifically cause damage to adjoining and nearby properties. A property which is
20
merely unkempt or vacant for long periods may reduce the value of adjoining and
nearby property, and the habitability and economic well-being of the City may be
materially and adversely affected.
The goals of this chapter are as follows:
A. To supplement the City Nuisance Ordinance and further define as public nuisances
those conditions which constitute visual blight and which could result in conditions
which are harmful or deleterious to the public health, safety and welfare; and
B. To develop regulations that will promote the sound maintenance of buildings and
structures, enhance the livability, community appearance, and the social, economic,
and environmental conditions of the community; and
C. To establish guidelines for the correction of property maintenance violations and
nuisances that afford due process and procedural guarantees to affected property
owners; and
D. To support responsible environmental practices with the repair and reuse of existing
structures in lieu of demolition of buildings that are able to be repaired.
15.10.020 Administration.
A. Determination of whether a building or property is in violation of this chapter shall
be made by the Planning Director (Director), or the Directors designee. The
Director should consult with the Building Official, Fire Marshal, Public Health
Officer, or any other agency as necessary, before making the determination to bring
the matter before the City Council subcommittee.
1. For a violation to have occurred under this chapter, a combination of at least
two building maintenance standards specified shall be out of compliance.
2. Prior to proceeding with a notice of violation, the Directors determination shall
be reviewed by a City Council subcommittee. If a majority of the subcommittee
agrees with the Directors determination, the Director will issue the notice of
violation to the owner or person in charge of the property. For the purposes of
this chapter, the term person in charge of property has the meaning defined in

permits and requirements in accordance with the Oregon Structural Specialty Code.

investigate and/or cause the removal of a nuisance.

15.10.080 Procedure for enforcement.
The following are the general steps that should be conducted in the enforcement of
derelict buildings as noted in the City Code. These procedures are intended as a
guideline and strict adherence to this process is not required. Time lines may be
shortened or lengthened depending on individual circumstances. These procedures do
not prevent the use of other methods of enforcement that may be available to the City.
A. Possible nuisance is identified by staff or through a complaint. Complaints may be
made anonymously.
B. Staff verifies that the nuisance exists and is a violation. Staff identifies property
owner, person in charge, and/or person responsible for the violation.
C. City Council subcommittee evaluates the Directors determination to rule if the
nuisance exists and is a violation. If a majority of the subcommittee decides that a
nuisance does not exist, then the Director will note that decision for the file and take
no further action on the matter.
D. If a majority of the subcommittee determines a nuisance does exist, the Director
shall cause a notice to be posted on the premises where the nuisance exists and
send a notice of violation by regular mail to the property owner or others advising of
the nuisance, citing code that is in violation, and the options for completing the work.
Staff provides the two options for rectifying the nuisance, rehabilitation or
abatement.
E. If the property owner submits a rehabilitation plan then the steps in Section
15.10.100 for Rehabilitation Procedure shall be followed.
F. If the property owner does not submit a rehabilitation plan then after two weeks,
staff verifies if the nuisance still exists. If a nuisance does not exist, the Director
will note that fact for the file and take no further action on the matter.
G. If nuisance persists, a second notice of violation is sent by regular and certified mail
with due date of additional two weeks, and advise of possible fines.
H. After two weeks, staff verifies if nuisance still exists. If nuisance does not exist, the
Director will note that fact for the file and take no further action on the matter.
I. If nuisance still exists, staff issues a citation with a possible fine up to $500.00 per
day, mandatory appearance in Municipal Court, or initiates the abatement process.
J. Each day the nuisance persists is a separate violation.
K. If nuisance still exists after fines and court, City can abate it and lien the property
for all of its costs incurred to abate the nuisance, including but not limited to
attorney fees, and/or continue with other methods of enforcement available to the
26
city.

Various Lamps). Area lights include, but are not limited to, street lights, parking lot lights
and yard lights.
Automatic timing device: A device that automatically controls the operation of a light
fixture or fixtures, circuit or circuits. Photocells and light and or motion sensors shall be
considered automatic-timing devices
Average Foot-candle: The level of light measured at an average point of illumination
between the brightest and darkest areas. The measurement can be made at the ground
surface or at four to five feet above the ground.
Bulb: The source of electric light. To be distinguished from the whole assembly (See
Luminaire).
Candela (cd): Unit of luminous intensity.
Eighty-five (85) Degree Full Cut-Off Type Fixtures: Fixtures that do not allow light to
escape above an 85-degree angle measured from a vertical line from the center of the
lamp extended to the ground.
Exterior Lighting: Temporary or permanent lighting that is installed, located or used in
such a manner to cause light rays to shine outside. Fixtures that are installed indoors
that are intended to light something outside are considered exterior lighting for the intent
of this Ordinance.
Fixture: The assembly that holds the lamp in a lighting system. It includes the elements
designed to give light output control, such as a reflector (mirror) or refractor (lens), the
ballast, housing, and the attachment parts.
Flood Light: Light that produces up to 1800 lumens (See Addendum 1 for Light Output
of Various Lamps) and is designed to "flood" a well-defined area with light. Generally,
floodlights produce from 1000 to 1800 lumens.
Foot-candle: Illuminance produced on a surface one foot from a uniform point source
of one candela. Measured by a light meter.
48
Full cutoff fixture: A fixture which, as installed, gives no emission of light above a
horizontal plane.
Glare: Intense light that results in discomfort and/or a reduction of visual performance
and visibility.
Holiday Lighting: Festoon type lights, limited to small individual bulbs on a string,
where the output per bulb is no greater than 15 lumens.

HID lighting.
Lamp or Bulb: The light-producing source installed in the socket portion of a luminaire.
Light Pollution: Any adverse effect of manmade light including, but not limited to, light
trespass, up lighting, the uncomfortable distraction to the eye, or any manmade light
that diminishes the ability to view the night sky. Often used to denote urban sky glow.
Light trespass: Light emitted by a luminaire falls where it is not wanted or needed or
shines beyond the property on which the luminaire is installed.
49
Lighting: Any or all parts of a luminaire that function to produce light.
Lumen: Unit of luminous flux; the flux emitted within a unit solid angle by a point source
with a uniform luminous intensity of one candela. One foot-candle is one lumen per
square foot. One lux is one lumen per square meter.
Luminaire: The complete lighting unit, including the lamp, the fixture, and other parts.
Luminance: At a point and in a given direction, the luminous intensity in the given
direction produced by an element of the surface surrounding the point divided by the

the visual effect of the illuminance, reflected, emitted or transmitted from a surface.
Measurement:
1. Lamp output
a. Total output: Measurement of total output is in lumens. This should be understood to
be the initial lumen value for the lamp.
b. Illuminance: Measurements of illuminance are expressed in initial lumens per square
foot. (A desktop illuminance of twenty (20) initial lumens per square foot is adequate
for most purposes.)
In measuring illuminance, the light detector should be pointed directly at the light source
or sources. The intervening light path should be free of obstruction.

15.32.010 Purpose and policy.
The sign regulations are intended to serve the community by:
A. Requiring sound construction, by requiring that signs be maintained, and by limiting
the number of visual images to be communicated;
B. Providing an equitable opportunity to use signs outside of public rights-of-way as a
communication medium;
C. Providing standards for frequency, location, size, construction, type and number of
signs;
57
D. Providing reasonable limits on the magnitude and extent of graphic communication
presented to the public; and
E. Regulating the location and quantity of temporary signs, and the circumstances
under which they may be used and encourage all businesses to utilize permanent signs
to the maximum extent possible and not rely on temporary signs for advertising needs.
F. Expressing elements of or reflecting Cascadian architecture by adapting elements of
the Sandy Style into new signs.
15.32.020 Signs permitted only in commercial & industrial zones
Permits are required for these signs.
A. Sign Lighting. Backlit (i.e., internally illuminated) signs are prohibited in the C-1
zone. Panels for existing backlit signs in the C-1 zone may be replaced as long as the
new panel provides light lettering and/or graphics on a dark background (see sample
photo, below).
B. Wall signs.
1. Sign size (area): Up to 10% of the gross wall area of each wall, including windows.
Businesses with less than 250 ft2 of wall area may have a 25 ft2 sign. A building with
frontage on two or more streets shall be permitted wall signs on each frontage.
2. Maximum area: 200 ft2 in the C-1 zoning district; no limit other zones.
3. Multiple uses: the permitted sign area for uses located on the same site or within the
same building may be divided among the uses. Separate wall signs or a joint-use wall
sign may be erected, provided that the maximum allowable sign area is not exceeded.
4. Maximum sign projection: 18 inches.
C. Projecting signs. A "projecting sign" is a sign attached to and projecting out from a
building face or wall and generally at right angles to the building (see sample photo
below). Projecting signs include signs projecting totally in the right-of-way, partially in
the right-of-way, and fully on private property.
1. Maximum area on one sign face: 32 ft2.
2. Height: shall not exceed the height of the structure.
3. Clearance: 8 feet above pedestrian walkways; 15 feet above vehicular driveways
and public rights-of-way. Clearance is measured from the highest point of the grade
below the sign to the lowermost point of the sign.
58
4. Projection distance: no more than 8 feet from the building, or two-thirds the width of
the sidewalk, whichever is less. In any case, the sign shall not project within 2 feet of
the curb.
5. Hanging signs under awnings are encouraged, as long as the above clearances are
met. (See sample photo below.)
6. Marquee, canopy and awning signs are permitted and must comply with the State
Structural Specialty Code and city regulations.
a) Marquee signs may be placed on or incorporated into these structures provided they

incorporated into, erected or maintained under, supported by or attached to a marquee
or permanent canopy. "Marquee" means a permanent roof-like or roofed structure
attached to, supported by and projecting outward from a building over the entrance to a
theater, hotel, etc.
b) As used here, "awning" means a movable shelter supported entirely from the exterior
wall of a building extending over a doorway or window and providing shelter from the
rain or sun. When signs are incorporated into awnings the entire panel containing the
sign is counted as sign face unless it is clear that part of the panel contains no related
display or decoration. Awning signs are considered as wall signs for calculation of the
maximum permitted area.
D. Individual business--freestanding signs. A freestanding sign is a sign on a frame,
pole or other support structure which is not attached to any building. A monument sign
is a type of freestanding sign. (See sample photo below.)

OBLIGATIONS OF BUILDERS AND LAND DIVIDERS
TO CLEAN UP SIDEWALKS AND ROADWAYS
15.35.010 Responsibility designated.
Any applicant for a building permit and any land divider as defined in Chapter 16.08 of
this code shall be solely responsible for cleanup of debris, dirt and foreign materials
derived from their development or project upon sidewalks and roadways. Responsibility
shall also apply in the same manner to deposits of the aforesaid material on adjacent
lots or parcels when such deposits are determined to be a nuisance. The responsibility
for building permit applicants shall continue until the building or structure for which the
building permit was issued receives a certificate of occupancy from the city. The
responsibility of the land divider shall continue until such time as all required
improvements within the subdivision or partition have been inspected and finally
approved by the city. The building permit applicant and the land divider shall be
responsible for cleaning all debris, dirt or foreign materials upon the sidewalks,
roadways and adjacent lots; except that if the debris, dirt or foreign material is founded
by the city manager to constitute an immediate traffic or safety hazard, it shall be
immediately removed by the building permit applicant or the land divider. All building
permit applicants and land dividers shall furnish the city with information as to where he
or a designated subordinate may be reached at all times by the city in regard to the
performance of such cleanup work. (Ord. 5-87 § I (A), 1987: Ord. 2-81 § 1 (part), 1981.)
77
15.35.020 City authority to cause cleanup.
Failure of the building permit applicant or the land divider to clean up debris, dirt or
foreign materials, as stated in Section 15.35.010, shall give the city the right to clean up
the debris, dirt or foreign materials utilizing city crews, or to hire an independent
contractor to do the same. The city shall bill the building permit applicant or land divider
for all such cleanup services at the rate of twice the actual city labor cost incurred plus
thirty-five percent of such actual labor costs reflecting utilization of city equipment. In the
event the city hires a private contractor to perform these services, the city shall bill the
land divider or building permit applicant the actual costs incurred by the private
contractor plus fifty percent of the actual costs reflecting the administrative costs
incurred. (Ord. 5-87 § 1(B), 1987: Ord. 2-81 § 1 (part), 1981.)
15.35.030 Deposit required for enforcement procedure.
A. The building permit applicant or land divider shall deposit with the city a sum
established by the city council by resolution, which shall be retained by the city a fund to
be utilized for street, sidewalk and adjacent property cleaning pursuant to the provisions
of this chapter. Failure of the building permit applicant or land divider to maintain said
sum for a period of over five days shall result in the issuance of stop work order which
will remain in effect on the entire development until the fund is restored to the amount
established by the city council by resolution of the building permit applicant or land
divider. If the city bills the applicant or land divider pursuant to Section 15.35.020 for
cleanup costs which exceed the deposit amount, the building permit applicant or land
divider shall pay the bill in full and restore the deposit in full within five days of his
receipt of said bill.
B. The city is not required by the terms of this chapter to clean up roadways, sidewalks
and adjacent parcels of the debris, dirt or foreign materials if the building permit
applicant or land divider fails to do so within the aforesaid time period. The city shall
have the option, if it does not elect to clean the roadways, sidewalks and adjacent
parcels itself, utilizing its own employees or a private contractor, to issue a stop work
order on the entire development after the expiration of the aforesaid time periods, which
stop work order shall remain in effect until the roadways, sidewalks and adjacent lots
are cleared by the building permit applicant or the land divider of debris, dirt or foreign
materials, to the satisfaction of the city.

EROSION CONTROL REGULATIONS
(Ord. 2002-12)
15.44.00 Intent.
The purpose is to regulate land disturbing activities that may lead to soil erosion and
sedimentation into watercourses, wetlands, riparian areas, and public and private
property. No land disturbing activity shall be conducted so as to cause slides of mud,
soil, rock, vegetative material, or any other material to be pushed onto, deposited upon,
or gravitated to the property of another, either public or private. (Ord. 2002-12)
15.44.10 Definitions.
Definitions are provided in the most recent version of the Erosion Prevention and
Sediment Control Planning and Design Manual, Clackamas County WES. Selected
words and terms are defined as follows:
Best Management Practice (BMP): Physical, structural and/or managerial practices
employed to avoid or mitigate damage or potential damage from contamination or
pollution of surface waters or wetlands. Structural BMPs are actually physical
installations rather than procedural/managerial BMPs such as good housekeeping and
employee training.
Building: Any structure used or intended for support, shelter or enclosure of any
persons, animals, goods, equipment or chattels and property of any kind
Building Official: The duly appointed officer or other designated authority charged with
the administration and enforcement of this Code, and includes the building official's duly
authorized deputies, officers, and inspectors.
Clearing: Any activity that removes vegetative ground cover.
Cut: Portion of land surface or area from which earth has been removed or will be
removed by excavating the depth below the original group surface to the excavated
surface.
Denuded Site (or Soil): An area made bare; stripped of ground covering.
Developer: The owners of property or their agents or contractors, or their successors or
assigns, who have undertaken or are proposing development.
Development: Any artificial change to improved or unimproved real estate, including
but not limited to, construction of buildings or other structures, excavation, vegetation
removal, mining, dredging, filling, grading, compaction, paving, drilling, stream alteration
or challenging, or other similar activities.
80
Disturbed Area: That area of natural ground excluding the footprint of the residence
that has been or is proposed to be altered through grading, cut and fill, removal of
natural vegetation, placement of material, trenching, or by any means that causes a
change in the undisturbed natural surface of the land or natural vegetation.
Erosion: The detachment and movement of earth, soil, sand, gravel, rock fragments,
refuse or any other organic or inorganic material by running water, wind, ice, or other
geologic agents, including such processes as gravitational creep, and detachment and
movement of soil or rock fragments by water, wind, ice, or gravity.
Erosion Control Manual: The most recent version of the Erosion Prevention and
Sediment Control Planning and Design Manual, Clackamas County WES.
Excavation: Any act by which earth, soil, sand, gravel, rock fragments, refuse or any
other organic or inorganic material is cut into, dug, quarried, uncovered, removed,
displaced, relocated, or bulldozed by a person, including the conditions resulting there
from.
Fill: Any act by which earth, soil, sand, gravel, rock fragments, refuse or any other
organic or inorganic material is deposited, placed, replaced, pushed, dumped, pulled,
transported, or moved by a person to a new location, including the conditions resulting
there from.
Footprint: That area of the residence measured from the outside walls (excluding any
overhanging portions) which includes indoor uses such as attached garage, carports,
utility room, laundry, etc., but excludes outdoor uses such as patios and breezeways.
Grading: The cutting and/or filling of the land to a desired slope or elevation.
Ground disturbing activity: See Land disturbing activity.
Land disturbing activity: Any clearing, grading, stripping, excavation, fill, or any
combination thereof.
Lot: A single unit of land that is created by a subdivision of land.
Residential Erosion Control Plan: A standard drawing maintained in the Building
Division showing typical erosion control measures used in construction of a singlefamily
dwelling on a lot with slopes less than 5%.
Sediment: Fragmented material originated from weathering and erosion of rocks and
unconsolidated deposits. The material is transported by, suspended in, or deposited by
water, air, wind, or gravity.
Sedimentation: The depositing of solid material, mineral or organic, that is in
suspension, is being transported, or has been moved from its site of origin by air, wind,
water, or gravity.
81
Stabilized: Is when the soil erosion rate approaches that of undisturbed soils. Soils
which are disturbed will be considered protected when covered with a healthy, mature
growth of grass or a good covering of hay or straw mulch (minimum 2 tons/acre). (Mulch
is only a temporary measure; ultimately, the site needs vegetation).
Stockpile: On-site storage of any soil, sand, gravel, clay, mud, debris, vegetation,
refuse or any other material organic or inorganic, in a concentrated state.
Stripping: Any activity that removes the vegetative surface cover including tree
removal, clearing, and storage or removal of topsoil.
15.44.20 Area of Application.
This chapter applies to all ground disturbing activities within the city limits whether or not
a permit is required, unless such activities are otherwise exempted by the Sandy
Development Code. All non-permitted ground disturbing activities that are permanent or
temporary in nature shall comply with this chapter unless otherwise noted.
15.44.30 Applicability.

private street, adjacent property, or into the surface water management system either
by direct deposit, dropping, tracking, discharge or as a result of erosion.
2. Flows of water over bare soils, turbid or sediment laden flows, or evidence of on-site
erosion such as rivulets or bare soil slopes, where the flow of water is not filtered or
captured on the site.
82
3. Any type of earth slides, mudflows, earth sloughing, or other earth movement, which
leaves the property of origin.
D. Exemptions:
1. Cutting brush where vegetative ground cover will remain intact.
2. Maintenance of public infrastructure by state or local government agencies. State and
local government agencies, however, shall implement best management practices to
prevent erosion and control sediment; and shall make regular inspections to ascertain
that erosion and sediment control measures consistent with best management practices
have been implemented and are being effectively maintained.
3. Emergencies: Development, which is subject to Chapter 15.44, may commence
without complying with the requirements of this chapter if the building official or private
property owner determines that emergency response activities are required because
there is a hazard posing imminent danger to life or property, such as substantial fire
hazards, risk of flood or other emergency. However, upon a determination by the
building official that such emergency has passed, the provisions of this chapter shall
apply.
4. Installation of signs.

otherwise expose soil shall be confined to the immediate construction site only.
2. The duration of exposure of soils shall be kept to a minimum during construction.
Exposed soils shall be covered by mulch, sheeting, temporary seeding or other suitable
material following grading or construction, until soils are stabilized. During the rainy
season, October 1 through April 30, soils shall not be exposed for more than seven
consecutive days. All disturbed land areas which will remain unworked for 30 days or
more during construction, shall be mulched and seeded.
3. During construction, runoff from the site shall be controlled, and increased runoff and
sediment resulting from soil disturbance shall be retained on-site. Temporary diversions,
sediment basins, barriers, check dams, or other methods shall be provided as
necessary to hold sediment and runoff.
4. Appropriate erosion and sediment control measures shall be installed prior to soil
disturbance.
5. A stabilized pad of gravel shall be constructed and maintained at all entrances and
exits to the construction site to prevent soil deposits on the roadway or in the drainage
ways. The stabilized gravel pad(s) shall be the only allowable entrances or exits to the
site.
6. Topsoil removal for development shall be stockpiled and reused on-site to the degree
necessary to restore disturbed areas to their original or enhanced condition, or to
assure a minimum of six inches of stable topsoil for revegetation. Additional soil shall be
provided if necessary to support revegetation. Topsoil stockpile sites are subject to and
must comply with these regulations.
7. The removal of all sediments which are carried into the streets, or on to adjacent
property, are the responsibility of the developer. The applicant shall be responsible for
cleaning and repairing streets, catch basins, and adjacent properties, where such
properties are affected by sediments or mud. In no case shall sediments be washed into
storm drains, ditches, drainage ways, streams, or wetlands.
8. All temporary erosion and sediment control measures shall be removed after final site
stabilization.
9. Any other relevant provision of the most recent version of the Clackamas County
WES Erosion Prevention and Sediment Control Planning and Design Manual required
by the building official.
B. Restoration of Vegetation. The developer shall be responsible for re-vegetating
public and private open spaces, utility easements, and undeveloped rights-of-way in
accordance with an approved Schedule of Installation.
84
1. If the vegetation existing prior to site development is non-native or invasive, it shall be
replaced with native or non-invasive plant species.
2. Temporary measures used for initial erosion control shall not be left in place
permanently.
3. Work areas on the immediate site shall be carefully identified and marked to reduce
potential damage to trees and vegetation.
4. Trees shall not be used as anchors for stabilizing working equipment.
5. During clearing operations, trees and vegetation shall not be permitted to fall or be
placed outside the work area.
6. In areas designated for selective cutting or clearing, care in falling and removing trees
and brush shall be taken to avoid injuring trees and shrubs to be left in place and the
provisions for tree preservation in Chapter 17.102.
7. Stockpiling of soil, or soil mixed with vegetation, shall be removed prior to completion
of the project.
C. Schedule of Installation. A schedule of planned erosion control and revegetation
measures shall be provided, which sets forth the progress of construction activities, and
mitigating erosion control measures.
D. Responsible Person. The developer shall designate a specific person to be
responsible for carrying out the Erosion Prevention and Sediment Control Plan.
E. Reference Authority. The most recent version of the Clackamas County WES
Erosion Prevention and Sediment Control Planning and Design Manual, a copy of which
is available in the Planning & Development department office, shall be the primary guide
for the City of Sandy in establishing and reviewing erosion control techniques, methods
and requirements. The Building Official may also develop regulations and procedures in
accordance with the Handbook to implement erosion control measures as needed.
15.44.50 Applicants Responsibility.
The developer, subsequent developers or property owners shall bear responsibility for
the installation, construction, protection of all stockpiles on the site, materials
transported from the site, maintenance including re-vegetation of all graded areas,
inspection and disposition of erosion control measures. In order to meet the purpose of
this chapter, the developer shall:
A. Plan Approval Required Prior to Clearing or Grading. No grading, clearing or
excavation of land requiring an Erosion Prevention and Sediment Control Plan shall be
undertaken prior to approval of the Erosion Prevention and Sediment Control Plan.
85
B. Implementation. The developer shall implement the measures and construct facilities
contained in the approved Erosion Prevention and Sediment Control Plan in a timely
manner.
1. Install measures intended to keep soil on site or out of water bodies, storm drainage
systems or the public right-of-way as the first step in any development. These measures
shall be made functional prior to any upslope development taking place. The developer
shall be responsible for maintenance, adjustment, repair and replacement of or erosion
control measures to ensure that they are functioning properly without interruption.
2. Remove any soil that enters the public right-of-way.
3. Protect stormwater inlets that are functioning during the course of the development
by approved sediment control measures so that sediment-laden water cannot enter the
inlets without first being filtered.

measures to reduce dust and sediment transport shall be applied as soon as
practicable, but in no case more than seven days after ground disturbing activity occurs.
3. Ground cover shall be installed on any portion of a site that is denuded for more than
six months. Sports fields or playgrounds surrounded by vegetative cover or permanently
installed curbing are exempt from this requirement.
4. Temporary measures shall be maintained until permanent measures are established.
5. Plant replacement vegetative cover that does not include plants listed as nuisance or
prohibited plants on the City of Portland Plant List (available in the Planning &
Development office) or the Citys Native Plant List. Agriculture, timber production or
residential crop growing activities are exempted from this requirement.
86
6. Secure or protect soil stockpiles throughout the project with temporary or permanent
soil stabilization measures. Depositions of soil may be subject to additional regulations
requiring permit, review or erosion and sediment control.
7. Select BMPs from the Erosion Control Manual.
D. Dust Control. The City of Sandy is susceptible to wind erosion. Therefore, the
building official may require that additional dust control measures be included in the
Erosion Prevention and Sediment Control Plan. Such control measures may include,
but are not limited to, the following:

15.44.150 Security.
The plans for development, including, but not limited to, road (public or private) and
driveway construction and building of any kind or nature whatsoever, must be approved
by the city and appropriate legal permit(s) issued, before any grading, bulldozing,
blasting, or movement of earth is commenced. If construction does not commence
within six months of securing such approval, no construction shall occur until such plans
have been resubmitted and reapproved.
For any grading or other activity for which an erosion control permit is required, at the
Citys discretion, the applicant shall supply a performance bond or other financial
guarantee in the amount of 120% of the value of the erosion prevention and control
measures necessary to stabilize the site and maintain water quality. Any financial
guarantee instrument proposed other than a performance bond shall be approved by
the Public Works Director. The performance guarantee required under this section shall
conform to the requirements of Section 17.100.330.
In the event that construction has not commenced within six months from the date of
issuance of the grading permit or restoration is not complete within twelve months from
the date of issuance of the grading permit, such bond shall be forfeited to the city in
such amount necessary for the purpose of restoration of the construction site to a
stabilized condition and all authorized permits shall be revoked and become void.
93
A. Duration. The financial guarantee instrument shall be in effective for a period of at
least one year after grading has been completed, and shall be released when the
building official determines that the site has been stabilized. All or a portion of the
security retained by the City may be withheld for a period of up to five (5) years beyond
the one-year maintenance period, if it has been determined by the building official that
the site has not been sufficiently stabilized against erosion.
B. If for any reason the financial guarantee is not adequate to complete stabilization of
the site the City shall have the ability to perform any work necessary to stabilize the site.
The City may enter a lien against the subject property in the Citys lien docket in order to
recover these costs.
C. Exemptions. Individual lots zoned for single-family and multi-family residential use
prior to the effective date of this section, and individual lots subject to the Residential
Erosion Control Plan stated in Section 15.44.30 shall be exempt from the security
requirements of this section.
D. Conflict. Due to the immediate threat to the public health, safety and welfare posed
by failure to comply with the strict provisions of the erosion control measures required
under this section, the provisions of Section 15.44.150 shall supersede the more
general provisions of the City of Sandy Development Code, where they exist.
15.44.160 Violations.
Each violation of any provision of this section, or any failure to carry out the conditions
of any approval granted pursuant to this section, shall be unlawful and a civil infraction
subject to the enforcement provisions of Section 1.16.010 of this code.
A. In addition to those penalties available under Section 1.16.010 of this code, the
Building Official may enforce the following additional penalties to this chapter:
1. Issue a stop work order where erosion control measures are not being properly
maintained or are not functioning properly due to faulty installation or neglect.
2. Refuse to accept any further permit applications until erosion control measures have
been installed properly and maintained in accordance with this chapter.
B. The owner of the property from which the erosion occurs, together with any person or
parties who cause such erosion, shall be responsible for mitigating the impacts of the
erosion and for preventing future erosion.
15.44.170 Severability.
The provisions of this ordinance are severable and if any paragraph, section,
subsection, or part of this ordinance is held to be invalid, unenforceable,
unconstitutional, or inapplicable to any person or circumstance, such illegality, invalidity,
unconstitutionality, or inapplicability shall not affect or impair the remainder of this
ordinance.

Code or a permit issued hereunder may be the subject of a civil action in the nature of a debt
or of any appropriate remedy issuing from a court of competent jurisdiction, including
mandatory and prohibitory injunctions and orders of abatement.
1. The Director is authorized to impose a civil penalty of up to $1,000.00 for any violation
of this Code.
2. In imposing a penalty amount pursuant to the schedule authorized by this section the
Director shall consider the following factors:
a) The past history of the person incurring a penalty in taking all feasible steps or
procedures necessary or appropriate to correct any violation;
b) Any prior violations of statutes, rules, orders or permits pertaining to development
regulations;
c) The gravity and magnitude of the violation;
d) Whether the violation was repeated or continuous; and
e) Whether the cause of the violation was an avoidable accident, negligence or an
intentional act.
3. Imposition and enforcement of civil penalties is not an exclusive remedy, but shall be in
addition to any other procedures or remedies provided by law. Imposition or payment of
a civil penalty under this section shall not be a bar to any criminal proceeding authorized
under this ordinance.
4. A civil penalty shall be imposed under this section by issuance of a notice of penalty. A
civil penalty may be imposed for the first 30 days and each additional 30-day period the
17.06 - 3
condition continues. The notice of penalty shall be provided in the manner as described
under Subsection 5 below.
5. Any civil penalty imposed under this section shall become due and payable when the
notice of penalty is served upon the person incurring the penalty. Service shall be by
personal service or by mailing the notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the
last known address of the person incurring the penalty. The notice of penalty shall
include:
a) A reference to the particular provision or law violated;
b) A statement of the matters asserted or charged;
c) A statement of the amount of the penalty or penalties imposed;
d) A statement of the owners right to appeal the penalty; and
e) A statement that if the penalty is not paid within the time required under Subsection

of the person incurring the penalty.
6. If the notice of penalty is returned to the City without service upon the named person, the
Director shall post a notice of penalty on the premises where the violation has occurred.
The notice shall be posted so as to be visible from the public right-of-way and shall be
delivered to a person, if any, occupying the premises. The posted notice shall be affixed
to the premises and shall also indicate that tampering or removal of the notice shall
constitute a misdemeanor.
7. The person to whom the notice of penalty is issued shall have 20 days from the date of
service of the notice in which to appeal the penalty before the municipal judge, after
which time the notice of penalty becomes a final order. The appeal shall be as provided in
Subsections 8 and 9 below.
8. Any appeal shall be in writing and signed by the person against whom the penalty has
been assessed or the attorney for that person. The appeal shall state the grounds of the
appeal. A deposit in the amount of the civil penalty assessed and an appeal fee shall
accompany the appeal. The appeal shall be filed with the municipal court and served
upon the City Attorney. Failure to comply with these provisions shall result in the
dismissal of the appeal.
9. The municipal judge shall develop any rules or regulations that may be necessary for the
proper conduct of the appeal. The only issues to be decided by the municipal judge are
determinations of whether or not the condition of the property was as alleged in the
notice of penalty and if so, whether that condition violated this Code. If the judge finds
that the alleged condition existed at the time and date specified on the notice of penalty,
the municipal judge shall issue an order affirming the penalty. The order shall contain a
provision for court costs to be paid by the violator. If the judge finds that the condition
alleged in the notice of penalty did not exist at the time and date specified on the notice,
the municipal judge shall void the notice of penalty. The order voiding the notice of
penalty shall provide for return of the deposit, including the appeal fee. The judges order
is final and not subject to appeal unless challenged in a court of competent jurisdiction.
10. Unless the amount of penalty imposed is paid within 10 days after the notice of penalty or
the order becomes final by operation of law or after appeal, the order shall constitute a
lien on the owners subject property and shall be recorded in the City Lien Docket.
Where the service has been made by certified mail or other means providing a receipt, the
returned receipt shall be attached to and made a part of the order recorded. The penalty
provided in the order and added costs so recorded become a lien upon the real property.
That lien shall have priority over all other liens and encumbrances of any character. The
lien shall accrue interest at the rate applicable for municipal assessment liens from the
date of docketing until clearance. The lien may be foreclosed on and the property sold as
17.06 - 4
may be necessary to discharge the lien in the manner specified in ORS 223.505 through
223.595.
11. Any lien for a civil penalty shall be released when the full amount determined to be due
has been paid to the City; and the owner or person making such payment shall receive a
receipt therefor, stating that the full amount of penalties, interest, recording fees, and
service costs have been paid and that the lien is thereby released and the record of the lien
satisfied.

CHAPTER 17.08 - NONCONFORMING DEVELOPMENT
17.08.00 INTENT
These regulations are intended to permit nonconforming uses and structures to continue, but not
to encourage their perpetuation. The regulation of nonconforming development is intended to
bring development into conformance with this Code and the Comprehensive Plan.
As used in this chapter, nonconforming development includes nonconforming structures and
nonconforming uses. A nonconforming structure is a structure that does not fully comply with
the zoning district provisions because of setbacks, building height, off-street parking, or with
some other standard of the district.
Within the zoning districts established by this Code, development may exist that was lawful at
the time it began, but would be prohibited in the future under the terms of this Code or future
amendments.
In order to avoid undue hardship, nothing in this Code shall be deemed to require a change in the
plans, construction, or designated use of any building on which actual substantial construction
was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Code and upon
which actual building construction has been carried on diligently. Construction is considered to
have started if excavation, demolition, or removal of an existing building has begun in
preparation of rebuilding, and a building permit has been acquired, prior to the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this Code.
17.08.10 GENERAL PROVISIONS
A. Alterations of a Nonconforming Use. No building, structure, or land area devoted to a
nonconforming use shall be enlarged, extended, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered
unless such development conforms to the provisions of this Code. Nothing in this chapter
shall be construed to prohibit normal repair, maintenance, and nonstructural alterations to
such development, nor the alteration, strengthening, or restoration to safe condition as may
be required by law.
B. Alteration of a Nonconforming Structure. Where the use of a structure is permitted by the
applicable development district but the structure is nonconforming, an alteration, expansion,
enlargement, extension, reconstruction, or relocation may be administratively approved if the
improvement, evaluated separately from the existing structure, would be in compliance, and
is not within a vision clearance area.
17.08.20 DISCONTINUANCE OF A NONCONFORMING USE
Whenever a nonconforming use is discontinued for more than 1 year, further use shall be in
conformity with the provisions of this Code. For purposes of this Code, rental payments or lease
payments and taxes shall not be considered a continued use. Discontinued shall mean nonuse
and shall not require a determination of the voluntary or involuntary nature of the discontinuance
or the intent to resume the nonconforming use.
17.08.30 DAMAGE TO A NONCONFORMING USE
If a structure with a nonconforming use is damaged by any means to an extent exceeding 80
percent of its most recent, pre-damage assessed valuation as indicated by the Clackamas County
17.08 - 2
Assessors office, any future development on the site shall conform to the requirements of the
zoning district in which it is located.
17.08.40 RECLASSIFICATION TO CONDITIONAL DEVELOPMENT
Whenever a nonconforming use is classified as a use that may be permitted conditionally, it shall
be reclassified as conforming upon receipt of an approved conditional use permit in accordance
with Chapter 17.68.
17.08.50 EXCEPTIONS
A. Multi-Family Dwellings, Office Uses, Automotive Fueling Stations, Car Washes, and
retail auto dealerships in the C-1 zoning district. (Ord. 2000-02 § , 2000.)
1. Multi-family dwellings in existence as of September 30, 1997 shall not be
classified as nonconforming development. However, any redevelopment or
expansion shall require compliance with current landscaping, access and parking
standards and shall be processed as a conditional use permit.
2. Office uses in existence as of September 30, 1997 shall not be classified as
nonconforming development. However, any redevelopment or expansion shall
require compliance with current landscaping, access and parking standards and
shall be processed as a conditional use permit.
3. Automotive fueling stations and car washes in existence as of September 30, 1997
shall not be classified as nonconforming development. However, any
redevelopment or expansion shall require compliance with current landscaping,
access and parking standards and shall be processed as a conditional use permit.
4. Retail auto dealerships in existence as of September 30, 1997 shall not be
classified as nonconforming development. Redevelopment of the existing
dealership shall require compliance with current landscaping, lighting and access
requirements. Expansion of an existing dealership shall be permitted only on
property contiguous to the existing auto dealership and in the same ownership as
the auto dealership on the effective date of this ordinance. Expansion shall be
processed as a conditional use permit. If the existing auto dealership building is
proposed to be altered or if a new building is proposed to be constructed on the
expansion property, the entire dealership shall be required to conform to current
applicable criteria and standards in the Sandy Development Code. If the
expansion is proposed to include only parking for the display of automobiles,
landscaping, light standards and signage, only the expansion property shall be
required to conform to current applicable criteria and standards in the Sandy
Development Code. (Ord. 2000-02 § , 2000.)
B. Nonconforming Duplexes. Where a duplex is a nonconforming building type in the zoning
district where it is located and has been damaged as described in 17.08.30 above, a duplex
may be reconstructed provided such reconstruction commences within 1 year of the damage
and complies with required development standards.
C. Nonconforming Lots of Record. An existing lot of record may not meet the lot size
requirements of the zoning district in which it is located. Such a lot may be occupied by a use
permitted in the district. If, however, the lot is smaller than the size required in its district,
residential use shall be limited to one dwelling unit or to the number of dwelling units
consistent with density requirements of the district. Also, other applicable requirements of
the zoning district must be met.
17.08 - 3
D. Street and Drainageway Dedications. The act of conveyance to or appropriation by the City
for street, drainage or other public purposes shall not in itself render as nonconforming the
use of land, structure, or other improvement maintained upon a lot.
E. Residential Uses. Any residential dwelling permitted prior to adoption of this Code, but
which is no longer allowed as a new use, may be modified or enlarged, provided it complies
with required development standards of the district.
F. Legally Required Alterations. Alterations of any nonconforming use shall be permitted when
necessary to comply with any lawful requirement for alteration in the use.

Type IV (Quasi-Judicial) procedures apply to individual properties. This type of application is
generally considered initially by the Planning Commission with final decisions made by the City
Council.
Type IV (Legislative) procedures apply to legislative matters. Legislative matters involve the
creation, revision, or large-scale implementation of public policy (e.g., adoption of land use
regulations, zone changes, and comprehensive plan amendments that apply to entire districts, not
just one property). Type IV matters are typically considered first by the Planning Commission
with final decisions made by the City Council. Occasionally, the Planning Commission will not
consider a legislative matter prior to its consideration by the City Council.
Applications processed under a Type IV procedure involve a public hearing pursuant to the
requirements of Chapter 17.20. Notification of this public hearing shall be noticed according to
the requirements of Chapter 17.22 with appeal of a Type IV decision made to the state Land Use
Board of Appeals according to the provisions of Chapter 17.28.

conduct a public hearing pursuant to Chapter 17.20. The Director shall set a date for the
hearing. The form of notice and persons to receive notice are as required by the relevant
sections of this Code. At the public hearing, the staff shall review the report of the Planning
Commission and provide other pertinent information, and interested persons shall be given
the opportunity to present new testimony and information relevant to the proposal that was
not heard before the Planning Commission and make final arguments why the matter should
or should not be approved and, if approved, the nature of the provisions to be contained in
approving action.
B. To the extent that a finding of fact is required, the City Council shall make a finding for each
of the applicable criterion and in doing so may sustain or reverse a finding of the Planning
Commission. The City Council may delete, add or modify any of the provisions pertaining to
the proposal or attach certain development or use conditions beyond those warranted for
compliance with standards in granting an approval if the City Council determines the
conditions are appropriate to fulfill the criteria for approval.
C. To the extent that a policy is to be established or revised, the City Council shall make its
decision after information from the hearing has been received. The decision shall become
effective by passage of an ordinance.
D. Types of Applications
1. Appeal of Planning Commission decision
2. Comprehensive Plan text or map amendment
3. Zoning District Map changes
4. Planned Developments
5. Village Specific Area Plan (master plan)
6. Annexations
7. Extension of City Services Outside the City Limits

Revised by Ordinance 2013-11 effective 12/18/13
CHAPTER 17.18 - PROCESSING APPLICATIONS
17.18.00 PROCEDURES FOR PROCESSING LAND USE APPLICATIONS
An application shall be processed under a Type I, II, III or IV procedure. The differences
between the procedures are generally associated with the different nature of the decisions as
described in Chapter 17.12.
When an application and proposed development is submitted, the Director shall determine the
type of procedure the Code specifies for its processing and the potentially affected agencies.
If a development proposal requires an applicant to file a land use application with the city (e.g. a
design review application) and if there is a question as to the appropriate procedure to guide
review of the application (e.g. a Type II versus a Type III design review process), the question
will be resolved in favor of the lower type number.
If a development proposal requires an applicant to file more than one land use application with
the city (e.g. a design review application and a variance) and if the development code provides
that the applications are to be reviewed under separate types of procedures (e.g. a Type II design
review and a Type III variance):
 the Director will generally elevate all of the required applications to the highest number
procedure for review (e.g. the Type II design review application would be reviewed by
the Planning Commission along with the Type III variance).
In situations where an applicant has attended a pre-application conference and has reviewed the
application with the Director prior to submitting the applications, the Director may exercise
his/her discretion to review the Type II application(s) at the staff level and only schedule a public
hearing for the Type III portion(s) of the development proposal.
17.18.10 COORDINATION OF PERMIT PROCEDURE
The Director shall be responsible for the coordination of the permit application and decisionmaking
procedure and shall issue any necessary permits to an applicant whose application and
proposed development is in compliance with the provisions of this Code. Sufficient information
shall be submitted to resolve all determinations that require furnishing notice to persons other
than the applicant. In the case of a Type II or Type III procedure, an applicant may defer
submission of details demonstrating compliance with standards where such detail is not relevant
to the approval under those procedures. Before issuing any permits, the Director shall be
provided with the detail required to establish full compliance with the requirements of this Code.
17.18.20 PRE-APPLICATION CONFERENCE
A pre-application conference is required for all Type II, III, and IV applications unless the
Director determines a conference is not needed. A request for a pre-application conference shall
be made on the form provided by the city and will be scheduled following submittal of required
materials and payment of fees. The purpose of the conference is to acquaint the applicant with
the substantive and procedural requirements of the Code, provide for an exchange of information
regarding applicable elements of the Comprehensive Plan and development requirements,
arrange such technical and design assistance which will aid the applicant, and to otherwise
17.18 - 2
Revised by Ordinance 2013-11 effective 12/18/13
identify policies and regulations that create opportunities or pose significant constraints for the
proposed development. The Director will provide the applicant with notes from the conference
within 10 days of the conference. These notes may include confirmation of the procedures to be
used to process the application, a list of materials to be submitted, and the applicable code
sections and criteria that may apply to the application. Any opinion expressed by the Director or
City staff during a pre-application conference regarding substantive provisions of the Citys code
is advisory and is subject to change upon official review of the application.
17.18.30 LAND USE APPLICATION MATERIALS

request, pertinent background information, information required by the Development Code
and other material that may have a bearing in determining the action to be taken.
D. Proof that the property affected by the application is in the exclusive ownership of the
applicant, that the applicant has the consent of all parties in ownership of the affected property,
or the applicant is the contractual owner.
E. Legal description of the property affected by the application.
F. Written narrative addressing applicable code chapters and approval criteria.
G. Vicinity Map showing site in relation to local and collector streets, plus any other significant
features in the nearby area.

pre-judgment, personal interest, or other facts from which the challenger has concluded that
the member of the hearing body cannot participate in an impartial manner.
B. Disqualification. Except for Type IV legislative hearings conducted by the governing body,
no member of a hearing body shall participate in a discussion of the proposal or vote on the
proposal when any of the following conditions exist:

within the previous two years, or any business with which the member is negotiating for
or has an arrangement or understanding concerning prospective partnership or
employment;
2. The member has a direct private interest in the proposal;
3. For any other valid reason, the member has determined that participation in the hearing
and decision cannot be done in an impartial manner.
C. Ex Parte Contacts. Except for Type IV legislative hearings conducted by the governing body,
the general public has a right to have hearing body members free from pre-hearing or ex
parte contacts on matters heard by them. It is recognized that a countervailing public right is
free access to public officials on any matter. Therefore, hearing body members shall reveal
any significant pre-hearing or ex parte contacts with regard to any matter at the
commencement of the public hearing on the matter. If such contacts have not impaired the
member's impartiality or ability to vote on the matter, the member shall so state and shall
participate or abstain in accordance with Chapter 17.20.120.
Ex parte contacts with a member of the decision making body shall not invalidate a final
decision or action of the decision making body, provided that the member receiving the
contact places the substance of the content of the ex parte communication in the record of the
hearing and makes a public announcement of the content of the communication and of the
right of the parties to rebut the content at the first hearing where action will be considered or
taken.
D. Abstention or Disqualification. Except for Type IV hearings conducted by the governing
body, disqualification for reasons other than the member's own judgment may be ordered by
a majority of the members of a hearing body present and voting. The member who is the
subject of the motion for disqualification may not vote on the motion.
E. Rights of Disqualified Member of the Hearing Body.
1. An abstaining or disqualified member of the hearing body may be counted for purposes
of forming a quorum. A member who represents personal interest at a hearing may do so
only by physically joining the audience and vacating the seat on the hearing body. He
shall make full disclosure of his status and position at the time of addressing the hearing
body and shall not vote;
2. If all members of a hearing body disqualify themselves all members present after stating
their reasons for abstention or disqualification shall by so doing be re-qualified and
proceed to resolve the issues;
17.20 - 7
Revised by Ordinance 2008-05 effective 04/02/08
3. Except for Type IV legislative hearings conducted by the governing body, a member
absent during the presentation of evidence in a hearing may not participate in the
deliberations or final decision regarding the matter of the hearing unless the member has
reviewed the evidence received.
F. Voting Eligibility. When a member of the hearing authority becomes ineligible to vote due to
absence from a portion of the public hearing on the proposed development, the member may
revive voting eligibility by listening to the completed audio or video tape recording of the
portion of the hearing missed. The member shall then announce to the hearing authority that
the tapes have been listened to, thus reviving voter eligibility.

to be recorded stenographically or electronically.

CHAPTER 17.26 - ZONING DISTRICT AMENDMENTS
17.26.00 INTENT
This chapter sets forth review criteria and procedural requirements for quasi-judicial and
legislative zoning map amendments to accomplish the following:
A. Maintain sound, stable, and desirable development within the City;
B. Permit changes in zoning district boundaries where appropriate;
C. Ensure zoning changes are consistent with the communitys land use policies and goals; and
D. Lessen the influence of private economic interests in the land use decision-making process.
17.26.10 BACKGROUND
The Zoning Map is consistent with the adopted Comprehensive Plan, as amended, and as such it
is a reflection of the Citys land use planning goals. The Zoning Map has been adopted as part of
the Development Code. Frequent and piecemeal amendments to the Zoning Map can threaten the
integrity of the Comprehensive Plan and the likelihood of its successful implementation.
Nevertheless, it may be necessary to amend the Zoning Map from time to time to correct errors
or to respond to changing conditions or unforeseen circumstances.
When a zoning district is amended there often must be a corresponding change to the
Comprehensive Plan map. There are, however, instances where more than one zoning district
matches the Comprehensive Plan designation. In these situations, the zoning district can be
amended without a Plan map change. The table below illustrates the relationship between the
Comprehensive Plan and the Zoning Map designations in the City.
Zoning district changes are classified as legislative or quasi-judicial, depending on the number of
properties involved. Changes to the Zoning Map are reviewed initially by the Planning
Commission with a recommendation forwarded to the City Council. The City Council conducts a
public hearing and considers adoption of changes. A Zoning Map application may be reviewed
in conjunction with a Comprehensive Plan map amendment or other land use application.

development plan.
B. Review Criteria. Quasi-judicial zoning district changes shall be reviewed to:
1. Determine the effects on City facilities and services;
2. To assure consistency with the purposes of this chapter;

17.30.10 ZONING MAP
The Zoning Map is incorporated herein and is deemed as much a part of this Code as if fully set
forth. If a conflict appears between the Zoning Map and the written portion of this Code, the
written portion shall control. The map and each amendment shall remain on file in the Planning
Directors Office.
The boundaries of all districts are established as shown on the Zoning Map, which is made a part
of this Code. All notations and references and other matters shown shall be and are hereby made
part of this Code.
17.30.20 RESIDENTIAL DENSITY CALCULATION PROCEDURE
The number of dwelling units permitted on a parcel of land is calculated after the determination
of the net site area and the acreage of any restricted development areas (as defined by Chapter
17.60). Limited density transfers are permitted from restricted development areas to unrestricted
areas consistent with the provisions of the Flood and Slope Hazard Area Overlay District,
Chapter 17.60.
Calculation of Net Site Area (NSA): Net site area should be calculated in acres based upon a
survey of the property boundaries excluding areas dedicated for public use.
17.30 - 2
Revised by Ordinance 2013-04 effective 07/03/13
A. Minimum and Maximum Dwelling Units for Sites with No Restricted Areas
The allowable range of housing units on a piece of property is calculated by multiplying the
net site area (NSA) in acres by the minimum and maximum number of dwelling units
allowed in that zone.
For example: A site (NSA) containing 10 acres in the Single Family Residential Zoning
District requires a minimum of 30 units and allows a maximum of 58 units. (NSA x 3
units/acre = 30 units minimum) (NSA x 5.8 units/acre = 58 units maximum)
B. Minimum and Maximum Dwelling Units for Sites with Restricted Areas
1. Unrestricted Site Area: To calculate unrestricted site area (USA): subtract all restricted
development areas (RDA) as defined by Section 17.60.20(A) from the net site area
(NSA), if applicable.
NSA - RDA = USA
2. Minimum Required Dwelling Units: The minimum number of dwelling units required for
the site is calculated using the following formula:
USA (in acres) x Minimum Density (Units per Acre) of Zoning District = Minimum
Number of Dwelling Units Required.
3. Maximum Allowed Dwelling Units: The maximum number of dwelling units allowed on
a site is the lesser of the results of these two formulas:
a. NSA (in acres) x Maximum Density of Zoning District (units/acre)
b. USA (in acres) x Maximum Density of Zoning District (units/acre) x 1.5 (maximum
allowable density transfer based on Chapter 17.60)
For example: suppose a site in a zone with a maximum density of eight (8) units per acre
has 6 acres of unrestricted site area (USA= 6) and two acres of restricted development
area (RDA=2), for a total net site area of 8 acres (NSA= 8). Then NSA (8) x 8 units/acre
= 64 and USA (6) x 8 units/acre x 1.5 = 72, so the maximum permitted number of
dwelling units is 64 (the lesser of the two results).
C. Lot Sizes: Lot sizes shall comply with any minimum lot size standards of the underlying
zoning district.
D. Rounding: A dwelling unit figure is rounded down to the nearest whole number for all total
maximum or minimum figures less than four dwelling units. For dwelling unit figures greater
than four dwellings units, a partial figure of one-half or greater is rounded up to the next
whole number.
For example: A calculation of 3.7 units is rounded down to 3 units. A calculation of 4.2 units
is rounded down to 4 units and a calculation of 4.5 units is rounded up to 5 units.

CHAPTER 17.54 - SPECIFIC AREA PLAN OVERLAY
17.54.00 SPECIFIC AREA PLAN DEVELOPMENT AND APPROVAL PROCESS
A. Purpose. The purpose of a specific area plan overlay zone is to allow development and
approval of specific area plans in the city. A specific area plan is a master plan coordinating
and directing development in terms of transportation, utilities, open space and land use,
however, no phasing or timeline is required. Specific area plans may be located anywhere
within the Urban Growth Boundary and are intended to promote coordinated planning
concepts and pedestrian-oriented mixed-use development.
B. Initiation. The process to establish a specific area plan shall be initiated by the City Council.
The Planning Commission or interested property owners may submit requests to the City
Council to initiate the specific area plan process. If owners request initiation of a specific
area plan process, the City Council may require an application fee to cover the cost of
creating the plan.
C. Advisory Committee. The City Council may appoint an advisory committee to guide
development of the plan. The advisory committee may include persons representing affected
property owners, neighbors, city staff, agencies, special districts and the community at large.
The role of the committee is advisory to the Planning Commission and the City Council.
D. Adoption. A specific area plan shall be adopted through a Type IV process, and shall be
evaluated for compliance with the criteria for zoning district amendments and/or
comprehensive plan amendments where applicable.
E. Map identification. A specific area plan overlay zone is identified on the City of Sandy
Zoning Map with a specific border around the perimeter of the plan area and a letter S
depicted approximately in the center of the plan area. A report that includes the specific area
plan and relevant development standards shall be adopted as an exhibit to the ordinance
approving the overlay zone district.
F. Comprehensive Plan Amendment. A specific area plan is similar to a master plan and does
not automatically require a comprehensive plan amendment. A comprehensive plan
amendment shall only be required if a need for such an amendment is identified during
development of the specific area plan.
G. Compliance with Specific Area Plan Standards and Procedures. New construction and land
divisions shall meet any development, land division and design standards of the applicable
specific area plan. Base zone and land division standards shall apply where no different
standard is referenced for the specific plan area.
H. Specific Area Plan Standards. Specific standards for adopted specific area plans are defined
below.
17.54.10 SPECIFIC AREA PLAN CONTENT

C. Land Use Diagram. The land use diagram shall indicate the distribution and location of
planned land uses, including open space and parks, within the area covered by the specific
area plan.
D. Density. If residential uses are proposed, a narrative shall describe planned residential
densities.
E. Facilities Analysis. The plan shall include an analysis of the general location and extent of
major components of sanitary sewer, water, and other essential facilities proposed to be
located within the specific plan area and needed to support the land uses and densities
described in the plan. A review of existing facilities master plans shall be sufficient if these
master plans indicate there is adequate capacity to serve the specific plan area.
F. Circulation/Transportation Diagram. The circulation diagram shall indicate the proposed
street pattern for the specific area plan area, including pedestrian pathways and bikeways.
Design standards and street cross sections shall be included, if different than normal City
standards.
G. Market Analysis. Specific are plans that include amendments to the zoning map affecting the
acreage of Village Commercial (C-3) land within the plan area shall include a market
analysis of supportable retail space that verifies demand for the proposed acreage of C-3
land. The analysis should include a market delineation, a regional and local economic review,
and a retail market evaluation.
H. Design and Development Standards. If standards differ from normal City standards, design
and development standards shall be included in the plan.
17.54.20 LAND USE REVIEW
The review procedures outlined in Chapter 17.12, Procedures for Decision Making, shall apply
for all development subject to a specific area plan overlay zone, unless modified below.
A. Type I. The Director, at his or her discretion, may refer a Type I application to the Planning

17.54.40 BORNSTEDT VILLAGE OVERLAY (BVO) DISTRICT
The City of Sandy developed a specific area plan for Bornstedt Village, a mixed-use
neighborhood located south of downtown Sandy surrounding the intersection of Hwy 211 and
Bornstedt Road, as depicted on the City of Sandy Zoning Map. The Bornstedt Village Specific
Area Plan Report, the background document that includes Figures referenced in this Chapter, is
available for review in the City of Sandy Planning Department.
17.54.50 BVO INTENT
The Bornstedt Village Overlay (BVO) district is intended to guide the development of a new,
pedestrian-oriented neighborhood in Sandy, and, implement the Comprehensive Plans village
policies. The district is intended to integrate land use, transportation, natural resource and
infrastructure planning in a way that recognizes and enhances the unique qualities of Bornstedt
Village. The district references other chapters within the Sandy Development Code in
combination with provisions that apply solely within Bornstedt Village. Where there is a conflict
between a referenced section of the Code and this chapter, the BVO district provisions
supercede.
The planning objectives for Bornstedt Village are to:
A. Create a Livable Village  Create a neighborhood-oriented village that fulfills the village
definition in the Sandy Comprehensive Plan, and, responds to the unique opportunities and
site conditions of Bornstedt Village.

accommodating automobile traffic. Integrate planned land uses with existing and future
transportation modes.
C. Plan for a New, Village-Oriented Character for Hwy 211, Bornstedt and Jacoby Roads 
Evaluate ways to calm traffic, improve safety, create an attractive character, protect natural
resources and generally minimize adverse impacts from traffic on these high-speed roads.
D. Protect, Restore, and Enhance Natural Resources in Balance with Creating an Urban Village
 Plan for integration for land use, transportation, and natural resources in the village. This
objective seeks to protect, restore and enhance key resources and implement appropriate
green and sustainable development practices, all in balance with creating an urban village.
E. Plan for a Parks and Open Space  Provide parks that implement the City of Sandy Parks
Master Plan, and other open space opportunities that enhance the livability of the village.
F. Provide Housing Choices  Provide a variety of housing choices that meet the needs of a
broad spectrum of Sandy residents.
G. Ensure Attractive and Village-Oriented Design  Identify zoning and design guidelines that
will result in attractive design that supports the creation of a walkable village.

4. Covered front porches
5. Pillars or posts
6. Bay or bow windows
7. Eaves of 12 inches or greater
8. Off-set of 16 inches or greater on building face or roof
9. Window trim (minimum 4-inches-wide nominal) or shutters (minimum 8-inches-wide
nominal)
17.54 - 11
Revised by Ordinance No. 2003-09 effective 10/15/03
10. Balconies or porch rail
11. Shakes, shingles, brick or other similar decorative materials occupy at least 100 square
feet of the street façade
C. Variety of Housing Standard for Subdivisions and Planned Developments  In order to
reduce repetition of the same building type and promote housing choices, all subdivisions
and planned unit developments exceeding 40 platted lots, in the R-1, R-2 and R-3 zones,
must demonstrate that a variety of lot sizes and/or building types have been provided. This
standard is met by providing a different lot size or housing type for at least one-third (33.3%)
of the dwellings, by one or more of the following:
1. A mix of attached and detached dwellings.
2. A variety of lot sizes for detached dwellings where the varied lot sizes are at least 20%
larger or smaller than the average lot size for the remaining lots.
3. A mix of one and two story dwellings.
4. A mix of multi-family housing and detached dwellings, where allowed by the underlying
zoning district.
5. Other techniques as approved by the Planning Commission through a Type III review
process.
D. Garage Standards  The following standards apply to new single-family, duplex and zero-lotline
residential development. The purpose for these standards is to:
1. Ensure that there is a physical and visual connection between the living area and entrance
of the dwelling and the street.
2. Enhance public safety for residents and visitors and provide opportunities for community
interaction.
3. Provide for a more pleasant pedestrian environment by preventing garages and vehicle
areas from dominating the views of the neighborhood from the sidewalk.
Garages that are accessed from the front lot area of the dwelling must meet one of the four
options listed below, unless the garage is placed behind the dwelling.
a. The length of the garage wall may be up to 60% of the length of the street-facing
building façade when the garage does not extend closer to the front lot line than the
longest wall of the street-facing façade (Figure 10a in the Bornstedt Village SAP).
b. The length of the garage may be up to 70% of the length of the street-facing building
façade when the garage is recessed at a minimum of 2 feet from the longest wall of
the street-facing façade (Figure 10a in the Bornstedt Village SAP).
c. The garage may extend up to 6 feet in front of the longest street-facing wall when its
width does not exceed 50% of the total street-facing façade, and, the garage is not
closer to the street lot line than the front of the porch. As referenced here, the porch
must be at least 48 square feet in area, have a solid roof that is not more than 12 feet
above the porch (Figure 10b in the Bornstedt Village SAP).
d. A garage door that is oriented at least 90 degrees to the street lot line is not subject to
standards a-c above. Such side-oriented garages must have at least 15% of their
street-facing wall (measured in square feet) in windows (Figure 10b in the Bornstedt
Village SAP).
17.54 - 12
Revised by Ordinance No. 2003-09 effective 10/15/03
E. Access to Narrow Lots  In order to minimize the extent of curb cuts on each block, to deemphasize
front-facing garages, and mitigate turning movement conflicts, lots with less than
40 feet of frontage shall receive access from a rear public alley or a shared private driveway.
A shared private driveway may serve: 1) as many as 6 dwelling units, none of which takes
direct access on the public street; or 2) two dwelling units, where both dwelling units share a
common driveway approach on a public street (where permitted). The Planning Commission
may grant exceptions through a Type III Variance process where the applicant demonstrates
topography or other conditions preclude compliance with this standard.
F. Landscaping Standards Adjacent to Highway 211  The street-side yard adjacent to the
Highway 211 Parkway (Figure 6 of the Bornstedt Village Specific Area Plan) shall be
landscaped to complement the parkway character. At a minimum, trees (minimum 2) shall
be planted on 50-foot centers together with contiguous groundcover. Less than 50-foot
center spacing for trees is encouraged.
17.54.120 BVO CIRCULATION
New streets and vehicle access shall be developed consistent with the Bornstedt Village
Circulation Plan (Figure 7 of the Bornstedt Village Specific Area Plan). Through-roads shown
on the circulation plan are considered required street connections, however, there is flexibility
regarding the specific alignment of the streets. Proposed road arrows (shown on Circulation
Plan) are considered suggested locations for additional connections between the through streets,
recognizing that flexibility is needed for the specific number and location of additional streets.
The combination of development of the through streets and additional connections shall provide
circulation resulting in a logical and connected network of local neighborhood streets. Figure 8
of the Bornstedt Village Specific Area Plan is an illustrative, non-binding, plan of how this
standard could be implemented. Within the Bornstedt Village Overlay District, changes in the
Circulation/Transportation Plan that cause a required transportation element, including a trail, to
be added or moved more than 100 feet from the location depicted on the specific area plan
Circulation diagram, shall be subject to the amendment procedures of Section 17.54.30 (B) rather
than 17.54.30 (C). Changes in the Circulation/Transportation Plan that cause a required
transportation element, including a trail, to be eliminated, shall be subject to the amendment
procedures of 17.54.30 (C).
A. Highway 211 Parkway Section. Development shall be consistent with the design of the
Highway 211 Parkway cross-section (Figure 6 of the Bornstedt Village Specific Area Plan),
subject to ODOT approval. The parkway cross-section may be modified, as needed, to adjust
to topographic and other constraints. Modifications as part of the review of any land use
application or development permit shall be approved by City Engineer and are subject to
ODOT approval.
B. Traffic Calming on Bornstedt Road. The intersection of Bornstedt Road and Cascadia
Village Drive shall be stop controlled. Other traffic calming methods such as striping,
reflectors, narrowing of the pavement section, regrading, landscaping and other traffic
calming techniques shall be considered during land use reviews and public improvement
projects.
C. Boulevards.
17.54 - 13
Revised by Ordinance No. 2003-09 effective 10/15/03
1. The concept for the Barlow Road Boulevard is to build a neighborhood street that:
a. Follows the general alignment of the historic Barlow Road, as shown on Figures 7
and 11 of the Bornstedt Village Specific Area Plan; and
b. Includes a landscaped park-block section that is a minimum of 20 feet wide and
includes interpretive signage and a trail within the median. The conceptual design
recognizes that the historic road is no longer visible, but is still valuable and
important to incorporate into the design of the neighborhood; and
c. Minimizes access points by requiring residential access from a side street, rear public
alley, or from a shared private driveway; and
d. Encourages pedestrian accessibility by requiring the primary entrance of all
residential development adjacent to the boulevard to be oriented toward the boulevard
street. Buildings adjacent to the boulevard shall have a primary entrance connecting
directly between the boulevard street and building interior.
2. The concept for the Village Boulevard is to build a neighborhood street that:
a. Extends from the signalized intersection at Highway 211 approximately 1,000 feet to
the south and approximately 260 feet to the north; and
b. This street should include a landscaped park-block median that is a minimum of 20
feet wide; and
c. The existing hedgerow of trees located at south end of the boulevard should be
incorporated into this street design; and
d. Minimizes access points by requiring residential access from a side street, rear public
alley, or from a shared private driveway; and
e. Encourages pedestrian accessibility by requiring the primary entrance of all
residential and commercial development adjacent to the boulevard to be oriented
toward the boulevard street. Buildings adjacent to the boulevard shall have a primary
entrance connecting directly between the boulevard street and building interior.
3. The concept for Cascadia Village Drive, west of Bornstedt Road, is to build a
neighborhood street that:
a. Features a landscaped park-block median that is a minimum of 20 feet wide, except
where the street must avoid areas regulated by Chapter 17.60, the FSH Overlay
District; and
b. Minimizes access points by requiring residential access from a side street, rear public
alley, or from a shared private driveway; and
c. Encourages pedestrian accessibility by requiring the primary entrance of all
residential development adjacent to the boulevard to be oriented toward the boulevard
17.54 - 14

street. Buildings adjacent to the boulevard shall have a primary entrance connecting
directly between the boulevard street and building interior.
D. Green Streets  Vegetated swales and other green street features, per SDC 17.100, approved
by the City Engineer shall be used where practicable in Bornstedt Village.
17.54.130 BVO PARKS
The Open Space, Parks and Trails Map (Figure 9 of the Bornstedt Village Specific Area Plan)
illustrates both existing parks and the location of new neighborhood parks. The proposed parks
are conceptually located. The parks are an important element of the BVO district, however, they
do not bind the subject properties to use as only parkland. Rather, the exact location and size of
the parks shall be established through acquisition by the City, parkland dedication during
development reviews as required by Chapter 17.86, development agreements, or other means
that involve property owner participation. Within the Bornstedt Village Overlay District, changes
in the parks plan that cause a required park, path or trail to be added or moved more than 100
feet from the location depicted on the specific area plan parks diagram, shall be subject to the
Amendment procedures of Section 17.54.30 (B) rather than 17.54.30 (C). Changes in the parks
plan that cause a required park, path or trail to be eliminated, shall be subject to the Amendment
procedures of 17.54.30 (C).
17.54.140 BVO ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS
The BVO district shall utilize the existing environmental standards in the Sandy Development
Code. The principal regulations are:
1. Flood Slope and Hazard (FSH) Overlay  see Chapter 17.60
2. Hillside Development  see Chapter 17.56
3. Urban Forestry  see Chapter 17.102, except where modified by this Chapter
A. Tree Retention  The landowner is responsible for retention and protection of retained
trees as specified below:
1. Within Bornstedt Village at least 9 trees, 11 inches DBH or greater, shall be retained
for every one-acre of land under contiguous ownership within 300 feet of the FSH
Overlay District as depicted on the Zoning Map, and 6 trees per acre in other areas of
the village.
All other standards of Chapter 17.102 shall remain in effect.

use activity and surrounding site conditions are unchanged, that report may be utilized and a
new report is not required. Should environmental conditions associated with the site or
surrounding the site change, or if the proposed land use activity or development has
materially changed, the applicant shall submit an amendment to the required assessment or
report, which may be reviewed and approved through the peer review process.
APPENDIX A
GEOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT REQUIREMENTS
The geological assessment is intended as an overview of site conditions. Its purpose is to identify
geologic hazards and considerations, and to provide an assessment of the suitability of the site
for the proposed project. It is the Citys policy to evaluate not only the development site and its
effect on adjacent properties, but also adjacent properties that may affect the site. The report
should include the items listed below in sufficient detail so that the City may determine whether
a more thorough engineering geology report or geotechnical report may be needed to complete
the evaluation of the suitability of the site for the proposed use.
The geologic assessment shall include the following:
GENERAL
 Name, address, and phone number.
 Client for whom the report was prepared.
 A description of the proposed project and its location.
 A review of the geologic history and the history of prior excavations and fills.
 A field reconnaissance of the site and vicinity.
 A discussion of geologic hazards, if any.
SITE INVESTIGATION
A site map of the area at a scale of 1":400' or larger. Geologic conditions, topography, and
location of proposed structures are to be shown. A geologic profile showing any referenced
subsurface conditions. A copy of published geologic maps shall also be provided.
 Suitability of the site for proposed development from a geologic standpoint.
 A description of the magnitude and extent of proposed grading or soil disturbance.
 If deemed necessary, subsurface exploration shall be conducted to assess unclear geologic
conditions.
 A description of all field mapping and exploration procedures.
 Additional information or analyses as necessary to evaluate the site.
 A bibliography of all references used.
GEOLOGIC PROCESSES
 A discussion of any unusual or extreme geologic processes at work on the site, for example:
rapid erosion, landslide hazard, flood hazard, rockfall, subsidence, or other features.
 A list of any geologic hazards that may affect the proposed land use, including slope
stability, debris flow, flooding, topography, erosion hazard, shallow groundwater, expansive
soils, subsidence, fault rupture, or any other geologic hazard discovered by the investigation.
17.56 - 5
 An identification of any areas of the site that you recommend be avoided for human occupied
structures.
 The effects of the geologic conditions on the proposed land use.
 The effects of the proposed land use on future geologic processes.
 The effects of the geologic conditions and proposed land use on surrounding properties.
RECOMMENDATIONS
 Discuss mitigation measures to address any anticipated geologic problems.
 Discuss potential future follow-up studies that should be recommended, such as engineering
geology reports, geotechnical reports, additional subsurface exploration or more extensive
soil reports.
 Geologic feasibility of the site for the proposed development.
CERTIFICATION
A signature, certification number, and stamp of a Registered Geologist who is certified in the
specialty of Engineering Geology under the provisions of ORS 672.505 to 672.705.
APPENDIX B
GUIDELINES FOR PREPARING
ENGINEERING GEOLOGIC REPORTS IN OREGON
Adopted by The Oregon State Board of Geologist Examiners
This is a suggested guide for the preparation of an engineering geologic report in Oregon. The
engineering geologic report should include sufficient facts and interpretation regarding geologic
materials, processes, and history to allow evaluation of the suitability of the site for the proposed
use. Because of the wide variation in size and complexity of projects and scope of work, the
guidelines are intended to be flexible and should be tailored to the specific project. The
guidelines are intended to be fairly complete; however, not all items would be applicable to small
projects or low-risk sites. In addition, some items may be addressed in separate reports prepared
by a geotechnical engineer, geophysicist, structural engineer, or hydrologist.
The guidelines are based on a publication developed by the Guidelines Committee of the Utah
Section of the Association of Engineering Geologists, a series of guidelines published by the
California Division of Mines and Geology in the CDMG Note series, and the Bulletin of the
Association of Engineering Geologists (Slosson, 1984).
GENERAL INFORMATION
The following items should be addressed:
 Client or party that commissioned the report.
 Name(s) of geologist(s) who did the mapping and other investigation on which the report is
based, and dates when the work was done.
 Location and size of area, and its general setting with respect to major or regional geographic
and geologic features.
 Purpose and scope of the report and geologic investigation, including the proposed use of the
site. Also, identify level of the study, i.e., feasibility, preliminary, final, etc.
 Topography and drainage within or affecting the area.
 General nature, distribution, and abundance of exposures of earth materials within the area.
17.56 - 6
 Nature and source of available subsurface information and geologic reports or maps. Suitable
explanations of the available data should provide a technical reviewer with the means of
evaluating the reliability. Reference to cited works or field observations should be made, to
substantiate opinions and conclusions.
 Disclosure of known or suspected geologic hazards affecting the area, including a statement
regarding past performance of existing facilities (such as buildings or utilities) in the
immediate vicinity.
 Location of test holes and excavations (drill holes, test pits, and trenches) shown on maps
and sections and described in the text of the report. The actual data, or processed data upon
which interpretations are based, should be included in the report to permit technical
reviewers to make their own assessments regarding reliability and interpretation.
 All field and laboratory testing procedures (by ASTM designation, if appropriate) and test
results.
 Disclosure statement of geologist's financial interest, if any, in the project or the client's
organization.
 The signature and seal of the certified engineering geologist who prepared the report.
GEOLOGIC MAPPING AND INVESTIGATION
 Geologic mapping of the area should be done at a scale which shows sufficient detail to
adequately define the geologic conditions present. For many purposes, available published
geologic maps are unsuitable to provide a basis for understanding the site conditions, so
independent geologic mapping is needed. If available published geologic maps are used to
portray site conditions, they must be updated to reflect geologic or topographic changes
which have occurred since map publication. It may be necessary for the geologist to extend
mapping into adjacent areas to adequately define significant geologic conditions.
 Mapping should be done on a suitable topographic base or aerial photograph, at an
appropriate scale with satisfactory horizontal and vertical control. The date and source of the
base should be included on each map or photo.
 The geologist doing the investigation and preparing the map should report the nature of
bedrock and surficial materials, the structural features and relationships, and the threedimensional
distribution of earth materials exposed and inferred within the area. A clear
distinction should be made between observed and inferred features and relationships.
 The report should include one or more appropriately positioned and scaled cross sections to
show subsurface relationships that cannot be adequately described in words alone. Fence or
block diagrams may also be appropriate.
GEOLOGIC DESCRIPTIONS
The report should contain brief but complete descriptions of all natural materials and structural
features recognized or inferred within the subject area. Where interpretations are added to the
recording of direct observations, the basis for such interpretations should be clearly stated.
Describe all field mapping and exploration procedures (surface geologic reconnaissance, drilling,
trenching, geophysical survey, etc.)
The following checklist may be useful as a general, though not necessarily complete, guide for
descriptions:
Bedrock
 Identification of rock types.
 Relative and absolute age and, where possible, correlation with named formations and other
stratigraphic units.
17.56 - 7
 Surface and subsurface expression, areal distribution, and thickness.
 Pertinent physical characteristics (e.g., color, grain size, nature of stratification, strength,
variability).
 Distribution and extent of zones of weathering; significant differences between fresh and
weathered rock.
 Special engineering geologic characteristics or concerns (e.g., factors affecting proposed
grading, construction, and land use).
Structural features - stratification, faults, discontinuities, foliation, schistosity, folds
 Occurrence, distribution, dimensions, orientation and variability; both within and projecting
into the area.
 Relative ages, where pertinent.
 Special features of faults (e.g., topographic expression, zones of gouge and breccia, nature of
offsets, age of movements, youngest faulted unit and oldest unfaulted unit).
 Other significant structural characteristics or concerns.
Surficial deposits - alluvial, colluvial, eolian, glacial, lacustrine, marine, residual, mass
movement, volcanic (such as cinders and ash), and fill.
 Identification of material, grain size, relative age, degree of activity of originating process.
 Distribution, dimensional characteristics, variations in thickness, degree of soil development,
surface expression.

compactness, cementation, strength, thickness, variability).
 Special physical or chemical features (e.g., indications of volume change or instability, such
as expansive clays or peat).
 Other significant engineering geologic characteristics or concerns.
Surface and shallow subsurface hydrologic conditions, including groundwater, springs, and
streams and their possible effect on the site. Indicate how conditions may be affected by
variations in precipitation, temperature, etc.
 Distribution, occurrence, and variations (e.g., drainage courses, ponds, swamps, springs,
seeps, aquifers).
 Identification and characterization of aquifers; depth to groundwater and seasonal
fluctuations, flow direction, gradient, recharge and discharge areas.
 Relationships to topographic and geologic features.
 Evidence for earlier occurrence of water at localities now dry (e.g., vegetation, mineral
deposits, historic records).
 Other significant engineering geologic characteristics or concerns, such as fluctuating water
table and the effects of proposed modifications on future hydrologic processes.
Seismic considerations.
 Description of the seismotectonic setting of the area (including size, frequency, and location
of historic earthquakes), current seismic zoning, and expected seismic risk.
 Potential for area to be affected by surface rupture (including sense and amount of
displacement, and width of surface deformation zone).
 Probable response of site to likely earthquakes (estimated ground motion).
 Potential for area to be affected by earthquake-induced landslides or liquefaction.
 Potential for area to be affected by regional tectonic deformation (subsidence or uplift.
17.56 - 8
ASSESSMENT OF GEOLOGIC FACTORS
Assessment of existing geologic conditions and processes with respect to intended use of the site
constitutes the principal contribution of the report. It involves 1) the effects of the geologic
features upon the proposed grading, construction, and land use, and 2) the effects of these
proposed modifications upon future geologic conditions and processes in the area.
The following checklist includes topics that ordinarily should be considered in discussions,
conclusions, and recommendations in geologic reports:
General suitability of proposed land use to geologic conditions.
 Areas to be avoided, if any, and mitigation alternatives.
 Topography and slope.
 Stability of geologic units.
 Flood and tidal inundation, erosion, and deposition.
 Problems caused by geologic features or conditions in adjacent properties.
 Other general problems.
Identification and extent of known or probable geologic conditions which may result in risk to
the proposed land use (such as flood inundation, shallow groundwater, storm surge, surface and
groundwater pollution, snow avalanche, landslide, debris flow, rock fall, expansive soil,
collapsible soil, subsidence, erosion, deposition, earthquake shaking, fault rupture, tectonic
deformation, liquefaction, seiche, tsunami, volcanic eruption).
Recommendations for site grading.
 Protection of what materials and structural features will be encountered in proposed cuts.
 Prediction of stability based on geologic factors; recommended avoidance or mitigation
alternatives to cope with existing or potential landslide masses.
 Excavation considerations (hard or massive rock, groundwater flows).
 General considerations of proposed fill masses in canyons or on sidehills.
 Suitability of on-site material for use as compacted fill.
 Recommendations for positioning fill masses, provision for subdrainage, buttressing, and the
need for erosion protection on fill slopes.
 Other recommendations required by the proposed land use, such as the angle of cut slopes,
position of drainage terraces, need for rock-fall and/or erosion protection on cut slopes.
Drainage considerations.
 Protection from inundation or wave erosion along shorelines.
 Soil permeability, suitability for septic systems.
 Protection from sheet flood or gulley erosion, and debris flows or mud flows.
Limitations of study, and recommendations for additional investigations. Considering the scope
of work and intended use of the site, provide a statement of the limitations of the study and the
need for additional studies outside the stated scope of work.
 Borings, test pits, and/or trenches needed for additional geologic information.
 Percolation tests needed for design.
17.56 - 9
 Program of subsurface exploration and testing that is most likely to provide data needed by
the soils or civil engineer.
 Program for long-term monitoring of the site to evaluate geologic conditions (survey hubs,
inclinometers, extensometers, etc.).
RECOMMENDED TECHNIQUES/SYSTEMS TO CONSIDER
 Engineering geology mapping can be done using the Genesis-Lithology-Qualifier (GLQ)
system (Keaton, 1984), rather than the conventional Time-Rock system commonly used in
geologic mapping. The GLQ system promotes communication of geology information to
non-geologists. The Unified Soil Classification System (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 1960
- Tech. Memo 3-357, and American Society for Testing and Materials, 1984) has been used
in engineering for many years and has been incorporated into the GLQ system.
 The Unified Rock Classification System (Williamson, 1984) provides a systematic and
reproducible method of describing rock weathering, strength, discontinuities, and density in a
manner directly usable by engineers.
 Systems for mapping landslide deposits are described by Wieczorek (1984) and by McCalpin
(1984).
 Commonly accepted grading requirements are described in Chapter 70 of the Uniform
Building Code.

17.60.20 PERMITTED USES AND ACTIVITIES
This chapter lists permitted uses, or uses allowed under prescribed conditions, within the FSH
overlay district. Where there are conflicts, this chapter supersedes the use provisions of the
underlying district.
A. Restricted Development Areas. Restricted development areas within the FSH overlay district
as shown on the City of Sandy Zoning Map include:
1. Slopes of 25% or greater that (a) encompass at least 1,000 square feet and (b) have an
elevation differential of at least 10 feet.
2. Protected water features, including locally significant wetlands, wetland mitigation areas
approved by the Division of State Lands, and perennial streams.
3. Required setback areas as defined in Section 17.60.30.
B. Permitted Uses. Permitted uses within restricted development areas are limited to the
following:
1. Open space and trails provided they are constructed consistent with standards on file in
the Planning Department.
2. Removal of refuse and permitted fill.
3. Planting of native vegetation species included on a list maintained by the Director.
4. Removal of non-native / invasive vegetation, dead or dying trees or vegetation that is
hazardous to the public.
5. Removal of up to two trees of 6 inches or greater dbh in a calendar year, provided that
each tree removed is replaced with two native trees, each of which must be 1.5 inches or
greater caliper and placed within the restricted development area of the site.
6. Construction or expansion of public facilities or private roads necessary to support
permitted development.
7. Construction or expansion of a single-family residence on a lot-of-record, under the
following prescribed conditions:
a) The applicant must demonstrate that the lot has received planning approval from
either Clackamas County or the City of Sandy and that there is insufficient buildable
land on the same lot to allow the proposed construction or expansion.
b) The site review, engineering, erosion control, water quality and re-vegetation
standards of this chapter have been fully satisfied.
c) The residence or addition has been sited so as to minimize excavation and disturbance
to native vegetation on restricted development areas.
d) The maximum impervious surface coverage resulting from development on restricted
development areas shall be 2,500 square feet. Exception: This standard may be
exceeded to allow a superior private driveway design and location that reduces
adverse impacts to protected areas. To exceed the standard, the applicant must
demonstrate that a longer driveway will avoid required setbacks from protected water
features, and that driveway construction will either: (a) more closely follow hillside
contours and thereby reduce overall cut and fill area by at least 20%; or (b) avoid tree
clusters and thereby reduce the number of 6-inch or greater dbh trees that must be
removed by at least 20%.
e) The option of an adjustment under Section 17.60.100 has been considered as a means
of avoiding or minimizing impacts on restricted development areas.
17.60 - 4
Revised by Ordinance No. 2019-01 effective 1/07/19

Revised by Ordinance No. 2019-01 effective 1/07/19
B. Minimize Impacts. Natural vegetation shall be preserved and enhanced and excavation
minimized within required water quality setback areas.
C. Exceptions, Intent. Exception 1 below recognizes that existing hillside, stormwater detention
and erosion control measures are sufficient to maintain water quality and quantity in areas of
steep slopes separated from streams and wetlands by improved public streets in existing
rights-of-way. Exception 2 recognizes that No Name Creek east of Towle Drive has been
severely impacted by culverting, erosion and invasive plants, and has only a few remaining
infill sites adjacent to its banks. This exception is intended to encourage appropriate
development of these infill sites and the opening and restoration of this stream reach over
time.
1. Land lying within the FSH overlay district, but upland from an existing public right-ofway
with an improved public street, shall not be subject to the steep slope restrictions of
this chapter. Such land shall remain subject to applicable Section 17.56 Hillside
Regulations and shall comply with required setbacks set forth in subsection 17.60.30.A.3
above.
a. Applications for development that include only areas that meet this exception and
have existing improved public streets and have no locally significant mapped
wetlands are not subject to the provisions of this chapter.
2. The required setback for No Name Creek east of the Towle Drive crossing may be
reduced to 25 feet, subject to approval of a stream bank restoration plan that meets the
standards of Section 17.60.20.B.10.

17.62.90 CRITERIA FOR DEMOLITION OR REMOVAL OF CHR DESIGNATION
The importance to the public of retaining the object, site or structure shall be weighed against the
hardship to the owner and any potential hazard to the public if the site or structure is to be
retained.
The demolition of a historic building is an irrecoverable loss to the community, therefore special
criteria are established and shall be considered before issuing a permit for demolition.
The Planning Commission and City Council shall make findings based on, but not limited to, the
following:
A. The historic or architectural significance of the landmark.
17.62 - 6
B. The physical condition of the building.
C. The economic use of the building and economic reuse of the property.
D. The proposed new use.
E. The economic, social, environmental and energy consequences of allowing the demolition as
opposed to preserving the historic building.
F. If within a historic district, its contribution to the district and the subsequent integrity of the
district once the structure is demolished.

CHAPTER 17.64 - PLANNED DEVELOPMENT
17.64.00 INTENT
The Planned Development regulations are intended to:
A. Refine and implement village development patterns designated V on the Comprehensive
Plan Map.
B. Allow the relocation of zones within designated villages, provided that the overall intent of
the village designation is maintained.
C. Allow a mixture of densities between base zones within the planned development.
D. Promote flexibility in site planning and architectural design, placement, and clustering of
structures.
E. Provide for efficient use of public facilities and energy.
F. Encourage the conservation of natural features.
G. Provide usable and suitable recreation facilities and public or common facilities.
H. Allow coordination of architectural styles, building forms and relationships.
I. Promote attractive and functional business environments in non-residential zones, which are
compatibility with surrounding development.
17.64.10 GENERAL PROVISIONS
A. Combined Review. The procedures of this chapter require review of both a Conceptual
Development Plan and a Detailed Development Plan. Requests may be made sequentially or
for a combined review. In the event of a combined review, the Planning Commission shall
forward a recommendation regarding the plans to the City Council, and the City Council
shall make a final decision approving, approving with conditions or denying the application.
B. Development Permit Issuance. Development permits are only issued following approval of a
Detailed Development Plan.
C. Planned Development Required if relocating Village zones. Areas designated V on the
Comprehensive Plan Map require a planned development application if any zone relocation
is requested. Development consistent with the V base zoning may proceed under the base
zone provisions, subject to design review, without application for a planned development.
17.64.20 AREAS OF APPLICATION
Planned developments are allowed in all zones.
17.64.30 DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
A. Variation from Development Code Standards Generally. The development standards of the
base zone, overlay zone or planned development overlay apply unless they are superseded by
the standards of this chapter, or are modified during a Planned Development review. The
Planned Development and Specific Area Plan review processes allow modification of
development code standards that are dimensional and/or quantitative, however a base zones
minimum density is not eligible for modification under any circumstances, including a
modification under Chapter 17.66.
17.64 - 2
Revised by Ordinance 2005-02 effective 2/22/05
B. Minimum Site Area. A planned development may be established on any parcel of land, or on
more than one parcel of land if those parcels are abutting.
17.64.40 DENSITY CALCULATION
The maximum number of allowable dwelling units shall be the sum of densities allowed by the
underlying zone(s) unless an increase is authorized as otherwise allowed in this chapter.
A. Residential Zones. The calculation is based on a determination of gross site area and the
acreage of any restricted development areas (as defined by Chapter 17.60). A specific
determination of density shall be made pursuant to Chapter 17.30. When a PD is located in
more than one R zone, the total allowed number of units is the sum of the number of units
allowed by each zone. The dwelling units may be placed without regard to zone boundaries.
B. Commercial and Industrial Zones. The allowed density is only restricted by the provisions of
the base zone with respect to parking, setbacks, landscaping, etc., or as modified during
Detailed Development Plan review.
C. Increase in Density. An increase in density of up to 25% of the number of dwelling units may
be permitted upon a finding that the Planned Development is outstanding in planned land use
and design, and provides exceptional advantages in living conditions and amenities not found
in similar developments constructed under regular zoning.
D. Density Transfer. A transfer of density may be allowed by the Planning Commission when
consistent with the review criteria of Chapter 17.64.100 C. Density may be transferred across
zone district boundaries.
E. Reconfiguration of Village Zones. Reconfiguration of the base zones within a Village may be
modified through the Conceptual Development review process, provided that no more than a
20% change in acreage results between existing and proposed residential and non-residential
zones. The intent of this provision is to allow flexibility and potential for improved Village
design through the planned development process.
17.64.50 OPEN SPACE AND PARKLAND
All Planned Developments shall provide a minimum percentage of the total area in open space as
specified below. In addition to required open space, all Planned Developments that include
residential housing shall also provide a required parkland dedication as specified in Chapter
17.86.
A. Residential Zones. A minimum of 25% of the total site area.
B. Commercial or Industrial Zones. A minimum of 15% of the total tract area.
C. Payment in Lieu of Dedication. At the citys discretion only, the city may accept payment of
a fee in lieu of land dedication. The amount of the fee in lieu of land dedication (in dollars
per acre) shall set by City Council Resolution or determined by a current land appraisal. The
City may also allow open space land donation requirements to be fulfilled on another parcel.
D. The following factors shall be used in the choice of whether to accept land or cash in lieu:
a. The topography, geology, access to, parcel size, and location of land to be dedicated;
b. Potential adverse/beneficial effects on environmentally sensitive areas;
17.64 - 3
Revised by Ordinance 2005-02 effective 2/22/05
c. Compatibility with the Parks Master Plan, Public Facilities element of the
Comprehensive Plan, and the City of Sandy Capital Improvements Program in effect at
the time of dedication;
d. Availability of previously acquired property; and
e. The feasibility of dedication.
E. The types of open space that may be provided are as follows:
a. Natural Areas: areas of undisturbed vegetation, steep slopes, stream corridors, wetlands,
wildlife habitat areas or areas replanted with native vegetation after construction.
b. Greenways: linear green belts linking residential areas with other open space areas.
These greenways may contain bicycle paths or footpaths. Connecting greenways
between residences and recreational areas are encouraged.
F. Dedication Procedures. Open space as part of Planned Development application shall be
dedicated according to the requirements of Section 17.86.50.
17.64.60 ALLOWED USES
A. Residential Districts:
1. Uses permitted in the underlying district
2. Housing types may include, but are not limited to, single family dwellings, duplexes, row
houses, clustered dwelling units, multiple family dwellings, or manufactured dwellings.
3. Related commercial uses as part of the development
4. Related community service uses as part of the development
5. Accessory buildings and uses
B. Commercial Districts:
1. Uses permitted in the underlying district
2. Community service uses
3. Other uses approved as part of the Detailed Development Plan
4. Accessory buildings and uses
17.64.70 OFFICIAL ZONING MAP
When a Planned Development project has been approved, the official Zoning Map shall be
amended by ordinance to denote the new PD Planned Development overlay designation. Such
an amendment is a ministerial act, and Chapter 17.26, Zoning District Amendments, shall not
apply when the map is amended to denote a PD overlay.
17.64.80 CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN PROCEDURE
A. The Planning Commission shall review the Conceptual Development Plan at a public hearing
and forward a recommendation for approval, approval with modifications, or denial of the
application to the City Council for consideration.
B. The City Council shall review the recommendation at a public hearing and take action based
on the Planning Commission recommendation. The City Council may approve, approve with
modifications, or deny the application. Approval of the Conceptual Development Plan shall
be limited to the tentative acceptability of the land uses proposed and their interrelationships
and shall not be construed to endorse precise locations of uses nor engineering feasibility.
17.64 - 4

application), including extensions.
17.64.150 NONCOMPLIANCE WITH THE APPROVED DETAILED DEVELOPMENT
PLAN
If the Director determines that the development substantially differs from the approved plans, the
Director shall notify the developer in writing. Thereafter, the city may issue orders to the
developer within the range of discretion available, and upon continued noncompliance may
withhold building permits for further construction or revoke those permits previously issued until
compliance is achieved, or pursue any other remedies available to the City.
17.64.160 PLANNED DEVELOPMENT NULLIFICATION
If no development has occurred for an approved Planned development, and development plan
approval has expired under 17.64.140, an applicant may seek to have the PD zoning overlay
designation removed from the subject property.
17.64 - 10
Revised by Ordinance 2005-02 effective 2/22/05
A. Property owner(s) or their authorized agents may apply to nullify an established Planned
Development designation by filing an application on a form provided by the Director.
1. The City Council shall conduct a public hearing and provide notice of the hearing and the
decision in accordance with Chapter 17.20-Public Hearings.
B. The burden of proof is placed on the applicant to justify nullification of the Planned
Development designation, giving substantial evidence that:
1. Developing the property under conventional district standards and regulations will not
create nonconforming development.
2. Special circumstances such as building relationships, drainage ways, public
improvements, topography, and so forth that were to be responded to specifically through
the Planned Development process can be dealt with as effectively with conventional
standards.
3. Conditions attached to the approved Planned Development by the hearing authority can
be met or are no longer necessary.
4. No prior commitments involving the property were made that would adversely affect the
subject property, other related properties, or the city, as in the case of density transfer,
public improvements and activities, building relationships, recreational facilities, open
space, or phasing of development.
C. If the Planned Development is nullified, the PD overlay designation shall be removed from
the Official Zoning District Map after the appeal period has expired. The removal of the
designation from the map shall be a ministerial act and shall not implicate Chapter 17.26,
Zoning District Amendments.
17.66 - 1
CHAPTER 17.66 - ADJUSTMENTS & VARIANCES
17.66.00 INTENT
Adjustments and variances are procedures to vary development standards normally applied to a
particular district.
17.66.10 ADJUSTMENTS
Adjustments are a Type I or Type II procedure that provide a means to vary the development
standards normally applied in a particular district. This option exists for those circumstances
where uniform; unvarying rules would prevent a more efficient use of a lot. A typical example is
permitting a structure to be located closer to a property boundary than normally allowed by the
zoning district regulations.
Adjustments apply only to individual lots and therefore cannot be used by applicants seeking to
vary development standards for lots to be created through a subdivision process. Modifications
to land divisions standards should be sought through the Type II or Type III Variance process or
where appropriate, the Planned Development process.
An adjustment is intended to:
A. Allow more efficient use of land.
B. Provide flexibility and innovation in site planning and architectural design on individual lots.
C. Permit building location and/or construction techniques that conserve energy.
D. Minimize procedural delays and ensure due process in the review of unique development
situations.
E. Provide relief from the strict adherence of land division development standards where sitespecific
physical or functional land development conditions warrant a variance.
17.66.20 TYPE I ADJUSTMENTS
In issuing a permit the Director may grant or deny an adjustment under the Type I procedure if
the request involves only the expansion or reduction by not more than 10% of one or more
quantifiable provisions of this code.
17.66.30 TYPE II ADJUSTMENTS
Except in the case of a nonconforming development or use, the Director may grant or deny an
adjustment under the Type II procedure if the request involves only the expansion or reduction
by not more than 20% of one or more quantifiable provisions of this code.
17.66.40 TYPE I AND II ADJUSTMENT CRITERIA
A. The proposed development will not be contrary to the purposes of this chapter, policies of the
Comprehensive Plan, and any other applicable policies and standards adopted by the City;
17.66 - 2
B. The proposed development will not substantially reduce the amount of privacy enjoyed by
users of nearby structures when compared to the same development located as specified by
this Code;
C. The proposed development will not adversely affect existing physical systems and natural
systems, such as traffic, drainage, dramatic land forms, or parks; and
D. Architectural features of the proposed development will be compatible to the design
character of existing structures on adjoining properties and on the proposed development site.
17.66.50 ADJUSTMENT LIMITATIONS
Adjustments may not be utilized to:
A. Reduce width of accessways required for flag lots created through the land partition or minor
replat process
B. Reduce the area reserved for private outdoor space and/or usable open space by more than
10%
C. Reduce project site amenities such as screening and/or landscaping provisions by more than
10%
D. Increase fence height inside clear-vision areas
17.66.60 VARIANCES
Variances are a means of requesting a complete waiver or major adjustment to certain
development standards. They may be requested for a specific lot or as part of a land division
application. The Type II variance process is generally reserved for major adjustments on
individual lots, while variances to development standards proposed as part of a land division are
processed as a Type III application (requiring a public hearing).
17.66.70 TYPE II AND TYPE III VARIANCE CRITERIA
The authority to grant a variance does not include authority to approve a development that is
designed, arranged or intended for a use not otherwise approvable in the location. The criteria are
as follows:
A. The circumstances necessitating the variance are not of the applicants making.
B. The hardship does not arise from a violation of this Code, and approval will not allow
otherwise prohibited uses in the district in which the property is located.
C. Granting of the variance will not adversely affect implementation of the Comprehensive
Plan.
D. The variance authorized will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare or materially
injurious to other property in the vicinity.
17.66 - 3
E. The development will be the same as development permitted under this code and City
standards to the greatest extent that is reasonably possible while permitting some economic
use of the land.
F. Special circumstances or conditions apply to the property which do not apply generally to
other properties in the same zone or vicinity, and result from lot size or shape (legally
existing prior to the effective date of this Code), topography, or other circumstances over
which the applicant has no control.
17.66.80 TYPE III SPECIAL VARIANCES
The Planning Commission may grant a special variance waiving a specified provision for under
the Type III procedure if it finds that the provision is unreasonable and unwarranted due to the
specific nature of the proposed development. In submitting an application for a Type III Special
Variance, the proposed development explanation shall provide facts and evidence sufficient to
enable the Planning Commission to make findings in compliance with the criteria set forth in this
section while avoiding conflict with the Comprehensive Plan.
One of the following sets of criteria shall be applied as appropriate.
A. The unique nature of the proposed development is such that:
1. The intent and purpose of the regulations and of the provisions to be waived will not be
violated; and

welfare and will not be injurious to other property in the area when compared with the
effects of development otherwise permitted.
B. The variance approved is the minimum variance needed to permit practical compliance with
a requirement of another law or regulation.
C. When restoration or replacement of a nonconforming development is necessary due to
damage by fire, flood, or other casual or natural disaster, the restoration or replacement will
decrease the degree of the previous noncompliance to the greatest extent possible.

CHAPTER 17.68 - CONDITIONAL USES
17.68.00 INTENT
Certain uses listed in each zoning district require special review to determine what their effects
may be to the surrounding properties, neighborhood, and community as a whole. The Minor
Conditional Use Permit (Type II) and Conditional Use Permit (Type III) processes provide an
opportunity to allow a use when potential adverse effects can be mitigated or deny a use if
concerns cannot be resolved.
It is the intent of this chapter to permit minor conditional uses or conditional uses that are
consistent with the Comprehensive Plan, subject to procedures and criteria intended to mitigate
potentially negative impacts.
Procedures and review criteria for conditional development are established for the following
purpose:
A. Permit certain types of public and private development that provides a community service in
locations related to their service areas.
B. Permit commercial development in locations related to its service area.
C. Ensure that a conditional use is compatible with its immediate area and the affected part of
the community
17.68.10 PROCEDURES

1. Relationship of the site to adjoining properties, streets, alleys, structures, public utilities,
and drainage way with sufficient information on land areas within at least 300 ft. of the
subject property specifically addressing land uses, lot lines, circulation systems
(including potential for connectivity of streets and pedestrian ways), public facilities, and
unique natural features of the landscape.
2. Boundary of the proposed conditional use and any interior boundaries related to proposed
development phases.
2. Lot line dimensions

CHAPTER 17.72 - CONGREGATE HOUSING
17.72.00 PURPOSE
The purpose of a CH district is to provide housing alternatives for elderly or handicapped
persons. The standards set forth in this section are intended to insure that congregate housing
developments provide a minimum of services and facilities to accommodate the needs of the
residents and to relieve any possible detrimental effects of the development on surrounding
properties.
17.72.10 JUSTIFICATION
This chapter recognizes that housing for senior citizens and handicapped persons customarily has
less impact on surrounding properties than typical multi-family developments providing the
same number, or fewer units, and therefore, deserves special consideration.
17.72.20 ESTABLISHMENT OF CONGREGATE HOUSING
Congregate housing facilities may be permitted as conditional uses in the R-2, R-3 and C-1
zoning districts.
17.72.30 DENSITY STANDARDS
The Planning Commission may increase the underlying density of the zoning district through the
conditional use permit process if warranted based on the size of the dwelling units, number of
proposed occupants, lesser impact on surrounding properties, and other relevant factors. Density
is limited to the increase in the following chart:
Zone Percentage of Increase
R-2 25%
R-3 50%
C-1 50%
17.72.40 DIMENSIONAL STANDARDS
The setbacks and height limitations shall be in compliance with the standards of the underlying
zoning district.
Type Standard
Minimum Lot Width, Depth, Frontage, Setbacks,
Projections, & Accessory Structures, and Height
Same as underlying district
Landscaping 20%
Off-Street Parking See Chapter 17.98
17.72.50 ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS
A. Age Restriction. Congregate housing is intended for persons fifty-five (55) years of age and
older or handicapped persons.
17.72 - 2
B. Any principal or accessory use allowed in the zoning district may be provided. These uses
shall be primarily for residents and guests.
C. Community Space. All complexes shall have a minimum of 15 square feet of community
space for social and recreational opportunities per occupant, based on one person per
bedroom. Community space may include, but is not limited to:
1. Game room, meeting rooms, music or craft rooms.
2. Congregate Dining Facilities. Complexes with or without kitchen facilities in each unit
may include congregate dining facilities providing regular daily meals for residents.
Areas used as congregate dining areas may be applied to the minimum community space
requirements.
D. Laundry and Storage. A minimum of 10 square feet of general storage area (80 cu. Ft.) other
than regular kitchen, bedroom and linen storage shall be provided within each unit.
Complexes, which do not include laundry facilities in the units, shall have adequate laundry
facilities accessible to all tenants.
E. Design Standards. The design of the building and the site and landscaping plans shall be
subject to review. Special considerations for this use may include, but are not limited to:
1. Compatibility in style, colors, materials, and scale with the general character of the
neighborhood.
2. Defining semi-public, semi-private and private spaces.

CHAPTER 17.74 - ACCESSORY DEVELOPMENT
ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS AND PROCEDURES
17.74.00 INTENT
These provisions are intended to establish the relationship between principal and accessory
development and specify criteria for regulating accessory developments.
In addition to uses expressly included in each zoning district as primary or conditional uses each
district shall provide for accessory developments identified in this chapter. When a proposed
accessory use is not specified, the Director shall determine the appropriateness of the use and
whether it is customarily associated with, and subordinate to, the principal development. The
Director shall base the decision on the similarity of the proposed accessory development to those
developments specifically identified as accessory to the principal developments and the
relationship between the proposed accessory development and principal development. The
Directors determination shall be made in accordance with procedures set forth in Chapter 17.14
- Request for Interpretation.
17.74.10 RESIDENTIAL ACCESSORY STRUCTURES
Accessory structures (sheds) may be constructed or installed when in conformance with the
standards of this section. A detached accessory structure shall be separated from the primary
structure by at least six (6) feet. An accessory structure located closer than six (6) feet from the
primary structure shall be considered attached and is required to comply with the same setbacks
as the primary structure.
A. Detached Accessory Structure Setbacks.
Table 17.74.10 below and Figures 17.74.10-A and B specify setbacks for detached accessory
structures. If not specified below, these structures are subject to the standards identified in
the respective zoning district where the structure is to be located. For purposes of these
regulations, solariums, greenhouses, garages or other enclosed areas which are attached to
the residential structure shall not be considered accessory but shall be considered part of the
main dwelling. Rigid frame fabric structures are considered accessory structures subject to
these standards.

Revised by Ordinance No. 2020-13 (effective 08/05/20)
C. The site must be contiguous to the city or separated from it only by a public right-of-way or a
stream, bay, lake or other body of water; and
D. The site has not violated Section 17.78.25.
17.78.25 TREE RETENTION
The intent of this section is to treat property with annexation potential (in the UGB) as if it had
been subject, prior to annexation, to the tree retention provisions of the City's Urban Forestry
Ordinance (Chapter 17.102) and Flood and Slope Hazard (FSH) Overlay District (Chapter
17.60), to discourage property owners from removing trees prior to annexation as a way of
avoiding Urban Forestry Ordinance provisions, and to prevent unnecessary tree removal for
future subdivision layout. In accordance with ORS 527.722, the State Forester shall provide the
City with a copy of the notice or written plan when a forest operation is proposed within the
UGB. The City shall review and comment on an individual forest operation and inform the
landowner or operator of all other regulations that apply but that do not pertain to activities
regulated under the Oregon Forest Practices Act.
A. Properties shall not be considered for annexation for a minimum of ten (10) years if any of
the following apply:
1. Where any trees six (6) inches or greater diameter at breast height (DBH) have been
removed within 25 feet of the high water level along a perennial stream in the ten (10)
years prior to the annexation application.
2. Where more than two (2) trees (six (6) inches or greater DBH) per 500 linear feet have
been removed in the area between 25 feet and 80 feet of the high water level of Tickle
Creek in the ten (10) years prior to the annexation application.
3. Where more than two (2) trees (six (6) inches or greater DBH) per 500 linear feet have
been removed in the area between 25 feet and 50 feet of the high water level along other
perennial streams in the ten (10) years prior to the annexation application.
4. Where any trees six (6) inches or greater DBH have been removed on 25 percent or
greater slopes in the ten (10) years prior to the annexation application.
5. Where more than ten (10) trees (11 inches or greater DBH) per gross acre have been
removed in the ten (10) years prior to the annexation application, except as provided
below:
a. Sites under one (1) acre in area shall not remove more than five (5) trees in the ten
(10) years prior to the annexation application.
b. Sites where removal of ten (10) or fewer trees will result in the site not meeting
the minimum tree retention requirements of Chapter 17.102, Urban Forestry.
c. For properties in or adjacent to the Bornstedt Village Overlay (BVO), tree
removal must not result in fewer than six (6) healthy 11 inch DBH or greater trees
17.78 - 3
Revised by Ordinance No. 2020-13 (effective 08/05/20)
per acre. For properties in or adjacent to the BVO and within 300 feet of the FSH
Overlay District, tree removal must not result in fewer than nine (9) healthy 11
inch DBH or greater trees per acre.
Rounding: Site area shall be rounded to the nearest half acre and allowed tree removal
shall be calculated accordingly. For example, a 1.5 acre site will not be allowed to
remove more than fifteen (15) trees in the ten (10) years prior to the annexation
application. A calculation of 1.2 acres is rounded down to one (1) acre and a calculation
of 1.8 is rounded up to two (2) acres.
Cumulative Calculation: Total gross acreage includes riparian areas and other sensitive
habitat. Trees removed under Sections 17.78.25(A) 2. and 3. shall count towards tree
removal under Section 17.78.25(A) 5.
B. Exceptions. The City Council may grant exceptions to this section where:
1. The property owner can demonstrate that Douglas Fir, Western Red Cedar, or other
appropriate native trees were planted at a ratio of at least two trees for every one tree
removed no less than ten (10) years prior to the submission of the annexation
application, and at least 50 percent of these trees have remained healthy; or
2. The Council finds that tree removal was necessary due to hazards, or right-of-way or
utility facilities or access; or
3. The trees were removed because they were dead, dying, or diseased and their
condition as such resulted from an accident or non-human cause, as determined by a
certified arborist or other qualified professional; or
4. The trees removed were nuisance trees; or
5. The trees were removed as part of a stream restoration and enhancement program
approved by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife as improving riparian
function; or
6. The trees removed were orchard trees, Christmas trees, or commercial nursery trees
grown for commercial purposes; or
7. The application of this section will create an island of unincorporated area.
17.78.30 ZONING OF ANNEXED AREAS

CHAPTER 17.80 - ADDITIONAL SETBACKS ON COLLECTOR & ARTERIAL
STREETS
17.80.00 INTENT
The requirement of additional special setbacks for development on arterial or collector is
intended to provide better light, air and vision on more heavily traveled streets. The additional
setback, on substandard streets, will protect collector and arterial streets and permit the eventual
widening of streets.
17.80.10 APPLICABLITY
These regulations apply to all collector and arterial streets as identified in the latest adopted
Sandy Transportation System Plan (TSP). The Central Business District (C-1) is exempt from
Chapter 17.80 regulations.
17.80.20 SPECIFIC SETBACKS
Any structure located on streets listed above or identified in the Transportation System Plan as
arterials or collectors shall have a minimum setback of 20 feet measured from the property line.
This applies to applicable front, rear and side yards.

CHAPTER 17.82 - SPECIAL SETBACKS ON TRANSIT STREETS
17.82.00 INTENT
The intent is to provide for convenient, direct, and accessible pedestrian access to and from
public sidewalks and transit facilities; provide a safe, pleasant and enjoyable pedestrian
experience by connecting activities within a structure to the adjacent sidewalk and/or transit
street; and, promote the use of pedestrian, bicycle, and transit modes of transportation.
17.82.10 APPLICABILITY
This chapter applies to all residential development located adjacent to a transit street. A transit
street is defined as any street designated as a collector or arterial, unless otherwise designated in
the Transit System Plan.
17.82.20 BUILDING ORIENTATION
A. All residential dwellings shall have their primary entrances oriented toward a transit street
rather than a parking area, or if not adjacent to a transit street, toward a public right-of-way
or private walkway which leads to a transit street.
B. Dwellings shall have a primary entrance connecting directly between the street and building
interior. A clearly marked, convenient, safe and lighted pedestrian route shall be provided to
the entrance, from the transit street. The pedestrian route shall consist of materials such as
concrete, asphalt, stone, brick, permeable pavers, or other materials as approved by the
Director. The pedestrian path shall be permanently affixed to the ground with gravel
subsurface or a comparable subsurface as approved by the Director.
C. Primary dwelling entrances shall be architecturally emphasized and visible from the street
and shall include a covered porch at least 5 feet in depth.
D. If the site has frontage on more than one transit street, the dwelling shall provide one main
entrance oriented to a transit street or to a corner where two transit streets intersect.
17.84 - 1
CHAPTER 17.84 - IMPROVEMENTS REQUIRED WITH DEVELOPMENT
17.84.00 INTENT
This chapter provides general information regarding improvements required with residential,
commercial, and industrial development. It is intended to clarify timing, extent, and standards for
improvements required in conjunction with development. In addition to the standards in this
chapter, additional standards for specific situations are contained in other chapters.
17.84.10 EXCEPTIONS

exception of 17.84.30 Pedestrian Requirements.
17.84.20 TIMING OF IMPROVEMENTS
A. All improvements required by the standards in this chapter shall be installed concurrently
with development, as follows:
1. Where a land division is proposed, each proposed lot shall have required public and
franchise utility improvements installed or financially guaranteed in accordance with the
provisions of Chapter 17 prior to approval of the final plat.
2. Where a land division is not proposed, the site shall have required public and franchise
utility improvements installed or financially guaranteed in accordance with the provisions
of Chapter 17 prior to temporary or final occupancy of structures.
B. Where specific approval for a phasing plan has been granted for a planned development
and/or subdivision, improvements may similarly be phased in accordance with that plan.
17.84.30 PEDESTRIAN AND BICYCLIST REQUIREMENTS
A. Sidewalks shall be required along both sides of all arterial, collector, and local streets, as
follows:
1. Sidewalks shall be a minimum of 5 ft. wide on local streets. The sidewalks shall be
separated from curbs by a tree planting area that provides separation between sidewalk

planting area, except as necessary to continue an existing curb-tight sidewalk. The
planting area shall be landscaped with trees and plant materials approved by the City. The
sidewalks shall be a minimum of 6 ft. wide.
3. Sidewalk improvements shall be made according to city standards, unless the city
determines that the public benefit in the particular case does not warrant imposing a
severe adverse impact to a natural or other significant feature such as requiring removal
of a mature tree, requiring undue grading, or requiring modification to an existing
building. Any exceptions to the standards shall generally be in the following order.
a) Narrow landscape strips
b) Narrow sidewalk or portion of sidewalk to no less than 4 feet in width

the site, generally with building permits, except as noted in (c) below.
c) Where sidewalks on local streets abut common areas, drainageways, or other publicly
owned or semi-publicly owned areas, the sidewalks and planted areas shall be
installed with street improvements.
B. Safe and convenient pedestrian and bicyclist facilities that strive to minimize travel distance
to the extent practicable shall be provided in conjunction with new development within and
between new subdivisions, planned developments, commercial developments, industrial
areas, residential areas, public transit stops, school transit stops, and neighborhood activity
centers such as schools and parks, as follows:
1. For the purposes of this section, safe and convenient means pedestrian and bicyclist
facilities that: are reasonably free from hazards which would interfere with or discourage
travel for short trips; provide a direct route of travel between destinations; and meet the
travel needs of pedestrians and bicyclists considering destination and length of trip.
2. To meet the intent of B above, right-of-ways connecting cul-de-sacs or passing through
unusually long or oddly shaped blocks shall be a minimum of 15 ft. wide with 8 feet of
pavement.
3. 12 feet wide pathways shall be provided in areas with high bicycle volumes or multiple
use by bicyclists, pedestrians, and joggers.
4. Pathways and sidewalks shall be encouraged in new developments by clustering
buildings or constructing convenient pedestrian ways. Pedestrian walkways shall be
provided in accordance with the following standards:
a) The pedestrian circulation system shall be at least five feet in width and shall connect
the sidewalk on each abutting street to the main entrance of the primary structure on
the site to minimize out of direction pedestrian travel.
b) Walkways at least five feet in width shall be provided to connect the pedestrian
circulation system with existing or planned pedestrian facilities which abut the site
but are not adjacent to the streets abutting the site.

maintain ease of access for pedestrians from abutting streets, pedestrian facilities, and
transit stops.
e) With the exception of walkway/driveway crossings, walkways shall be separated
from vehicle parking or vehicle maneuvering areas by grade, different paving
material, painted crosshatching or landscaping. They shall be constructed in
accordance with the sidewalk standards adopted by the City. (This provision does not
require a separated walkway system to collect drivers and passengers from cars that
have parked on site unless an unusual parking lot hazard exists).
f) Pedestrians amenities such as covered walk-ways, awnings, visual corridors and
benches will be encouraged. For every two benches provided, the minimum parking
requirements will be reduced by one, up to a maximum of four benches per site.
Benches shall have direct access to the circulation system.
C. Where a development site is traversed by or adjacent to a future trail linkage identified within
the Transportation System Plan, improvement of the trail linkage shall occur concurrent with
17.84 - 3
development. Dedication of the trail to the City shall be provided in accordance with
17.84.80.
D. To provide for orderly development of an effective pedestrian network, pedestrian facilities
installed concurrent with development of a site shall be extended through the site to the edge
of adjacent property(ies).
E. To ensure improved access between a development site and an existing developed facility
such as a commercial center, school, park, or trail system, the Planning Commission or
Director may require off-site pedestrian facility improvements concurrent with development.
17.84.40 TRANSIT AND SCHOOL BUS TRANSIT REQUIREMENTS
A. Development sites located along existing or planned transit routes shall, where appropriate,
incorporate bus pull-outs and/or shelters into the site design. These improvements shall be
installed in accordance with the guidelines and standards of the transit agency. School bus
pull-outs and/or shelters may also be required, where appropriate, as a condition of approval
for a residential development of greater than 50 dwelling units where a school bus pick-up
point is anticipated to serve a large number of children.
B. New developments at or near existing or planned transit or school bus transit stops shall
design development sites to provide safe, convenient access to the transit system, as follows:
1. Commercial and civic use developments shall provide a prominent entrance oriented
towards arterial and collector streets, with front setbacks reduced as much as possible to
provide access for pedestrians, bicycles, and transit.
2. All developments shall provide safe, convenient pedestrian walkways between the
buildings and the transit stop, in accordance with the provisions of 17.84.30 B.
17.84.50 STREET REQUIREMENTS
A. Traffic evaluations may be required of all development proposals in accordance with the
following:
1. A proposal establishing the scope of the traffic evaluation shall be submitted for review
to the City Engineer. The evaluation requirements shall reflect the magnitude of the
project in accordance with accepted traffic engineering practices. Large projects should
assess all nearby key intersections. Once the scope of the traffic evaluation has been
approved, the applicant shall present the results with and an overall site development
proposal. If required by the City Engineer, such evaluations shall be signed by a Licensed
Professional Civil Engineer or Licensed Professional Traffic Engineer licensed in the
State of Oregon.
2. If the traffic evaluation identifies level-of-service conditions less than the minimum
standard established in the Transportation System Plan, improvements and funding
strategies mitigating the problem shall be considered concurrent with a development
proposal.
B. Location of new arterial streets shall conform to the Transportation System Plan in
accordance with the following:
1. Arterial streets should generally be spaced in one-mile intervals.
2. Traffic signals should generally not be spaced closer than 1500 ft. for reasonable traffic
progression.
17.84 - 4
C. Local streets shall be designed to discourage through traffic. NOTE: for the purposes of this
section, through traffic means the traffic traveling through an area that does not have a
local origination or destination. To discourage through traffic and excessive vehicle speeds
the following street design characteristics shall be considered, as well as other designs
intended to discourage traffic:
1. Straight segments of local streets should be kept to less than a quarter mile in length. As
practical, local streets should include traffic calming features, and design features such as
curves and T intersections while maintaining pedestrian connectivity.
2. Local streets should typically intersect in T configurations rather than 4-way
intersections to minimize conflicts and discourage through traffic. Adjacent T
intersections shall maintain a minimum of 150 ft. between the nearest edges of the 2
rights-of-way.
3. Cul-de-sacs should generally not exceed 400 ft. in length nor serve more than 20
dwelling units, except in cases where existing topography, wetlands, or drainage systems
or other existing features necessitate a longer cul-de-sac in order to provide adequate
access to an area. Cul-de-sacs longer than 400 feet or developments with only one access
point may be required to provide an alternative access for emergency vehicle use only,
install fire prevention sprinklers, or provide other mitigating measures, determined by the
City.
D. Development sites shall be provided with access from a public street improved to City
standards in accordance with the following:
1. Where a development site abuts an existing public street not improved to City standards,
the abutting street shall be improved to City standards along the full frontage of the
property concurrent with development.
2. Half-street improvements are considered the minimum required improvement. Threequarter-
street or full-street improvements shall be required where traffic volumes
generated by the development are such that a half-street improvement would cause safety
and/or capacity problems. Such a determination shall be made by the City Engineer.
3. To ensure improved access to a development site consistent with policies on orderly
urbanization and extension of public facilities the Planning Commission or Director may
require off-site improvements concurrent with development. Off-site improvement
requirements upon the site developer shall be reasonably related to the anticipated
impacts of the development.
4. Reimbursement agreements for ¾ street improvements (i.e., curb face to curb face) may
be requested by the developer per Chapter 12 of the SMC.
5. A ½ street improvement includes curb and pavement 2 feet beyond the center line of the
right-of-way. A ¾ street improvement includes curbs on both sides of the side and full
pavement between curb faces.
17.84 - 5
E. As necessary to provide for orderly development of adjacent properties, public streets
installed concurrent with development of a site shall be extended through the site to the edge
of the adjacent property(ies) in accordance with the following:
1. Temporary dead-ends created by this requirement to extend street improvements to the
edge of adjacent properties may be installed without turn-arounds, subject to the approval
of the Fire Marshal.
2. In order to assure the eventual continuation or completion of the street, reserve strips may
be required.
F. Where required by the Planning Commission or Director, public street improvements may be
required through a development site to provide for the logical extension of an existing street
network or to connect a site with a nearby neighborhood activity center, such as a school or
park. Where this creates a land division incidental to the development, a land partition shall
be completed concurrent with the development.
G. Except for extensions of existing streets, no street names shall be used that will duplicate or
be confused with names of existing streets. Street names and numbers shall conform to the
established pattern in the surrounding area and be subject to approval of the Director.
H. Location, grades, alignment, and widths for all public streets shall be considered in relation
to existing and planned streets, topographical conditions, public convenience and safety, and
proposed land use. Where topographical conditions present special circumstances, exceptions
to these standards may be granted by the City Engineer provided the safety and capacity of
the street network is not adversely affected. The following standards shall apply:
1. Location of streets in a development shall not preclude development of adjacent
properties. Streets shall conform to planned street extensions identified in the
Transportation Plan and/or provide for continuation of the existing street network in the
surrounding area.
2. Grades shall not exceed 6 percent on arterial streets, 10 percent on collector streets, and
15 percent on local streets.
3. As far as practical, arterial streets and collector streets shall be extended in alignment
with existing streets by continuation of the street centerline. When staggered street
alignments resulting in T intersections are unavoidable, they shall leave a minimum of
150 ft. between the nearest edges of the two rights-of-way.
4. Centerline radii of curves shall not be less than 500 ft. on arterial streets, 300 ft. on
collector streets, and 100 ft. on local streets.
5. Streets shall be designed to intersect at angles as near as practicable to right angles and
shall comply with the following:
a) The intersection of an arterial or collector street with another arterial or collector
street shall have a minimum of 100 ft. of straight (tangent) alignment perpendicular to
the intersection.
b) The intersection of a local street with another street shall have a minimum of 50 ft. of
straight (tangent) alignment perpendicular to the intersection.
c) Where right angle intersections are not possible, exceptions can be granted by the
City Engineer provided that intersections not at right angles have a minimum corner
radius of 20 ft. along the right-of-way lines of the acute angle.
d) Intersections with arterial streets shall have a minimum curb corner radius of 20 ft.
All other intersections shall have a minimum curb corner radius of 10 ft.
17.84 - 6
6. Right-of-way and improvement widths shall be as specified by the Transportation System
Plan. Exceptions to those specifications may be approved by the City Engineer to deal
with specific unique physical constraints of the site.
J. Private streets may be considered within a development site provided all the following
conditions are met:
1. Extension of a public street through the development site is not needed for continuation
of the existing street network or for future service to adjacent properties;
2. The development site remains in one ownership, or adequate mechanisms are established
(such as a homeowners association invested with the authority to enforce payment) to
ensure that a private street installed with a land division will be adequately maintained;
and
3. Where a private street is installed in connection with a land division, paving standards
consistent with City standards for public streets shall be utilized to protect the interests of
future homeowners.
17.84.60 PUBLIC FACILITY EXTENSIONS
A. All development sites shall be provided with public water, sanitary sewer, broadband (fiber),
and storm drainage.

development of adjacent properties;
2. The development site remains in one ownership and land division does not occur (with
the exception of land divisions that may occur under the provisions of 17.84.50 F above);
3. The facilities are designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Plumbing
Code and other applicable codes, and permits and/or authorization to proceed with
construction is issued prior to commencement of work.
17.84.70 PUBLIC IMPROVEMENT PROCEDURES
It is in the best interests of the community to ensure public improvements installed in
conjunction with development are constructed in accordance with all applicable City policies,
standards, procedures, and ordinances. Therefore, prior to commencement of installation of
public water, sanitary sewer, storm drainage, broadband (fiber), street, bicycle, or pedestrian
17.84 - 7
improvements for any development site, developers shall contact the City Engineer to receive

CHAPTER 17.86 - PARKLAND & OPEN SPACE
17.86.00 INTENT
The availability of parkland and open space is a critical element in maintaining and improving
the quality of life in Sandy. Land that features trees, grass and vegetation provides not only an
aesthetically pleasing landscape but also buffers incompatible uses, and preserves sensitive
environmental features and important resources. Parks and open space, together with support
facilities, also help to meet the active and passive recreational needs of the population of Sandy.
This chapter implements policies of Goal 8 of the Comprehensive Plan and the Parks Master
Plan by outlining provisions for parks and open space in the City of Sandy.
17.86.10 MINIMUM PARKLAND DEDICATION REQUIREMENTS
Parkland Dedication: New residential subdivisions, planned developments, multi-family or
manufactured home park developments shall be required to provide parkland to serve existing
and future residents of those developments. Multi-family developments which provide some
"congregate" services and/or facilities, such as group transportation, dining halls, emergency
monitoring systems, etc., but which have individual dwelling units rather than sleeping quarters
only, are considered to be multi-family developments for the purpose of parkland dedication.
Licensed adult congregate living facilities, nursing homes, and all other similar facilities which
provide their clients with individual beds and sleeping quarters, but in which all other care and
services are communal and provided by facility employees, are specifically exempt from
parkland dedication and system development fee requirements.
1. The required parkland shall be dedicated as a condition of approval for the following:
a. Tentative plat for a subdivision or partition;
b. Planned Development conceptual or detailed development plan;
c. Design review for a multi-family development or manufactured home park; and
d. Replat or amendment of any site plan for multi-family development or manufactured
home park where dedication has not previously been made or where the density of the
development involved will be increased.
2. Calculation of Required Dedication: The required parkland acreage to be dedicated is based
on a calculation of the following formula rounded to the nearest 1/100 (0.00) of an acre:
Required parkland dedication (acres) = (proposed units) x (persons/unit) x 0.0043 (per
person park land dedication factor)
a. Population Formula: The following table shall be used to determine the number of
persons per unit to be used in calculating required parkland dedication:
17.86 - 2
Revised by Ordinance No. 2013-03 (effective 07/03/13)
Type of Unit Total Persons Per Unit
Single family residential 3.0
Standard multi-family unit 2.0
Manufactured dwelling park 2.0
Congregate multi-family unit 1.5
Persons per unit, age distribution, and local conditions change with time. The specific
formula for the dedication of land will, therefore, be subject to periodic review and
amendment.
b. Per Person Parkland Dedication Factor: The total parkland dedication requirement shall
be 0.0043 of an acre per person based on the adopted standard of 4.3 acres of land per
one thousand of ultimate population per the Parks Master Plan1. This standard represents
the citywide land-to-population ratio for city parks, and may be adjusted periodically
through amendments to the Parks Master Plan.
17.86.20 MINIMUM PARKLAND STANDARDS
Land required or proposed for parkland dedication shall be contained within a continuous unit
and must be suitable for active use as a neighborhood or mini-park, based on the following
criteria:
1. Homes must front on the parkland as shown in the example below:
PARK
2. The required dedication shall be contained as a contiguous unit and not separated into
pieces or divided by roadways.
3. The parkland must be able to accommodate play structures, play fields, picnic areas, or
other active park use facilities. The average slope of the active use parkland shall not
exceed 15%.
1 Parks Master Plan, Implementation Plan section, Pages 4 and 5 indicate a required park acreage total of 64.5 acres.
This number, divided by population (2015) of 15,000 equates to 4.3 acres per 1000 population or 0.0043 per person.
17.86 - 3
Revised by Ordinance No. 2013-03 (effective 07/03/13)
4. Any retaining wall constructed at the perimeter of the park adjacent to a public right-ofway
or private street shall not exceed 4 feet in height.
5. Once dedicated, the City will assume maintenance responsibility for the neighborhood or
mini parkland.
17.86.30 DEDICATION PROCEDURES
Prior to approval of the final plat, the developer shall dedicate the land as previously determined
by the City in conjunction with approval of the tentative plat. Dedication of land in conjunction
with multi-family development shall be required prior to issuance of permits and commencement
of construction.
A. Prior to acceptance of required parkland dedications, the applicant/developer shall complete
the following items for all proposed dedication areas:
1. The developer shall clear, fill, and/or grade all land to the satisfaction of the City, install
sidewalks on the park land adjacent to any street, and seed the park land; and,
2. The developer shall submit a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment completed by a
qualified professional according to American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM)
standards (ASTM E 1527). The results of this study shall indicate a clean environmental
record.
B. Additional Requirements
1. In addition to a formal dedication on the plat to be recorded, the subdivider shall convey
the required lands to the city by general warranty deed. The developer of a multi-family
development or manufactured home park shall deed the lands required to be dedicated by
a general warranty deed. In any of the above situations, the land so dedicated and deeded
shall not be subject to any reservations of record, encumbrances of any kind or easements
which, in the opinion of the Director, will interfere with the use of the land for park, open
space or recreational purposes.
The subdivider or developer shall be required to present to the City a title insurance
policy on the subject property ensuring the marketable state of the title.
2. Where any reservations, encumbrances or easements exist, the City may require payment
in lieu of the dedication of lands unless it chooses to accept the land subject to
encumbrances.
C. Phased Developments. In a phased development, the required park land for the entire
development shall be dedicated prior to approval of the final plat for the first phase.
Improvements to the land as required by 17.86.30 (A.1.) shall be made prior to approval of
the final plat for the phase that includes the park land.
17.86 - 4
Revised by Ordinance No. 2013-03 (effective 07/03/13)
17.86.40 CASH IN LIEU OF DEDICATION
At the citys discretion only, the city may accept payment of a fee in lieu of land dedication. The
city may require payment in lieu of land when the park land to be dedicated is less than 3 acres.
A payment in lieu of land dedication is separate from Park Systems Development Charges, and is
not eligible for a credit of Park Systems Development Charges. The amount of the fee in lieu of
land dedication (in dollars per acre) shall be set by City Council Resolution, and it shall be based
on the typical market value of developed property (finished lots) in Sandy net of related
development costs.
1. The following factors shall be used in the choice of whether to accept land or cash in lieu:
a. The topography, geology, access to, parcel size, and location of land in the
development available for dedication;
b. Potential adverse/beneficial effects on environmentally sensitive areas;
c. Compatibility with the Parks Master Plan, Public Facilities element of the
Comprehensive Plan, and the City of Sandy Capital Improvements Program in effect
at the time of dedication;
d. Availability of previously acquired property; and
e. The feasibility of dedication.
2. Cash in lieu of parkland dedication shall be paid prior to approval of the final plat or as
specified below:
a. 50 percent of the payment shall be paid prior to final plat approval, and
b. The remaining 50 percent of the payment pro-rated equally among the lots, plus an
administrative surcharge as determined by the City Council through a resolution, will
constitute a lien against the property payable at the time of sale.
17.86.50 MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR OPEN SPACE DEDICATION
The applicant through a subdivision or design review process may propose the designation and
protection of open space areas as part of that process. This open space will not, however, be
counted toward the parkland dedication requirement of Sections 17.86.10 through 17.86.40.
1. The types of open space that may be provided are as follows:
a. Natural Areas: areas of undisturbed vegetation, steep slopes, stream corridors,
wetlands, wildlife habitat areas or areas replanted with native vegetation after
construction.
b. Greenways: linear green belts linking residential areas with other open space areas.
These greenways may contain bicycle paths or footpaths. Connecting greenways
between residences and recreational areas are encouraged.
17.86 - 5
Revised by Ordinance No. 2013-03 (effective 07/03/13)
2. A subdivision or design review application proposing designation of open space shall
include the following information as part of this application:
a. Designate the boundaries of all open space areas; and
b. Specify the manner in which the open space shall be perpetuated, maintained, and
administered; and
c. Provide for public access to trails included in the Park Master Plan, including but not
limited to the Tickle Creek Path.
3. Dedication of open space may occur concurrently with development of the project. At the
discretion of the city, for development that will be phased, the open space may be set
aside in totality and/or dedicated in conjunction with the first phase of the development or
incrementally set aside and dedicated in proportion to the development occurring in each
phase.
4. Open space areas shall be maintained so that the use and enjoyment thereof is not
diminished or destroyed. Open space areas may be owned, preserved, and maintained by
any of the following mechanisms or combinations thereof:
a. Dedication to the City of Sandy or an appropriate public agency approved by the City,
if there is a public agency willing to accept the dedication. Prior to acceptance of
proposed open space, the City may require the developer to submit a Phase I
Environmental Site Assessment completed by a qualified professional according to
American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) standards (ASTM E 1527). The
results of this study shall indicate a clean environmental record.
b. Common ownership by a homeowner's association that assumes full responsibility for
its maintenance;
c. Dedication of development rights to an appropriate public agency with ownership
remaining with the developer or homeowner's association. Maintenance responsibility
will remain with the property owner; and/or
d. Deed-restricted private ownership preventing development and/or subsequent
subdivision and providing for maintenance responsibilities.
5. In the event that any private owner of open space fails to maintain it according to the
standards of this Code, the City of Sandy, following reasonable notice, may demand that
the deficiency of maintenance be corrected, and may enter the open space for
maintenance purposes. All costs thereby incurred by the City shall be charged to those
persons having the primary responsibility for maintenance of the open space.

CHAPTER 17.90 - DESIGN STANDARDS
17.90.00 INTENT
Chapter 17.90 is intended to implement the following design standards. In addition to these
standards, several appendices are included to aid in the implementation of these standards.
Applicable appendices are referenced in this chapter and kept on file by the Planning Director at
City Hall. In implementing these standards, the reviewing body shall refer to the following
objectives in evaluating Design Review requests:
A. Protect and enhance the citys quality of life and community image.
B. Encourage functional, safe, and aesthetically pleasing development, while maintaining
compatibility with the surrounding built and natural environment.
C. Implement the Sandy Style, as described by this chapter. The Sandy Style is based on the
following guiding principles:
1. Celebrate Sandy as the Gateway to Mount Hood through contextually appropriate
landscaping and building designs.
2. Protect and enhance Sandys tree canopy, particularly along the Highway 26 Landscape
Management Corridor.
3. Emphasize a village scale and character in new development. Village scale means
development is compact and walkable, building entrances are oriented to the street
sidewalk or a plaza, and large building masses are broken down through a combination of
design elements such as articulation, combinations of complementary building materials
and detailing.
4. Express elements of or reflect Cascadian architecture by adapting appropriate elements of
English Arts and Crafts Style (1900-1920) and Oregon Rustic Style (1915-1940), and/or
similar elements, into new buildings and exterior remodels, except in locations where this
code allows or requires a different architectural style (e.g., C-1 Historic Roadside
Commercial District).
5. Encourage green building practices in new construction, such as the use of renewable
energy (e.g., solar and wind), use of recycled materials, integration of water quality
facilities in landscapes, capture of rainwater for irrigation, and similar practices.
D. The city considers the following elements to be incompatible with the Sandy Style. The
reviewing body may deny, or require modifications to, a project with any of the following:
1. Excessive tree removal and/or grading that may harm existing vegetation within a
designated landscape conservation area.
2. Commercial development where buildings are setback from the street behind surface
parking lots.
3. Excessive surface parking lot paving and redundant driveways.
4. Drive-up facilities adjacent to a street that interrupt pedestrian circulation patterns or
create potential safety hazards.
5. Disjointed parking areas, confusing or unsafe circulation patterns.
6. Box-like structures with large, blank, unarticulated wall surfaces.
17.90- 2
Revised by Ordinance 2013-04 effective 07/03/13
7. Building materials or colors that do not conform to this code.
8. Highly reflective surfaces or heavily tinted glass storefronts.
9. Strongly thematic architectural styles, forms, colors, materials, and/or detailing, that do
not conform to the Sandy Style, including some forms of franchise architectural styles
associated with some chain commercial establishments.
10. Inadequate landscape buffers adjacent to parking lots, walkways and streets.
11. Visible outdoor storage, loading, and equipment areas.

contribute to the unique character of Sandys business community. However, these buildings
are not necessarily designed in conformance with the applicable design standards described
in this chapter. This section allows these buildings to be maintained, repaired, painted or
added on to, in a way that is consistent with the existing architectural design of these
buildings. Additionally, in the event a portion or the entire building is damaged by any
means, this section allows these buildings to be rebuilt as currently designed. This
exemption does not allow the architectural design of these buildings to be changed or altered
from the current design without compliance with the provisions of this code. (as of February
1, 2008, see Appendix A) All other provisions in this chapter related to site design,
landscaping, lighting, and external storage and screening are still applicable. This exception

as shown in Figure 17.90.110(C). When access must be provided directly from a public
right-of-way, driveways for ingress or egress shall be limited to one per 150 ft. For lots
with frontage of less than 150 ft. or less, shared access may be required.
4. Adjacent parking lots shall be connected to one another when the City determines it is
practicable to do so. Developments shall avoid creating barriers to inter-parcel
circulation.
5. Urban design details, such as raised or painted pedestrian crossings and similar devices
incorporating changes in paving materials, textures or color, shall be used to calm traffic
and protect pedestrians in parking areas.
6. Where openings occur between buildings facing Proctor Boulevard or Pioneer Boulevard,
pedestrian ways shall connect the street sidewalk to any internal parking areas.
Development shall avoid creating barriers to pedestrian circulation.
7. Parking lots may include public alley accessed garages at the rear property line, except
where a setback is required for vision clearance or to conform to other city standards.
8. Raised walkways or painted crossings from the public street sidewalk to the building
entrance(s) are required. Crosswalks through parking lots and drive aisles shall be
constructed of a material contrasting with the road surface or be painted (e.g., colored
concrete inlay in asphalt).

Revised by Ordinance 2013-04 effective 07/03/13
9. Joint use of access points and interconnections and cross-over easements between parcels
shall be required, where the City determines it is practicable and necessary. A
development approval may be conditioned to require a joint use access easement and
interconnecting driveways or alleys to comply with access spacing and other applicable
code requirements.
10. Connection to Adjacent Properties: The location of any real improvements to the property
must provide for a future street and pedestrian connection to adjacent properties where
the City determines this is practicable and necessary.
11. Through lots and corner lots may be permitted with two access points, one onto each
abutting street, where necessary to serve a centralized, shared parking facility. Such
access points must conform to the above access spacing requirements and parking must
be internalized to the property.
12. Free-standing buildings shall be connected to one another with a seamless pedestrian

B. Building Facades, Materials, and Colors
Intent: To provide building façades, materials and colors consistent with the Sandy Style. For
purposes of interpreting the Sandy Style, representative illustrations and photos are provided.
(Figures 17.90.110-C, 17.90.110-D, 17.90.110-E, 17.90.110-F, 17.90.110-G, 17.90.110-H,
17.90.110-I, Color Palettes (Appendices C and D), and photos (Appendix E)
1. Articulation. The Sandy Style includes asymmetrical building forms, which by definition
require buildings to be articulated, varied, and provide visual interest. This standard is met
by dividing elevations of a structure visible from an abutting public street or pedestrian way
into smaller areas or planes to minimize the appearance of bulk as viewed from the street as
follows:
a. All elevations visible from an abutting public street or pedestrian way shall be
divided into distinct planes no more than 30 lineal feet long to include the following:
1) Wall planes meeting this standard shall include a feature or variation in the wall
plane that projects or recedes at least six (6) inches from the adjacent plane, for a
length of at least four (4) feet. Changes in plane may include but are not limited to
recessed entries, bays, secondary roof forms (e.g., gables, lower roof sheds,
dormers and towers), canopies, awnings, projections, recesses, alcoves, pergolas,
porticos, roof overhangs, or other features consistent with the Sandy Style.
2) Wall planes shall incorporate at least one visually contrasting and complementary
change in materials or changes in texture or patterns, including trim, moldings, or
other ornamental devices.
3) The lower and upper floors of multi-story buildings shall be clearly delineated by
using pedestrian shelters, change in siding materials, heavy timber or natural
wood accents (e.g., brackets, paneling or other detailing).
17.90- 12
Revised by Ordinance 2013-04 effective 07/03/13
2. Pedestrian Shelters. Buildings must incorporate pedestrian shelters, as follows:
a. Pedestrian shelters shall be provided over the buildings primary entrance(s) and
pedestrian areas (i.e., sidewalks and civic spaces) abutting the subject building.
b. Features such as canopies, arcades, awnings, roofs overhangs, covered porches,
alcoves, and/or porticoes are required.
c. Pedestrian shelters must extend at least five (5) feet over the pedestrian area.
d. Shelters designed with gables (e.g., over building entrances) are preferred over flat
shelters, and must comply with the roof pitch standards in Section 17.90.110(C).
Dome or bubble shaped awnings are not permitted.
3. Building Materials. Exterior building materials shall convey an impression of strength and
durability consistent with the Sandy Style, as follows:
a. Buildings on the same site shall be architecturally unified. This provision shall apply
to new construction, additions, and remodeling such that buildings are related in
architectural style and share some common elements, such as color scheme, materials,
roof forms, and/or detailing. Unity does not mean repetition or mirroring of building
elevations.
b. Strong base materials such as natural stone (e.g., basalt, granite, river stone), splitfaced
rusticated concrete block, or brick are required. Cultured stone may be allowed
if it has a stone texture and is similar in appearance and durability to natural stone. A
buildings base must extend at least 36 inches but not more than 60 inches above the
adjacent finished grade and be included on those sides of the building visible from the
abutting public street. If the site contains a grade differential making construction of
a minimum 36-inch base impracticable, the reviewing body may allow portions of the
base to be less than 36-inches.
c. Foundations shall be designed to match the scale of the building being supported.
Examples include sheathing the foundation structure with base materials and wall
siding.
d. Siding shall consist of wood, composite-wood (e.g., concrete fiberboard, panels or
shingles), stone, brick, split-faced or rusticated concrete block, or a combination of
these materials. Stucco, synthetic stucco, and metal are permitted only as specified
below. Vinyl, plastic or similar siding is not permitted.
1) Where wood siding is used, it shall consist of horizontal (e.g., lap, v-groove, or
tongue-and-groove) siding, vertical (board and batten) siding, shingles, or
combinations thereof. Vertical grooved (i.e., T1-11) sheet siding and similar
materials are prohibited.
2) Where board-and-batten siding is used, battens shall be a minimum of 2-inches
wide x 1-inch deep and spaced 24 inches apart or closer; rough-sawn boards
(specialty panel) are preferred over panels having a resin overlay.
3) Where masonry siding is used, it shall consist of brick, stone, or rusticated
concrete block, and must incorporate decorative patterns over not less than 15
percent of every elevation where it is used. Examples of decorative patterns
include multi-toned masonry units, such as brick, stone, or cast stone, in layered
or geometric patterns or split-faced concrete block to simulate rusticated stone17.90-
13
Revised by Ordinance 2013-04 effective 07/03/13
type construction. Changes in pattern should be used to accentuate breaks in
building stories, corners, windows, structural bays, and building tops (e.g.,
parapets where flat roofs are allowed).
4) Where metal siding is used, it shall be used as an accent only, comprising not
more than 20 percent of the surface area of the building elevation (e.g.,
wainscoting or other accent paneling). Metal must be architectural grade and have
a non-reflective (burnished or painted) finish conforming to the approved Color
Palette. Metal may also be used for flashing, gutters, downspouts, brackets,
lighting, and signage and similar functional elements.
5) Where stucco or synthetic stucco is used, it shall be used as an accent only,
comprising not more than 20 percent of the surface area of the building elevation.
e. Building elevations facing a public right-of-way or civic space shall incorporate at
least three (3) of the following features: Using these features may also address other
code requirements, such as those related to building articulation, change in relief,
pedestrian shelters, and storefront elements.
1) Exposed, heavy timbers;
2) Exposed natural wood color beams, posts, brackets and/or trim (e.g., eaves or trim
around windows);
3) Natural wood color shingles (e.g., used as siding or to accent gable ends);
4) Metal canopies;
5) Heavy metal brackets (e.g., cast iron or similar appearance), which may be
structural brackets or applied as cosmetic detailing; and,
6) Similar features, consistent with the Sandy Style.
f. Materials required on elevations visible from an abutting public street must turn the
building corner and incorporate appropriate transitions onto elevations not requiring
these materials for a distance of not less than two (2) feet.
4. Colors. Building exteriors shall comply with the following standards:
a. Permitted colors include warm earth tones (tans, browns, reds, grays and greens)
conforming to the Color Palette provided in Appendix C.
b. High-intensity primary colors, metallic colors and black, may be utilized as trim and
detail colors only, not to exceed one (1) percent of the surface area of any elevation.
Such color shall not be used as primary wall colors.
c. Day-glow colors, highly reflective colors, and similar colors are not permitted.

C. Roof Pitch, Materials, and Parapets
Intent: To provide roof forms and detailing consistent with the Sandy Style. For purposes of
interpreting the Sandy Style, representative illustrations and photos are provided. (See Figures
17.90.110-C, 17.90.110-D, 17.90.110-E, 17.90.110-F, 17.90.110-G, 17.90.110-H, 17.90.110-I
and representative photos in Appendix E)
1. Except as provided in subsections 17.90.110(C)(8), below, pitched (gabled or hipped)
roofs are required on all new buildings with a span of 50-feet or less. Gable and hipped
roof forms must achieve a pitch not less than the following:
Zoning District Primary Roof Forms
(minimum)
Secondary Roof
Forms (minimum)
C-1, C-3 6:12 4:12
2. As provided above, Primary Roof Forms are those that individually comprise 20
percent or more of the total surface area of a roof elevation. Secondary roof forms (e.g.,
dormers, towers, cupolas, etc.) are those that comprise less than 20 percent of the roof
elevation. See also, Section 17.74.20 Vertical Projections.
3. When practicable, buildings shall be oriented so the gable end of the roof faces the
abutting street.
4. Pitched roof surfaces visible from an abutting public street shall provide a secondary roof
form (e.g. dormer) in the quantity specified below. Secondary roof forms may be located
anywhere on the roof, although grouping these features is preferred.
Roof Length Number of Secondary Roof Forms
30  40 feet 1
41  80 feet 2
81 feet and greater 4
5. Visible roof materials must be wood shingle or architectural grade composition shingle,
slate, or concrete tile. Metal with standing or batten seam may also be used conforming
to the Color Palette in Appendix D.
6. All roof and wall-mounted mechanical, electrical, communications, and service
equipment, including satellite dishes and vent pipes, shall be screened from view from
public rights-of-way and civic spaces by parapets, walls or by other approved means.
Roof plans and elevations must show proposed equipment locations, approximate
dimensions, and line of sight from public rights-of-way and civic spaces. The reviewing
body may require additional equipment setbacks, screen walls, or other mitigation to
ensure compliance.
7. A-frame buildings and Mansard-style roofs are not permitted.
17.90- 17
Revised by Ordinance 2013-04 effective 07/03/13
8. Exception to Pitched Roof: When a building requires a roof span greater than 50-feet, or
the internal function of the building or a portion of the building makes construction of a
pitched roof impractical, the reviewing body may allow an alternative roof form. An
alternative roof form includes an applied pitched roof or flat roof constructed over the
building or portion of the building as specified below. An example when a pitched roof
is considered impractical would be the need to have large rooftop stove vents over the
kitchen portion of a restaurant. Roof forms constructed under this exception shall comply
with the standards below.
a. Applied Pitched Roof: An applied pitched roof is the preferred alternative roof
form and shall be considered first. An applied pitched roof is a roof form with the
general appearance of a pitched roof in terms of materials, pitch, and overhang, but
does not extend all the way from the eave of the building to the ridge of the roof as a
typical pitched roof. An applied pitched roof shall be constructed according to the
following:
1) For buildings with a span of less than 50 feet, the applied pitched roof shall
extend at least 50 percent of the distance from the eave to the ridge as if had been
constructed as a pitched roof;
2) For buildings with a span of 50 feet or greater, the applied pitched roof shall
extend at least 12 feet from eave.
3) The reviewing body may require buildings with a span of 50 feet or greater to
include an applied pitched roof in lieu of a flat roof along street facing
elevations.
b. Flat Roof: Flat roofs shall comply with the following standards:
1) Sandy Style stepped parapets and detailed coursing shall be provided on those
elevations visible from an abutting public street. Parapets shall be varied so that
the length of a parapet does not exceed 30 feet without a change in the parapet
height of at least 2 feet or as necessary to hide rooftop equipment.
2) Average parapet height shall not exceed 15 percent of the supporting wall height,
and the maximum parapet height shall not at any point exceed one-third (1/3) of
the height of the supporting wall;
3) A cornice projecting at least six (6) inches from the building face shall be
provided at the roofline of all elevations visible from abutting public rights-ofways
and pedestrian ways;
4) Parapet corners shall be stepped and the parapet be designed to emphasize the
center or primary entrance(s), unless the primary entrance is at the corner of the
building.
D. Building Orientation and Entrances
Intent: To maintain and enhance downtown and village commercial streetscapes as public
spaces, emphasizing a pedestrian-scale and character in new development, consistent with the
Sandy Style; and to provide for a continuous pedestrian network that promotes pedestrian safety,
comfort and convenience, and provides materials and detailing consistent with the Sandy Style.
(Figures 17.90.110-A, 17.90.110-B, 17.90.110-C, 17.90.110-D, 17.90.110-E, 17.90.110-F,
17.90.110-G, 17.90.110-H, 17.90.110-I and representative photos in Appendix E)
17.90- 18
Revised by Ordinance 2013-04 effective 07/03/13
1. Buildings shall be oriented to a public street or civic space. This standard is met when at
least 50 percent of the subject sites street frontage is comprised of building(s) placed within
10 feet of a sidewalk or an approved civic space and not more than 20 percent of the offstreet
parking on a parcel as required by SDC 17.98, tract or area of land is located between
a buildings front façade and the adjacent street(s).
2. Where parking is placed between a front façade and a street, a landscaped berm and/or
architectural features, such as a knee wall, colonnade, arbor, trellis and/or similar device,
shall be placed behind the sidewalk to partially screen the parking area from the sidewalk.
The partial screen shall be designed to achieve at least 50 percent opacity at the time of
installation, with openings for walkways connecting to the buildings primary entrance.
3. Ground floor spaces shall face a public street and shall be connected to it by a direct
pedestrian route (i.e., avoid out-of-direction travel). Where the reviewing authority
determines that facing the building to a street is not practical, it may require the building to
face a civic space.
4. Buildings located at the intersection of two streets shall use a corner building entrance;
where a corner entrance is not practical due to the internal functioning of the building space
or due to physical constraints of the site (e.g., topography, accessibility, or similar
circumstances), a building entrance must be provided within 40 feet of the corner. The
building corner must use detailing that emphasizes the corner location and is consistent with
the Sandy Style. Examples of acceptable detailing include a rounded or chamfered (beveled)
corner, weather protecting canopy, plaza, sculpture, and/or similar pedestrian-oriented
features.
5. Upper story residential units shall have an entrance separate from the ground floor
(commercial) space and conform to applicable building codes.
6. Buildings shall provide at least two elevations where the pedestrian environment is
activated. An elevation is activated when it meets the window transparency
requirements in subsection 17.90.110(E), below, and contains a customer entrance with a
pedestrian shelter extending at least five (5) feet over an adjacent sidewalk, walkway or
civic space. Where providing a customer entrance on two (2) elevations is not practical, the
reviewing body may allow a single entrance.
7. Primary entries shall face a public street or a civic space and shall be spaced not more than
30 feet apart on average. Ancillary shops shall provide entries every 30 feet, on average.
8. Primary entrances shall be architecturally emphasized and visible from the abutting public
right-of-way or civic space and shall be sheltered with a canopy, overhang, or portico with a
depth of at least five (5) feet. Architectural emphasis should be provided by a gabled shelter
where practical, consistent with the Sandy Style. Detailing around the base of the building,
such as stonework, benches or art, should also be used to emphasize an entrance.
E. Windows
Intent: To promote business vitality, public safety and aesthetics through effective window
placement and design, consistent with the Sandy Style. (See Figures 17.90.110-C, 17.90.110-D,
17.90.110-E, 17.90.110-F, 17.90.110-G, 17.90.110-H, and 17.90.110-I, and representative
photos in Appendix E.
17.90- 19
Revised by Ordinance 2013-04 effective 07/03/13
1. Unified Design. Building plans must provide for unity in window placement and design
so that all sides of a building relate to one another and multiple buildings on a
development site relate to one another.
2. Ground Floor Windows. The ground floor elevation of all new buildings shall contain
display areas, windows, and doorways along street frontages and where the building
abuts a civic space as follows: Lots with multiple street frontages are required to meet
this standard on only two frontages.
Building Size Percentage Windows Required
0 - 10,000 sq. ft. 40 percent of ground floor elevation
Greater than 10,000 sq. ft. 25 percent of ground floor elevation
a. Windows shall contain clear glass to allow views to interior activity or display areas.
The bottom edge of windows shall be no less than three (3) feet above the adjacent
finished grade. Where the internal functions of a building preclude windows at this
height, the reviewing body may approve locating windows above or below this
height. Display boxes affixed to a buildings exterior are not counted in meeting the
above standard.
b. Windows shall be square or vertically oriented and may consist of vertically stacked
or horizontally banked window units. Windows located over a door or transom
windows may be horizontally oriented.
c. Windows with any dimension exceeding six (6) feet shall be divided into smaller
panes (e.g., 2 foot by 2 foot grid) with real divided panes, vinyl inserts or applied
dividers.
d. Windows shall have trim or moldings at least three (3) inches in width around them,
or have reveals of at least three (3) inches in depth. Casings shall consist of a drip
cap, head casing, side casings, and/or sills.
3. Upper Floor Window Standards.
a. The reviewing authority may require buildings exceeding 20 feet in height to provide
upper-story windows along activated frontages. Such windows may be required for
attic space, or applied to roof forms where no second story exists, to meet the
articulation requirements under Section 17.90.110(B)(1).
b. Windows shall be square or vertically oriented. Individual window units shall not
exceed five (5) feet by seven (7) feet. Any portion of a window unit with a dimension
exceeding four (4) feet shall be divided into smaller panes.
c. At least half of all the window area in upper floors shall be made up of glass panes
with dimensions no greater than two (2) feet by three (3) feet, unless approved by
variance or adjustment. Upper story windows that have 1 foot by 1 foot grid inside
double pane glass are appropriate and are encouraged.
d. Window trim and moldings shall be compatible with those used on the ground floor.
4. Prohibited Windows. The following window types are prohibited:
17.90- 20
Revised by Ordinance 2013-04 effective 07/03/13
a. Darkly tinted windows, mirrored windows, and similar windows are prohibited
adjacent to street sidewalks, civic spaces and walkways.
b. Glass curtain windows are not permitted facing public right-of-ways, except where
the reviewing body finds that such windows are consistent with the Sandy Style.
F. Landscaping and Streetscape Design
Intent: To promote business vitality, public safety and aesthetics through effective landscaping
and streetscape design, consistent with the Sandy Style; and to provide for a pedestrian network
that promotes pedestrian safety, comfort and convenience, and provides materials and detailing
consistent with the Sandy Style. (Figures 17.90.110-A, 17.90.110-B, 17.90.110-C, 17.90.110-D,
17.90.110-E, 17.90.110-F, 17.90.110-G, 17.90.110-H, 17.90.110-I, and Downtown Sandy
Streetscape Design)
1. The provisions of Chapter 17.92, Landscaping and Screening General Standards shall
apply except in the C-1 Zoning District where conformance with the Downtown Sandy
Streetscape Design, as illustrated in Appendix F is required.
2. Where any conflict arises between provisions of the Sandy Streetscape Design and other
city standards (e.g., sidewalk width, materials, or similar specifications), the Streetscape
Design shall prevail. All applicable provisions of Chapter 17.92 Landscaping and
Screening General Standards must be met, except as modified by the Downtown Sandy
Streetscape Design.
G. Civic Space
Intent: To connect buildings to the public realm and create comfortable and attractive gathering
places and outdoor seating areas for the public, consistent with Sandys Downtown Streetscape
Design. (See Figures 17.90.110-H and 17.90.110-I).
1. Not less than three (3) percent of the ground floor area of every development shall be
improved as civic space.
2. All civic spaces shall have dimensions of not less than eight (8) feet across and have a
surface area of not less than 64 square feet. No civic space is required if the size of this
space results in an area of less than 64 square feet.
3. Civic space improvements may include plazas, private extensions of sidewalks and
walkways (i.e., to accommodate outdoor seating), public art, pedestrian-scale lighting,
bus waiting areas, tourist amenities (e.g., way finding signs as approved by the city) or
similar pedestrian amenities as approved through Design Review.
4. The highest priority locations for civic space are those areas with the highest pedestrian
activity (e.g., street corners and mid-block pedestrian access ways) that have a western or
southern exposure.
5. Unless impractical, civic spaces shall abut a public right-of-way or otherwise be
connected to and visible from a public right-of-way by a sidewalk or pedestrian access
way; access ways shall be identifiable with a change in paving materials (e.g., pavers
inlaid in concrete or a change in pavement scoring patterns and/or texture) or painted.
Where a right-of-way connection is not possible, the owner must provide a public access
way easement to the civic space. Civic spaces shall not be gated or closed to public
access, unless otherwise required by the city.

H. Lighting
Intent: To promote business vitality, public safety and aesthetics through effective outdoor
lighting, consistent with the Sandy Style.
1. Streetscape lighting shall conform to the Downtown Sandy Streetscape Design and the
requirements of Chapter 15.30, Dark Sky Ordinance.
2. Exterior lighting must be an integral part of the architectural design and must
complement any ornamental street lighting and remain in context with the overall
architectural character of the district. On-site light fixtures conforming to the Sandy Style
are encouraged.
3. Lighting must be adequate for safety purposes. Walkways, parking lots, and building
entrances should be illuminated at 1.5  2.0 foot candles.
I. Safety and Security
Intent: To promote natural surveillance of public spaces for safety and security.
1. Locate windows in a manner that enables tenants, employees and police to watch over
pedestrian, parking and loading areas.
2. In commercial, public and semipublic development, including civic spaces, locate
windows in a manner that enables surveillance of interior activity from the public rightof-
way.
3. Provide street address numbers measuring a minimum of six (6) inches high, which
clearly locates buildings and their entries for patrons and emergency services.
4. Locate, orient and select on-site lighting to facilitate surveillance of on-site activities
from the public right-of-way and other public areas. (See also, subsection H Lighting.)
J. External Storage and Screening
Intent: To promote land use compatibility and aesthetics, particularly where development abuts
public spaces.
1. Exterior storage of merchandise and/or materials, except as specifically authorized as a
permitted accessory use, is prohibited.
2. Where such storage is allowed, it must be screened from view from public rights of way
and civic spaces.
3. Mechanical, electrical, communications equipment including meters and transformers,
and service and delivery entrances and garbage storage areas shall be screened from view
from public rights-of-way and civic spaces.
4. Trash collection and recycling storage areas must be located within the structure or
otherwise screened from view in an enclosed facility. Such facilities must be screened
from view from public rights-of-way and civic spaces behind a screening wall
constructed to match the materials used on the primary building(s) on the subject site.
5. Exceptions to the above provisions may be allowed through Design Review where no
other practical alternative exists and such equipment is made to be visually subordinate to
17.90- 23
Revised by Ordinance 2013-04 effective 07/03/13
the proposed building and landscape, for example, through the use of common materials
for screening walls or landscape berms. The reviewing body may require additional
setbacks, screening walls or other mitigation, for aesthetic reasons and to minimize odors
or noise impacts on adjoining properties, public rights-of-way or civic spaces.
17.90.120 GENERAL COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL (C-2 and I-1) AND NONRESIDENTIAL
USES IN RESIDENTIAL ZONES DESIGN STANDARDS
Development in the C-2 and I-1 districts and non-residential uses in a residential zone shall
conform to all of the following standards, as applicable. Where a conflict exists between the
requirements of this Chapter and any other code provision, this Chapter shall prevail.
A. Site Layout and Access.
Intent: To provide for compact, walkable development, and to design and manage vehicle access
and circulation in a manner that supports pedestrian safety, comfort and convenience. (Figures
17.90.120-A and 17.90.120-B)
1. All lots shall abut or have cross access to a dedicated public street.
2. All lots that have access to a public alley shall provide for an additional vehicle access from
that alley.
3. Off-street parking shall be located to the rear or side of buildings with no portion of the
parking lot located within required setbacks or within 10-feet of the public right-of-way,
as shown in Figure 17.90.120-A. When access must be provided directly from a public
right-of-way, driveways for ingress or egress shall be limited to one per 150 ft. For lots
with frontage of less than 150 ft. or less, shared access may be required.
4. Adjacent parking lots shall be connected to one another when the City determines it is
practicable to do so. Developments shall avoid creating barriers to inter-parcel circulation.
5. Urban design details, such as raised or painted pedestrian crossings and similar devices
incorporating changes in paving materials, textures or color, shall be used to calm traffic and
protect pedestrians in parking areas.
6. Parking lots may include public alley accessed garages at the rear property line, except
where a setback is required for vision clearance or to conform to other city standards.
7. Walkways from the public street sidewalk to the building entrance(s) are required.
Crosswalks through parking lots and drive aisles shall be constructed of a material
contrasting with the road surface or painted (e.g., colored concrete inlay in asphalt).
8. Connection to Adjacent Properties: The location of any real improvements to the property
must provide for a future street and pedestrian connection to adjacent properties where the
City determines this is practicable and necessary. Where openings occur between buildings
adjacent to Highway 26, pedestrian ways should connect the street sidewalk to any
internal parking areas and building entrances. Development should avoid creating
barriers to pedestrian circulation.
9. Joint use of access points and interconnections and cross-over easements between parcels
shall be required, where the City determines it is practicable and necessary. A
development approval may be conditioned to require a joint use access easement and
17.90- 24
Revised by Ordinance 2013-04 effective 07/03/13
interconnecting driveways or alleys to comply with access spacing and other applicable
code requirements.
10. Through lots may be permitted with two access points, one onto each abutting street,
where necessary to serve a centralized, shared parking facility. Such access points must
conform to the above access spacing requirements and parking must be internalized to the
property.
11. Free-standing buildings shall be connected to one another with a seamless pedestrian
network that provides access to building entrances and adjacent civic spaces.
12. Minimum parking requirements are contained in Chapter 17.98. For developments
containing more than 150 parking spaces, at least 20 percent of all parking spaces shall be
constructed of permeable materials such as permeable asphalt, permeable concrete,
pavers, and/or similar materials as approved by the City.

B. Building Facades, Materials, and Colors
Intent: To provide building façades, materials and colors consistent with the Sandy Style. For
purposes of interpreting the Sandy Style, representative illustrations and photos are provided.
(Figures 17.90.120-C, 17.90.120-D, 17.90.120-E, 17.90.120-F, 17.90.120-G, 17.90.120-H, and
17.90.120-I; and the Color Palette and representative photos provided in the Appendix E.)
1. Articulation. The Sandy Style includes asymmetrical building forms, which by
definition require buildings to be articulated, varied, and provide visual interest. This
standard is met by dividing elevations visible from an abutting public street or pedestrian
way into smaller areas or planes to minimize the appearance of bulk as follows:
a. All elevations visible from an abutting public street or pedestrian way shall be
divided into distinct planes of no more than 40 lineal feet long to include the
following:
1) Wall planes meeting this standard shall include a feature or variation in the wall
plane that are those that are entirely separated from other wall planes by a
recessed or projecting section of the structure that projects or recedes at least six
(6) inches from the adjacent plane, for a length of at least four (4) feet. Changes in
plane may include but are not limited to recessed entries, bays, secondary roof
forms (e.g., gables, lower roof sheds, dormers and towers), building bases,
canopies, awnings, projections, recesses, alcoves, pergolas, porticos, roof
overhangs, or other features consistent with the Sandy Style.
2) Wall planes shall incorporate at least one visually contrasting and complementary
change in materials or changes in texture or patterns, including trim, moldings, or
other ornamental devices.

3) The lower and upper floors of multi-storied buildings shall be delineated by using
pedestrian shelters, changes in siding materials, heavy timbers, or natural wood
accents (e.g. brackets, paneling, or other detailing).

2. Pedestrian Shelters. Buildings must incorporate pedestrian shelters, as follows:
a. Pedestrian shelters shall be provided over the buildings primary entrance(s) and all
pedestrian areas (i.e., sidewalks, and civic spaces) abutting the subject building,
where pedestrians are likely to use these facilities.
b. Features such as canopies, arcades, awnings, roofs overhangs, covered porches,
alcoves, and/or porticoes are required to protect pedestrians from the rain and sun.
c. Pedestrian shelters must extend at least five (5) feet over the pedestrian area.
d. Shelters designed with gables (e.g., over building entrances) are preferred over flat
shelters, and must comply with the roof pitch standards in Section 17.90.120(C).
Dome or bubble shaped awnings are not permitted.
3. Building Materials. Exterior building materials shall convey an impression of strength
and durability consistent with the Sandy Style, as follows:
a. Buildings on the same site shall be architecturally unified. Architectural unity means
buildings are related in architectural style and share some common elements, such as
color scheme, materials, roof forms, and/or detailing. Unity does not mean repetition
or mirroring of building elevations.
b. Strong base materials such as natural stone (e.g., basalt, granite, river stone), splitfaced
rusticated concrete block, brick, or concrete form liner replicating these
materials are required. Cultured stone may be allowed if it has a stone texture and is
similar in appearance and durability to natural stone. A buildings base must extend at
least 36 inches but not more than 60 inches above the adjacent finished grade and be
included on those sides of the building visible from an abutting public street. If the
site contains a grade differential making construction of a minimum 36-inch base
impracticable, the reviewing body may allow portions of the base to be less than 36-
inches.
c. Foundations shall be designed to match the scale of the building being supported.
Sheathing the foundation structure with base materials and wall siding are examples
of methods which accomplish this purpose.
d. Siding shall consist of wood, composite-wood (e.g., concrete fiberboard, panels or
shingles), stone, brick, split-faced or rusticated concrete block, concrete form liner or
17.90- 27
Revised by Ordinance 2013-04 effective 07/03/13
a combination of these materials. Stucco, synthetic stucco, or metal are only
permitted as specified below. Vinyl, plastic or similar siding is not permitted.
1) Where wood siding is used, it shall consist of horizontal (e.g., lap, v-groove, or
tongue-and-groove) siding, vertical (board and batten) siding, shingles, or
combinations thereof. Vertical grooved (i.e., T1-11) sheet siding and similar
materials are prohibited.
2) Where board-and-batten siding is used, battens shall be a minimum of 2-inches
wide x 1-inch deep and spaced 24 inches apart or closer; rough-sawn boards
(specialty panel) are preferred over panels having a resin overlay.
3) Where masonry siding is used, it shall consist of brick, stone, or rusticated
concrete block, and must incorporate decorative patterns over not less than 15
percent of every elevation where it is used. Examples of decorative patterns
include multicolored masonry units, such as brick, stone, or cast stone, in layered
or geometric patterns or split-faced concrete block to simulate a rusticated stonetype
construction. Changes in pattern should be used to accentuate breaks in
building stories, corners, windows, and building tops (e.g., parapets where flat
roofs are allowed).
4) Where metal siding is used, it shall be used as an accent only, comprising not
more than 30 percent of the surface area of the building elevation (e.g.,
wainscoting or other accent paneling). Metal must be architectural grade and have
a non-reflective (burnished or painted) finish conforming to the Color Palette in
Appendix C. Metal may also be used for flashing, gutters, downspouts, brackets,
lighting, and signage and similar functional elements.
5) Where stucco or synthetic stucco is used, it shall only be used as an accent
comprising not more than 30 percent of the surface of the building elevation.
6) Where concrete form liner is used, it shall be limited to patterns replicating
horizontal wood siding, stone, or brick as shown in Appendix H and shall not
include ribbed, fluted, or similar patterns.
e. Building elevations facing a public street shall incorporate at least three (3) of the
following features: Using these features may also address other code requirements,
such as those related to building articulation, change in relief, pedestrian shelters,
storefront elements.
1) Exposed, heavy timbers;
2) Exposed natural wood color beams, posts, brackets and/or trim (e.g., eaves or trim
around windows);
3) Natural wood color shingles (e.g., used as siding or to accent gable ends);
4) Metal canopies;
5) Heavy metal brackets (e.g., cast iron or similar appearance), which may be
structural brackets or applied as cosmetic detailing, and/or;
6) Similar features, consistent with the Sandy Style.
f. Materials required on elevations visible from an abutting public street must turn the
building corner and incorporate appropriate transitions onto elevations not requiring
these materials for a distance of not less than four (4) feet.
17.90- 28
Revised by Ordinance 2013-04 effective 07/03/13
4. Colors. Building exteriors shall comply with the following standards:
a. Permitted colors include warm earth tones (tans, browns, reds, grays and greens)
conforming to Color Palette in Appendix C.
b. High-intensity primary colors, metallic colors and black, may be utilized as trim and
detail colors only, not to exceed one percent (1%) of the surface area of any elevation.
Such color shall not be used as primary wall colors.
c. Day-glow colors, highly reflective colors, and similar colors are not permitted.

C. Roof Pitch, Materials, and Parapets
Intent: To provide roof forms and detailing consistent with the Sandy Style. For purposes of
interpreting the Sandy Style, representative illustrations and photos are provided. (Figures
17.90.120-D, 17.90.120-E, 17.90.120-F, 17.90.120-G, 17.90.120-H, and 17.90.120-I and
representative photos in Appendix E)
1. Except as provided in subsections 17.90.120(C)(8), below, pitched (gabled or hipped)
roofs are required on all new buildings with a span of 50-feet or less. Gable and hipped
roof forms must achieve a pitch not less than the following:
Zoning District Primary Roof Forms
(minimum)
Secondary Roof
Forms (minimum)
C-2 and I-1 6:12 4:12
2. As provided above, Primary Roof Forms are those that individually comprise 20
percent or more of the total surface area of a roof elevation. Secondary roof forms (e.g.,
dormers, towers, cupolas, etc.) are those that comprise less than 20 percent of the roof
elevation. See also, Section 17.74.20 Vertical Projections.
3. When practicable, buildings shall be oriented so the gable end of the roof faces the
abutting street.
4. Pitched roofs visible from an abutting public street shall provide a secondary roof form
(e.g. dormer) in the quantity specified below. Secondary roof forms may be located
anywhere on the roof, although grouping these features is preferred.
17.90- 31

Roof Length Number of Secondary Roof Forms
30  40 feet 1
41  80 feet 2
81 feet and greater 4
5. Visible roof materials must be wood shingle or architectural grade composition shingle,
slate, or concrete tile. Metal with standing or batten seam may also be used conforming
to the Color Palette in Appendix D.
6. All roof and wall-mounted mechanical, electrical, communications, and service
equipment, including satellite dishes and vent pipes, shall be screened from view from all
adjacent public rights-of-way and civic spaces by parapets, walls or by other approved
means. Roof plans and elevations must show proposed equipment locations, approximate
dimensions, and line of sight from public rights-of-way and civic spaces. The reviewing
body may require additional equipment setbacks, screen walls, or other mitigation to
ensure compliance.
7. A-frame buildings and Mansard-style roofs are not permitted.
8. Exception to Pitched Roof: When a building requires a roof span greater than 50-feet, or
the internal function of the building or a portion of the building make construction of a
pitched roof impractical, the reviewing body may allow an alternative roof form. An
alternative roof form includes an applied pitched roof or flat roof constructed over the
building or portion of the building as specified below. An example when a pitched roof
is considered impractical would be the need to have large rooftop stove vents over the
kitchen portion of a restaurant. Roof forms constructed under this exception shall comply
with the standards below.
a. Applied Pitched Roof: An applied pitched roof is the preferred alternative roof
form and shall be considered first. An applied pitched roof is a roof form with the
general appearance of a pitched roof in terms of materials, pitch, and overhang, but
does not extend all the way from the eave of the building to the ridge of the roof as a
typical pitched roof. An applied pitched roof shall be constructed according to the
following:
1) For buildings with a span of less than 50 feet, the applied pitched roof shall
extend at least 50 percent of the distance from the eave to the ridge as if had been
constructed as a pitched roof;
2) For buildings with a span of 50 feet or greater, the applied pitched roof shall
extend at least 12 feet from eave.
3) The reviewing body may require buildings with a span of 50 feet or greater to
include an applied pitched roof in lieu of a flat roof along street facing
elevations.
b. Flat Roof: Flat roofs shall comply with the following standards:
17.90- 32
Revised by Ordinance 2013-04 effective 07/03/13
1) Sandy Style stepped parapets and detailed coursing shall be provided on those
elevations visible from a public street. Parapets shall be varied so that the length
of a parapet does not exceed 40 feet without a change in the parapet height of at
least 2 feet or as necessary to hide rooftop equipment.
2) Average parapet height shall not exceed 15 percent of the supporting wall height,
and the maximum parapet height shall not at any point exceed one-third (1/3) of
the height of the supporting wall;
3) A cornice projecting at least six (6) inches from the building face shall be
provided at the roofline of all elevations visible from public rights-of-way;
4) Parapet corners shall be stepped and the parapet be designed to emphasize the
center or primary entrance(s), unless the primary entrance is at the corner of the
building;
Figure 17.90.120-I: Parapet Detailing
D. Building Orientation and Entrances
Intent: To maintain and enhance General Commercial and Industrial streetscapes as public
spaces, emphasizing pedestrian-scale and character in new development, consistent with the
Sandy Style. (Figures 17.90.120-A, 17.90.120-B, 17.90.120-D, 17.90.120-E, 17.90.120-F,
17.90.120-G, and 17.90.120-H) and representative photos in Appendix E.
1. Buildings shall be oriented to a public street or civic space. This standard is met when at
least 50 percent of the subject sites street frontage is comprised of building(s) placed within
20 feet of a sidewalk, walkway or civic space and not more than 20 percent of the off-street
parking on a parcel as required by SDC 17.98, tract or area of land is located between a
buildings front façade and the adjacent street(s).
2. Where parking is placed between a front façade and a street, a landscaped berm and/or
architectural features, such as a knee wall, colonnade, arbor, trellis and/or similar device,
17.90- 33
Revised by Ordinance 2013-04 effective 07/03/13
shall be placed behind the sidewalk to partially screen the parking area from the sidewalk.
The partial screen shall be designed to achieve at least 50 percent opacity at the time of
installation, with openings for walkways connecting to the buildings primary entrance.
3. Ground floor spaces shall face a public street or civic space and shall be connected to it by a
direct pedestrian route (i.e., avoid out-of-direction travel).
4. Buildings located at the intersection of two streets shall use a corner building entrance;
where a corner entrance is not practical due to the internal functioning of the building
space or due to physical constraints of the site (e.g., topography, accessibility, or similar
circumstances), a building entrance must be provided within forty feet of the corner. The
building corner must use detailing that emphasizes the corner location and is consistent
with the Sandy Style. Examples of acceptable detailing include a rounded or chamfered
(beveled) corner, weather protecting canopy, plaza, sculpture, and/or similar pedestrianoriented
features.
5. For structures greater than 40,000 gross square feet, there shall be at least two (2) clearly
articulated public entrances on the structure; at least one such entrance shall be visible from
a public street and connected to that street by a pedestrian sidewalk or walkway.
6. Retail buildings shall provide at least one customer entrance for every 200 lineal feet of
anchor store space along at least one of the buildings street-facing elevation(s). Such
entrances may be oriented to a public street or designated civic space. Where ancillary stores
or offices are provided, entrances to those spaces must be placed not more than 40 feet apart
on average. For example, a 300 foot long building with one anchor store and four ancillary
stores would provide no fewer than two anchor space entrances spaced not more than 200
feet apart and four ancillary entrances placed not more than 40 feet apart on average.
7. Buildings shall provide at least one (1) elevation where the pedestrian environment is
activated. An elevation is activated when it meets the window transparency requirements
in subsection 17.90.120(E), below, and contains a public entrance with a pedestrian shelter
extending at least five (5) feet over an adjacent sidewalk, walkway or civic space.
8. Primary entrances must be architecturally emphasized and visible from the public rightof-
way and shall be sheltered with a canopy, overhang, or portico with a depth of at least
five (5) feet. Architectural emphasis should be provided by a gabled shelter where
practical, consistent with the Sandy Style. Detailing around the base of the building, such
as stonework, benches or art, should also be used to emphasize an entrance.
E. Windows
Intent: To promote business vitality, public safety and aesthetics through effective window
placement and design, consistent with the Sandy Style. (Figures 17.90.120-A, 17.90.120-B,
17.90.120-D, 17.90.120-E, 17.90.120-F, 17.90.120-G, and 17.90.120-H)
1. Unified Design. Building plans must provide for unity in window placement and design
so that all sides of a building relate to one another and multiple buildings on a
development site relate to one another.
2. Ground Floor Windows. The ground floor elevation of all new buildings shall contain
ground floor display areas, windows, and doorways on the activated frontage. as
follows:
Building Size Percentage Windows Required
17.90- 34
Revised by Ordinance 2013-04 effective 07/03/13
0 - 10,000 sq. ft. 30 percent of elevation
10,000 sq. ft. - 30,000 sq. ft. 25 percent of elevation
Greater than 30,000 sq. ft. 20 percent of elevation
a. Windows shall contain clear glass to allow views to interior activity or display areas.

standards in this chapter. All required landscaping and related improvements shall be
completed or financially guaranteed prior to the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy.
B. Appropriate care and maintenance of landscaping on-site and landscaping in the adjacent
public right-of-way is the right and responsibility of the property owner, unless City
ordinances specify otherwise for general public and safety reasons. If street trees or other
plant materials do not survive or are removed, materials shall be replaced in kind within 6
months.
C. Significant plant and tree specimens should be preserved to the greatest extent practicable
and integrated into the design of a development. Trees of 25-inches or greater circumference
measured at a height of 4-½ ft. above grade are considered significant. Plants to be saved and
methods of protection shall be indicated on the detailed planting plan submitted for approval.
Existing trees may be considered preserved if no cutting, filling, or compaction of the soil
takes place between the trunk of the tree and the area 5-ft. outside the trees drip line. Trees
to be retained shall be protected from damage during construction by a construction fence
located 5 ft. outside the dripline.
D. Planter and boundary areas used for required plantings shall have a minimum diameter of 5-
ft. (2-½ ft. radius, inside dimensions). Where the curb or the edge of these areas are used as a

CHAPTER 17.98 - PARKING, LOADING, & ACCESS REQUIREMENTS
17.98.00 INTENT
The intent of these regulations is to provide adequate capacity and appropriate location and
design of parking and loading areas as well as adequate access to such areas. The parking
requirements are intended to provide sufficient parking in close proximity for residents,
guests/visitors, customers, and/or employees of various land uses. These regulations apply to
both motorized vehicles (hereinafter referred to as vehicles) and bicycles.
17.98.10 GENERAL PROVISIONS
A. Provision and Maintenance. The provision of required off-street parking for vehicles and
bicycles and loading facilities for vehicles is a continuous obligation. Building permits or
other permits will only be issued after review and approval of site plans showing location of
permanent access, parking and loading facilities.
B. Unspecified Requirements. Vehicle and bicycle parking requirements for uses not specified
in this chapter shall be determined by the Director based upon the requirements of similar
specified uses.
C. New Structure or Use. When a structure is constructed or a new use of land is commenced,
on-site vehicle and bicycle parking and loading spaces shall be provided in accordance with
Section 17.98.20 below or as otherwise modified through a planned development or specific
area plan.
D. Alteration of Existing Structures. When an existing structure is altered to the extent that the
existing use is intensified, on-site vehicle and bicycle parking shall be provided in the
amount required for such intensification. Alteration of existing structures, increased intensity,
and change in use per Sections 17.98.10 (D.), (E.) and (F.) does not apply to commercial uses
in the Central Business District (C-1).
E. Increased Intensity. When increased intensity requires no more than four (4) vehicle spaces,
no additional parking facilities shall be required. However, the effects of changes, additions,
or enlargements shall be cumulative. When the net effect of one or more changes generates a
need for more than four spaces, the additional required spaces shall be provided. Additional
spaces shall be required for the intensification but not for the original use.
F. Change in Use. When an existing structure or use of land is changed in use from one use to
another use as listed in Section 17.98.20 below and the vehicle and bicycle parking
requirements for each use type are the same; no additional parking shall be required.
However, where a change in use results in an intensification of use in terms of number of
vehicle and bicycle parking spaces required, additional parking space shall be provided in an
amount equal to the difference between the number of spaces required for the existing use
and number of spaces required for the more intensive use.
G. Time of Completion. Required parking spaces and loading areas shall be improved and
available for use prior to issuance of a temporary certificate of occupancy and/or final
building inspection or final certificate of occupancy.

I. Truck Parking. In all residential zoning districts, no overnight parking of trucks or other
equipment on wheels or tracks exceeding a 1-ton capacity used in the conduct of a business
activity shall be permitted except vehicles and equipment necessary for farming on the
premises where such use is conducted.
J. Mixed Uses. In the case of mixed uses, the total required vehicle and bicycle parking shall be
the sum of requirements of individual uses computed separately.
K. Conflicting Parking Requirements. When a building or use is planned or constructed in such
a manner that more than one standard is applicable, the use that requires the greater number
of parking spaces shall govern.
L. Availability of Parking Spaces. Required vehicle and bicycle parking spaces shall be
unobstructed, available for parking of vehicles and bicycles of residents, customers, patrons,
and employees only, and shall not be used for storage of vehicles or materials or for parking
of vehicles and bicycles used in conducting the business or use and shall not be used for sale,
repair, or servicing of any vehicle or bicycle.
M. Residential Parking Analysis Plan. A Residential Parking Analysis Plan shall be required for
all new residential planned developments, subdivisions, and partitions to include a site plan
depicting all of the following:
1. Location and dimension of required parking spaces as specified in Section 17.98.200.
2. Location of areas where parking is not permitted as specified in Sections 17.98.200(A)(3)

CHAPTER 17.100 - LAND DIVISION
17.100.00 INTENT
The intent of this chapter is to implement the Comprehensive Plan, to provide procedures,
regulations, and design standards for land divisions and associated improvements and to provide
for orderly and efficient land division patterns supported by a connected system of streets, water
supply, sewage and drainage facilities.
The division of land is the initial step in establishing Sandys ultimate development pattern. The
framework of streets, blocks and individual lots is implemented through the land division
process. Density, units per gross acre, and dimensional standards are established in zoning
district regulations.
This chapter presents the review procedures, design standards and improvement requirements for
land divisions. Procedures for replats and property line adjustments are also addressed in this
chapter.
17.100.10 GENERAL PROVISIONS
A. No land shall be divided prior to approval of a minor partition, major partition or subdivision
in accordance with this Code.
B. No sale or conveyance of any portion of a lot, for other than a public purpose, shall leave a
structure on the remainder of a lot with less than the minimum lot, yard or setback
requirements of the zoning district.
C. Land division is processed by approval of a tentative plan prior to approval of the final land
division plat or map. Where a Type II or Type III procedure is required for land division
approval, that procedure shall apply to the tentative plan approval. As long as there is
compliance with the approved tentative plan and conditions, the Director shall have the
authority to approval final plats and maps for land divisions through a Type I procedure.
17.100.20 LAND DIVISION CLASSIFICATION - TYPE I, II OR III PROCEDURES
A. Type I Land Division (Property Line Adjustment). Property line adjustments shall be a Type
I procedure if the resulting parcels comply with standards of the Development Code and this
chapter.
B. Type I Land Division (Minor Partition). A minor partition shall be a Type I procedure if the
land division does not create a street and the resulting parcels comply with the standards of
the zoning district and this chapter.
C. Type II Land Division (Major Partition or Subdivision). A major partition or subdivision
shall be a Type II procedure when a street is extended, satisfactory street conditions exist and
the resulting parcels/lots comply with the standards of the zoning district and this chapter.
Satisfactory street conditions exist when the Director determines one of the following:
1. Existing streets are stubbed to the property boundaries and are linked by the land
division.
17.100 - 2
Revised by Ordinance No. 2013-04 (effective 07/03/13)
2. An existing street or a new proposed street need not continue beyond the land division in
order to complete an appropriate street system or to provide access to adjacent property.
3. The proposed street layout is consistent with a street pattern adopted as part of the
Comprehensive Plan or an officially adopted City street plan.
D. Type II Land Division (Minor Revised Plat). A minor replat of an existing platted
subdivision shall be a Type II procedure when the street(s) are existing and no extension or
reconstruction/realignment is necessary, when the replat does not increase the allowable
density, the resulting parcels comply with the standards of the zoning district and this
chapter, and the replat involves no more than six (6) lots.
E. Type III Land Division (Major Partition or Subdivision). A major partition or subdivision
shall be a Type III procedure if unsatisfactory street conditions exist or the resulting
parcels/lots do not comply with the standards of the zoning district and this chapter. The
Director shall determine if unsatisfactory street conditions exist based on one of the
following criteria:
1. The land division does not link streets that are stubbed to the boundaries of the property.
2. An existing street or a new proposed street will be extended beyond the boundaries of the
land division to complete a street system or provide access to adjacent property.
3. The proposed street layout is inconsistent with a street pattern adopted as part of the
Comprehensive Plan or officially adopted City street plan.
F. Type III Land Division (Major Replat). A major replat involves the realignment of property
lines involving more than six lots, even if the subdivision does not increase the allowable
density. All parcels resulting from the replat must comply with the standards of the zoning
district and this chapter. Any replat involving the creation, extension or modification of a
street shall be processed as a major replat.
17.100.30 PROPERTY LINE ADJUSTMENT
Approval of a property line adjustment is required to move a common boundary between two
parcels or lots. A Type I property line adjustment is not considered a development action for
purposes of determining whether floodplain, greenway, or right-of-way dedication or
improvements are required.
A. Application Requirements. Property line adjustment applications shall be made on forms
provided by the city and shall be accompanied by:
1. Eight copies of the property line adjustment map;

Access Management Policy guidelines.
17.100 - 10
Revised by Ordinance No. 2013-04 (effective 07/03/13)
C. Reduction of compliance with the cited State standards means that all reasonable alternatives
to reduce the number of accesses and avoid new non-complying accesses will be explored
during the development review. The methods to be explored include, but are not limited to:
closure, relocation, and consolidation of access; right-in/right-out driveways; crossover
easements; and use of local streets, alleys, and frontage roads.
17.100.100 STREETS GENERALLY
No subdivision or partition shall be approved unless the development has frontage or approved
access to an existing public street. In addition, all streets shall be graded and improved in
conformance with the City's construction standards, approved by the City Engineer, in
accordance with the construction plans.
A. Street Connectivity Principle. The pattern of streets established through land divisions should
be connected to: (a) provide safe and convenient options for cars, bikes and pedestrians; (b)
create a logical, recognizable pattern of circulation; and (c) spread traffic over many streets
so that key streets (particularly U.S. 26) are not overburdened.
B. Transportation Impact Studies. Transportation impact studies may be required by the city
engineer to assist the city to evaluate the impact of development proposals, determine
reasonable and prudent transportation facility improvements and justify modifications to the
design standards. Such studies will be prepared in accordance with the following:
1. A proposal established with the scope of the transportation impact study shall be
coordinated with, and agreed to, by the city engineer. The study requirements shall reflect
the magnitude of the project in accordance with accepted transportation planning and
engineering practices. A professional civil or traffic engineer registered in the State of
Oregon shall prepare such studies.
2. If the study identifies level-of-service conditions less than the minimum standards
established in the Sandy Transportation System Plan, improvements and funding
strategies mitigating the problem shall be considered as part of the land use decision for
the proposal.
C. Topography and Arrangement. All streets shall be properly related to special traffic
generators such as industries, business districts, schools, and shopping centers and to the
pattern of existing and proposed land uses.
D. Street Spacing. Street layout shall generally use a rectangular grid pattern with modifications
as appropriate to adapt to topography or natural conditions.
E. Future Street Plan. Future street plans are conceptual plans, street extensions and connections
on acreage adjacent to land divisions. They assure access for future development and
promote a logical, connected pattern of streets. It is in the interest of the city to promote a
logical, connected pattern of streets. All applications for land divisions shall provide a future
street plan that shows the pattern of existing and proposed future streets within the
boundaries of the proposed land divisions, proposed connections to abutting properties, and
extension of streets to adjacent parcels within a 400 foot radius of the study area where
development may practically occur.

Revised by Ordinance No. 2013-04 (effective 07/03/13)
F. Connections. Except as permitted under Exemptions, all streets, alleys and pedestrian
walkways shall connect to other streets within the development and to existing and planned
streets outside the development and to undeveloped properties which have no future street
plan. Streets shall terminate at other streets or at parks, schools or other public land within a
neighborhood.
Where practicable, local roads shall align and connect with other roads when crossing
collectors and arterials.
Proposed streets or street extensions shall be located to provide direct access to existing or
planned transit stops, and existing or planned neighborhood activity centers, such as schools,
shopping areas and parks.
G. Exemptions.
1. A future street plan is not required for partitions of residentially zoned land when none of
the parcels may be redivided under existing minimum density standards.
2. Standards for street connections do not apply to freeways and other highways with full
access control.
3. When street connection standards are inconsistent with an adopted street spacing standard
for arterials or collectors, a right turn in/right turn out only design including median
control may be approved. Where compliance with the standards would result in
unacceptable sight distances, an accessway may be approved in place of a street
connection.
17.100.110 STREET STANDARDS AND CLASSIFICATION
Street standards are illustrated in the figures included at the end of this chapter. Functional
definitions of each street type are described in the Transportation System Plan as summarized
below.
A. Major arterials are designed to carry high volumes of through traffic, mixed with some
unavoidable local traffic, through or around the city. Major arterials should generally be
spaced at 1-mile intervals.
B. Minor arterials are designed to collect and distribute traffic from major and minor arterials to
neighborhood collectors and local streets, or directly to traffic destinations. Minor arterials
should generally be spaced at 1-mile intervals.
C. Residential minor arterials are a hybrid between minor arterial and collector type streets that
allow for moderate to high traffic volumes on streets where over 90% of the fronting lots are
residential.
D. Collector streets are designed to collect and distribute traffic from higher type arterial streets
to local streets or directly to traffic destinations. Collector streets should generally be spaced
at 1/2-mile intervals.
E. Local streets are designed to provide direct access to abutting property and connect to
collector streets. A general spacing of 8-10 local streets per mile is recommended.
17.100 - 12
Revised by Ordinance No. 2013-04 (effective 07/03/13)
F. Cul-de-sacs and dead end streets are discouraged. If deemed necessary, cul-de-sacs shall be
as short as possible and shall not exceed 400 feet in length.
G. Public access lanes are designed to provide primary access to a limited number of dwellings
when the construction of a local street is unnecessary.
H. Alleys are designed to provide access to multiple dwellings in areas where lot frontages are
narrow and driveway spacing requirements cannot be met.
17.100.120 BLOCKS AND ACCESSWAYS
A. Blocks. Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for two tiers of lots at appropriate
depths. However, exceptions to the block width shall be allowed for blocks that are adjacent
to arterial streets or natural features.
B. Residential Blocks. Blocks fronting local streets shall not exceed 400 feet in length, unless
topographic, natural resource, or other similar physical conditions justify longer blocks.
Blocks may exceed 400 feet if approved as part of a Planned Development, Specific Area
Plan, adjustment or variance.
C. Commercial Blocks. Blocks located in commercial districts shall not exceed 400 feet in
length.
D. Pedestrian and Bicycle Access Way Requirements. In any block in a residential or
commercial district over 600 feet in length, a pedestrian and bicycle accessway with a
minimum improved surface of 10 feet within a 15-foot right-of-way or tract shall be provided
through the middle of the block. To enhance public convenience and mobility, such
accessways may be required to connect to cul-de-sacs, or between streets and other public or
semipublic lands or through greenway systems.
17.100.130 EASEMENTS
A minimum eight (8) foot public utility easement shall be required along property lines abutting
a right-of-way for all lots within a partition or subdivision. Where a partition or subdivision is
traversed by a watercourse, drainage way, channel or stream, the land division shall provide a
stormwater easement or drainage right-of-way conforming substantially with the lines of such
watercourse, and such further width as determined needed for water quality and quantity
protection.
17.100.140 PUBLIC ALLEYS
A. Public alleys shall have a minimum width of 20 feet. Structural section and surfacing shall
conform to standards set by the City Engineer.
B. Existing alleys may remain unimproved until redevelopment occurs. When development
occurs, each abutting lot shall be responsible for completion of improvements to that portion
of the alley abutting the property.
17.100 - 13
Revised by Ordinance No. 2013-04 (effective 07/03/13)
C. Parking within the alley right-of-way is prohibited except as provided in Section
17.100.140(D) below.
D. An alley with a minimum width of 28 feet may permit parallel parking on one side of the
alley only.
17.100.150 RESIDENTIAL SHARED PRIVATE DRIVES
A shared private drive is intended to provide access to a maximum of two (2) dwelling units.
A. Criteria for Approval
Shared private drives may be approved by the Director when one or more of the following
conditions exist:

size, shape, or natural features.
2. The construction of a local street is determined to be unnecessary.
B. Design
1. A shared private drive constructed to city standards shall not serve more than two (2)
dwelling units.
2. A shared access easement and maintenance agreement shall be established between the
two units served by a shared private drive. The language of the easement and
maintenance agreement shall be subject to approval by the Director.
3. Public utility easements shall be provided where necessary in accordance with Section
17.100.130.
4. Shared private drives shall be fully improved with an all weather surface (e.g. concrete,
asphalt, permeable pavers) in conformance with city standards. The pavement width shall
be 20 feet.
5. Parking shall not be permitted along shared private drives at any time and shall be signed
and identified accordingly.
17.100.160 PUBLIC ACCESS LANES
Public access lanes are designed to provide primary access to a limited number of dwellings
where the construction of a local street is not necessary. Public access lanes are intended to serve
a maximum of six (6) dwelling units.
A. Criteria for Approval
Public access lanes may be approved by the Director when certain conditions exist which
make the construction of a standard local street unnecessary. Approval of public access lanes
shall be based on one or more of the following:
1. Physical conditions such as natural features, unusual lot size, shape, or other unique
features prevent the construction of a local street.
2. It is determined that construction of a local street is not necessary to facilitate orderly

17.100.170 FLAG LOTS
Flag lots can be created where it can be shown that no other street access is possible to achieve
the requested land division. The flag lot shall have a minimum street frontage of 15 feet for its
accessway. The following dimensional requirements shall apply to flag lots:
A. Setbacks applicable to the underlying zoning district shall apply to the flag lot.
B. The access strip (pole) may not be counted toward the lot size requirements.
C. The accessway shall have a minimum paved width of 10 feet.
17.100.180 INTERSECTIONS
A. Intersections. Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles. A
proposed intersection of two new streets at an angle of less than 75 degrees shall not be
17.100 - 16
Revised by Ordinance No. 2013-04 (effective 07/03/13)
acceptable. No more than two streets shall intersect at any one point unless specifically
approved by the City Engineer. The city engineer may require left turn lanes, signals, special
crosswalks, curb extensions and other intersection design elements justified by a traffic study
or necessary to comply with the Development Code.
B. Curve Radius. All local and neighborhood collector streets shall have a minimum curve
radius (at intersections of rights-of-way) of 20 feet, unless otherwise approved by the City
Engineer. When a local or neighborhood collector enters on to a collector or arterial street,
the curve radius shall be a minimum of 30 feet, unless otherwise approved by the City
Engineer.
17.100.190 STREET SIGNS
The subdivider shall pay the cost of street signs prior to the issuance of a Certificate of
Substantial Completion. The City shall install all street signs and upon completion will bill the
developer for costs associated with installation. In addition, the subdivider may be required to
pay for any traffic safety devices related to the development. The City Engineer shall specify the
type and location of the street signs and/or traffic safety devices.
17.100.200 STREET SURFACING
Public streets, including alleys, within the development shall be improved in accordance with the
requirements of the City or the standards of the Oregon State Highway Department. An overlay
of asphalt concrete, or material approved by the City Engineer, shall be placed on all streets
within the development. Where required, speed humps shall be constructed in conformance with
the City's standards and specifications.
17.100.210 STREET LIGHTING
A complete lighting system (including, but not limited to: conduits, wiring, bases, poles, arms,
and fixtures) shall be the financial responsibility of the subdivider on all cul-de-sacs, local
streets, and neighborhood collector streets. The subdivider will be responsible for providing the
arterial street lighting system in those cases where the subdivider is required to improve an
arterial street. Standards and specifications for street lighting shall be coordinated with the utility
and any lighting district, as appropriate.
17.100.220 LOT DESIGN
A. The lot arrangement shall be such that there will be no foreseeable difficulties, for reason of
topography or other conditions, in securing building permits to build on all lots in
compliance with the Development Code.
B. The lot dimensions shall comply with the minimum standards of the Development Code.
When lots are more than double the minimum lot size required for the zoning district, the
subdivider may be required to arrange such lots to allow further subdivision and the opening
of future streets to serve such potential lots.
C. The lot or parcel width at the front building line shall meet the requirements of the
Development Code and shall abut a public street other than an alley for a width of at least 20
17.100 - 17
Revised by Ordinance No. 2013-04 (effective 07/03/13)
feet. A street frontage of not less than 15 feet is acceptable in the case of a flag lot division
resulting from the division of an unusually deep land parcel which is of a size to warrant
division into not more than two parcels.
D. Double frontage lots shall be avoided except where necessary to provide separation of
residential developments from arterial streets or to overcome specific disadvantages of
topography or orientation.
E. Lots shall avoid deriving access from major or minor arterials. When driveway access from
major or minor arterials may be necessary for several adjoining lots, the Director or the
Planning Commission may require that such lots be served by a common access drive in
order to limit possible traffic hazards on such streets. Where possible, driveways should be
designed and arranged to avoid requiring vehicles to back into traffic on minor or major
arterials.
17.100.230 WATER FACILITIES
Water lines and fire hydrants serving the subdivision or partition, and connecting the
development to City mains, shall be installed to provide adequate water pressure to serve present
and future consumer demand. The materials, sizes, and locations of water mains, valves, service
laterals, meter boxes and other required appurtenances shall be in accordance with the standards
of the Fire District, the City, and the State.
If the city requires the subdivider to install water lines in excess of eight inches, the city may
participate in the oversizing costs. Any oversizing agreements shall be approved by the city
manager based upon council policy and dependent on budget constraints. If required water mains
will directly serve property outside the subdivision, the city may enter into an agreement with the
subdivider setting forth methods for reimbursement for the proportionate share of the cost.
17.100.240 SANITARY SEWERS
Sanitary sewers shall be installed to serve the subdivision and to connect the subdivision to
existing mains. Design of sanitary sewers shall take into account the capacity and grade to allow
for desirable extension beyond the subdivision.
If required sewer facilities will directly serve property outside the subdivision, the city may enter
into an agreement with the subdivider setting forth methods for reimbursement by
nonparticipating landowners for the proportionate share of the cost of construction.
17.100.250 SURFACE DRAINAGE AND STORM SEWER SYSTEM
A. Drainage facilities shall be provided within the subdivision and to connect with off-site
drainage ways or storm sewers. Capacity, grade and materials shall be by a design approved
by the city engineer. Design of drainage within the subdivision shall take into account the
location, capacity and grade necessary to maintain unrestricted flow from areas draining
through the subdivision and to allow extension of the system to serve such areas.
B. In addition to normal drainage design and construction, provisions shall be taken to handle
any drainage from preexisting subsurface drain tile. It shall be the design engineer's duty to
17.100 - 18
Revised by Ordinance No. 2013-04 (effective 07/03/13)
investigate the location of drain tile and its relation to public improvements and building
construction.
C. The roof and site drainage from each lot shall be discharged to either curb face outlets (if
minor quantity), to a public storm drain or to a natural acceptable drainage way if adjacent to
the lot.
17.100.260 UNDERGROUND UTILITIES
All subdivisions or major partitions shall be required to install underground utilities (including,
but not limited to, electrical and telephone wiring). The utilities shall be installed pursuant to the
requirements of the utility company.
17.100.270 SIDEWALKS
Sidewalks shall be installed on both sides of a public street and in any special pedestrian way
within the subdivision.
17.100.280 BICYCLE ROUTES
If appropriate to the extension of a system of bicycle routes, existing or planned, the Director or
the Planning Commission may require the installation of bicycle lanes within streets. Separate
bicycle access ways may be required to reduce walking or cycling distance when no feasible
street connection is available.
17.100.290 STREET TREES
Where planting strips are provided in the public right-of-way, a master street tree plan shall be
submitted and approved by the Director. The street tree plan shall provide street trees
approximately every 30 on center for all lots.
17.100.300 EROSION CONTROL
Grass seed planting shall take place prior to September 30th on all lots upon which a dwelling
has not been started but the ground cover has been disturbed. The seeds shall be of an annual rye
grass variety and shall be sown at not less than four pounds to each 1000 square feet of land area.
17.100.310 REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS
The following improvements shall be installed at no expense to the city, consistent with the
design standards of Chapter 17.84, except as otherwise provided in relation to oversizing.
A. Drainage facilities

own option shall conform to the design standards of Chapter 17.84 and improvement standards
and specifications adopted by the city. Improvements shall be installed in accordance with the
following general procedure:
A. Improvement work shall not start until plans have been checked for adequacy and approved
by the city engineer. To the extent necessary for evaluation of the proposal, improvement
plans may be required before approval of the tentative plan of a partition or subdivision.
B. Improvement work shall not start until after the city is notified. If work is discontinued for
any reason it shall not resume until the city is notified.
C. Improvements shall be constructed under the inspection and to the satisfaction of the city
engineer.
D. All improvements installed by the subdivider shall be guaranteed as to workmanship and
material for a period of one year following acceptance by the City Engineer. Such guarantee
shall be secured by cash deposit in the amount of the value of the improvements as set by the
City Engineer.
E. A map showing public improvements as built shall be filed with the city engineer upon
completion of the improvements.
17.100.330 OPTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENTS
Before the signature of the City Engineer is obtained on the final partition or subdivision plat, the
applicant shall install the required improvements, agree to install required improvements, or have
gained approval to form an improvement district for installation of the improvements required
with the tentative plat approval. These procedures are more fully described as follows:
A. Install Improvements. The applicant may install the required improvements for the
subdivision prior to recording the final subdivision plat. If this procedure is to be used, the
subdivision plat shall contain all the required certifications except the County Surveyor and
the Board of County Commissioners. The City shall keep the subdivision plat until the
improvements have been completed and approved by the City Engineer. Upon City
Engineer's approval, the City shall forward the final subdivision plat for certification by the
Board of County Commissioners and then to the County Clerk for recording; or
17.100 - 20
Revised by Ordinance No. 2013-04 (effective 07/03/13)
B. Agree to Install Improvement. The applicant may execute and file with the City an agreement
specifying the period within which required improvements shall be completed. The
agreement shall state that if the work is not completed within the period specified, the City
may complete the work and recover the full cost and expense from the applicant. A
performance guarantee shall be required. The agreement may provide for the construction of
the improvements in increments and for an extension of time under specified conditions; or
C. Form Improvement District. The applicant may have all or part of the public improvements
constructed under an improvement district procedure. Under this procedure the applicant
shall enter into an agreement with the City proposing establishment of the district for
improvements to be constructed, setting forth a schedule for installing improvements, and
specifying the extent of the plat to be improved. The City reserves the right under the
improvement district procedure to limit the extent of improvements in a subdivision during a
construction year and may limit the area of the final subdivision plat to the area to be
improved. A performance guarantee shall be required under the improvement district
procedure. The formation of a LID is entirely within the discretion of the city.
17.100.340 PERFORMANCE GUARANTEE
If the applicant chooses to utilize the opportunities provided under "A" or "B" above, the
applicant shall provide a performance guarantee equal to 110% of the cost of the improvements
to assure full and faithful performance thereof, in one of the following forms:
A. A surety bond executed by a surety company authorized to transact business in the State of
Oregon in a form approved by the City Attorney.
B. In lieu of the surety bond, the applicant may:
1. Deposit with the City cash money to be released only upon authorization of the City
Engineer;
2. Supply certification by a bank or other reputable lending institution that money is being
held to cover the cost of required improvements to be released only upon authorization of
the City Engineer;
3. Supply certification by a bank or other reputable lending institution that a line of credit
has been established to cover the cost of required improvements, to be utilized only upon
authorization of the City Engineer; or
4. Provide bonds in a form approved by the City Attorney.
C. Such assurance of full and faithful performance shall be for a sum determined by the City
Engineer as sufficient to cover the cost of required improvements, including related
engineering and incidental expenses.
D. If the applicant fails to carry out provisions of the agreement and the City has expenses
resulting from such failure, the City shall call on the performance guarantee for
reimbursement. If the amount of the performance guarantee exceeds the expense incurred,
the remainder shall be released. If the amount of the performance guarantee is less than the
expense incurred, the applicant shall be liable to the City for the difference.

retention standard if they meet these requirements.
B. Tree Protection Area: Except as otherwise determined by the Planning Director, all tree
protection measures set forth in this section shall be instituted prior to any development
activities and removed only after completion of all construction activity. Tree protection
measures are required for land disturbing activities including but not limited to tree removal,
clearing, grading, excavation, or demolition work.

limited to dumping or storage of materials such as building supplies, soil, waste items,
equipment, or parked vehicles.
C. Inspection. The applicant shall not proceed with any tree removal or construction activity,
