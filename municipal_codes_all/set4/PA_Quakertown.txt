ARTICLE A.
Police Pension.
§ 401. Creation of Fund. [Ord. 988, 4/7/1993]
Pursuant to the provisions of Act 600 of 1956, the Borough of Quakertown
hereby establishes and reenacts a Police Pension Fund (originally passed
as Ordinance 591 of 1957, as amended) (hereinafter referred to as the
"fund") for the benefit of all full time police officers in the Quakertown
Police Department.
§ 402. Administration of Fund. [Ord. 988, 4/7/1993]
The fund shall be under the super vision of the Borough Council of
Quakertown. However, Borough Council may appoint the Borough Manager
or a Pension Fund Committee who shall supervise the activities of the fund
and who shall report to Borough Council. In addition, Borough Council may
appoint a trustee who shall manage the fund, and report directly to the
Borough Manager, Pension Police Fund Committee and/or Borough Council.
§ 403. Membership in the Fund. [Ord. 988, 4/7/1993]
Any full time police officer shall become a member of the fund by
completing a form provided by the Borough. In joining the fund, the member
agrees to be bound by the provisions of this Part and amendments thereto,
and by applicable State statutes including Act 600 of 1956, as amended. For
purpose of this Part, a full-time police officer is one appointed by Borough
Council in conformance with any/all state laws and Borough ordinances. A
member's actual beginning date for purposes of calculating benefits shall be
his first day of full-time employment in the Quakertown Police Department.
§ 404. Contributions by Members. [Ord. 988, 4/7/1993; as amended
by Ord. 1083, 5/7/2003, § 404]
Each member shall pay into the fund an amount equal to but not less
than 5% nor more than 8% of salary as deducted from each paycheck. For
purposes of this section, "salary" shall be defined as W-2 wages (including
base pay, overtime, longevity and holiday pay). However, Borough Council
shall review annually the financial condition of the fund and may, by annual
resolution, reduce or eliminate contributions by members.
§ 405. Retirement from Active Duty. [Ord. 988, 4/7/1993; as
amended by Ord. 1001, 9/1/1993, § 1; and by Ord. 1167, 2/3/2010]
A member of the fund who shall have attained the age of 50 years and
who shall have served an aggregate of at least 25 years in the Quakertown
Police Department may retire from active duty. The monthly pension or
§ 401 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 405
1:35
retirement benefits shall be computed at 1/2 the average monthly salary
of such member during the last 36 months of employment. For purposes
of computing this pension benefit, "salary" shall be defined as W-2 wages
(including base pay, overtime, longevity and holiday pay). In addition, the
pension benefit will be increased by a service increment of $100 per month
for each year of service in excess of 25, up to a maximum service increment
of $500 per month.
§ 406. Members Leaving the Fund Before Retirement Date. [Ord.
988, 4/7/1993]
Any member who dies, is discharged or voluntarily withdraws, or retires on
disability with less than 12 years of service or membership in the fund and
has not acquired vested rights shall be paid all of his contributions to the
fund, plus 5% interest that has accrued.
§ 407. Vesting Rights. [Ord. 988, 4/7/1993]
All members in the fund shall have the right to vested pension benefits
following a minimum of 12 years of membership in the Fund. Any member
who wishes to vest his pension must file his intent to do so in writing to
Borough Council within 90 days of the date he ceases to be a full-time
policeman in Quakertown. The pension shall be payable starting after a
projected retirement date, that is, the date the member would have retired
had he remained in the fund. Upon reaching this projected retirement date,
he shall be paid a monthly retirement benefit determined by applying the
percentage his years of service to the years he would have rendered had
he continued to work until actual retirement, to the monthly pension. The
monthly pension shall be 1/2 the average monthly salary the member was
paid during his last 60 months of employment in the fund.

Council, be retired on disability allowance. However, before approval by
Borough Council, the member must submit to a physical examination by
a physician designated by Council, and this physician must certify that

performance of his duties such that he ought to be retired, and that
such incapacity was caused by an incident that occurred while being
employed on duty in the Quakertown Police Department.
2. Once every year Council may require any disability annuitant to
undergo a medical examination by a physician designated by Council.
Should the physician report and certify to Council that such disabled
annuitant is no longer physically or mentally incapacitated for the
performance of his duties associated with the normal occupational
requirements of any position with the Police Department, then his
disability benefits hereunder shall be discontinued. Should a disability
annuitant refuse to submit to at least one medical examination in any
year by a physician designated by Council, his disability benefits
hereunder shall be discontinued until withdrawal of such refusal, and
should such refusal continue for one year, then all his rights in and to
any municipal annuity for disability or for retirement not voluntarily
provided for by this act shall be forfeited.
3. In the event a member is killed in service and his widow and/or children
are not eligible for any benefits under § 409 of the plan, the member's
designated beneficiary shall be paid all of his contributions to the fund,
plus 5% interest that has accrued. [Amended by Ord. 1167, 2/3/

4. If a member retires because of a "total and permanent disability," he
shall be entitled to receive a pension benefit equal to 50% of his base
salary at the time the disability was incurred, offset by Social Security.
This benefit shall continue until his death. "Total and permanent
disability" shall mean any condition arising from service-connected
illness or injury which precludes an employee from performing the
duties associated with the normal occupational requirements of any
position with the Police Department as certified by a physician
designated by the Borough.
1. If a member dies, survived by a spouse or dependent children, after
having become eligible to receive a pension benefit [i.e., he was eligible
because (i) he was already receiving a pension (ii) he met the age and
service requirements but he had not yet retired], then a monthly
pension benefit shall be provided.
2. The amount of the monthly pension benefit shall be 50% of the pension
the member was receiving or would have been entitled to receive if he
had been retired at the time of his death.
3. In the event the member dies after completing 12 or more years of
service but was not yet eligible for normal retirement or preretirement
survivor benefits, the surviving spouse shall act on behalf of the
member in selecting the alternative addressed in § 407. If a vested

Each member shall be entitled to a cost-of-living increase to commence
on the first January 1 from the commencement of his pension and on
each January 1 thereafter. Such cost-of-living increases shall not exceed
the percentage increase as determined by the Department of Labor in the
All Urban Consumers Price Index for the Philadelphia Metropolitan Region
from the year in which the member last worked; provided further, that in no
such case shall the total police pension benefits exceed 75% of the salary
for computing retirement benefits; and, provided further, that the total costof-
living increase shall not exceed 30%. No cost-of-living increase shall be
granted which would impair the actuarial soundness of the pension plan.
benefit is selected, the surviving spouse shall receive 50% of the
member's vested monthly benefit commencing on the first day of the
month following the member's normal retirement date.
4. In the event a member dies after completing 20 or more years of service
but was not yet eligible for normal retirement or preretirement survivor
benefits, the surviving spouse shall act on behalf of the member in
selecting the alternative addressed in § 413. If an early retirement
benefit is selected, the surviving spouse shall receive 50% of the
member's monthly early retirement benefit commencing on the first day
of the month following the election of this benefit.
5. The monthly pension benefit is payable to the surviving spouse until
death, then to surviving dependent children under the age of 18 years
or if attending college, under or attaining the age of 23 years. Attending
college shall mean the eligible children are registered at an accredited
institution of higher learning and are carrying a minimum course load
of seven credit hours per semester. Dependent children shall include
step-children, adopted children and any child conceived at the time of
the member's death.
6. In the event the member dies (and is not killed in service) before
completing 12 years of service, his surviving spouse or, if no spouse
survives or if he or she survives and subsequently dies, the child or
children under the age of 18 years or, if attending college, under or
attaining the age of 23 years, of the member of the police force shall be
entitled to receive payment of all money which the member invested in
the pension fund plus interest or other increases in the value of the
member’s investment in the pension fund, unless the member has
designated another beneficiary for this purpose. [Added by Ord. 1191,
4/4/2012]
§ 409 QUAKERTOWN CODE § 412
1:38
§ 412. Applicability to State Laws. [Ord. 988, 4/7/1993]
It is the intention of Borough Council of the Borough of Quakertown to
establish this pension plan and fund in accordance with Pennsylvania Laws
and Act 600 and Act 205 and any other applicable laws of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
§ 413. Early Retirement Benefit. [Ord. 1065, 4/9/20001, § 1]
Each member may retire on or at any time after his early retirement
date. (For purposes of this section, early retirement date shall mean the
first day following the date on which the member completes 20 years of
service.) Upon termination, the member must file with the Manager of
the Borough a written notice of his intention to elect an early retirement
benefit. This benefit shall become effective as of the date of the notice or the
date designated in the notice, whichever is later. The amount of the early
retirement benefit shall be the actuarial equivalent of a vested retirement
benefit. The actuarial equivalent of the vested retirement benefit shall be
determined by actuarially reducing the vested retirement benefit to reflect
that it will commence on the effective date of the early retirement rather
than on the member's normal retirement date. The actuarial reduction shall
be calculated using the actuarial assumptions reported in the last actuarial
valuation filed with the Public Employee Retirement Commission.
§ 414. Purchase of Military Service. [Ord. 1065, 4/9/2001, § 1]
1. The police pension plan may provide full service credit for each year of
military service or fraction thereof, not to exceed five years, to any
member of the police force who was not employed by the Borough prior
to such military service. The amount due for the purchase of credit for
military service other than intervening military service shall be
computed by applying average normal cost rate for the police pension
plan as certified by the Public Employee Retirement Study Commission,
but not to exceed 10%, to the member's average annual rate of
compensation over the first three years of municipal service and
multiplying the result by the member of years and fractional part of a
year of creditable nonintervening military service being purchased,
together with interest at the rate of 4 3/4% compounded annually from
the date of initial entry into municipal service to the date of payment.
Any member of the police force shall be eligible to receive service credit
for nonintervening military service, provided that he is not entitled to
receive, eligible to receive now or in the future or is receiving
retirement benefits for such service under a retirement system
administered and wholly or partially paid for by any other governmental
agency, with the exception of a member eligible to receive or receiving
military retirement pay earned by a combination of active duty and
nonactive duty with a reserve or National Guard component of the
armed forces, which retirement pay is payable only upon the attainment
of a specified age and period of service under 10 U.S.C. Chapter 67
§ 412 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 414
1:39
§ 415. Deferred Retirement Option Plan. [Ord. 1126, 12/6/2006, § 1]
(relating to retired pay for nonregular service). [Amended by Ord.
1191, 4/4/2012]
2. Any member of the Borough of Quakertown Police Department who has
been employed as such for at least six months and who enters active
military service for the United States shall have credited to his
employment record for pension or retirement benefits all of the time
spent by him in such military service, provided that he return to
employment within six months after his separation from such military
service and be ineligible to receive military retirement pay as a result of
that service. [Added by Ord. 1191, 4/4/2012]
1. Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms shall have the
meanings indicated:
BENEFICIARY — The individual identified by a police officer to receive
the contents of an officer's DROP account in the event of the death of an
officer during period in which the officer is participating in the DROP,
but before the officer separates from employment.
DROP — Deferred retirement option plan.
DROP ACCOUNT — Separate account created to accept DROP
participants' monthly pension check while a DROP participant.
FUND OR PLAN — The Police Pension Plan for the Borough of
Quakertown.
POLICE OFFICERS — Police officers of the Borough of Quakertown.
2. Eligibility. As of the effective date of this section, police officers who
have not retired prior to the implementation of the DROP program, may
enter into DROP on the first day of any month following completion of
25 years of credited service and attaining the age of 50.
3. Written Election.
A. A police officer electing to participate in the DROP must complete
and file with the Borough Manager a "drop option form" prepared
by the Borough which shall evidence the member's participation in
the DROP. The form must be signed by the member and notarized
and submitted to the Borough prior to the date on which the
member wishes the DROP option to be effective. The DROP option
notice shall include an irrevocable notice to the Borough, by the
member, that the member shall resign from employment with the
Borough Police Department effective on a specific date (the
"resignation date"). In no event shall the resignation date be
shorter than 12 months or longer than 60 months from the
execution of the DROP option form. An officer shall cease to work
as a police officer on the officer's resignation date, unless the
Borough terminates or honorably discharges the officer prior to the
resignation date.
§ 414 QUAKERTOWN CODE § 415
1:40
B. In addition, all retirement documents required by the Police
Pension Plan Administrator must be filed and presented to the
Borough for approval of retirement and payment of pension. Once a
retirement application has been approved by the Borough, it is
irrevocable.
4. Pension Contributions. A police officer shall not be required to make
any contributions to the fund during his/her DROP period.
5. Limitation on Pension Accrual. After the effective date of the DROP
option, the police officer shall no longer earn or accrue additional years
of continuous service for pension purposes.
6. Benefit Calculation. For all retirement fund purposes, continuous
service of a police officer participating in the DROP shall remain as it
existed on the effective date of commencement of participation in the
DROP. Service thereafter shall not be recognized or used for the
calculation or determination of any benefits payable by the Police
Pension Plan of the Borough. The average monthly compensation of the
police officer for pension calculation purposes shall remain, as it
existed on the effective date of commencement of participation in the
DROP. Earnings or increases in earnings thereafter shall not be
recognized or used for the calculation or determination of any benefits
payable by the Pension Plan.
7. Payments to the DROP Account. The monthly retirement benefits that
would have been payable had the police officer elected to cease
employment and receive a normal retirement benefit, shall, upon the
police officer commencing participation in DROP, be paid into the
separate account established to receive the participant's monthly
pension payments. This account shall be designated the DROP account.
An individual officer's DROP account shall be a self-directed investment
vehicle with the officer having exclusive control over the investment of
his or her DROP account monies. The Borough accepts no responsibility
and makes no guarantee for the performance of any investments made
by the officer, nor shall the Borough guarantee or be required to
guarantee that an officer's DROP account generate a specific amount of
earnings or income or any earnings or income at all. Any investment
losses occurring in an officer's DROP account shall be solely the
responsibility of the officer, and the Borough assumes no liability or
responsibility for the same. Likewise, the Borough's establishment of a
DROP shall not be construed to endorse any retirement vehicle,
investment manager, nor shall the DROP be construed as providing tax
advice or other information to retirees. By entering into the DROP, each
participating officer holds the Borough harmless for any tax, financial
or other consequences of the DROP program or the officer's
participation therein.
8. Accrual of Non-Pension Benefits. After a police officer elects to
participate in the DROP program, all other contractual benefits shall
continue to accrue with the exception of those provisions relating to the
§ 415 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 415
1:41
Police Pension Plan and the buyback of accrued, but unused, sick or
vacation time. A police officer may utilize leave time during the DROP
period, but the Borough shall not be required to buyback any such
unused leave time at the end of the DROP period.
9. Payout. Upon the resignation date set forth in the police officer's drop
option notice or such date as the Borough separates the member from
employment, the retirement benefits payable to the police officer or the
police officer's designated beneficiary, if applicable, shall be paid to the
police officer or beneficiary and shall no longer be paid to the police
officer's deferred retirement option account. Within 30 days following
termination of a police officer's employment pursuant to their
participating in the DROP program, the balance in the police officer's
DROP account shall be paid to the police officer in a single lump sum
payment or at the police officer's option, in any manner permitted by
law. By participating in the DROP, each officer agrees to hold the
Borough harmless for any tax or other consequences flowing from the
officer's disposition of the payout under this section.
10. Disability During DROP. If a police officer becomes temporarily
incapacitated during his participation in DROP, that police officer shall
continue to participate in the DROP program as if fully employed. The
police officer shall receive disability pay in the same amount as disabled
police officers that are not participating in DROP. In no event shall a
police officer on temporary disability have the ability to draw from his
DROP account. However, notwithstanding any other provision in this
paragraph, if a police officer is disabled and has not returned to work as
of his required resignation date then such resignation shall take
precedence over all other provisions herein and said officer shall be
required to resign. If a police officer becomes permanently disabled
during the DROP period, the officer shall be honorably discharged from
employment, on the date that the police officer may obtain the contents
of his DROP account and, thereafter, commence receiving his normal
pension benefit.
11. Death. If a DROP participant dies before the DROP account balances
are paid, the participant member's designated beneficiary shall have
the same rights as the police officer to withdraw the account balance.
However, if a DROP participant dies during the DROP period and the
Act 600 killed-in-service death benefit is payable to the deceased DROP
participant, then the DROP election shall be revoked and the DROP
account shall not be payable to any designated beneficiary of the
deceased DROP participant. If death occurs during the DROP period
but the Act 600 killed-in-service death benefit is not payable, then the
DROP participant's designated beneficiary shall be entitled to a lump
sum payment of the DROP account balance and any applicable survivor
benefit shall be paid by the Fund.
12. Forfeiture of Benefits. Notwithstanding a police officer's participation
in the DROP Plan, a police officer who is convicted or pleads guilty to
engaging in criminal misconduct which constitutes a "crime related to
§ 415 QUAKERTOWN CODE § 415
1:42
public office or public employment," as that phrase is defined in
Pennsylvania's Pension Forfeiture Act, 43 P.S. §§ 1311-1314, and
interpreted thereunder, shall forfeit his right to receive a pension,
including any amounts currently deposited in the DROP account. In
such a case, the police officer shall only be entitled to receive the
contributions, if any, made by the police officer to the Fund, without
interest.
13. Amendment. Any amendments to the DROP ordinance shall be
consistent with the provisions covering deferred retirement option
plans set forth in any applicable collective bargaining agreement and
shall be binding upon all future DROP participants and upon all DROP
participants who have balances in their deferred retirement option
accounts. The DROP plan may only be amended by a written
instrument, not by any oral agreement or past practice.
14. Effect of Provisions. A police officer's election to participate in the
DROP program shall in no way be construed as a limitation on the
Borough's right to suspend or to terminate a police officer for just cause
or to grant the police officer an honorable discharge based upon a
physical or mental inability to perform his or her duties.
15. Change in Law. In the event that the DROP provision is declared invalid
or illegal by a court of competent jurisdiction or through an
administrative determination of the Office of the Auditor General, the
police officers shall not have the right to bargain in accordance with Act
111 over deletion of this benefit.

1. Contributions by Members. Members are not required to contribute

members to contribute in order to keep the fund actuarially sound. If
contributions are required, members would contribute a percentage of
their annual compensation. The Council, on a annual basis, by

after discontinuance). If such discontinuance is due to death, then such
refund shall be paid to his designated beneficiary or, in the absence
thereof, to his estate. If the disabled or retired member is receiving a
benefit by reason of disability or retirement, then the refund payable to
the beneficiary is equal to the individual account balance at the date of

donors of such funds and property may prescribe.
1. Normal Retirement. Each member may retire on or at any time after his
normal retirement date. Any member so retiring shall be entitled to
receive a monthly pension commencing as of the first day of the month

ending with the payment made as of the first day of the month in which
his death occurs. The monthly pension to which such retired member
shall be entitled under this plan shall be equal to 1.7% average
compensation for each year of service, measured in years and
completed months, subject to a maximum of 25 years. Notwithstanding
the above, if an employee retires in January of 2010 and is within five

average compensation for each year of service, including all service
through his or her normal retirement date, measured in years and
completed months, subject to a maximum of 25 years. [Amended by
Ord. 1168, 3/1/2010]
§ 424 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 425
1:47
2. Postponed Retirement. An employee shall be allowed to continue as an
employee beyond his normal retirement date. In such case, the

ceases to be an employee. Any member on postponed retirement shall
continue to make contributions required pursuant to § 424, Subsection
1.
3. Early Retirement. Each member may retire on or after his early
retirement date. The benefit payable at the early retirement date shall
be the benefit described in Subsection 1 reduced by 6 2/3% for each
year up to five, and 3 1/3% for each year between five and 10, that the
early retirement date precedes normal retirement. [Amended by Ord.
1168, 3/1/2010; by Ord. 1204, 8/6/2014; by Ord. No. 1220, 9/6/
2017; and by Ord. No. 1221, 10/4/2017]
A. Notwithstanding the above, if an employee retires in January of
2010 and is within five years of his or her normal retirement date,
the benefit payable at the early retirement date shall be the benefit
described in Subsection 1, unreduced by the number of years that
early retirement proceeds normal retirement.
B. Notwithstanding the above, if an employee retired in June of 2012
and was within five years of his normal retirement date, the benefit
payable at the early retirement date shall be the benefit described
in Subsection 1, unreduced by the number of years that early
retirement precedes normal retirement.
C. Notwithstanding the above, if any employee retires in September
2017, was between four and five years from his or her normal
retirement date and has completed 23 or more years of service, the
benefit payable at the early retirement date shall be the benefit
described in Subsection 1, based on the maximum 25 years of
service under the pension formula and reduced for early
commencement by the number of years that January 1, 2019,
precedes normal retirement.
D. Notwithstanding the above, if the Borough's Director of Services
retires after age 60 but prior to July 1, 2028 (his normal retirement
date), the benefit payable at the early retirement date shall be the
benefit described in Subsection 1, unreduced for early
commencement.
4. Cost-of-Living Increases. Retired members shall be eligible for cost-ofliving

Consumers (CPI-U) as it applies to Philadelphia consumers; however,
not to exceed 3% in any such year; and, provided further, that the
overall benefit limit does not exceed 150% of the normal retirement
benefits.
§ 425 QUAKERTOWN CODE § 426
1:48
§ 426. Death Benefits. [Ord. 1006, 11/2/1994, § 1; as amended by
Ord. 1068, 10/3/2001, § 1; by Ord. 1069, 12/5/2001, § 1; and by Ord.
1181, 7/6/2011]
§ 427. Vesting and Severance of Employment. [Ord. 1006, 11/2/
1994, § 1; as amended by Ord. 1009, 4/5/1995, § 1]
1. If a member who is partially or totally vested in his accrued pension or
who is eligible for early or normal retirement dies, his spouse shall
receive a monthly pension, payable at the member’s earliest retirement
date and for the remainder of the spouse’s lifetime, equal to 50% of the
pension the member would have received if he had terminated
employment on the date of his death, survived until his earliest
retirement date, elected the 50% survivor life annuity form of pension
and then died. If the deceased member’s spouse is not alive, this death
benefit shall be payable, in equal shares, to the member’s dependent
children under age 18, if any.
2. In lieu of receiving the monthly survivor’s pension, the survivors may
elect to receive a refund of the accumulated member’s contributions
with interest.
3. If a member dies before vesting or retirement eligibility, his designated
beneficiary shall receive a refund of the accumulated member’s
contributions with interest.
4. If a member dies after retirement, any death benefits will be
determined by the form of payment of his retirement benefit chosen at
retirement.
1. If a member leaves the employ of the Borough or ceases to be a member
whether by reason of his transfer, resignation, discharge or death or by
reason of retirement other than becoming eligible for benefits pursuant
to §§ 425 or 426 of this plan, he shall be entitled to a refund of all
contributions made by him and then on deposit in the fund, plus interest
thereon, computed at the rate described in § 424, Subsection 1.
However, the member may elect to leave his contributions, plus
interest, in the fund so as to receive a vested pension benefit to start his
normal retirement date if he has at least six years of service. The
vesting percentage is determined from the schedule below:
Years of Service Vesting Percentage
6 60%
7 70%
8 80%
9 90%
10 100%
2. The amount of vested pension benefit shall be computed in accordance
with § 425 as of the date of termination multiplied by the vesting
§ 426 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 427
1:49
§ 428. Method of Distribution of Benefits. [Ord. 1006, 11/2/1994,
§ 1]
§ 429. Management of Fund. [Ord. 1006, 11/2/1994, § 1]
percentage. No member shall be eligible for vesting without at least six
years of service.
1. Refund of member's contributions becoming distributable pursuant to
§ 427 shall be paid in the form of lump-sum distribution.
2. Options on Normal, Early Retirement or Vesting. At the time a member
elects to receive a retirement benefit allowance, the benefit is payable
throughout the member's life, in which case the benefit is known as a
single life annuity. The member may alternatively elect at the time of
retirement, or prior to retirement, to receive the following actuarial
equivalent value in a lessor allowance:
A. Straight Life Annuity. This optional form provides a monthly
annuity for the life time of the member. There are no death benefits
provided. This form must have spousal consent.
B. Life Annuity With Certain Period. This optional form provides a
monthly annuity for the lifetime of the member. If his death occurs
before the end of a specified certain period of five, 10 or 15 years,
the balance of the annuity payments for the certain period will be
paid to the beneficiary. The certain period must be named by the
member before his retirement date and cannot be changed after
such date. The member may change his beneficiary at any time.
C. Survivorship Life Annuity. This optional form provides a monthly
annuity for the lifetime of the member. Upon his death, a
percentage of 50%, 66 2/3% or 100% will continue for the lifetime
of his contingent annuitant. The survivorship percentage and
contingent annuitant must be named by the member before his
retirement date and cannot be changed after such date. If the
contingent annuitant dies before the member's retirement date,
this optional form is canceled.
3. For options in Subsection 2B and C above, the actual amounts shall be
determined by use of an actuarial equivalent table with proper interest
percentage that is in effect at the time of retirement. Should a member
who has elected a single life annuity die before receiving in annuity
payments the full amount of the total accumulated member's
contribution deductions standing to his credit in the member account
on the effective date of retirement, the balance shall be paid to the
designated beneficiary.
1. It is the duty of the trustee to pay the benefits to members and their
beneficiaries, as provided in §§ 425, 426, 427 and 428 in accordance
with the instructions received from the Council; provided, however, that
§ 427 QUAKERTOWN CODE § 429
1:50
§ 430. The Council. [Ord. 1006, 11/2/1994, § 1]
the duty of the trustee to make such payments is wholly contingent
upon the sufficiency of the fund for such purpose.
2. The Borough may employ as actuary, investment advisors, counsel or
other professional consultants from time to time in connection with the

respect to matters coming before it concerning employees in similar
circumstances.

the trustee's administration of the trust and shall give proper
instructions to the trustee for the carrying out of the purposes of this
plan.

plan indefinitely and will from time to time contribute to the fund such
amounts as may be needed to provide the benefits set forth in the plan;
but continuance of the plan is not assumed as an obligation of the
Borough and the right is reserved by the Borough at any time to reduce,
suspend or discontinue its contributions hereunder.

§ 433. Miscellaneous. [Ord. 1006, 11/2/1994, § 1]
3. Nothing contained in the plan shall be held or construed as a contract
or guarantee of employment nor to create any liability upon the
Borough to retain any person in its service. The Borough reserves the
full right to discontinue the service of any person without any liability
except for salary or wages that may be due and unpaid, whenever in its
judgment its best interests so require, and such discontinuance shall be
without regard to this plan.
1. The Borough may amend, curtail or terminate this plan at any time;
provided, however, that no amendment affecting the trustee shall be
made without its consent (other than an amendment having the effect of
terminating the plan); nor shall any amendment be made which will, in
any manner, divert any part of the fund to any purpose other than the
exclusive benefit of members of their, beneficiaries (except upon
termination such diversion may be made after all of the fixed and
contingent liabilities to members and their beneficiaries have been
met); nor shall any amendment be made at any time which will, in any
manner, divest any benefit then vested in a member.
2. In the event of termination of this plan, the trustee, upon written
instructions from Council, shall allocate the assets then remaining in
the fund, to the extent that such assets are sufficient, to members and
retired members in the following order of precedence:
A. To members and retired members in an amount equal to their
respective contributions with interest, reduced in the case of
retired members by any prior distributions made to them.
B. To provide benefits due members in the proportion that the pension
earned by each member bears to the total pensions earned for all
such members.
C. The remaining assets, if any, to each of the remaining members in
the proportion that his pension credits earned to the date of
termination bears to the total pension credits so earned for all such
remaining members.
3. After allocation of the fund, the Council shall determine whether to
operate the fund as the source of whatever payments the money so
allocated will provide.
1. No benefit under this plan shall be subject in any manner to
anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge or
encumbrance, nor to seizure, attachment or other legal process for the
debts of any member or member's beneficiary. This provision shall not
apply to a "qualified domestic relations order" defined in IRS Code
§ 431 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 433
1:53
Section 414(p), and those other domestic relations orders permitted to
be so treated by the Council under the provisions of the Retirement
Equity Act of 1984.
2. Any person dealing with the trustee may rely upon a copy of this plan
and any amendments thereto certified to be a true and correct copy by
the trustee.
3. Anything heretofore contained in this plan to the contrary
notwithstanding, it is the intention of the Borough that any action
herein provided to be taken by the trustee shall be taken only in
accordance with written instructions of the Council given in such detail
as to preclude the exercise by the trustee of discretion in the
performance thereof.
4. In no circumstance, whether upon amendment or termination of this
plan or otherwise, shall any part of the fund be used or diverted to any
purpose other than the exclusive benefit of members or their
beneficiaries until all of the actuarial obligations to such member or
member's beneficiaries have been met.
5. If the Council deems any person incapable of receiving benefits to
which he is entitled by reason of minority, illness, infirmity or other
incapacity, it may direct the trustee to make payment directly for the
benefit of such person, or to any person selected by the Council to
disburse it, whose receipt shall be a complete acquittance thereof. Such
payment shall, to the extent therefor, discharge any liability of the
Borough, the trustee and the fund.
6. Should any provision of this plan be determined to be void by any court,
the plan will continue to operate and, to the extent necessary, will be
deemed not to include the provision deemed void.
7. Headings and captions provided herein are for convenience only and
shall not be deemed part of the plan.
8. This plan shall be construed and applied under the laws of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania where not in conflict with federal laws
which shall prevail.
9. All ordinances or resolutions or portions thereof inconsistent herewith
are hereby repealed.

is taken, each employee us entitled to the difference between the
amount he or she has taken individually and 12 weeks for family
medical leave for a purpose other than the birth or adoption of a
child, for example, if each spouse took six weeks leave for the birth
of a child, each could take up to an additional six weeks due to
personal illness in the family as described previously.
(4) Employees who anticipate taking leave for child care are required
to provide notice of their intent at least 30 days prior to the date
leave is anticipated to begin. If leave becomes necessary before
such thirty-day notice can be given, notice that is reasonable and
practical as determined by the Borough Manager shall be given.

required.
(3) Employees taking leave under this subsection may take the leave
intermittently upon production of a health care provider's
certification that the intermittent leave is necessary for or will
assist the care of the family member and that provides the dates

leave on an intermittent basis must try to schedule the leave to
minimize disruption to normal operations. An employee may be
reassigned to an alternative position, with equivalent pay and
benefits, that better accommodates the recurring periods of leave.
(4) Employees who anticipate taking leave under this subsection are
required to provide notice of their intent at least 30 days prior to
the date leave is anticipated to begin. If leave becomes necessary
before such thirty-day notice can be given, notice that is reasonable

essential functions of the position. Employees seeking the
certification must provide the health care provider with a verbal
description of the essential functions performed by the employee.

may be reassigned to an alternative position with equivalent pay
and benefits that better accommodates the recurring periods of
leave.

OPEN PUBLIC RECORDS
§ 1101. Purpose. [Ord. 1150, 12/3/2008]
The purpose of this Part 11 is to assure compliance with Act 3 of 2008,
the Pennsylvania Right-to-Know Law, as amended; to provide access to
public records of Quakertown Borough; to preserve the integrity of the
Borough's records; and to minimize the financial impact to the residents
of the Borough regarding the resources utilized in the receipt of and
processing of public record requests and the retrieval and copying of public
records.
§ 1102. Open Records Officer; Guidelines for Requests for Records;
Fees; Appeals. [Ord. 1150, 12/3/2008]
It is the policy of the Borough to require the presence of a designated
employee when public records are examined and inspected and to charge
reasonable fees for duplication of public records of the Borough. The
Borough Council designates the Borough Manager as the Open Records
Officer, responsible for assuring compliance with the Pennsylvania Right-to-
Know Law, in accordance with the following guidelines:
A. The Borough Manager may designate certain employee(s) to process
public record requests.
B. The Borough Manager is responsible for minimizing, where possible,
the financial impact to the Borough regarding the resources utilized in
the receipt and processing of public record requests and the retrieval
and copying of public records.
C. All requests for public records of the Borough under this policy shall be
specific in identifying and describing each public record requested. In
no case shall the Borough be required to create a public record which
does not exist or to compile, maintain, format or organize a public
record in a manner in which the Borough does not currently compile,
maintain, format or organize the public record. All requests for public
records shall be submitted in writing and include the date of the
request; requestor's name, address, and telephone number;
certification of United States residency; signature of requestor; and if
duplication is requested, appropriate payment.
D. The designated employee shall make a good-faith effort to determine
whether each record requested is a public record.
E. The Borough shall facilitate a reasonable response to a request for the
Borough's public records. In no case is the Borough expected to provide
extraordinary staff to respond to the request, but it will respond in a
manner consistent with the Borough's administrative responsibilities
and consistent with the requirements of the Pennsylvania Right-to-
Know Law.
§ 1101 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 1102
1:73
F. The designated employee shall respond to the requester within five
business days from the date of receipt of the written request. If the
Borough does not respond within five business days of receipt thereof,
the request is deemed denied.
G. The response provided by the Borough shall consist of:
(1) Approval for access to the public record;
(2) Review of the request by the designated employee; or
(3) Denial of access to the record requested.
H. If access to the public record requested is approved, the public record
shall be available for access during the regular business hours of the
Borough. The designated employee shall cooperate fully with the
requester, while also taking reasonable measures to protect the
Borough public records from the possibility of theft and/or modification.
The presence of a designated employee is required when public records
are examined and inspected.
I. Fees for duplication of public records shall be as established by the
Commonwealth's Office of Open Records. The Borough may, at its
discretion, waive fees and by resolution or ordinance set forth fees as
not otherwise established by the Commonwealth's Office of Open
Records.
J. In the event that the estimated cost of fulfilling a request submitted
under this policy is expected to exceed $100, the designated
employee(s) shall obtain the expected cost in advance of fulfilling the
request to avoid unwanted expense of Borough resources.
K. If the request is being reviewed, the notice provided by the Borough
shall be in writing and include the reason for the review and the
expected response date, which shall be within 30 days of the notice of
review. If the Borough does not respond within 30 days thereof, the
request is deemed denied.
(1) Review of the request is limited to situations where:
(a) The record requested contains information which is subject to
access as well as information which is not subject to access
that must be redacted prior to a grant of access. The redacted
information is considered a denial as to that information.
(b) The record requires retrieval from a remote location.
(c) A timely response cannot be accomplished due to staffing
limitations.
(d) A legal review is necessary to determine whether the record
requested is a public record.
§ 1102 QUAKERTOWN CODE § 1102
1:74
(e) The requester has failed to comply with the Borough's policy
and procedure requirements.
(f) The requester refuses to pay the applicable fees.
(g) The extent or nature of the request precludes a response
within the required time period.
(2) Upon a determination that one of the factors listed above applies,
the Borough shall send written notice to the requester within five
business days of receipt of the request for access. The notice shall
include a statement notifying the requester that the request for
access is being reviewed, the reason for the review, a reasonable
date that a response is expected to be provided, and an estimate of
applicable fees owed when the record becomes available. If the
date that a response is expected to be provided is in excess of 30
days following the five business days allowed for, the request for
access shall be deemed denied unless the requester has agreed, in
writing, to an extension to the date specified in the notice. If the
requester agrees to the extension, the request shall be deemed
denied on the day following the date specified in the notice if the
agency has not provided a response by that date.
L. If access to the record requested is denied, the notice provided by the
Borough shall be in writing as indicated on the form attached hereto
entitled "Denial of Request to Review and/or Duplicate the Borough of
Quakertown Records."
M. If the request is denied or deemed denied, the requester may file an
appeal with the Commonwealth's Office of Open Records within 15
business days of the mailing date of the Borough's notice of denial, or
within 15 days of a deemed denial. The appeal shall state the grounds
upon which the requester asserts that the record is a public record and
shall address any grounds stated by the agency for delaying or denying
the request.
N. Within 30 days of the mailing date of the final determination of the
appeals officer, the requester or Borough may file a petition for review
or other document as required by rule of court with the Court of
Common Pleas of Bucks County. The decision of the court shall contain
findings of fact and conclusions of law based upon the evidence as a
whole. The decision shall clearly and concisely explain the rationale for
the decision. A petition for review under this section shall stay the
release of documents until a decision is issued.
O. This policy shall be available for review at the Borough office.

SEX OFFENDER RESIDENCY PROHIBITION
§ 501. Findings and Intent. [Ord. 1118, 5/3/2006]
§ 502. Sexual Offender and Sexual Predator Residence Prohibition;
Penalties; Exceptions. [Ord. 1118, 5/3/2006]
1. The Borough Council of the Borough of Quakertown has reviewed the
findings of the Pennsylvania Legislature when it adopted Megan's Law
II, as well as resource materials from the Criminal Justice Information
Services Division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Center
for Sex Offender Management (www.csom.org) as established in June
1997 as a collaborative effort of the Office of Justice Programs, the
National Institute of Corrections and the State Justice Institute and
administered by the Center for Effective Public Policy and the American
Probation and Parole Association, the goal of which is to enhance public
safety by preventing further victimization through improving the
management of adult and juvenile sex offenders who are in the
community. The Borough Council finds that repeat sexual offenders,
sexual offenders who use physical violence, and sexual offenders who
prey on children are sexual predators who present an extreme threat to
the public safety. Sexual offenders are extremely likely to use physical
violence and to repeat their offenses, and most sexual offenders commit
many offenses, have many more victims than are ever reported, and are
prosecuted for only a fraction of their crimes. This makes the cost of
sexual offender victimization to society at large, while incalculable,
clearly exorbitant.
2. It is the intent of this Part to serve the Borough's compelling interest to
promote, protect and improve the health, safety and welfare of the
citizens of the Borough by creating areas around locations where
children regularly congregate in concentrated numbers wherein
certain sexual offenders and sexual predators are prohibited from
establishing temporary or permanent residence.
1. It is unlawful for any person who has been convicted of a violation of
Section 9795.1 of Megan's Law II, 42 P.A.C.S.A. § 9795.1 (relating to
registration), in which the victim of the offense was less than 16 years
of age, to establish a permanent or temporary residence within 2,500
feet of any school, child-care facility, park or playground.
2. For purposes of determining the minimum distance separation, the
requirement shall be measured by following a straight line from the
outer property line of the permanent residence or temporary residence
to nearest outer property line of a school, child-care facility, park or
playground.
3. Penalties. A person who violates this section shall be punished by a fine
not exceeding $500 or by imprisonment for a term not exceeding 60

§ 503. Notification of the Pennsylvania Board of Probation and
Parole. [Ord. 1118, 5/3/2006]
The Borough Council shall supply or cause to be supplied to the
Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole, Bucks County Probation,
Pennsylvania State Corrections, and Bucks County Corrections a duly
certified copy of this Part to inform the state and county prison and
probation and parole personnel about the limitations on residence set forth
in this Part.
§ 504. Severability. [Ord. 1118, 5/3/2006]
If any section, sentence, clause or phrase of this Part is held to be invalid
or unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, then said holding
shall in no way affect the validity of the remaining portions of this Part.
§ 505. Effective Date. [Ord. 1118, 5/3/2006]
This Part shall become effective immediately upon adoption.
days or period of community service not to exceed 90 days, or any
combination of the same, as determined at the discretion of the
Magistrate Judge; for a second or subsequent conviction of a violation
of this section, such person shall be punished by a fine not to exceed
$1,000 or imprisonment of not more than 12 months, or by both such
fine and imprisonment.
4. Exceptions. A person residing within 2,500 feet of any school, child-care
facility, park or playground does not commit a violation of this Part if
any of the following apply:
A. The person established the permanent residence prior to May 3,
2006, the date of adoption of this Part.
B. The person was a minor when he/she committed the offense and
was not convicted as an adult.
C. The person is a minor, unless said minor is tried as an adult for a
sex crime.
D. The school, child-care facility, park or playground within 2,500 feet
of the person's permanent or temporary residence was opened
after the person established the residence.

ELECTRIC SERVICE RULES AND REGULATIONS
§ 801. Title; Purpose; Interpretation. [Ord. 1211, 9/2/2015]
1. This Part shall be known and may be cited as the "Electric Service Rules
and Regulations."
2. The purpose of this Part is to establish rules for determining terms and
conditions governing the purchase of electric service by customers.
These rules are intended to establish a tariff by which formally adopted
policies and administrative rules are collected and maintained in a
format that provides easy access for the public. It is the Borough
Council's intent that these service rules and regulations shall, as and
where indicated herein, generally conform to selected applicable rules
and regulations of the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, but are
expressly adopted independent of that agency and are not subject to
rule making, tariff approval or other regulatory pronouncements,
actions or processes of that agency, which under the Pennsylvania
Public Utility Code does not have jurisdiction or control over municipal
corporations, including the company, the Borough or the Council (66
Pa.C.S.A. § 102). All references throughout these Electric Service Rules
and Regulations to the Pennsylvania Public Utility Code or to the
regulations of the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission are intended
only as voluntary guidelines, where applicable, and shall not in any way
be interpreted as submitting the company, the Borough or the Council
to the jurisdiction or control of the Pennsylvania Public Utility
Commission in any respect. Notwithstanding any references
throughout these Electric Service Rules and Regulations to the
Pennsylvania Public Utility Code or to the regulations of the
Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, the Council shall remain the
sole regulator of the company in all respects.
3. These Electric Service Rules and Regulations are consistent with
applicable provisions of state and federal law.
4. These Electric Service Rules and Regulations do not preclude the
Borough of Quakertown from using best management practices to
ensure the fair and equitable access to electric service and recovery of
customer costs. These Electric Service Rules and Regulations may be
amended at any time, and from time to time, by the Council.
5. Interpretation of this service Part as to its intent and applicability will
be made by the company in its sole discretion, subject to review of the
Borough Council.
6. This service Part shall supersede and repeal any prior enactment of the
Borough Council, and prior rules of the company, which are
inconsistent herewith.
§ 801 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 802
1:143
§ 802. Definitions. [Ord. 1211, 9/2/2015]
As used in this Part, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated:
CAPACITY REQUIRED — The maximum rate of use of energy by the
customer during a stated time interval, expressed in kw, kilowatts; 1,000
watts.
COMPANY — The Electric Department of the Borough of Quakertown.
COUNCIL — The Borough Council of the Borough of Quakertown.
CUSTOMER — Any corporation, municipality, governmental agencies,
person or partnership to whom the company may furnish service. Each
individual domestic establishment, single-family residence or apartment
shall be a customer.
ENERGY REQUIRED — The use of energy by the customer, expressed in
kwh, kilowatt hours; the use of 1,000 watts for one hour.
MONTH — The period between two monthly meter readings, taken as
nearly as practicable on the same date each calendar month, as selected by
the company.
RATE ORDINANCE(S) — A rate which may be obtained by a customer if
his use of service conforms to the character of supply contemplated in the
rate and his location is such that this service can be supplied from existing
facilities of the company.
SERVICE — Any electricity which the company may supply or make
provision to supply or any work or material furnished or any obligation
performed by the company hereunder or under any rate ordinance adopted
by the company.
SERVICE POINT — The point of connection between the electric lines of the
company and the electric system of the customer.
§ 803. Characteristics of Service Supplied. [Ord. 1211, 9/2/2015]
1. The company will furnish only alternating current at available company
standard voltages:
Single-Phase
120 volts, 2-wire
120/240 volts, 3-wire
240 volts, 2-wire
THREE-PHASE
120/208 volts, 4-wire
240 volts, 3-wire
277/480 volts, 4-wire
480 volts, 3-wire

§ 802 QUAKERTOWN CODE § 803
1:144
§ 804. Application for Service. [Ord. 1211, 9/2/2015]
7,200/12,470 volts, 4-wire
2. Electric service shall not be submetered or resold by the customer
except as provided in wholesale or net metering rate ordinances or
upon written consent of the company.
3. The rates as adopted by the Council are based on the cost of providing
service overhead. Underground service will be supplied in accordance
with the common practice and any company regulations consistent
therewith. In situations not covered by such rules, customers may
secure underground service by paying the estimated difference in total
cost between overhead and underground service.
4. The company will undertake to furnish service to a building or a group
of buildings of the customer for use only in or on the premises owned,
leased to, occupied, or managed by the customer. Each such building or
separate unit will be metered separately and considered a separate
service. Adjoining buildings or groups of buildings located on a single
or contiguous land parcel may receive service through a single meter,
provided the customer furnishes the necessary electrical
interconnection among the buildings or units and said buildings or units
are used and operated by the customer and held out to the public as one
single business unit. Any intervening fee ownership will act to break the
contiguity of a land parcel. However, master metering to new
multifamily dwelling units is prohibited. See "Submetering" [§ 824].
1. The company reserves the right to require the applicant, before any
electricity is delivered, to execute an application of "electric service
agreement." Whether or not a written application or agreement is
executed, the applicant, by accepting the electricity, agrees to be bound
by the applicable rate ordinance and these terms and conditions, as
amended from time to time. Failure to make application will make new
customers liable for all services supplied since the last meter reading
by which the previous customer on the same premises was billed. No
promises, agreements, or representation of any agent or employee of
the company constituting a departure from this Part shall be binding
unless incorporated in a written contract signed by the company and
the customer.
2. The company may require an applicant or customer to verify the
identity of each adult occupant of the residential property, to establish
creditworthiness and/or to pay a deposit, generally in accordance with
the applicable provisions of 52 Pa. Code Chapter 56, "Standards and
Billing Practices for Residential Utility Service," and/or 66 Pa.C.S.A.
Chapter 14, "Responsible Utility Customer Protection." All
determinations of the applicability of such standards shall be made by
the company in its sole discretion.
§ 803 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 804
1:145
3. Any customer who is about to vacate any premises supplied with
company service or who, for any reason, wishes to have service
discontinued shall give at least seven days' notice to the company,
specifying the date on which it is desired that service be discontinued.
In the absence of such notice, the customer shall be responsible for all
service rendered.
4. Requirements for Service.
A. Customers should directly, or through an electrical contractor,
make application with the company for the purpose of giving the
exact location of premises and details of all current-consuming
devices which are to be installed. The company will thereupon
designate a point of delivery at which its service line will terminate.
At or near that location, the customer must provide, without
expense to the company, a suitable place for the installation of
metering and all necessary transforming equipment and
supplementary apparatus incident to fulfillment of the contract.
B. The wiring on the premises for connection to the service line shall
be brought outside the building wall at a location designated by the
company and in such a manner that it will be easily accessible for
attachment.
C. All wiring shall be installed and maintained in accordance with
provisions of the latest edition of the National Electrical Code. The
company shall not be obligated to connect or remain connected
with any customer's wiring or facilities unless and until a certificate
of compliance has been issued by a recognized inspection service.
This covers new buildings and modifications involving a wiring
change.
D. The customer's service and meter connections shall be installed in
accordance with instructions of the company and shall be subject to
the company's inspection and approval. However, the customer
assumes full responsibility for the energy at and from the point of
delivery thereof and for the wires, apparatus, devices and
appurtenances thereon used in connection with the service.
E. The company will run only one service lateral to a customer's
premises or install only one meter for each class of service to be
supplied, except where, in its judgment, special conditions may
make more than one necessary. Service laterals normally will not
be run from building to building. If special conditions warrant it, an
exception may be made at the company's option.
F. Service connections will not be made until the wiring on the
premises is actually in progress or completed.
G. The company will furnish, install and maintain the necessary
meters, transformers and service line for secondary service
requiring only a single span of wiring extending from its facilities to
§ 804 QUAKERTOWN CODE § 804
1:146
§ 805. Service Limitations. [Ord. 1211, 9/2/2015]
§ 806. Service Connections. [Ord. 1211, 9/2/2015]
the point of supply connections. All equipment supplied by the
company shall remain its exclusive property and may be removed
after termination of service for whatever cause.
H. The customer shall own, maintain and operate all substation and
transforming equipment where voltage, phase or frequency of the
supply is different from that specified in the applicable rate
ordinance. Also, the customer shall bear the cost of special
installation that may be necessary to meet a particular requirement
for service at other than standard voltages or if closer than
allowable voltage and frequency variation is desired.
I. Where energy is desired at 2,400 volts or higher, the company will
extend its facilities to a customer's service connection as provided
herein. Except the conditions for which provision may be made in a
particular rate ordinance, all other wiring, with the exception of
meters, shall be installed and maintained by the customer.
J. In the event the company may be required to place underground
any portion of its mains, wires or services or relocate any pole or
feeders, the customer, at his own expense, shall change the
location of the delivery point to that readily accessible to the new
location.
5. All fees or other charges required to be paid in connection with the
issuance of inspection certificates shall be borne by the applicant.
6. Any changes in, or additions to, the original wiring, equipment or
appliances of an applicant or customer should be installed in
compliance with the requirements of the National Board of Fire
Underwriters and such other requirements as may be fixed by the
inspection authority having jurisdiction.
7. In no event shall the company be under any obligation to inspect the
wiring, equipment or appliances of an applicant or customer.
1. Single-phase service for lighting will not be supplied where the
connected load to be served exceeds 25 KVA of capacity, unless
previous arrangements have been made with the company. The
customer must arrange the wiring of loads in excess of this amount to
receive polyphase service.
2. The customer shall at all times take and use energy in such a manner
that it will be taken equally between phases. Should this not be
possible, and the unbalancing equals or exceeds 10% of the lesser
phase, then the charge therefor shall be computed on the assumption
that the energy taken from each phase is equal to the amount taken
from the greater phase.
§ 804 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 806
1:147
§ 807. Location of Company Equipment. [Ord. 1211, 9/2/2015]
1. The company will make application for permits and acquire the
easements necessary to build its supply facilities to the property
occupied by the applicant or customer; and the applicant or customer
will apply for, obtain, and deliver to the company all other permits or
certificates necessary to give the company the right to connect its
conductors to the applicant's or customer's wiring and access for all
other proper purposes, including an easement from the landowner for
the company's facilities. The company shall not be required to supply
electricity until a reasonable time has elapsed after the company has
obtained or received all necessary permits, certificates and easements.
With respect to the item "right-of-way," the company shall not be
required to build line extensions over a private right-of-way in the event
that such construction involves the company making payment for rightof-
way easements or tree trimming rights.
2. Should any change or changes in the service connection furnished the
customer by the company be made necessary by any requirement of
public authority, the entire cost of such changes on the customer's side
of the delivery point shall be borne by the customer.
3. Normally the company will supply and meter at one delivery point
electricity of the characteristics desired by the customer at the delivery
point.
4. Whenever a customer requests the company to supply electricity
through not more than two banks of transformers for the purpose of
separating different types of load and the company finds it practicable,
such electricity will be supplied if all transformers and service
equipment incidental thereto are installed in a place and manner
satisfactory to the company, and the electricity is metered on the
company's side of the transformers.
1. Without cost to the company, the customer shall furnish a satisfactory
right-of-way and suitable location and housing for equipment, on his
premises, for the company's facilities required to provide the customer
with service.
2. The company shall have the right to place its transformers and such
other apparatus as may be needed in connection with supplying such
electricity at a convenient point or points on the property or in the
building or buildings of the customer.
3. The customer shall provide suitable space for the installation of the
necessary metering apparatus, which space shall be:
A. Substantially free from vibration and dust; and, if practicable, at
any outside location;
B. Readily accessible and convenient for reading, testing and
servicing; and
§ 806 QUAKERTOWN CODE § 807
1:148
§ 808. Access to Customer Premises. [Ord. 1211, 9/2/2015]
The company shall have free access at a reasonable hour to the customer's
premises for such purposes as may be proper and necessary in connection
with supplying service.
§ 809. Deposits for Service. [Ord. 1211, 9/2/2015]
C. Such that the apparatus will be protected from injury by the
elements or the negligent or deliberate acts of persons.
4. All service equipment furnished and installed by the company shall be
and remain the property of the company.
5. Interference or tampering with the company's meters or other facilities
or any act preventing the proper registration of service is prohibited,
and the customer, by reason of his control of the premises, shall pay for
all damages caused by violation of this rule. Furthermore, if incorrect
metering is caused by such violation, the customer shall pay an amount
estimated by the company to cover service not properly recorded.
1. The company shall require a security deposit during application for
utility services pursuant to the Quakertown Borough Fee Schedule.
2. The company will allow interest on cash deposits pursuant to the
Quakertown Borough Fee Schedule. For residential customers, the
interest calculation will generally comply with the applicable provisions
of 52 Pa. Code Chapter 56, "Standards and Billing Practices for
Residential Utility Service," and/or 66 Pa.C.S.A. Chapter 14,
"Responsible Utility Customer Protection." All determinations of the
applicability of such standards shall be made by the company in its sole
discretion.
3. Deposits shall be returned to residential customers upon termination of
service and after termination billing is satisfied so long as the customer
is not currently delinquent or when other guarantees satisfactory to the
company are offered. Deposits of other classes of customers are subject
to return, prior to discontinuance of service, solely at the option of the
company.
4. Deposits shall cease to bear interest upon discontinuance of service (or,
if earlier, when the company closes the account).
5. When a residential customer or a residence is involved, the company
will generally comply with the applicable provisions of 52 Pa. Code
Chapter 56, "Standards and Billing Practices for Residential Utility
Service," and/or 66 Pa.C.S.A. Chapter 14, "Responsible Utility Customer
Protection." All determinations of the applicability of such standards
shall be made by the company in its sole discretion.
6. The payment of any undisputed bill shall be due within 20 days
following presentation of the bill. The payment of any contested bill,

1:149
§ 810. Selection of Rate. [Ord. 1211, 9/2/2015]
§ 811. Customer Installation and Responsibility. [Ord. 1211, 9/2/
2015]
§ 812. Metering and Billing. [Ord. 1211, 9/2/2015]
payment of which is withheld beyond the period herein mentioned and
the dispute is terminated substantially in favor of the customer, shall be
made by the customer within 10 days thereafter.
1. Whenever there is a choice of rates, the choice lies with the customer.
Each rate sets forth the conditions under which it applies. The full and
active assistance of the company is freely offered and, on request, will
be given to the customer in order to determine which rate is then the
most favorable to the customer.
2. An investigation will be made by the company if and when the customer
notifies the company of changes in his connected loan, capacity
required, operating conditions, or other factors which may affect the
selection of the rate, and the customer will be assisted in determining
whether a change in rate is then advisable.
3. The company cannot guarantee that the customer will be served under
the most-favorable applicable rate, and no refund will be made by the
company to the customer representing the difference in the charge
made under the rate applied and that which would have been made if a
more-favorable applicable rate had been chosen and applied.
1. It is necessary for the protection of the customer that all work, wiring
and apparatus shall be inspected and approved by a certified thirdparty
electrical inspector.
2. The customer, in accepting service from the company, assumes full
responsibility for the safety and efficiency of the wiring and apparatus
installed by the customer. The customer agrees to indemnify and save
the company harmless against any liability that may arise as the result
of the use of service supplied to the customer by the company.
3. The customer shall not operate any apparatus creating a condition
which prevents the company from supplying satisfactory service to the
customer or to other customers. The company reserves the right to
place restrictions on the type and manner of use of all customers'
electrical equipment connected to the company's lines, especially
prohibiting any loads of highly fluctuating or low power factor
character.
1. Where service is rendered under rate ordinance provisions which do
not require monthly demand measurements, meters may be read and
bills rendered either monthly or bimonthly, at the company's option.
When bills are rendered bimonthly, the minimum bill and the number of
§ 809 QUAKERTOWN CODE § 812
1:150
kilowatt hours included in each energy block of the rate shall be twice
the amount specified for monthly billing. When the use of electricity
averages over 2,000 kilowatt hours per month and the customer does
not participate in the uniform monthly payment plan or the average
payment plan as may be provided in certain rates, monthly billing will
be used if requested by the customer.
2. All electricity sold by the company shall be on the basis of meter
measurement, except for installations where the usage is constant and
the consumption may readily be computed, or as provided for in its filed
rates.
3. When meters are installed by the company to measure the electricity
used by its customer, all charges for electricity used, except certain
minimum charges, shall be calculated from the readings of such meters.
4. Bills shall be rendered, as nearly as practicable, for thirty-day periods
when monthly and sixty-day periods when bimonthly. However, bills for
less than 25 days or more than 35 days for monthly billing, and bills for
less than 50 days or more than 70 days for bimonthly billing shall be
prorated on the basis of the ratio of the number of days in the period to
the number of days included in the standard period, which will be taken
at 30 days for monthly billing and 60 days for bimonthly billing. Bills
shall be due on the date rendered. In case of any dispute at the date of
rendering, the postmark shall control.
5. Bills for special or short-term service, including charges for connection
and disconnection, may be rendered at any time at the discretion of the
company and will be payable upon presentation.
6. If service is supplied to the customer before a meter is placed in use or
while the metering is defective, the customer will pay for service on a
basis estimated from a period of similar use.
7. When an investigation discloses excessive bills due to an accidental
ground on the customer's wiring or equipment, occurring without the
knowledge of the customer, an allowance for a share of such wastage
will be made by the company in its sole discretion.
8. An average payment plan (APP) is offered as a convenience to qualified
customers who request this payment option. The plan is an alternative
payment option. Participation in the APP does not affect the calculation
of charges applied to the customer's account nor the customer's
ultimate responsibility to pay for all billings rendered. To qualify, a
customer must be served under the residential rate ordinance, as
adopted. At the company's option, small nonprofit organizations served
under the commercial rate may also qualify for this payment option.
New customers may be required to pay their initial regular billing in full
to be eligible for the APP. Under the APP, a customer's monthly payment
amount will be calculated based on 1/12 of the last 12 months' usage
and priced to include the current approved base rates, average fuel and
purchased power adjustment rates and any other applicable charges.

§ 813. Use of Electricity. [Ord. 1211, 9/2/2015]
The average usage and APP payment amount will be recomputed with
each metered billing. When a customer does not have 12 months' billing
history, the company may, at its discretion, estimate the customer's
projected annual usage. Any difference that accumulates between the
calculated APP payments and the actual charges for a twelve-month
period will be amortized over the next twelve-month period. At any
time, the company may adjust the APP payment amount to prevent an
excessive accumulated difference. APP payments are due 20 days from
the billing date. If an APP customer is delinquent with two consecutive
APP payments, the company shall have the option of terminating the
customer's participation in the plan. When a customer's account is
closed and a final bill is rendered, the total account balance will become
due in 20 days. The company reserves the right to restrict the
enrollment period to any thirty-day window per year. The company may
market the APP service under a variety of names, including "budget
billing."
1. The Council shall be the sole retail electric regulatory authority for the
Borough of Quakertown and all its retail electric consumers.
2. The company is the sole entity permitted to aggregate retail customers'
power needs and demand response.
3. The Borough Manager, as general manager of the company, is
authorized to adopt any necessary regulations to implement this Part.
4. No other power supply shall be connected with the company's facilities,
except by written consent of the company.
5. Except as may be otherwise determined and approved by Council, the
company shall be the sole electric service and distribution utility within
the corporate limits of the municipality.
6. Because the company's facilities used in supplying electricity to the
customer have a definite limited capacity and can be damaged by
overloads, the customer shall give adequate notice to the company and
obtain the company's written consent before making any substantial
change in the amount or use of the load connected to the company's
service.
7. The customer shall not use electricity in any manner which will be
detrimental to the company's supply of electricity to other customers.
The company reserves the right, but shall have no duty, to determine
the suitability of apparatus or appliances to be connected to its service
by the customer and to refuse to continue to supply electricity if it shall
determine that the operation of such apparatus or appliances may be
detrimental to its general supply of electricity.

§ 816. Discontinuance of Service. [Ord. 1211, 9/2/2015]
Agreements are not transferable without the company's consent. Whether
or not there is a written agreement, upon a customer's discontinuance of
service, the customer shall remain responsible until the company receives
notice in writing of discontinuance for any service supplied to the premises
formerly occupied by the customer, and shall remain responsible for
minimum charges and/or other obligations contracted for.
§ 817. Waivers. [Ord. 1211, 9/2/2015]
The company may at any time petition the Council for a temporary or
permanent waiver of any of the Electric Service Rules and Regulations,
either in an individual circumstance or generally. The Council shall remain
the sole regulator of the company in all respects, with the power, in its sole
discretion, to grant a waiver or waivers of the Electric Service Rules and
Regulations, either upon request of the company or otherwise.
§ 818. Termination of Service. [Ord. 1211, 9/2/2015]
1. The company will use reasonable diligence in providing regular and
uninterrupted service, but the company shall not be liable for any loss,
cost, damage or expense to any customer or third party occasioned by
any failure to supply electricity for any reason whatsoever.
2. The company may, without liability therefor, interrupt or limit service to
any or all customers whenever, in the sole judgment of the company,
such action is indicated in order to prevent or limit any actual or
threatened instability or disturbance on the electric system of the
company of any electric system interconnected with the company.
1. The supply of electricity by the company is contingent upon payment of
all charges due from the customer. The company will render bills to the
customer at regular intervals. Bills are due upon presentation and
become past due after the net payment period provided in the rate
ordinance. Bills are payable at any office of the company or to any
collector or collection agency duly authorized by the company, except
that, when a disconnection notice for nonpayment has been sent to the
customer, payment must be made at a company office. Failure to
receive a bill does not excuse the customer from its payment obligation,
and payments shall be due and payable as provided herein without
regard to any counterclaim whatsoever.
2. The company reserves the right to apply any bill payments made by the
customer in whole or in part to any account due to the company by the
customer.
§ 814 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 818

E. Winter Terminations. Unless otherwise authorized by the Council,
after November 30 and before April 1 ("winter period"), the
company shall not terminate service to residential customers with
household incomes at or below 250% of the federal poverty level,
except for termination in accordance with Subsection 2B above.

the federal poverty level. To be eligible for a winter termination
exemption, a customer must make application with the company by
providing the company with a copy of the customer's current year
federal tax return.
F. Unauthorized Termination of Service. Unless expressly and
specifically authorized by the Council, service shall not be
terminated, nor will a termination notice be sent, for any of the
following reasons:
(1) Nonpayment for concurrent service of the same class received
at a separate metering point.
(2) Nonpayment for a different class of service received at the

(3) Nonpayment, in whole or in part: for leased or purchased
merchandise, appliances, or special services, including but not

reasonably have been detected or loss of service not caused by
the residential customer or occupant; or two or more
consecutively estimated bills, if the "make-up" bill exceeds the
otherwise normal, estimated bill by 50%. This section shall not
prohibit termination where the company reviews the bill with
the residential customer and offers to enter a payment
agreement which may, at the residential customer's option,
extend: at least as long as the period during which the excess
amount accrued; or at least as necessary so that the quantity of
service billed in any one billing period will not be greater than
the normal estimated quantity for such period plus 50%.

pay for the service previously furnished. This section shall not
affect the company's creditor rights and remedies otherwise
permitted by law.
(9) Nonpayment of charges calculated on the basis of estimated
billings, unless the estimated bill was required because
company personnel were unable to gain access to the affected
premises to obtain an actual meter reading on two occasions
and have made a reasonable effort to schedule meter reading
at a time convenient to the residential customer or occupant.
(10) Nonpayment of delinquent accounts: which accrued over two
billing periods or more; which remain unpaid in whole or in
part for six months or less; and which amount to a total
delinquency of less than $25.
3. Notice Procedures for Termination of Residential Customers.
A. Notice Requirements for Authorized Termination of Service. Prior
to a termination of service under Subsection 2A above, the
company shall:
§ 818 QUAKERTOWN CODE § 818
1:156
(1) Provide written notice of the termination to the residential
customer at least 10 days prior to the date of the proposed
termination. The termination notice shall remain effective for
60 days.
(2) Attempt to contact the residential customer or occupant, either
in person or by telephone, to provide notice of the proposed
termination at least three days prior to the scheduled
termination. Phone contact shall be deemed complete upon
attempted calls on two separate days to the residence between
the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m. if the calls were made at
various times of the day.
(3) During the months of December through March, unless
personal contact has been made with the residential customer
or the responsible adult by personally visiting the residential
customer's residence, the company shall, within 48 hours of
the scheduled date of termination, post a notice of the
proposed termination at the service address.
B. Notice When Dispute Pending. The company shall not mail or
deliver a notice of termination if a notice of dispute has been filed
and is unresolved and if the subject matter of the dispute forms the
grounds for the proposed termination. Any notice mailed or
delivered in contravention of this section shall be void.
C. Procedures Upon Residential Customer or Occupant Contact Prior
to Termination.
(1) If, at any time after the issuance of the initial termination
notice and prior to the actual termination of service, a
residential customer or occupant contacts the company
concerning a proposed termination, an authorized company
employee shall fully explain:
(a) The reasons for the proposed termination.
(b) All available methods for avoiding a termination,
including:

(c) The residential customer's right to file a dispute with the
company.

(2) The company, through its employees, shall exercise good faith
and fair judgment in attempting to enter a reasonable
settlement or payment agreement, or otherwise equitably to
resolve the matter. Factors to be taken into account when
attempting to enter into a reasonable settlement or payment
agreement shall include, but not be limited to, the size of the
unpaid balance, the residential customer's payment history
and the length of time over which the bill accumulated. The
company may negotiate payment arrangements on the portion
of the past-due amount attributable to its charges.
D. Use of Termination Notice Soley as Collection Device Prohibited.
The company shall not threaten to terminate service when it has no
present intent to terminate service or when actual termination is
prohibited under this section; notice of the intent to terminate shall
be used only as a warning that service will in fact be terminated in
accordance with the procedure set forth by this section unless the
ratepayer or occupant remedies the situation which gave rise to the
company's enforcement efforts.
4. No Liability. Whenever the supply of electricity is disconnected in
accordance herewith, the company shall not be liable for any damage,
direct or indirect, that may result from such disconnection. In all cases
where the supply of electricity is disconnected by reason of violation by
the customer of any of the provisions hereof or of any agreement with
the company for the purchase of electricity, there shall then become
due and payable, in addition to the bills in default, an amount equal to
the monthly minimum charge for the unexpired term of the agreement,
not as a penalty, but in lieu of the income reasonably to be expected
during the unexpired term of the agreement.
5. Emergency Provisions for Residential Customers.
A. General Provision. The company shall not terminate, or refuse to
restore, service to any premises when any occupant therein is
certified by a physician or nurse practitioner to be seriously ill with
a medical condition that will be aggravated by a cessation of
service or failure to restore service.
B. Postponement of Termination Pending Receipt of Certificate. If,
prior to termination of service, the company employee is informed
that an occupant is seriously ill with a medical condition which will
be aggravated by a cessation of service and that a certification will
be procured, termination shall not occur for at least three days.
Service may be terminated if no certification is produced within
that three-day period.
§ 818 QUAKERTOWN CODE § 818
1:158
C. Medical Certifications. The residential customer shall obtain a
certification from a licensed physician and promptly forward it to
the company. All certifications must be procured on a Borough
medical certification application.
D. Length of Postponement; Renewals. Service shall not be terminated
for the time period specified in the medical certification, provided
that the maximum length of the certification shall be 60 days.

the time period is not readily ascertainable, service shall not be
terminated for at least 60 days.

under Subsection 5A through C of this policy (relating to
emergency provisions), the company shall make a diligent effort to
have service restored on the day of receipt of the medical
certification. In any case, service shall be restored within 24 hours.
The company shall have employees available or on call to restore
service in emergencies.
F. Residential Customer's Duty to Pay Bills. Whenever service is
restored or termination postponed pursuant to the medical
emergency procedures, the residential customer shall retain a duty
to equitably arrange to make payment on all bills.
G. Termination Upon Expiration of Medical Certification. When the
initial and all renewal certifications have expired, the original
grounds for termination shall be revived and the company may
terminate service without additional written notice, if notice
previously has been mailed or delivered pursuant to the notice
requirements of this tariff.
(1) The company shall continue to provide service while a final
Council adjudication on the petition is pending.
6. Termination at Any Premises Other Than the Residential Customer's
Residence.
A. General Rule. Unless the affected occupants agree to a proposed
termination, or the residential customer states in writing that the
affected premises are unoccupied, the company shall not terminate
service to a single-meter multi-unit dwelling or any premises that is
not the residential customer's residence, except in compliance with
the following provisions, in addition to all other notice and
procedural provisions in Subsection 3 of this policy (relating to
notice procedures prior to termination):
§ 818 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 818

grounds for termination are otherwise eliminated; or
(b) A settlement or payment agreement is entered into
between the residential customer and the company; or
(c) The occupants agree to subscribe for future service
individually and this can be accomplished without a major
revision in distribution facilities or additional right-of-way
acquisitions; or
(d) Where separate service cannot be instituted without a
major revision in distribution facilities or additional rightof-
way acquisitions, the occupants agree to be jointly and
severally responsible for the full amount of all future bills
for service at the affected dwelling. The consent of these
occupants must be knowing and voluntary.
(3) Where the residential customer arranges to make payment in
accordance with Subsection 6A(2)(a) or (b) of this section or
where the occupants agree to subscribe for future service in
accordance with Subsection 6A(2)(c) or (d) of this section, the
company shall consider the original grounds for termination
eliminated and shall be prohibited from terminating service
pursuant to those grounds. This section shall not affect the
creditors' rights and remedies of the company otherwise
permitted by law.
(4) Reduction of Deposit. When occupants at a single-meter
multifamily dwelling agree to pay all future bills for service
provided in Subsection 6A(2)(d) of this section and when any
responsible person in a residential unit establishes credit, the
amount of any required deposit or guarantee shall be reduced
pro rata based on the number of residential units contained in
the dwelling.
7. Third-Party Notification for Residential Customers.
A. Third-Party Notification. The company shall permit its residential
customer to designate a consenting individual or agency which is to
be sent, by the company, a duplicate copy of all reminder notices,

§ 819. Company's Right to Discontinue Electric Service. [Ord. 1211,
9/2/2015]
§ 820. (Reserved) [Ord. 1211, 9/2/2015]

past-due notices, delinquent account notices, or termination
notices of whatever kind issued by the company. When contact with
a third party is made, the company shall advise the third party of
the pending action and the efforts which must be taken to avoid
termination. The company shall institute and maintain a program:
(1) To allow a residential customer to designate third parties to
receive copies of a residential customer's or group of
residential customers' notices of termination of service;
(2) To advise a residential customer of the availability of such a
third-party notification program and to encourage their use
thereof.

the following reasons, without notice:
A. Unavoidable shortages of interruption in the company's source of
supply, or other cases of emergency.
B. Repairs, alterations or extensions of the service network.

disconnected will be reconnected after 8:00 p.m. on regular working
days.
2. If the supply of electricity has been disconnected because of improper
use, nonpayment, or if, in the company's opinion, its meter or wires or
other apparatus has been tampered with, the company may refuse to
reconnect the customer's service until the customer shall have:

request of any public authority having jurisdiction, the customer's
service will not be reconnected until authorization to do so has been
obtained from said public authority.
4. Where the company has disconnected service for nonpayment of bill or
for other reasons listed in this Part, the customer shall pay the

location or at a different location per the Quakertown Borough Fee
Schedule.
1. For purposes of this rule, the following definitions are applicable:
CONTRACTOR COSTS — The amounts paid by a public utility to a
contractor for work performed on a pole removal or relocation.
DIRECT COSTS — The pay and expenses of Borough employees directly
attributable to work performed on pole removals or relocations,
including all material, equipment, ancillary charges, construction
overheads or payroll taxes, workers' compensation expenses or similar
expenses.
DIRECT MATERIAL COSTS — The purchase price of materials used
in performing a pole removal or relocation, but do not include related
stores expenses. In computing direct material costs, proper allowance
shall be made for unused materials, materials recovered from
temporary structures, and for discounts allowed and realized in the
purchase of materials.
POLE REMOVAL OR RELOCATION — The removal or relocation of
distribution line poles and their associated attachments made under
the request of a residential property owner. The term does not include
pole repairs or replacements made under the request of a residential
property owner. The term does not include pole repairs or replacements
necessitated by the intentional or negligent conduct of a party.
2. The removal or relocation of a pole when done at the request of others
is done at the applicant's request, and payment of the company's
estimated cost of the removal or relocation is required in advance of the
construction. Charges are limited to contractor costs, direct labor costs
and material costs, less an amount equal to avoided maintenance costs.
1. The extension of the company's distribution facilities for supplying
electric energy either overhead or underground to a customer or group
of customers will be made under one of the following plans, subject to
approval of the Borough, provided that the company reserves the right
to refuse to make an extension of its facilities, or to reinforce its
facilities, or to take title to and assume responsibility for the future
§ 821 QUAKERTOWN CODE § 823
1:162
maintenance and replacement of facilities built to another and offered
to the company, when in so doing the company is required to assume
an unusual financial risk or burden or is required to introduce a hazard
to the service of other customers, or to incur extraordinary losses
of electric energy, or to suffer excessive operating, maintenance and
replacement cost.
A. Extension Plan A: Single-Phase Overhead Line Extension Plan for
Customer with Loads Not Exceeding 25 Kilowatts. The company
will build single-phase extensions to its distribution lines to serve
small permanent customers in accordance with the following terms
and conditions:
(1) When an overhead extension is required, the customer shall
pay the estimated cost for the acquisition and/or preparation of
rights-of-way in advance in addition to any other costs and
monthly minimums required hereunder. This cost will be
divided equally among the customers connected to the
extension or as may be mutually agreed upon by the
customers.
(2) When an underground extension is required, the customer
shall pay the cost of such extension, which will be the
estimated cost difference between the below-grade and
overhead construction plus the estimated cost for the
acquisition and/or preparation of rights-of-way, in addition to
any other costs and monthly minimums required hereunder.
Such costs will be divided equally among the customers
connected to the extension or as may be mutually agreed upon
by the customers and will be paid in advance.
(3) Customers taking service under this extension plan and whose
billing for each of the initial 12 months of service is estimated
at less than three times the minimum determined hereunder
shall enter into a written agreement with the company for an
initial term of five years, and the agreement shall remain in
effect on an annual basis thereafter or until such time as the
customer's billing under the applicable rate exceeds three
times his assured minimum as determined under this plan each
month for one year. Sale of the premises covered by the
agreement may be assigned to a new customer with the
consent of the company.
(4) Each customer taking service hereunder shall assure the
company monthly minimum revenue as follows:
(a) First 600 feet of extension length, per customer: rate
ordinance minimum.
(b) Each additional 100 feet of extension length in excess of
600 feet per customer: $1 per 100 feet per month (taken to
the next 100 feet, including service connection). This
§ 823 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 823
1:163
amount will be divided equally among the customers
connected to the extension and added to their rate
minimum, provided that, when more than one customer is
served from an extension exceeding 600 feet per customer,
the company may permit a customer to assume more than
an equal share for the purpose of permitting others to
assume less, provided the arrangement is a continuing
obligation on the part of such customer, subject to
adjustment only as provided in this plan, and is otherwise
acceptable to the company.
(5) Whenever additional customers are added to a line extension
requiring assured minimum revenue, or to a further extension
thereof, the assured minimum revenue as calculated above
shall be recalculated annually on the basis of the total length of
the line and the total customers served. Any further extension
constructed which requires assured minimum revenue per
customer greater than that on the extension from which it
originates will be considered a separate extension.
(6) Individual service lines necessary to reach a customer's
premises from the main line extension will be built by the
company under this plan as a part of a main line extension or
as a separate extension. When an individual service line
considered by itself requires an assured minimum revenue
greater than that in effect on the main extension, the individual
service line will be considered as a separate extension;
otherwise, it will be included as a part of the main extension.
(7) If the company is requested to extend or add to its facilities
under this plan in order to supply electric service to other than
small permanent customers or to meet special or unusual
conditions, the company will, after due consideration of the
stability of the customer's business and credit and proposed
usage, make such arrangement with the customer for financing
the company's facilities or guaranteeing revenue, or a
combination of the two; provided, however, that this is done
without preference to or discrimination against this customer
or customers.
B. Extension Plan B: Single-Phase Underground Line Extension Plan
for Customer with Loads Not Exceeding 25 Kilowatts.
(1) For the purposes of this rule only, the following definitions are
applicable:
APPLICANT FOR ELECTRIC SERVICE — The developer of a

DEVELOPER — The party responsible for constructing and
providing improvements in a development, that is, streets,

developer/applicant for electric service set out in a recorded
plot plan of five or more adjoining unoccupied lots for the
construction of single-family residences, detached or
otherwise, mobile homes or apartment houses, all of which are
intended for year-around occupancy, if electric service to the
lots necessitates extending the utility's existing distribution
lines.
DISTRIBUTION LINE — An electric supply line of
untransformed voltage from which energy is delivered to one
or more service lines.
SERVICE LINE — An electric supply line of untransformed
voltage from which service is delivered to the residence.
SUBDIVIDER — The party responsible for dividing a tract of
land into building lots which are not to be sold as utility-ready
lots.
SUBDIVISION — A tract of land divided by a subdivider into
five or more adjoining unoccupied lots for the construction of
single-family residences, detached or otherwise, or apartment
houses, all of which are intended for year-around occupancy, if
electric service to the lots necessitates extending the utility's
existing distribution lines.
(2) Underground facilities in new residential developments are
only required when a bona fide developer exists, i.e., only when
utility-ready lots are provided by the developer. A mere
subdivision is not required to have underground service.
(3) All distribution and service lines installed pursuant to an
application for electric service within a development shall be
installed underground, shall conform to the company's
construction standards, applicable provisions of 52 Pa. Code
§ 57.26, the specifications set forth in the National Electric
Safety Code (NESC), and shall be owned and maintained by the
company. All determinations of the applicability of such
standards shall be made by the company in its sole discretion.
Pad-mounted transformers may be installed by the company.
Excavating and backfilling shall be performed by the developer
of the project or by such other agent as the developer may
authorize. Installation of service-related utility facilities shall
be performed by the company or by such other agent as the
company may authorize. Any streetlighting lines installed then
or thereafter within the same development shall also be
installed underground, upon terms and conditions prescribed
elsewhere in the tariff. The company shall not be liable for
§ 823 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 823
1:165
injury or damage occasioned by the willful or negligent
excavation, breakage or other interference with its
underground lines occasioned by anyone other than its own
employees or agents.
(4) Nothing in this section shall prohibit the company from
performing its own excavating and backfilling for greater
system design flexibility.
(5) The applicant for electric service to a development shall:
(a) At its own cost, provide the utility with a copy of the
recorded development plot plan identifying property
boundaries and with easements satisfactory to the utility
for occupancy by distribution, service and streetlighting
lines and related facilities.
(b) At its own cost, clear the ground in which the lines and
related facilities are to be laid of trees, stumps and other
obstructions, provide the excavating and backfilling
subject to the inspection and approval of the utility, and
rough grade it to within six inches of final grade, so that
the utility's part of the installation shall consist only of
laying of the lines and installing other service-related
facilities. Excavating and backfilling performed or
provided by the applicant shall follow the utility's
underground construction standards and specifications set
forth by the utility in written form and presented to the
applicant at the time of application for service and
presentation of the recorded plot plan to the utility. If the
utility's specifications have not been met by the applicant's
excavating and backfilling, the excavating and backfilling
shall be corrected or redone by the applicant or its
authorized agent. Failure to comply with the utility's
construction standards and specifications permits the
utility to refuse utility service until the standards and
specifications are met.
(c) Request electric service at such time that the lines may be
installed before curbs, pavements and sidewalks are laid;
carefully coordinate scheduling of the utility's line and
facility installation with the general project construction
schedule, including coordination with other utilities
sharing the same trench; keep the route of lines clear of
machinery and other obstructions when the line
installation crew is scheduled to appear; and otherwise
cooperate with the utility to avoid unnecessary costs and
delay.
(d) Pay to the utility necessary and additional costs incurred
by the utility as a result of the following:
§ 823 QUAKERTOWN CODE § 823
1:166
[1] Installation of underground facilities that deviate from
the utility's underground construction standards and
specifications if the deviation is requested by the
applicant for electric service and is acceptable to the
utility.
[2] A change in the plot plan by the applicant for electric
service after the utility has completed engineering for
the project or has commenced installation of its
facilities.
[3] Physical characteristics, such as oversized lots or lots
with extreme setback, where, under the utility's line
extension policy contained in its tariff, a charge is
mandated for overhead service.
(6) Whenever the distance from the end of the company's existing
distribution line to the boundary of the development is 100 feet
or more, the 100 feet of new distribution line nearest to but
outside such boundary shall be installed underground if
practicable; and whenever such distance is less than 100 feet
from said boundary, all of the new distribution line nearest to
but outside such boundary shall be installed underground if
practicable. The installation required by this subsection shall
be provided by the company without cost to the applicant.
C. Extension Plan C: Line Extension Plan to Serve Customers with
Loads Exceeding 25 Kilowatts or Requiring Three-Phase Service.
The company will build extensions to its distribution lines to serve
customers with connected loads exceeding 25 kilowatts or
requiring three-phase service in accordance with the following
terms and conditions.
(1) When an underground extension is required, the customer
shall pay the cost of such extension, which will be the
estimated cost difference between below-grade and overhead
construction, in addition to any other costs and monthly
minimums required hereunder. Such costs will be divided
equally among the customers connected to the extension or as
may be mutually agreed upon by the customers and will be
paid in advance.
(2) The customer shall pay a monthly minimum equal to 2.75% of
the cost of the additional facilities necessary to serve him or
guarantee annual revenue equal to 1/3 of the additional
construction cost. Customers taking service under this plan
shall enter into an electric service agreement with the
company for an initial period of three years or longer when
required by the rate ordinance, and the agreement shall
remain in effect on an annual basis thereafter under the same
minimum guarantee, terms and conditions.
§ 823 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 823
1:167
§ 824. Submetering. [Ord. 1211, 9/2/2015]
The company will furnish electricity to the customer only for his own use,
on the premises occupied through ownership or lease by the customer. The
electricity furnished by the company shall not be remetered, submetered or
otherwise controlled by the customer for resale or assignment to another
or others, except for all apartment house, office building, or shopping
center owners, operators, or managers, who may provide submetering in
compliance with applicable rates and rules.
§ 825. Customer Service Calls. [Ord. 1211, 9/2/2015]
The company will advise and assist the customer in resolving electrical
service problems. The actual work performed by the company service
workers on the customer's installation will be confined to the restoration
of service and the isolation of faulty circuits or equipment. The customer
will be advised of any further work required by the customer's appliance
repairman or electrician.
(3) When the additional facilities installed to serve the customer
are used at some future time to serve another customer, the
customer's minimum under this plan shall be recalculated on
the basis of the capacities of the customers served from the
facilities, and each customer shall assume his proportionate
share of the minimum charge.
(4) The company, as a safeguard for its investment and as a
protection to its other customers, may require a customer to
give evidence of permanency by paying the company the cost
of connection and disconnection. The cost of connection and
disconnection shall be the original cost of installing the
additional facilities, less the salvage value of the additional
facilities when removed, plus the cost of removal. This
payment will be returned to the customer at the end of the
three years without interest, provided the customer has taken
continuous service from the company for three years and paid
the company the minimum revenue as provided herein. When a
customer does not take continuous service for three years, the
payment covering the cost of connection shall be forfeited to
the company and the facilities shall be removed.

§ 309. Start of Construction. [Ord. 1209, 3/4/2015]
§ 310. Enforcement. [Ord. 1209, 3/4/2015]
1. Work on the proposed construction or development shall begin within
180 days after the date of issuance of the development permit. Work
shall also be completed within 12 months after the date of issuance of
the permit or the permit shall expire, unless a time extension is
granted, in writing, by the floodplain administrator. The issuance of a
development permit does not refer to the zoning approval.
2. The "actual start of construction" means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of
slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or
any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a
manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not
include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor
does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it
include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the
erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the
property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied
as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial
improvement, the "actual start of construction" means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a
building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions
of the building.
3. Time extensions shall be granted only if a written request is submitted

time the extension is granted.
1. Notices. Whenever the floodplain administrator or other authorized
municipal representative determines that there are reasonable grounds
to believe that there has been a violation of any provisions of this
chapter, or of any regulations adopted pursuant thereto, the floodplain
administrator shall give notice of such alleged violation as hereinafter
provided. Such notice shall:
A. Be in writing;
B. Include a statement of the reasons for its issuance;
§ 308 QUAKERTOWN CODE § 310
1:180

C. Allow a reasonable time, not to exceed a period of 30 days, for the
performance of any act it requires;
D. Be served upon the property owner or his agent, as the case may
require; provided, however, that such notice or order shall be
deemed to have been properly served upon such owner or agent
when a copy thereof has been served with such notice by any other
method authorized or required by the laws of this state;
E. Contain an outline of remedial actions which, if taken, will effect
compliance with the provisions of this chapter.
2. Penalties. Any person who fails to comply with any or all of the
requirements or provisions of this chapter or who fails or refuses to
comply with any notice, order or direction of the floodplain
administrator or any other authorized employee of the municipality
shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, shall pay a fine
to the Borough of Quakertown, of not less than $25 nor more than $600,
plus costs of prosecution. In addition to the above penalties, all other
actions are hereby reserved, including an action in equity, for the
proper enforcement of this chapter. The imposition of a fine or penalty
for any violation of, or noncompliance with, this chapter shall not
excuse the violation or noncompliance or permit it to continue. All such
persons shall be required to correct or remedy such violations and
noncompliance within a reasonable time. Any development initiated or
any structure or building constructed, reconstructed, enlarged, altered,
or relocated, in noncompliance with this chapter may be declared by
the Council to be a public nuisance and abatable as such.
1. Any person aggrieved by any action or decision of the floodplain
administrator concerning the administration of the provisions of this
chapter may appeal to the Zoning Hearing Board. Such appeal must be
filed, in writing, within 30 days after the decision, determination or
action of the floodplain administrator.
2. Upon receipt of such appeal, the Zoning Hearing Board shall consider
the appeal in accordance with the Municipalities Planning Code7 and
any other local ordinance.
3. Any person aggrieved by any decision of the Zoning Hearing Board may
seek relief therefrom by appeal to court, as provided by the laws of this
state, including the Pennsylvania Flood Plain Management Act.

Agency (FEMA), or the most-recent revision thereof, including all
digital data developed as part of the Flood Insurance Study; and
B. Any community-identified flood hazard areas.
2. The above-referenced FIS and FIRMs, and any subsequent revisions
and amendments, are hereby adopted by the Borough of Quakertown
and declared to be a part of this chapter.
1. The identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific
areas:
A. The Floodway Area shall be those areas identified in the FIS and
the FIRM as floodway and which represent the channel of a
watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in
order to discharge the base flood without increasing the water
surface elevation by more than one foot at any point. This term
shall also include floodway areas which have been identified in
other available studies or sources of information for those special
flood hazard areas where no floodway has been identified in the FIS
and FIRM.
(1) Within any Floodway Area, no encroachments, including fill,
new construction, substantial improvements, or other
development, shall be permitted unless it has been
demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
performed in accordance with standard engineering practice
that the proposed encroachment would not result in any
increase in flood levels within the community during the
occurrence of the base flood discharge.
(2) Within any Floodway Area, no new construction or
development shall be allowed, unless the appropriate permit is
obtained from the Department of Environmental Protection's

structure before the damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT — Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, of which the cost equals
or exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have
incurred "substantial damage" or "repetitive loss," regardless of the actual
repair work performed. The term does not, however, include any project for
improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local
health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary
to assure safe living conditions.
UNIFORM CONSTRUCTION CODE (UCC) — The statewide building code
adopted by the Pennsylvania General Assembly in 1999 applicable to new
§ 902 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 902
1:211
construction in all municipalities, whether administered by the municipality,
a third party or the Department of Labor and Industry. Applicable to
residential and commercial buildings, the code adopted the International

1:246
§ 603. Responsibilities and Rights of Grantee; Standards of Service.
[Ord. 973, 6/5/1991, § 3]
2. Favored Nations. In the event that the franchising authority enters into
a franchise, permit, license, authorization or other agreement of any
kind with any other person or entity other than the grantee for the
purpose of construction or operating a cable system or providing cable
service to any part of the franchise area which contains terms more
favorable to such person or entity in any regard than similar provisions
of this franchise, then this franchise shall be deemed amended as of the
effective date of the other franchise, permit, license, authorization or
other agreement so as to give the grantee the benefit of any such more
favorable terms. This Part and franchise agreement may only be
otherwise amended through mutual consent of the parties hereto or as
directed by federal or state law or a ruling of a court of paramount or
competent jurisdiction.
3. Territory. Upon the annexation of any territory to the Borough, the
cable system may be extended, located and operated within said
territory upon the public ways of the Borough, subject to all the terms
of this Part and franchise agreement as though it were an extension
made thereunder and subject to the approval of the Borough Council.
Expansion in annexed territory shall be subject to the terms and
conditions of § 603, Subsections 9 and 10, herein and the authority of
the Borough Council may be superseded by federal or state law.
1. Conditions of Street Occupancy.
A. All transmission and distribution structures, poles, other lines and
equipment installed or erected by the grantee pursuant to the
terms hereof shall be so located as to cause a minimum of
interference with the proper use of public ways and with rights and
reasonable convenience of property owners who own property that
adjoins any of said public ways and shall be subject to approval by
the Borough Council; provided, however, that grantee's use of
private rights-of-way or easements and easements addressed in the
Cable Act shall not be subject to approval of the Borough Council
unless a hazardous condition will result or a Borough ordinance
will be violated. Grantee shall furnish the Borough with a map
showing the cable system in sufficient detail to assure the Borough
of being currently advised as to the location of the cables, lines and
wires of the system. It shall be the responsibility of grantee to keep
the Borough advised of any and all changes and additions and
removals in the cable system, except for the individual subscribers'
connection cables, line and wires.
B. It is the policy of the Borough and is understood by grantee that
where distribution lines are to be installed on any public street, the
same shall be attached to existing utility poles and not to additional
poles placed by grantee, unless otherwise approved by the Borough
Council and that where poles are to be placed in alleys, the same
§ 602 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 603
1:247
shall be located on the same side of the alley as existing utility
poles. It is understood and agreed that this restriction and
limitation shall extend to any and all streets within the limits of the
Borough, even though some of the streets may be part of the state
highway system. Special exceptions may be granted to grantee
by the Borough Council upon written application to it by grantee,
but said exceptions shall be for good cause shown and in the sole
discretion of the Borough Council.
C. Before grantee sets poles or equipment or constructs any structure
on Borough property, grantee shall file with the Borough detailed
specifications showing the exact location, height and dimensions of
the poles, equipment or structures to be erected. The poles,
equipment or structures shall not be erected thereafter until such
specification shall be approved in writing by the Borough Council.
All wires cables and other overhead equipment shall be at such
minimum heights as are or may be required for telephone or power
lines by the Public Utility Commission of Pennsylvania, the
Pennsylvania Department of Highways or any other governmental
authority legally empowered to set such standards.
2. Restoration of Public Ways. If, during the course of grantee's
construction, operation or maintenance of the cable system, there
occurs a disturbance of any public way by grantee, it shall, at its
expense and in a manner approved by the Borough Council, replace and
restore such public way to as good a condition as was existing
immediately prior to such disturbance, and grantee shall maintain the
replacement or restoration in such an improved condition for one year.
3. Relocation at Request of Franchising Authority. Upon its receipt of
reasonable advance notice, not to be less than five business days, the
grantee shall, at its own expense, protect, support, disconnect, relocate
in the public way or remove from the public way any property of the
grantee when lawfully required by the franchising authority by reason
of traffic conditions, public safety, street abandonment, freeway and
street construction, change or establishment of street grade,
installation of sewers, drains, gas or water pipes or any other type of
structure or improvements by the franchising authority; but, the
grantee shall in all cases have the right of abandonment of its property.
If public funds are available to any person or entity using such street,
easement or right-of-way for the purpose of defraying the cost of any of
the foregoing, such funds shall also be made available to the grantee.
4. Relocation of Request of Third Party. The grantee shall, on the request
of any person holding a permit issued by the franchising authority to
move a building, structure, large implement or equipment along or
across any public way, temporarily raise, lower or relocate its wires or
cable system to permit the moving of such building, structure, large
implement or equipment; provided that:
§ 603 QUAKERTOWN CODE § 603
1:248
A. The expense of such temporary raising, lowering or relocation of
wires or cable system is paid by said person, including, if required
by the grantee, making such payment in advance; and
B. The grantee is given not less than 10 business days' advance
written notice to arrange for such temporary wire changes.
5. Trimming Trees and Shrubbery. The grantee shall have the authority to
trim trees or other natural growth overhanging any of its cable system.
The grantee shall reasonably compensate the franchising authority or
property owner for any damages caused by such trimming or shall, in
its sole discretion and at its own cost and expense, reasonably replace
all trees, shrubs or other property damaged as a result of any
construction, operation or maintenance of the cable system undertaken
by grantee. All trimming and removal shall be done under the
supervision and direction of the Borough Council and at the expense of
grantee.
6. Use of Grantee's Equipment by Franchising Authority. Subject to any
applicable state or federal regulations or tariffs, the franchising
authority shall have the right to make additional use, for any public
purpose, of any poles or conduits controlled or maintained exclusively
by or for the grantee in any public way provided that:
A. Such use by the franchising authority does not interfere with a
current or future use by the grantee.
B. The franchising authority holds the grantee harmless against and
from all claims, demands, costs or liabilities of every kind and
nature whatsoever arising out of such use of said poles or conduits,
including but not limited to reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.
C. At grantee's sole discretion, the franchising authority may be
required either to pay a reasonable rental fee or otherwise
reasonably compensate grantee for the use of such poles, conduits
or equipment; provided, however, that grantee agrees that such
compensation or charge shall not exceed those paid by it to public
utilities pursuant to the applicable pole attachment agreement or
other authorization relating to the service area.
7. Safety Requirements. Construction, installation, operation and
maintenance of the cable system shall be performed in an orderly and
workmanlike manner. All such work shall be performed in substantial
accordance with applicable FCC or other federal, state and location
regulations. The cable system shall not reasonably endanger or
interfere with the safety of persons or property in the service area.
8. Aerial and Underground Construction. In those areas of the service
area where all of the transmission or distribution facilities of the
respective public utilities providing telephone communications and
electric services are underground, the grantee likewise shall construct,
operate and maintain all of its transmission and distribution facilities
§ 603 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 603
1:249
underground, provided that such facilities are actually capable of
receiving grantee's cable and other equipment without technical
degradation of the cable system's signal quality. In those areas of
the service area where the transmission or distribution facilities of
the respective public utilities providing telephone communications and
electric services are both aerial and underground, grantee shall have
the discretion, subject to the approval of the Borough Council to
construct, operate and maintain all of its transmission and distribution
facilities or any part thereof aerially or underground. Nothing
contained in this subsection shall require grantee to construct, operate
and maintain underground any ground mounted appurtenances such
as subscriber taps, line extenders, system passive devices (splitters,
directional couplers), amplifiers, power supplies, pedestals or other
similar equipment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this section, in the event that all of the transmission or distribution
facilities of the respective public utilities, providing telephone
communications and electric services are placed underground after the
effective date of this Part and franchise agreement, grantee shall only
be required, at grantee's expense, to construct, operate and maintain
all of its transmission and distribution facilities underground if it is
given reasonable notice and access to the public utilities' facilities at
the time that such are placed underground.
9. Required Extensions of Service. The cable system, as constructed as of
the date of the passage and final adoption by Borough Council of this
Part and franchise agreement, substantially complies with the material
provisions hereof. Grantee is hereby authorized to extend the cable
system as necessary, as desirable or as required pursuant to the terms
hereof within the service area, subject to the approval of the Borough
Council. Whenever grantee shall receive a request for cable service
from at least 15 subscribers within 1,320 cable-bearing strand feet 1/4
mile of its trunk or distribution cable, it shall extend its cable system to
such subscribers at no cost to said subscribers for system extension,
other than the usual connection fees for all subscribers; provided that
such extension is technically feasible and if it will not adversely affect
the operation, financial condition or market development of the cable
system or as provided for under Subsection 10 of this Part and franchise
agreement. Requests for service shall be numbered as one head-ofhousehold
per individual address.
10. Subscriber Charges for Extensions of Service. No subscriber shall be
refused service arbitrarily. However, for unusual circumstances, such
as a subscriber's request to locate his cable drop underground,
existence of more than 150 feet of distance from distribution cable to
connection of service to subscriber or a density of less than 15
subscribers per 1,320 cable-bearing strand feet of trunk or distribution
cable, cable service or other similar services may be made available on
the basis of a capital contribution in aid of construction, including cost
of material, labor and easements. For the purpose of determining the
amount of capital contribution in aid of construction to be borne by
§ 603 QUAKERTOWN CODE § 603
1:250
subscribers in the area in which cable service may be expanded, each
requesting subscriber shall pay to grantee an amount equal to 1/2
of the total construction and other costs to connect all requesting
subscribers multiplied by a number whose numerator equals one and
whose denominator equals the total potential number of subscribers.
The potential number of subscribers shall be calculated by counting
all those existing dwelling units between the points where the existing
cable lines are and where it will end after the new installation is
complete. Grantee may require the payment from each requesting
subscriber to be paid in advance.
11. Service to Public Building. The grantee shall provide, without charge,
one outlet of basic service to each of the franchising authority's office
building(s), fire station, police station, public school building and public
recreation building that is passed by its cable system. The outlets of
basic cable service shall not be used to distribute or sell cable services
in or throughout such buildings. In the event that additional outlets of
basic service are provided to such buildings, the building owner shall
pay the usual installation fees associated therewith including, but not
limited to, labor and materials.
12. Service Standards. Grantee shall, during the continuance of this Part
and franchise agreement, provide facilities and service sufficient to
meet the needs of the public welfare and shall maintain its facilities and
services up-to-date and in keeping with technical progress. Grantee
shall maintain and operate its cable system and render sufficient
service in accordance with the rules and regulations as are or in the
future may be set forth by the Federal Communications Commission,
state government, federal government or any authorized agencies
thereof. The Borough shall maintain all authorized police power. The
cable system shall be installed and maintained in accordance with good
engineering practices and any spurious electromagnetic radiation must
fall within the limits specified by the Federal Communications
Commission. Any interference caused by the cable system to television
sets not part of the system shall be immediately addressed by the
company upon notice from the Borough or any Borough resident.
Alleged interfered shall be explained, eliminated or reduced in
compliance with FCC standards. If the interference is caused by
grantee and a suitable filter or other satisfactory device that will
remove a problem is available, it shall be provided to the resident in
question. All construction must be done in a good and workmanlike
manner, free of obvious defects that may be a hazard to life and limb
and in conformance with the standards set forth in the National Electric
Safety Code. The location of the cable system, including antenna site,
towers, poles and associated equipment, shall be chosen with due
regard for highest technical performance concomitant with
aeronautical safety considerations and shall be subject to standards
established by the FCC, FAA or other governmental agencies having
jurisdiction over matters addressed in this subsection.
§ 603 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 603
1:251
§ 604. Compliance and Monitoring. [Ord. 973, 6/5/1991, § 4]
13. Notice of Interruption for Repairs. Whenever it is necessary to shut off
or interrupt service for the purpose of making repairs, adjustments or
installations, grantee shall do so at such time as shall cause the least
amount of inconvenience to its customers and, unless such interruption
is unforeseen and immediately necessary, grantee shall give reasonable
notice thereof to its customers. Any service interruption shall be for the
shortest period of time consistent with any necessary repairs,
adjustments or installations being made.
14. Continuous Service. Grantee's service shall be continuous daily during
the regular telecast operation hours of the stations and cable networks
whose broadcasts are being transmitted.
15. Nondiscrimination of Service. Grantee shall serve any person residing
in or owning property in the Borough and desiring cable service or
similar services provided by grantee. It is understood that this
subsection is limited by the terms and conditions of Subsections 9 and
10 hereof. Grantee shall not, as to rates, charges, service facilities,
rules, regulations or any other respect, make or grant preference or
advantage to any person, not subject any person to any prejudice or
disadvantage, provided that nothing in this Part and franchise
agreement shall be deemed to prohibit the establishment of a
graduated scale of charges and classified rate schedules to which any
customer coming within such classification might be entitled; provided,
however, that any such classification shall be reasonable in nature and
based upon substantial evidence of the need for the classification.
16. Interference. Grantee shall at all times operate the cable system so as
not to adversely affect or interfere with existing radio and television
reception and shall prevent radiation from grantee's cable system to
antennas located in the Borough. In this regard, grantee shall operate
the cable system in compliance with FCC standards.
1. Testing for Compliance. The franchise authority may perform technical
tests of the cable system during reasonable times and in a manner
which does not unreasonably interfere with the normal business
operations of the grantee or the cable system in order to determine
whether or not the grantee is in compliance with the terms hereof and
applicable state and federal laws. Except in emergency circumstances,
such tests may be undertaken only after giving grantee reasonable
notice thereof, not to be less than one business day, and providing a
representative of grantee an opportunity to be present during such
tests. In the event that such testing demonstrates that the grantee has
substantially failed to comply with a material requirement hereof, the
reasonable costs of such tests shall be borne by the grantee. In the
event that such testing demonstrates that grantee has substantially
complied with such material provisions hereof, the cost of such testing
shall be borne by the franchising authority. The results of all such
testing shall be made available to grantee upon grantee's request.

2. Books and Records. The grantee agrees that the franchising authority
may review such of its books and records during normal business hours

hereof. Such records include but shall not be limited to any public
records required to be kept by the grantee pursuant to the rules and
regulations of the Federal Communications Commission. The
franchising authority agrees to treat any information disclosed by the
grantee to it on a confidential basis, and only to disclose it to
employees, representatives and agents thereof that have a need to
know or in order to enforce the provisions hereof.
1. Notice of Violation. In the event that the franchising authority believes
that the grantee has not complied with the terms of the franchise, it
shall notify grantee of the exact nature of the alleged noncompliance.
2. Grantee's Right to Cure or Respond. Grantee shall have 30 days from
receipt of the notice described in Subsection 1 to respond to the
franchising authority contesting the assertion of noncompliance or to
cure such default or, in the event that, by nature of the default, such
default cannot be cured within the thirty-day period, initiate reasonable
steps to remedy such default and notify the franchising authority of the
steps being taken and the projected date that they will be completed.
3. Public Hearing. In the event that grantee fails to respond to the notice
described in Subsection 1 pursuant to the procedure set forth in
Subsection 2 or in the event that the alleged default is not remedied
within 60 days after the grantee is notified of the alleged default
pursuant to Subsection 1, the franchising authority shall schedule a
public meeting to investigate the default. In the event that a special
meeting is not scheduled for such purposes, such public meeting shall
be held at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the franchising
authority. The franchising authority shall notify the grantee of the time
and place of such meeting and provide the grantee with an opportunity
to be heard.
4. Enforcement. Subject to applicable federal and state law, in the event
the franchising authority, after such meeting, determines that grantee
is in default of any provision of the franchise, the franchising authority
may:
A. Foreclose on all or part of any security provided under the
franchise, if any, including, without limitation, any bonds or other
surety; provided, however, that the foreclosure shall only be in such
manner and in such amount as the franchising authority reasonably
determines is necessary to remedy the default.
B. Commence an action at law for monetary damages or seek other
equitable relief.

WASTEWATER INDUSTRIAL PRETREATMENT PROGRAM
§ 301. General Purposes. [Ord. 1077, 8/7/2002]
1. Purpose and Objectives. The purpose of this Part is to enable the
Borough of Quakertown to comply with all the applicable state and
federal environmental laws regulating the collection and treatment of
domestic and industrial waste as well as assist in assuring a welloperated
municipal wastewater sewage system and treatment plant. To
this end, the Borough reserves the right to condition or to refuse to
accept industrial wastewater. The particular objectives of this Part are:
A. To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the municipal
wastewater system which will interfere with the operation of the
system or contaminate the resulting sludge.
B. To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the municipal
wastewater system which will pass through the system
inadequately treated into receiving waters or the atmosphere, or
otherwise be incompatible with the system.
C. To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the municipal
wastewater system that could harm the collection system, the
treatment plant or the health, safety and welfare of the plant
personnel.
D. To prevent the introduction of clean water discharges into the
municipal wastewater system that could interfere with the
operation of the system or consume the treatment plant capacity or
reduce the effectiveness of the treatment process.
E. To promote reuse and recycling of industrial wastewater and
sludge from the publicly owned treatment works.
F. To provide for the equitable distribution of costs for the
implementation of the Borough's industrial pretreatment program.
G. This Part provides for the regulation of certain contributors to the
Borough of Quakertown municipal wastewater collection system
through the issuance of permits to significant industrial users and
through enforcement of general requirements for other users;
authorizes monitoring, compliance and enforcement activities;
establishes administrative review procedures; requires industrial
user reporting and assumes that existing customers capacity will
not be preempted.

implement and enforce the provisions of this Part. Nothing
contained in this Part shall be construed as preventing any special
agreement or arrangement between the Borough and users, within
or out of the Borough, whereby a waste of unusual strength or
character may be accepted by the Borough by special agreement,
either verbal or written, executed prior to such acceptance,
containing safeguards, limitations and conditions acceptable to the
Borough. No such special agreement or arrangement, however,
shall waive or abrogate any national categorical pretreatment
standard.
I. Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, nothing in this
Part shall be deemed to be a legally binding commitment under the
Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. § 1251, et seq., the Clean Streams Law,
35 Pa. Stat. §§ 691.1 et seq., and applicable regulations (e.g., 40

§ 302 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 302
1:337
J. Any substance which may cause the POTW's effluent or any other
product of the POTW, such as residues, sludges or scums to be
unsuitable for reclamation and reuse or to interfere with the
reclamation process. In no case shall a substance discharged to the

other persistent herbicides, pesticides or rodenticides.
Noncompliance with the above-listed prohibited standards is
enforceable under the provisions of this Part.
2. National Categorical Pretreatment Standards. If the categorical
standards for a particular industrial user are more stringent than local
§ 302 QUAKERTOWN CODE § 302
1:338
limits or other requirements imposed under this Part, then the
categorical standards shall apply. The national categorical
pretreatment standards as set forth in 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter
N, Part 405 et seq., are hereby incorporated into the industrial
pretreatment program as program requirements for those industrial
users subject to such categorical standards. Upon the promulgation
of new national categorical pretreatment standards that apply to an
existing industrial user, the industrial user so affected shall comply with
the reporting requirements in § 304, Subsection 7, of this Part and the
requirement of 40 CFR 403.12. If an existing industrial user not subject
to a wastewater discharge permit under this Part becomes a significant
industrial user because of a newly promulgated categorical standard,
the industrial user shall also apply for a permit as provided in § 304,
Subsection 1, of this Part.
3. Specific Pollutant Limitations. The Borough may establish, and review
from time to time, local limits regulating the discharge of specific
pollutants by industrial users. Local limits developed to prevent pass
through or interference or to implement prohibited discharge
standards shall be approved by the approval authority.
A. Local limits may be established for any substance which is
discharged, or is likely to be discharged, to the POTW.
B. Local limits may limit concentration, mass or a combination of the
two.
C. The procedure for the calculation of local limits may be as
recommended by the approval authority or otherwise considered
appropriate by the Borough.
D. Local limits shall be calculated for pollutants, as deemed necessary,
to prevent interference and pass through. In addition, local limits
may be calculated to prevent the discharge of toxic materials in
toxic amounts; threats to worker health and safety; and physical,
chemical or biological damage to the POTW.
E. Local limits are applicable to all significant industrial users and
may be included in wastewater discharge permits. Local limits may
be applied to other industrial users if deemed appropriate by the
Borough.
F. Discharging any pollutant in excess of a local limit established for
that pollutant shall constitute a violation of this Part.
4. Any user who is discharging industrial wastewater into the Borough's
collection system with concentrations of pollutants higher than those
listed below will, at the Borough's discretion, either be required to pay
a surcharge in addition to their regular sewer rate, or have to pretreat
the wastewater to within acceptable limits.
A. Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) — 300 mg/l.
§ 302 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 302
1:339
B. Total Suspended Solids (TSS) — 350 mg/l.
C. Ammonia (NH3) — 40 mg/l.
D. Total Phosphorous (TP) — 15 mg/l.
5. When a user discharges any of the above-listed parameters in excess of
the concentration indicated for that parameter, the sewer charge shall
be calculated using the following formula:
Sewer rate = regular sewer x surcharge factor.
The surcharge factor is calculated as follows:
Surcharge factor = 0.25 + 0.15(BOD÷300) + 0.25 (TSS÷350) +
0.1(NH3÷40) + 0.25 (TP÷15)
Where BOD is the concentration of biochemical oxygen demand, TSS
is the concentration of total suspended solids, etc. Where a pollutant
concentration is less than the limitation listed above for that
parameter, the number in parenthesis in the surcharge factor shall be
equal to one.
6. Borough's Right of Revision. The Borough Manager or Superintendent
may establish more stringent limitations or requirements for
dischargers to the POTW if deemed necessary to comply the objectives
as stated in § 301 of this Part. Such limitations or requirements shall
become effective upon the amendment or revision of a wastewater
discharge permit or upon publication of notice of such new limitations
or requirements in a newspaper of general circulation in the Borough.
7. Excessive Discharge. No user shall, unless expressly authorized by an
applicable standard or requirement, increase the use of process water
or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete
substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the
limitations contained in the federal categorical pretreatment standards
or with any other pollutant-specific limitation developed by the
Borough, state or federal agencies.
8. Accidental Discharge.
A. Each significant industrial user shall provide protection from
discharges of spills and slug loads. Facilities and procedures to
prevent discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and
maintained at the industrial user's own cost and expense. The
Borough shall evaluate each significant industrial user to
determine whether protection from slug loads or spills of
prohibited materials or other regulated substances must be
provided. If the Borough determines that the industrial user needs
such facilities, it will so notify the industrial user, requiring the
development and implementation of a spill control plan. No
significant industrial user that commences contribution to the
POTW after the date of adoption of this Part shall be permitted to
introduce pollutants into the POTW until such an evaluation has
§ 302 QUAKERTOWN CODE § 302
1:340
been completed and, if required by the Borough, a spill control plan
has been developed and implemented. Existing industrial users will
be reevaluated from time to time and, if so notified by the Borough,
shall develop and implement a spill control plan as instructed and
according to the schedule agreed to by the Borough. Inspection of
facilities and approval of spill control plans and facilities by the
Borough shall not relieve the significant industrial user from the
responsibility to modify its facility or plans as necessary to meet
the requirements of this Part, nor shall it imply any warranty or
determination regarding the appropriateness, efficacy or safety of
the plan or facilities on behalf of the Borough.
B. Any spill control plan developed by an industrial user shall include
the elements itemized in 40 CFR 403.8(f)(2)(vi)A-D. In addition, the
industrial user shall have permanently posted a notice to
employees advising whom to call in the event of a spill or slug load,
including the Superintendent, and listing the information required
to be provided to the Superintendent in such event. The industrial
user shall ensure that all employees are trained in the spill control
plan and in emergency notification procedures.
C. In the event of any spill or slug load, as defined by this Part, the
industrial user shall immediately notify the Superintendent, or his
designated agent, by telephone, providing information regarding
the nature, volume and constituents of the spill or slug load and
providing notice, to the best of the industrial user's knowledge, of
when the discharge commenced and when it will cease. Within five
days of such an event, the industrial user shall provide to the
Borough a written report of the spill or slug load describing the
cause, the nature, volume and constituents of the spill, the
measures taken to mitigate any expense, loss, damage or other
liability which might have been incurred as a result of the spill or
slug load and the measures the industrial user plans to take to
prevent a reoccurrence of the incident. Such a report may be
waived by the Borough at the Borough's sole discretion, if the
immediate telephone notice was provided and if the industrial user
requests such a waiver, giving sufficient reason therefor.
D. In any case, the reporting of a spill or slug load to the Borough shall
not relieve the industrial user of any fines, civil penalties or other
liability which may arise or be imposed by this Part or any other
applicable law.
9. Notification of the Discharge of Hazardous Wastes.
A. Pursuant to 40 CFR 403.12(p), industrial users shall notify the
Borough, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director
and state hazardous waste authorities in writing of any discharge
into the POTW of a substance, which, if otherwise disposed of,
would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such
notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set
§ 302 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 302
1:341
forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number and the
type of discharge (continuous, batch or other). If the industrial user
discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar
month to the POTW, the notification shall also contain the following
information to the extent such information is known and readily
available to the industrial user:
(1) An identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the
wastes.
(2) An estimation of the mass and concentration of such
constituents in the waste stream discharged during the
calendar month.
(3) An estimation of the mass of constituents in the waste stream
expected to be discharged during the following 12 months.
B. All notifications must take place as provided by 40 CFR 403.12(p).
Industrial users who commence discharging after the effective date
of this rule shall provide the notification no later than 180 days
after the discharge of the listed or characteristic hazardous waste.
Any notification under this subsection need be submitted only once
for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of
changed discharges must be submitted as provided in § 304 of this
Part.
C. The notification requirement does not apply to pollutants already
reported under the self-monitoring requirements of 40 CFR
403.12(b), (d) and (e). Dischargers are exempt from the
requirements of paragraph one of 40 CFR 403.12 (p) if, during a
calendar month, they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of
hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as
specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more
than 15 kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar
month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in
40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification.
Subsequent months during which the industrial user discharges
more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require
additional notification.
D. In the case of any new regulations under § 3001 of RCRA
identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing
any additional substance as a hazardous waste the industrial user
must notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste
Division Director and state hazardous waste authorities of the
discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of
such regulations.
E. In the case of any notification made under paragraph (p) of 40 CFR
403.12, the industrial user shall certify that it has a program in
place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes
§ 302 QUAKERTOWN CODE § 302
1:342
§ 303. Fees. [Ord. 1077, 8/7/2002]
§ 304. Administration. [Ord. 1077, 8/7/2002; as amended by Ord.
1159, 5/6/200910]
generated to the degree it has determined to be economically
practical.
10. Unauthorized Discharges. Except as otherwise provided in § 305,
Subsection 1A, of this Part, discharge of any prohibited substance listed
under § 302, Subsection 1, of this Part or in violation of applicable local
limits or categorical standards shall be an unauthorized discharge and
the Borough may take whatever steps necessary to halt such a
discharge or to seek penalties therefor as set forth in § 305 of this Part.
1. It is the purpose of this section to provide for the recovery of costs from
significant users or users of the Borough's wastewater disposal system
for the implementation of the program established herein. The
applicable charges or fees shall be set forth in the Borough's schedule
of charges and fees.
2. Charges and Fees. The Borough may adopt, by resolution of Borough
Council, charges and fees, which may include but not be limited to:
A. Fees for reimbursement of the costs of setting up and operating the
Borough's pretreatment program.
B. Fees for monitoring, inspections and surveillance procedures.
C. Fees for reviewing accidental discharge procedures and
construction.
D. Fees for permit applications.
E. Fees for filing appeals.
F. Fees for consistent removal by the Borough of pollutants otherwise
subject to Federal pretreatment standards.
G. Fees for responding to accidental discharges and emergencies
resulting from discharges in violation of the wastewater discharge
permit and this Part.
H. Other fees the Borough may deem necessary to carry out the
requirements contained herein.
These fees relate solely to the matters covered by this Part and are
separate from all other fees chargeable by the Borough.
10.Editor's Note: This ordinance provided that §§ 302 and 304 were readopted in their
entirety to acknowledge that the federal regulations referenced herein have been modified
since the last enactment of this Part and are reincorporated by the Borough as applicable
local regulations in their revised form.
§ 302 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 304
1:343
1. Industrial Users.
A. All significant industrial users proposing to connect to or
contribute to the POTW shall obtain a wastewater discharge permit
before connecting to or contributing to the POTW.
B. Whenever an existing industrial user becomes a significant
industrial user, but has not previously submitted an application for
a wastewater discharge permit, the user shall do so as soon as it
knows that it is or will be a significant industrial user.
C. Discharge of industrial wastes by a significant industrial user
without a valid wastewater discharge permit is an unauthorized
discharge and a violation of this Part, and the Borough may take
such action as allowed by law, including the blockage or severance
of the connection between the user's building sewer and the POTW
collection system, to exclude the unauthorized discharge from the
POTW. Industrial users that are not classified as significant
industrial users may discharge industrial wastes without a permit,
but must comply with all other provisions of this Part including, but
not limited to, the wastewater quality requirements established by
§ 302 and the reporting requirements of § 304, Subsection 8.

L. Statement of duration.
M. Statement of nontransferability.
N. Statement of applicable civil and criminal penalties for violation of
pretreatment requirements and standards.
O. Other conditions as deemed necessary by the Borough to ensure
compliance with this Part.
§ 304 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 304
1:347
A wastewater discharge permit, in addition to implementing
requirements as mandated by the general pretreatment
regulations and the industrial pretreatment program approved
by the approval authority, may be a means for the Borough to
implement other requirements. Implementation and enforcement
of such additional provisions shall be at the discretion of the
Borough and shall not be subject to the review of the approval
authority.
5. Permit Duration. Permits shall be issued for a specified time period, not
to exceed five years. A permit may be issued for a period less than a
year, or may be stated to expire on a specific date. A permitted user
shall apply for permit reissuance a minimum of 90 days prior to the
expiration of the users existing permit. The terms and conditions of the
users permit may be subject to modification by the Borough during the
term of the permit, as limitations or requirements as identified in this
section are modified or other just cause exists. Any changes or new
conditions in the permit shall include a reasonable time schedule for
compliance unless a specified time frame is expressly authorized by an
applicable standard or requirement.
6. Permit Transfer. Wastewater discharge permits are issued to a specific
user for a specific operation. A wastewater discharge permit shall not
be reassigned, transferred or sold to a new owner, new user, different
premises or a new or changed operation without the written approval of
the Borough. Any succeeding owner shall also comply with the terms
and conditions of the existing permit.
7. Permit Reporting Requirements. The provisions of this Subsection 7
apply to industrial users that are, or that become subject to national
categorical pretreatment standards. In the case that an industrial user
becomes subject to categorical standards through means of
promulgation of a new categorical standard, or due to changes in the
user's processes, the following reporting requirements apply. In
addition, the user may be subject to the provisions of Subsections 1, 2, 6
and 8 of this section.
A. Compliance Date Report. Within 90 days following the date for final
compliance with applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or
in the case of a new source, following commencement of the
introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any significant user
subject to categorical pretreatment standards shall submit to the
Borough a report indicating the nature and concentration of all
pollutants in the discharge from the regulated process(es) which
are limited by the categorical pretreatment standards. The report
shall state whether the applicable categorical pretreatment
standards are being met on a consistent basis, and if not, what
additional O&M and/or pretreatment is necessary to bring the
significant user into compliance with the applicable categorical
pretreatment standards. This statement shall be signed by an
§ 304 QUAKERTOWN CODE § 304
1:348
authorized representative of the significant user and certified by a
qualified professional engineer registered in the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania.
B. Periodic Compliance Report. In the case that the Borough does not
conduct semiannual sampling of a significant industrial user's
discharge, the reporting requirements of 40 CFR 403.12(e) and (h)
are applicable, and such a significant industrial user shall provide
self-monitoring reports as are required by the regulations. When
the Borough conducts all industrial waste sampling, industrial
users are not required to submit semiannual reports unless
otherwise notified by the Borough.
C. Baseline Monitoring Reports (BMRs). All significant users subject
to categorical pretreatment standards must submit a baseline
monitoring report (BMR) to the control authority. The purpose of
the BMR is to provide information to the control authority to
document the significant user's compliance with a categorical
pretreatment standard prior to commencement of discharge. As
required by 40 CFR 403.12(b), BMRs must be submitted to the
control authority within 180 days after the effective date of a
categorical pretreatment standard or 180 days after the final
administrative decision made upon a category determination
request [40 CFR 403.6(a)(4)], whichever is later. A BMR must
contain the information specified in 40 CFR 403.12(b).
D. Signatory Requirement. As specified in 40 CFR 403.12(1) reports
on compliance with categorical deadlines, periodic compliance
reports and BMRs must be signed by an appropriate official and
must contain the certification statement specified in 40 CFR
403.6(a)(2)(ii) which states:
I certify under penalty of law that this document and all
attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision
in accordance with a system designed to assure that qualified
personnel properly gather and evaluate the information
submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons directly
responsible for gathering the information, the information
submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true,
accurate and complete. I am aware that there are significant
penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility
of fine and imprisonment for knowing violations.
8. Change in Operations.
A. Any industrial user contemplating or planning a substantial change
in the manufacturing process, raw materials, auxiliary processes,
pretreatment processes or other changes which may result in
substantial changes to wastewater character, composition, volume
or rate of flow, shall notify the Borough in writing at least 30 days
prior to making such a change, or, if the change is not planned 30
§ 304 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 304
1:349
days or more in advance, immediately upon the decision to make
such a change. If a change in wastewater characteristics occurs
without the knowledge of the industrial user, the industrial user
shall report the change immediately upon becoming aware of it.
The report shall include all information necessary to determine
the effect on the wastewater of the change. The Borough may
require the industrial user to undertake a compatibility study to
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Borough that the wastewater
to be discharged is compatible with the POTW, will not affect any
requirements imposed upon the Borough (including sludge disposal
requirements) and will not otherwise adversely affect the POTW.
B. The Borough may, on receipt of such a report:
(1) Continue an existing wastewater discharge permit in effect.
(2) Require application for a new wastewater discharge permit.
(3) Modify an existing wastewater discharge permit to reflect the
changed nature of the waste.
(4) Rescind and reissue an existing wastewater discharge permit
in order to make substantial changes in wastewater discharge
permit conditions.
(5) Revoke an existing wastewater discharge permit or require the
industrial user to cease or prevent the discharge.
(6) Take such other action as it deems appropriate.
9. Monitoring Facilities.
A. The Borough shall determine whether an industrial user shall place
a monitoring facility on its building sewer line. Any required
monitoring facilities shall be provided, constructed and operated
by the industrial user at its expense. The monitoring facilities shall
meet all the Borough's requirements and comply with all the
applicable building, plumbing and electrical codes. Upon notice of
the Borough to do so, industrial users shall have 90 days to
construct and equip the required facilities.
B. There shall be ample room in and near each sampling manhole or
facility to allow accurate sampling and sampling preparation for
analysis. The facility and all related equipment shall at all times be
maintained by the industrial user in a safe and proper operating
condition.
10. Inspection and Sampling. Maintaining a source or potential source of
indirect discharge is governed by the Clean Water Act and the
Pennsylvania Clean Streams Law, and therefore is an activity that may
affect the public health and welfare if not conducted according to the
provisions of the applicable statutes, this Part and the rules adopted
hereunder. Accordingly, the Borough asserts its right to inspect at
§ 304 QUAKERTOWN CODE § 304
1:350
reasonable times the premises of any industrial users that is a source
or potential source of indirect discharge and to take samples and
measurements, all for the purposes of ascertaining compliance with the
provisions of the industrial pretreatment program. The maintenance of
a source of indirect discharge within the Borough shall be deemed a
regulated activity subject to the following rules.
A. The Superintendent may inspect the facilities of any industrial user
to ascertain whether the purpose of this Part is being met and all
requirements are being complied with. Owners or occupants of
premises where industrial wastewater is created or discharged
shall allow the Borough's representatives ready access at all
reasonable times to all parts of the premises for the purposes of
inspection, sampling, records examination, including the copying
thereof, or in the performance of any of their duties. The Borough,
EPA and DEP shall have the right to set up on the user's property
such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling, inspection,
compliance monitoring and/or metering operations. Where a user
has security measures in force which would require proper
identification and clearance before entry into his premises, the user
shall make necessary arrangements with his security guards so
that upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel from
the Borough, DEP and EPA will be permitted to enter without delay,
for the purpose of performing their specific responsibilities.
B. Significant industrial users’ facilities shall be inspected by the
Superintendent a minimum of one time per year and sampled a
minimum of one time per year. The Superintendent may include in
any wastewater discharge permit issued to a significant industrial
user a schedule under which the SIU must self-monitor its
wastewater discharge and report the results of such selfmonitoring
on dates or at intervals as specified in the permit. If any
sampling performed by an industrial user (whether or not such
sampling is required by a permit) indicates a violation, the user
must notify the Superintendent within 24 hours of becoming aware
of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and
analysis for each pollutant parameter in violation and report the
results to the Superintendent within 30 days after becoming aware
of the violation. [Amended by Ord. 1185, 12/7/2011]
(1) The user is not required to conduct the resampling and
reporting described above if the Borough performs sampling at
least once a month or if the Borough conducts sampling for the
parameter between the time the user’s original sampling was
conducted and the time when the user receives the results of
that sampling.
(2) In the case that the Borough conducts sampling that indicates
a violation, the Borough shall undertake the repeat sampling
and analysis, unless it notifies the user that the user is required
§ 304 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 304
1:351
to conduct the repeat sampling and analysis, in which case the
user is subject to the requirements stated above.
C. All industrial waste samples shall be representative of the
discharge and shall conform to the requirements found at 40 CFR
403.12(g)(3) or (4), as appropriate (regarding the use of grab and
composite samples). Sampling and analysis of all samples shall be
in accordance with 40 CFR Part 136 and any amendments thereto.
Costs of all sampling and analysis shall be borne by the user. The
Borough may include sampling and analysis costs in the sewer
rental charge or may invoice the user separately for such costs.
[Amended by Ord. 1185, 12/7/2011]
11. Pretreatment.
A. Users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as required to
comply with this Part and shall achieve compliance with all
applicable federal categorical pretreatment standards within the
time limitations as specified by the federal pretreatment
regulations. Any equipment or facilities required to pretreat
wastewater to a level acceptable to the Borough shall be provided,
operated and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans
showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall
be submitted to the Borough for review and shall be acceptable to
the Borough before construction of the facility. The review and
approval of such plans and operating procedures will in no way
relieve an industrial user from the responsibility of modifying his
facility as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to the
Borough under the provisions of this Part, nor does it imply any
warranty or determination regarding the appropriateness, efficacy
or safety of the plans, facilities or procedures by the Borough. Any
subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of
operation shall be reported to and be accepted by the Borough
prior to the user's initiation of the changes.
B. Grease, oil or sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the
opinion of the Borough, they are necessary for the proper handling
of liquid wastes containing floatable grease in such amounts as to
cause obstruction to the flow in a sewer or other interference with
the operation of the wastewater treatment facilities, or any
flammable waste, sand or other harmful ingredients, except such
interceptors shall not be required for private living quarters or
dwelling units. All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity
approved by the Borough and shall be located as to be readily
accessible for cleaning and inspection. In the maintaining of these
interceptors, the owner(s) shall be responsible for the proper
removal and disposal by appropriate means of the captured
material and shall maintain records of the dates and means of
disposal which are subject to review by the Borough. Any removal
and hauling of the collected materials not performed by the owner's
§ 304 QUAKERTOWN CODE § 304
1:352
(owners') personnel must be performed by properly licensed waste
disposal firms.
C. All records relating to compliance with the pretreatment
requirements and standards shall be made available to officials of
the Borough, DEP, EPA or approval authority upon request.
12. Significant Noncompliance and Significant Violators. Significant
noncompliance for significant industrial users will be calculated by the
Borough on a "rolling quarter" basis, using procedures as
recommended by the EPA. The Borough will annually publish in the
largest daily newspaper published in the Borough a list of significant
violators. The Borough may publish a list of significant violators more
frequently, at the discretion of the Borough.
13. Confidential Information. Information and data on an industrial user
obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits,
monitoring programs and inspections shall be available to the public or
other governmental agencies without restriction unless the industrial
user specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction
of the Borough that the release of such information would divulge
information, processes or methods of production entitled to protection
as trade secrets of the industrial user. When requested by the person
furnishing a report, those portions of a report which might disclose
trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for
inspection by the public but shall be made available, upon written
request, to governmental agencies for uses related to this Part, the
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit and/or the
pretreatment program. Any such portions of a report shall also be
available for use by the state or any state agency in judicial review or
enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report.
Wastewater constituents and characteristics will not be recognized as
confidential information.
14. Special Agreements and/or Waiver of Pretreatment Requirements.
Nothing contained in this Part shall be construed as prohibiting special
agreements between the Borough and a person discharging industrial
wastes or wastewaters to the sewer system, or for the Borough to
otherwise waive requirements hereunder, when conditions and
circumstances making such special agreements or waiver advisable
and/or necessary, in the opinion of the Borough, are present; provided,
however, that:
A. National categorical pretreatment standards and prohibited
discharge standards [including the general and specific
prohibitions set forth at 40 CFR 403.5(a) and (b)] shall not be
waived, unless such waiver is granted by mechanisms established
under the Federal Pretreatment Regulations (40 CFR 403 et seq.).
B. In no case shall a special agreement or waiver of local limits allow
for an industrial user to discharge any pollutant which, alone or in
§ 304 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 304
1:353
§ 305. Enforcement. [Ord. 1077, 8/7/2002]
combination with other regulated industrial user discharges, would
reasonably be expected to exceed the mass loadings determined
by the Borough as acceptable to the sewage treatment plant based
upon considerations of, among other things, interference, pass
through and sludge contamination. The Borough may consider
other factors (e.g., effect of the discharge on the POTW, future
expansion, etc.), as it deems appropriate. In no event shall any
special agreement or waiver allow the sum of the loadings
allocated to industrial users to exceed the values set forth in any
local limits analysis submitted by the Borough to EPA and approved
by EPA as part of the industrial pretreatment program.
C. The Borough may require an industrial user requesting a special
agreement or waiver adjusting effluent limitations to submit
supporting documentation indicating why the industrial user
cannot reasonably expect to meet the effluent limitation contained
in its wastewater discharge permit, setting forth an expeditious
schedule for achieving compliance with such limitations and
including such other information as the Borough may require. In
granting any special agreement or waiver the Borough may impose
time limitations upon any reduced requirements and provide a
compliance schedule for achieving compliance. In granting any
special agreement or waiver, the Borough may impose any other
conditions deemed necessary to implement the purposes of this
Part.
D. If granting a special agreement or waiver would result in increased
costs to the Borough (e.g., treatment, monitoring, sludge disposal
costs), the Borough may condition the special agreement or waiver
upon the agreement of the industrial user to pay those costs, and to
provide security adequate in the judgment of the Borough to assure
payment of said costs.
1. Administrative Enforcement Remedies.
A. Legal Action.
(1) If any person discharges sewage, industrial wastes or other
wastes into the Borough's POTW contrary to the provisions of
this Part, federal or state pretreatment standards or
requirements, or any order of the Borough, or violates any
other provision of this Part or wastewater discharge permit
conditions, the Borough may commence an action of the type
listed herein or may take any action for which it has been
empowered under state law, for appropriate relief in any court
of competent jurisdiction.
(2) The Borough may develop guidelines for the enforcement of
this Part and applicable industrial user permit conditions in the
§ 304 QUAKERTOWN CODE § 305
1:354
form of an enforcement response guide, which may be updated
or amended from time to time as is necessary. Such guidelines
shall not be mandatory and shall not serve to limit the
enforcement options available to the Borough for any violation
of the pretreatment program.
B. Notification of Violation. Whenever the Borough determines that
any industrial user has violated or is violating this Part, wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder, the Borough Manager
or his agent may serve upon said industrial user written notice of
the violation. The notice of violation may require a response to be
submitted to the Borough within a specified time period to be
determined by the Borough. This response may include, but not be
limited to, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the
satisfactory correction and prevention thereof. Response to a
notice of violation in no way relieves the industrial user of liability
for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of
violation.
C. Compliance Agreements. The Borough Manager is hereby
empowered to enter into agreements with industrial users for the
purpose of assuring timely compliance with the provisions of the
industrial pretreatment program. Such agreements shall not
replace an applicable wastewater discharge permit, but may serve
to modify the terms of such a permit regarding schedules of
compliance or other actions by the industrial user necessary to
meet the pretreatment requirements. No such agreement shall
serve to modify the provisions of a pretreatment standard so as to
make such provisions less stringent. The provisions of such an
agreement shall not serve to abrogate the rights of the Borough to
seek appropriate penalties for noncompliance should the industrial
user fail to meet the terms and conditions of the agreement, but the
Borough may agree not to seek such additional penalties if the
terms of the agreement are met.
D. Show Cause Hearing. The Borough may order any industrial user
which causes or contributes to a violation of this Part or
wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, to show
cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken.
Notice shall be served on the industrial user specifying the time
and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action and
the reasons for such action and a request that the user show cause
why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The
notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or
certified mail (return receipt requested) at least 10 days prior to
the meeting. Such notice may be served on any principal executive,
general partner or corporate officer.
E. Suspension of Wastewater Discharge Permits.
§ 305 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 305
1:355
(1) The Borough Manager may suspend a user's wastewater
discharge permit whenever such suspension is necessary in
order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which
presents, or may present, an imminent or substantial
endangerment to the health or welfare of persons or to the
environment, or causes interference to the POTW or causes the
Borough to violate any condition of its NPDES permit.
(2) Any person notified of a suspension of his wastewater
discharge permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the
discharge. In the event of a failure of the person to comply
voluntarily with the suspension order, the Borough may take
steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to
the POTW system or endangerment to any individuals.
(3) Upon proof of the elimination of the noncomplying discharge
by the user, payment of any damages, fines, penalties or costs
associated with the noncompliance, and the submission of a
detailed written statement describing the causes of the
harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any
future occurrence, the Borough, at its discretion, may reinstate
the user's wastewater discharge permit or keep it in
suspension for good cause.
F. Revocation of Permit. Any user is subject to revocation of a permit
granted hereunder for violation of applicable state and/or federal
regulations, conditions of this Part or by reason of the commission
of any of the following acts:
(1) Violation of the conditions of the permit.
(2) Failure to report significant changes in operations or
wastewater constituents or characteristics.
(3) Refusal to permit reasonable access to the premises for
inspection and monitoring.
(4) Failure to report factually the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge.
Upon revocation of a user's wastewater discharge permit,
the user's right to discharge industrial waste ceases and
subsequent discharge of industrial waste may result in such
action as the Borough deems appropriate, including
severance or plugging of the user's building sewer at the point
of connection to the POTW.
2. Judicial Remedies.
A. The Borough may proceed in equity in a court of competent
jurisdiction against any user who has violated or may violate any
provision of this Part or the provisions of the industrial
§ 305 QUAKERTOWN CODE § 305
1:356
pretreatment program, including any permit issued hereunder,
seeking appropriate relief therefore. In such an action, the Borough
may also seek to recover such damages as it suffered due to the
violations including, but not limited to, costs of investigation,
monitoring, remediation or treatment of nonconforming wastes;
civil or criminal costs, fines or penalties imposed on the Borough
by EPA, the Pennsylvania DEP or any court or tribunal; and damage
to persons or property.
B. Any user who violates any provision of this Part, or the terms and
conditions of any wastewater discharge permit issued hereunder,
shall be subject to a civil penalty of not more than $1,000 for each
such offense. Each day in which an offense occurs shall be a
separate offense. When the offense is the violation of a discharge
limit expressed as an average, each day in the averaging period
may be, at the discretion of the court, considered as a separate
offense. A proceeding under this section shall not act as a bar to a
simultaneous proceeding in equity before the same tribunal for the
same offense, nor to other actions of the Borough under this Part.
(1) The Borough may recover reasonable attorney's fees, court
costs and other expenses associated with enforcement
activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses.
(2) In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take
into account all relevant circumstances including, but not
limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the
magnitude and duration of the violation, any economic benefit
gained through the user's violation, corrective actions taken by
the user, the compliance history of the user and any other
factors as justice requires.
C. Any person who knowingly violates any provision of this Part, any
local limits imposed as provided herein or any wastewater
discharge permit issued under the industrial pretreatment
program is guilty of a summary offense and upon conviction thereof
shall be subject to a penalty of not more than $1,000 for each such
offense. Each day on which such an offense occurs shall be deemed
a separate and distinct offense.
D. Any person who knowingly makes any false statements,
representations or certifications in any application, record, report,
plan or other document filed or required to be maintained pursuant
to this Part or wastewater discharge permit, or who falsifies,
tampers with or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring
device or method required under this Part shall be subject to
prosecution or other legal action as provided herein or as otherwise
may be provided by local and/or state and federal law.
E. In addition to civil and criminal liability, the industrial user
violating any of the provisions of this Part, wastewater discharge
§ 305 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 305
1:357
permit or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or
causing damage to or otherwise adversely affecting the operation
of the Borough of Quakertown POTW shall be liable to the Borough
of Quakertown for any expense, loss or damage caused by such
violation or discharge. The Borough of Quakertown shall bill the
industrial user for the costs incurred by the Borough of
Quakertown for any cleaning, repair, monitoring, sampling,
supervision or replacement work caused by the violations or
discharge. Refusal to pay the assessed costs shall constitute a
separate violation of this Part.
F. The remedies provided for in this Part are not exclusive. The
Borough may take any, all or any combination of these actions
against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment
violations will generally be in accordance with the Borough's
enforcement response plan; however, the Borough may take any
action against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further,
the Borough Manager is empowered to take more than one
enforcement action against any noncompliant user.
3. Right of Appeal.
A. Industrial user may appeal to the Borough: (i) the terms or
conditions of a wastewater discharge permit; (ii) the denial of
issuance of a wastewater discharge permit; (iii) the revocation or
suspension of a wastewater discharge permit or (iv) a notice of
violation. An appeal is subject to the following requirements:
(1) The appeal must be made in writing to the Borough.
(2) The appeal must be served on the Borough within 30 calendar
days from the date of the industrial user's receipt of notice of
the action being.
(3) The appeal must state the specific provision(s) of a wastewater
discharge permit or the specific directions or actions of the
Borough which are being contested. The representative may
make a decision on a request for a stay of permit conditions,
granting, granting with conditions or denying such a request,
pending the hearing of the appeal, and such decision
constitutes final agency action on the matter.
(4) The appeal must state the reasons for the appeal of each
provision, direction or action.
(5) The appeal may suggest alternate or revised provisions or
actions to replace those appealed.
(6) An appeal of a wastewater discharge permit may include a
request to stay specific permit conditions pending the outcome
of the appeal. Any such request shall include all factual and
legal justification for such a request.
§ 305 QUAKERTOWN CODE § 305
1:358
B. Provisions specifically mandated by federal or state regulations
(e.g., compliance with categorical standards) shall not be appealed.
Conditions which, in the opinion of the Borough, would constitute a
hazard or pose a potential threat of pollution if stayed, shall not be
stayed during an appeal.
C. An appeal shall be made to the Borough, and shall be reviewed by
any designated representative(s) of the Borough, provided that the
representative shall not be the pretreatment coordinator. The
representative may make a decision on a request for a stay of
permit conditions, granting, granting with conditions or denying
such a request, pending the hearing of the appeal, and such
decision constitutes final agency action on the matter.
D. The representative(s) reviewing the appeal shall report in writing
to the Borough the results of the review. The report should contain,
at a minimum:
(1) A summary of each item appealed, the appellant's reasons for
appeal and the appellant's proposed remedies, if any.
(2) The finding of merit (i.e., that the appeal has merit or does not
have merit) for each point, and the reason(s) for so finding.
(3) For each point found to be with merit, a proposed remedy and a
determination that the proposed remedy is allowable under
this Part and all applicable federal, state and local rules,
regulations and laws.
E. The Borough Council, or a board appointed by the Council, shall
review the report and, at one or more regular or special public
meetings, take testimony offered by the appellant or his agent, the
reviewer, the pretreatment coordinator, the Superintendent, the
Borough Manager or other interested party. The hearing shall be
conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Local Agency
Law, 2 Pa.C.S.A. § 551, et seq. Within 15 days of the conclusion of
the hearing the Council, or the board appointed by the Council,
shall render its decision. Such a decision by Council or its
appointed board constitutes final agency action.
F. If the Borough or any hearing board appointed by the Borough shall
have as a member any person who has financial, legal or other
proprietary interest in the industrial user bringing the appeal, such
person shall recuse himself from any vote which shall determine
the decision of the body in regard to the appeal.
G. An action of the Borough for which administrative review had been
available under this section shall not be subject to administrative or
judicial review in any proceeding for enforcement.
§ 305 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 305

Part 4
GRAVITY CELLAR DRAINS AND SUMP PUMPS
§ 401. Definitions. [Ord. 1004, 7/6/1994]
The following words when used in this Part shall have the meanings
ascribed to them in this section except in those instances where the context
clearly indicates a different meaning:
ACCESS TO THE DRAINAGE SYSTEM — A situation where a portion of the
drainage system exists anywhere immediately surrounding a property. A lot
shall be considered to have access to the drainage system if any existing
storm sewer is located anywhere in front of any property's lot line.
DRAINAGE SYSTEM — That portion of the storm sewer and/or drainpipes,
gravity cellar drains and sump pump lines (unless otherwise permitted)
used with respect to any dwelling, land or tenement in conducting the
surface water from those places to its eventual outlet into a natural or
permitted watercourse.
DRAINPIPE — A pipe or series of pipes having an inside diameter of not
less than four inches or more than eight inches buried in any street or alley
in the Borough, including only that portion of the pipes extending from the

STORMWATER MANAGEMENT
A.
General Provisions.
§ 801. Short Title. [Ord. 1203,13 9/3/2014]
This Part 8 shall be known and may be cited as the "Borough of Quakertown
MS4 Stormwater Management Ordinance."

The governing body of the municipality finds that:
§ 803. Purpose. [Ord. 1203, 9/3/2014]
The purpose of this Part 8 is to promote health, safety and welfare within
the municipality and its watershed by minimizing the harms and maximizing
the benefits described in § 802 of this Part, through provisions designed to:
A. Inadequate management of accelerated runoff of stormwater resulting
from development throughout a watershed increases flows and
velocities, contributes to erosion and sedimentation, overtaxes the
carrying capacity of streams and storm sewers, greatly increases the
cost of public facilities to carry and control stormwater, undermines
floodplain management and flood-control efforts in downstream
communities, reduces groundwater recharge, threatens public health
and safety, and increases non-point-source pollution of water resources.
B. A comprehensive program of stormwater management, including
reasonable regulation of development and activities causing
accelerated runoff, is fundamental to the public health, safety, and
welfare and the protection of people of the commonwealth, their
resources, and the environment.
C. Stormwater is an important water resource, which provides
groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams,
which also protects and maintains surface water quality.
D. Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to
implement a program of stormwater controls. These municipalities are
required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their
separate storm sewer systems under the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES).
A. Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including
regulations at 25 Pa. Code Chapter 93, to protect, maintain, reclaim,

BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICE (BMP) — Activities, facilities, designs,
measures, or procedures used to manage stormwater impacts from
regulated activities, to meet state water quality requirements, to promote
groundwater recharge, and to otherwise meet the purposes of this Part 8.
Stormwater BMPs are commonly grouped into one of two broad categories
or measures: "structural" or "nonstructural." In this Part, "nonstructural
BMPs or measures" refer to operational and/or behavior-related practices
that attempt to minimize the contact of pollutants with stormwater runoff,
whereas "structural BMPs or measures" are those that consist of a physical
device or practice that is installed to capture and treat stormwater runoff.
Structural BMPs include, but are not limited to, a wide variety of practices
and devices, from large-scale retention ponds and constructed wetlands,
to small-scale underground treatment systems, infiltration facilities, filter
strips, low-impact design, bioretention, wet ponds, permeable paving,
grassed swales, riprarian or forested buffers, sand filters, detention basins,
A. Words used in the present tense include the future tense; the singular
number includes the plural, and the plural number includes the
singular; words of masculine gender include feminine gender; and
words of feminine gender include masculine gender.
B. The word "includes" or "including" shall not limit the term to the
specific example but is intended to extend its meaning to all other

adjoining floodplains that are reasonably required to carry and discharge
the one-hundred-year flood. Unless otherwise specified, the boundary of
the floodway is as indicated on maps and flood insurance studies provided
by FEMA. In an area where no FEMA maps or studies have defined the
boundary of the one-hundred-year floodway, it is assumed, absent evidence
to the contrary, that the floodway extends from the stream to 50 feet from
the top of the bank of the stream.

Stormwater Management Standards.
§ 821. General Requirements. [Ord. 1203, 9/3/2014]
1. For all regulated activities, unless preparation of an SWM site plan is
specifically exempted in § 822:
A. Preparation and implementation of an approved SWM site plan is
required.
B. No regulated activities shall commence until the municipality
issues written approval of an SWM site plan, which demonstrates
compliance with the requirements of this Part 8.
2. SWM site plans approved by the municipality, in accordance with § 836,
shall be on site throughout the duration of the regulated activity.
3. The municipality may, after consultation with DEP, approve measures
for meeting the state water quality requirements other than those in
this Part 8, provided that they meet the minimum requirements of, and
do not conflict with, state law, including, but not limited to, the Clean
Streams Law.
4. For all regulated earth disturbance activities, erosion and sediment
control BMPs shall be designed, implemented, operated, and
maintained during the regulated earth disturbance activities (e.g.,
during construction) to meet the purposes and requirements of this Part
8 and to meet all requirements under Title 25 of the Pennsylvania Code
and the Clean Streams Law. Various BMPs and their design standards
are listed in the Erosion and Sediment Pollution Control Program
Manual (E&S Manual),2 No. 363-2134-008 (March 31, 2012), as
amended and updated.
5. Impervious areas.
A. The measurement of impervious areas shall include all of the
impervious areas in the total proposed development even if
development is to take place in stages.
B. For development taking place in stages, the entire development
plan must be used in determining conformance with this Part 8.
C. For projects that add impervious area to a parcel, the total
impervious area on the parcel is subject to the requirements of this
Part 8; except that the volume controls in § 823 and the peak rate
controls of § 824 do not need to be retrofitted to existing
impervious areas that are not being altered by the proposed
regulated activity.
6. Stormwater flows onto adjacent property shall not be created,
increased, decreased, relocated, or otherwise altered without written
§ 821 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 821
1:435
notification of the adjacent property owner(s) by the developer. Such
stormwater flows shall be subject to the requirements of this Part 8.
7. All regulated activities shall include such measures as necessary to:
A. Protect health, safety and property.
B. Meet the water quality goals of this Part 8 by implementing
measures to:
(1) Minimize disturbance to floodplains, wetlands, and wooded
areas.
(2) Maintain or extend riparian buffers.
(3) Avoid erosive flow conditions in natural flow pathways.
(4) Minimize thermal impacts to waters of this commonwealth.
(5) Disconnect impervious surfaces by directing runoff to pervious
areas, wherever possible.
C. To the maximum extent practicable, incorporate the techniques for
low-impact development practices described in the Pennsylvania
Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual (BMP Manual).1
8. The design of all facilities over karst shall include an evaluation of
measures to minimize adverse effects.
9. Infiltration BMPs should be spread out, made as shallow as practicable,
and located to maximize use of natural on-site infiltration features while
still meeting the other requirements of this Part 8.
10. Normally dry, open-top, storage facilities should completely drain both
the volume control and rate control capacities over a period of time not
less than 24 and not more than 72 hours from the end of the design
storm.
11. The design storm volumes to be used in the analysis of peak rates of
discharge should be obtained from the Precipitation-Frequency Atlas to
the United States, Atlas 14, Volume 2, Version 3.0, United States
Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA), National Weather Service,
Hydrometeorological Design Studies Center, Silver Spring, Maryland.
NOAA's Atlas 145 can be accessed at: http://hdsc.nws.noaa.gov/hdsc/
pfds/.
12. For all regulated activities, SWM BMPs shall be designed,
implemented, operated and maintained to meet the purposes and
requirements of this Part 8 and to meet all requirements under Title 25
of the Pennsylvania Code, the Clean Streams Law, and the Storm Water
Management Act.18

§ 822. Exemptions. [Ord. 1203, 9/3/2014]
§ 823. Volume Controls. [Ord. 1203, 9/3/2014]
The low-impact development practices provided in the BMP Manual1 shall
be utilized for all regulated activities to the maximum extent practicable.
Water volume controls shall be implemented using the Design Storm
Method in Subsection A or the Simplified Method in Subsection B below.
For regulated activity areas equal to or less than one acre that do not
require hydrologic routing to design the stormwater facilities, this Part 8
establishes no preference for either methodology; therefore, the applicant
may select either methodology on the basis of economic considerations, the
intrinsic limitations on applicability of the analytical procedures associated
with each methodology, and other factors.
13. Various BMPs and their design standards are listed in the BMP Manual.1
1. Regulated activities that result in cumulative earth disturbances less
than one acre are exempt from the requirements in §§ 823 and 824 and
Subpart 8D of this Part.
2. Agricultural activity is exempt from the SWM site plan preparation
requirements of this Part, provided the activities are performed
according to the requirements of 25 Pa. Code Chapter 102.
3. Forest management and timber operations are exempt from the SWM
site plan preparation requirements of this Part, provided the activities
are performed according to the requirements of 25 Pa. Code Chapter
102.
4. Exemptions from any provisions of this Part 8 shall not relieve the
applicant from the requirements in § 821, Subsections 4 through 11.
5. The municipality may deny or revoke any exemption pursuant to this
section at any time for any project that the municipality believes may
pose a threat to public health and safety or the environment.
A. The Design Storm Method (CG-1 in the BMP Manual1) is applicable to
any size of regulated activity. This method requires detailed modeling
based on site conditions.
(1) Do not increase the post-development total runoff volume for all
storms equal to or less than the two-year, twenty-four-hour
duration precipitation.
(2) For modeling purposes:
(a) Existing (predevelopment) nonforested pervious areas must be
considered meadow in good condition.
18.Editor's Note: See 32 P.S. § 680.1 et seq.
§ 821 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 823
1:437
§ 824. Rate Controls. [Ord. 1203, 9/3/2014]
(b) Twenty percent of existing impervious area, when present,
shall be considered meadow in good condition in the model for
existing conditions.
B. The Simplified Method (CG-2 in the BMP Manual1) provided below is
independent of site conditions and should be used if the Design Storm
Method is not followed. This method is not applicable to regulated
activities greater than one acre or for projects that require design of
stormwater storage facilities. For new impervious surfaces:
(1) Stormwater facilities shall capture at least the first two inches of
runoff from all new impervious surfaces.
(2) At least the first one inch of runoff from new impervious surfaces
shall be permanently removed from the runoff flow, i.e., it shall not
be released into the surface waters of this commonwealth. Removal
options include reuse, evaporation, transpiration, and infiltration.
(3) Wherever possible, infiltration facilities should be designed to
accommodate infiltration of the entire permanently removed
runoff; however, in all cases at least the first 0.5 inch of the
permanently removed runoff should be infiltrated.
(4) This method is exempt from the requirements of § 824, Rate
Controls.
1. Areas not covered by a release rate map from an approved Act 167
stormwater management plan:
Post-development discharge rates shall not exceed the predevelopment
discharge rates for the one-, two-, five-, ten-, twenty-five-, fifty- and
one-hundred-year, twenty-four-hour storms. If it is shown that the peak
rates of discharge identified by the post-development analysis are less
than or equal to the peak rates of discharge indicated by the
predevelopment analysis for one-, two-, five-, ten-, twenty-five-, fiftyand
one-hundred-year, twenty-four-hour storms, then the requirements
of this section have been met. Otherwise, the applicant shall provide
additional controls as necessary to satisfy the peak rate of discharge
requirement.
2. Areas covered by a release rate map from an approved Act 167
stormwater management plan:
For the one-, two-, five-, ten-, twenty-five-, fifty- and one-hundred-year
storms, the post-development peak discharge rates will follow the
applicable approved release rate maps. For any areas not shown on
the release rate maps, the post-development discharge rates shall not
exceed the predevelopment discharge rates.

authority of that Act shall, during the time such duplication of the tax
exists, except as hereinafter otherwise provided, be 1/2 of the rate, and
such 1/2 shall become effective without any action on the part of the
Borough; provided, however, that the Borough and any other political
subdivision which impose such tax on the same person or transfer may
agree that, instead of limiting their respective rates to 1/2 of the rate
herein provided, they will impose respectively different rates, the total

child, between brother or sister or spouse of a brother or sister, and

Part 2
EARNED INCOME AND NET PROFITS
§ 201. Levy of Tax. [Ord. 1096, 3/3/2004, § 201]
A tax for general revenue purposes at the rate as approved by the Council
of the Borough of Quakertown is hereby imposed on:
§ 202. Definitions. [Ord. 1096, 3/3/2004, § 202]
The following words and phrases used in the tax ordinances and resolutions
and in this Part have the following meanings, unless the context clearly
indicates a different meaning:
ASSESSMENT — The determination by a local taxing authority of the
amount of underpayment by a taxpayer.
ASSOCIATION — A partnership, limited partnership or any other
unincorporated group of two or more persons.
BUSINESS — An enterprise, activity, profession or any other undertaking of
an unincorporated nature conducted for profit or ordinarily conducted for

COVENANT NOT TO COMPETE — A type of nonactivity; when one party
promises to compensate another party to refrain from working in a certain
business or profession within a limited geographic region for a certain
period of time. A covenant not to compete is not comparable to income from
the sale of goodwill, nor can it be considered investment income, for the
payments are directly dependent upon the conduct of the person receiving
the payments.
CURRENT YEAR — The calendar year for which the tax is being levied.
DOMICILE — The place where one lives and has his or her permanent home
and to which he or she has the intention of returning whenever he or she
is absent. Actual residence is not necessarily domicile, for domicile is the
fixed place of abode which, in the intention of the taxpayer, is permanent
A. Earned income/compensation earned by residents of the Borough of
Quakertown.
B. Earned income/compensation earned by nonresidents of the Borough of
Quakertown for work done or services performed or rendered in the
Borough.
C. The net profits earned from the operation of businesses, professions or
other activities, except corporations, regardless of location by residents

rather than transitory. Domicile is the voluntarily fixed place of habitation
of a person, not for a mere special or limited purpose, but with the present
intention of making a permanent home, until some event occurs to induce
him or her to adopt some other permanent home. In the case of businesses
or associations, the domicile is that place considered as the center of
business affairs and the place where its functions are discharged.
EARNED INCOME — Compensation as determined under Section 303 of
the Act of March 4, 1971 (P.L. 6, No.2), known as the "Tax Reform Code of
1971," and regulations in 61 Pa. Code, Part I, Subpart B, Article V (relating
to personal income tax). Employee business expenses are allowable
deductions as determined under Article III of the Tax Reform Code of 1971.
The amount of any housing allowance provided to a member of the clergy
shall not be taxable as earned income. See § 248 for referenced act and
regulations.
EMPLOYEE — A person employed by an employer on a salary, wage,
commission or other compensation basis; any person who renders services
to another for financial consideration or its equivalent, under an express or
implied contract, and who is under the control and direction of the latter,
and shall include temporary, provisional, casual or part-time employment.
EMPLOYER — A person, partnership, association, corporation, institution,
governmental body or unit or agency, or any other entity employing one or
more persons for a salary, wage, commission or other compensation.
GENERAL PARTNER — One of two or more persons who associate to carry
on a business as co-owners for profit and who are personally liable for all
the debts of the partnership.
INACTIVITY — Defined as doing nothing; generally weak and dissipating.

designated by the governing body to collect and administer the tax on
earned income/compensation and net profits.
INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR — A person who, while performing services
for another person, is not subject to the direction and control of another
person, as to the result to be accomplished by the work and as to the
details and means by which that result is accomplished, such as authors,
seamstresses, laundresses, tailors and registered or practical nurses.
Where the independent contractor is in the permanent or part-time
employment of an employer, however, that contractor will be considered an
employee of said employer for the purpose of withholding the tax due under
the ordinances and resolutions.
IRC — The Internal Revenue Code, as amended from time to time.
LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY or COMPANY — An association that is a
limited liability company organized and existing under Pa. Act 106 of 1994,
known as the “Limited Liability Company Act,” or organized and existing
under a similar act of another state or commonwealth.
LIMITED PARTNERSHIP — A type of partnership comprised of one or more
general partners who manage the business and who are personally liable
§ 202 QUAKERTOWN CODE § 202
1:468
for partnership debts, and one or more limited partners who take no part in
running the business and who incur no liability for partnership obligations
beyond the contribution they invested in the partnership.
LOCAL TAXING AUTHORITY — A political subdivision levying an eligible
tax. The term shall include any officer, agent, agency, clerk, income tax
officer, employee or other person to whom the governing body has assigned
responsibility for the audit, assessment, determination or administration
of an eligible tax. The term shall not include a tax collector or collection
agency that has no authority to audit a taxpayer or determine the amount of
eligible tax or whose only responsibility is to collect an eligible tax on behalf
of the Borough Council.
NET PROFITS — The net income from the operation of a business,
profession or other activity, except corporations, determined under
Section 303 of the Act of March 4, 1971 (P.L. 6, No. 2), known as the "Tax
Reform Code of 1971," and regulations in 61 Pa. Code, Part 1, Subpart
B, Article V (relating to personal income tax). The term does not include
income which is not paid for services provided and which is in the nature
of earnings from an investment. For taxpayers engaged in the business,
profession or activity of farming, the term shall not include:
NET LOSSES — The Pennsylvania Supreme Court has ruled that the tax
is levied on the total earned income/compensation and net profits as two
separate and distinct classes of income. Taxpayers may deduct proper,
permitted business losses from wage and salary income. However, the Court
let stand a prior Commonwealth Court decision that taxpayers may not
apply the net losses of one business against the net profits of another
business. Liability for earned income/compensation taxes on net profits is
to be calculated for each business separately. (Aronson v City of Pittsburgh,
485 A2nd 890; Pa. Cmwlth Court, 1985).
NONACTIVITY — Deliberately refraining from doing something; it is the
positive absence of activity as affirmative restraint. Each day throughout a
certain time period, the taxpayer is under a duty to refrain from working in
that profession or business. Performance under a "covenant not to compete"
is deliberate and purposeful nonactivity; and while inactivity is generally
weak and dissipating, nonactivity can be just as powerful as activity.
Example: A "covenant not to compete" is so important in our society that
courts may even enforce them by issuing injunctions — a rare civil remedy
— in addition to awarding monetary damages.
Any interest generated from monetary accounts or investment
instruments of the farming business.
A.
B. Any gain on the sale of farming machinery.
Any gain on the sale of livestock held 12 months or more for draft,
breeding or dairy purposes.
C.
D. Any gain on the sale of other capital assets of the farm.

E. By the center of his or her affairs appearing to be there.
§ 202 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 203
1:471
§ 204. What Is Taxed. [Ord. 1096, 3/3/2004, § 204]
Normally it is not difficult to determine the domicile of a person
because most of the determining factors point to one conclusion.
Obviously, if a person has all of the foregoing factors occurring
in one district, he or she is a resident of that district. Of more
difficulty is the situation concerning persons for whom some of
the factors occur in one district and others take place elsewhere.
In such cases, the residence or domicile of an individual shall
be determined by the Officer based on all of the legally relevant
factors which affect the issue. Each case shall be determined
solely on its own facts.
3. Effective July 1, 2003, by virtue of the ordinances and resolutions
adopted by the Borough of Quakertown, the tax rate is 1 1/2% unless or
until the tax rate is amended in the respective ordinances and
resolutions or by any act passed or amended by the Pennsylvania
General Assembly.
1. The tax is imposed on earned income/compensation and net profits, as
both are defined in § 202. These items are subject to the tax whether a
taxpayer received them directly or through an agent. Where the
taxpayer has received remuneration, a portion of which is attributable
to services rendered ("the earnings component") and another portion of
which is not attributable to services rendered, then only "the earnings
component" shall be subject to the tax.
2. The earned income/compensation and net profits tax levied under Act
511, as amended, and enacted by the ordinances and resolutions of the
Borough of Quakertown shall be applicable to earned income/
compensation received and net profits earned in the period beginning
January 1 and ending December 31 of each year, or in the fiscal year of
taxpayers electing a fiscal year basis under § 221, Subsection 2. The tax
shall continue in force on a calendar-year or taxpayer-fiscal-year basis,
without annual reenactment, unless the rate of tax is subsequently
changed. Changes in the rate shall become effective on the date
specified in the ordinances or resolutions.
3. Trusts or Estates. Every estate or trust must pay the tax:
A. On net profits resulting from its engagement in any business, trade
or other activity which would require the filing of a return by an
individual or partnership.
B. On income which would be subject to the tax if received by an
individual or partnership.
§ 203 QUAKERTOWN CODE § 205
1:472
§ 205. What Is Included in Earned Income/Compensation. [Ord.
1096, 3/3/2004, § 205]
The statutory definitions of earned income/compensation and net profits
can be found in § 202. The purpose of this section is not to modify these
definitions but to provide additional clarification through various examples
and explanations. The examples of earned income/compensation listed
below, without intending in any way to limit the provisions of the ordinances
or resolutions to these examples, are:
A. Gross salaries.
B. Gross wages.
C. Commissions.
D. Bonuses.
E. Drawing accounts reported on the current year's Form W-2. (If amounts
received as a drawing account exceed the salary or commissions
earned, the tax is payable on the amounts received. If the employee
subsequently repays to the employer any amounts not in fact earned,
the tax shall be adjusted accordingly.)
F. Clergy pay.
G. Incentive payments. Payments received from employers or on behalf of
employers, other than the usual compensation, for the purpose of
inducing the employee to make a decision — such as buying out an
agreement or contract or moving to another location or accepting an
early retirement or "golden parachute settlement" are incentive
payments. Such payments/settlements constitute taxable income.
Incentive payments are not to be considered "retirement" payments.
Lump-sum payments shall be taxed in the year received by the
employee or former employee. If the payment/settlement of such sums
is to be made in the future, such sums shall be taxed in the year they are
received. Incentive payments include stock appreciation rights (SAR)
and/or a phantom stock plan payment, where these payments are
attributable to remuneration for services rendered.
§ 205 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 205
1:473
Example: Employer offers to give Employee F an incentive payment of
$20,000 if Employee F agrees to depart or retire before his scheduled
date. The $20,000 is to be paid at the rate of $5,000 per year over a
four-year period after the retirement become effective. The $20,000 is
taxable income. It will be taxed in the years it is received by Employee
F. That is to say that Employee F shall have to include as earned
income/compensation the extra $5,000 received for/in each of the four
years following his retirement.
Example: The employee has been a product manager with an art
supply business for 12 years. He and his wife have purchased a home
in the suburbs of Houston for $80,000, $55,000 of which they financed
through a loan from their bank. The lending rate for the home
mortgage was 6% and their mortgage payments were $520 per month.
Twelve years after purchasing the house, he was offered a transfer
to Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, to open a sales office and showroom in
Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. His employer agreed to reimburse him for
his moving expenses if he took the assignment. When he and his
wife traveled here to look for a new residence, they were told that
a comparable home in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, would be $130,000
and that the mortgage rate would be 8.5%. The mortgage on their
new home would be $952. His employer was willing to pay the $432
difference between his old and new mortgage for two years. This form
of reimbursement is wages to the employee, subject to the earned
income/compensation and payroll tax withholding.
Example: In an SAR plan, the employee-participant is allowed to share
in the appreciation in value of the company stock plan. The employee
shares in the appreciation in value of the company stock plan over the
period selected.
In a phantom stock plan, the employee shares in the appreciation and
is also given the value of the stock at the starting point.
In each of these plans, the employee is not the owner of any shares.
By agreement the employee participates in the growth of the business'
value through a formula that measures the growth in value of the
company's stock. The employee is credited on paper with a percentage
of the growth in value, which value is convertible to cash at a future
date. The employee will be taxed on the date in the future that he or
she receives the cash benefit.
Example: An employer offers and pays an employee 15% on a house
purchased in another location in lieu of the employer acquiring the
employee's and becoming responsible for selling the house. This type
of circumstance shall be considered as an incentive for the employee to
move to another location. If the payment is restricted or imperfect with
a qualified right to enter (confined, temporary, modified, conditioned,
limited provisional, guarded, ambiguous, reserved, dependent,
defined), it shall not be taxable as earned income/compensation.
§ 205 QUAKERTOWN CODE § 205
1:474
The employee is responsible for providing proper documentation to the
Borough of Quakertown so as to establish whether this payment is or
is not restricted.
Moving expenses which are permitted on Pennsylvania Schedule UE
will be deducted.
Example: Auto manufacturers' incentive payments paid by or on behalf
of any automobile manufacturer, whether directly to individual
salespersons or through a dealership, are taxable for local earned
income/compensation tax purposes.
H. Tips and gratuities; honoraria; financial consulting services allowance;
travel allowance; moving allowance; mortgage differential; legal
service allowance; grossed up income; reimbursements received in
cash, when in excess of actual allowable business expenses. See § 211
for deductions against income.
I. Fees include: administrator fee, director fee, executor fee, expert
witness fee, fiduciary fee, honoraria fee (if one's profession is being a
professional speaker), trustee fee, any fee received for service
performed by the taxpayer and fees received for decisions made by the
taxpayer. The fees referenced herein involve activity and participation
on the part of the taxpayer.
J. Earnings component of stock option plans when the option is exercised.
The earnings component is considered to be the difference between the
stock option price and the fair market value of the stock at the time the
option is exercised.
Example: There is basis under the Local Tax Enabling Act for taxing
the earnings component of stock option plans. Stock option plans have
an earnings component, namely the difference between the option
price and the fair market value of the stock when the option is
exercised. The difference (the earnings component) is to be reported
on the taxpayer's W-2 Form and is taxable for local earned income/
compensation tax purposes, upon the exercise of the stock option.
The Pennsylvania Supreme Court, in its February 22, 2000, decision
in the Marchlen case, makes no distinction between qualified and
nonqualified stock option plans. The case site is: Louis Thomas
Marchlen, Appellee vs. the Township of Mt Lebanon, al, No. 7 W.D.,
Appeal Docket 1998 (707 A2nd 631, Pa. Cmwlth 1998).
§ 205 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 205
1:475
"At the time that the stock options in this case were granted to
Appellee, they could not be exercised. This does not imply that the
stock options have no value at the time they are granted. Stock options
are valuable inducements to attract and retain employees and to
compensate them for their services. The holder of a stock option can
reap the benefits of stock price increases without bearing the risks of
stock price declines. However, at the time the stock option is granted,
its "value" is purely speculative, for should the fair market value of
the stock drop below the purchase price of the option, the exercise of
the option on or after its maturity date would result in a loss to the
holder of the option — i.e., the option would be worthless. In contrast,
should the fair market value of the stock rise above the purchase price
of the option, the exercise of the option on or after its maturity date
would result in a gain to the holder of the option. Further, the holder
of the stock option may well choose not to exercise the option. Thus,
it is not that stock options have no value at the time they are granted,
rather, the value of the stock option is speculative and not readily
ascertainable until exercised. It is precisely for this reason that the
taxing authority must wait until the exercise of the stock option to
compute the associated tax liability (emphasis added)."
This says nothing about qualified vs. nonqualified plans. This says that
all stock options without differentiation are taxable when exercised. It
makes no difference whether the plans are qualified or not.
The only limitation imposed by Marchlen is, ". . . that the taxing
authority must wait until the exercise of the stock option to compute
the associated tax liability."
Employers have the obligation to withhold the local earned income/
compensation tax on the earnings component of the stock options at
the time the options are exercised. Employers should also report "the
earnings component" as part of the local wages total on the employee's
W-2 form.
K. Payments accruing from employment, including but not limited to
salary advances, annual leave, standby pay, overtime, vacation, holiday,
sickness, and severance or separation pay or benefits; excluding,
however, benefits referred to in § 207, Subsection 1A.
L. Fair market value of noncash fringe benefits accruing by virtue of
employment recognized as taxable by the Pennsylvania Department of
Revenue are also to be included as taxable earned income/
compensation, unless they are specifically listed in § 207 as exclusions
from earned income/compensation.
Examples: (taxable noncash fringe benefits):
(1) Stock options.
(2) Group legal services plans.
(3) Mortgage assistance in lieu of other compensation.
§ 205 QUAKERTOWN CODE § 205
1:476
(4) Noncash payment for services rendered.
(5) Stock bonus plans.
(6) Automobile allowance that exceeds actual expenses incurred.
(7) Taxpayer A receives a salary of $70,000. In addition to this salary,
Taxpayer A has exercised a nonqualified stock option, as reported
on Form W-2, of $11,000 and was compensated for spouse's travel
expenses in the amount of taxable noncash fringe benefits of
$3,100. Therefore, Taxpayer A's total taxable compensation is
$84,100.
(8) Taxpayer B receives a salary of $55,000, of which $9,000 is
deferred to a 401(k) plan for retirement. Taxpayer B's local taxable
earned income/compensation is $55,000. Any plan which serves to
reduce gross taxable wages for federal income tax purposes is not
recognized as an exclusion for earned income/compensation tax
purposes.
(9) Taxpayer C is a minister, employed by a church, but he does not live
in a church-provided parsonage. Taxpayer C receives a salary of
$30,000, a housing allowance of $10,000, and a car/travel expense
allowance of $3,000. The total taxable compensation is $33,000. To
claim unreimbursed business expenses associated with the car/
travel allowance, Taxpayer C can file a Pennsylvania Department of
Revenue Schedule UE as a deduction from the taxable
compensation. If necessary, a copy of Federal Form 2106 may be
required to substantiate the Pennsylvania Schedule UE amounts.
(10) Taxpayer D has recently moved into the Borough of Quakertown. In
addition to a salary of $43,000, Taxpayer D received $10,000 in
moving expense reimbursements from his/her employer. The total
taxable compensation for Taxpayer D is $53,000. Taxpayer D can
file a Pennsylvania Department of Revenue Schedule UE for moving
expenses in excess of the reimbursed amount. Federal Form 3903
must accompany the Schedule UE.
M. Taxes assumed by the employer for the employee. The payment of taxes
by an employer on behalf of an employee in consideration for services
rendered by the employee is a gain derived by the employee for his or
her labor and is therefore considered to be a part of his or her earned
income/compensation. The payment of taxes for an employee is taxable
in the year the taxes were paid and reported and must be reported on
the employee's W-2 or a similar form.
N. Regular wages or other compensation received during a period of
sickness or disability.
O. Employee contributions to deferred compensation plans and old age or
retirement benefit programs or cafeteria plans.
§ 205 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 205
1:477
NOTE ON CAFETERIA PLANS. Any plan which, through an employee's
contribution, serves to reduce gross taxable wages for federal income
tax purposes is not recognized as an exclusion for the tax and will
therefore be taxed accordingly.
Example: An employee's contribution/deferment under § 403(b),
§ 457(b) or § 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code will not be
recognized as a reduction of taxable wages for purposes of this tax.
P. Value of meals and lodging furnished by employers to domestics or
other employees, unless provided for the convenience of the employer
on the employer's premises. When lodging is provided by the employer
to the employee, and the employee is not required:
(1) To reside on his or her employer's premises by the employer, or
(2) By the employer to reside temporarily at a location other than the
employer's premises as a requirement of the employee's position
and/or employment: then the fair market value of the employer
supplied meals and lodging shall be included in the employee's
earned income/compensation as it shall be taxable.
Q. Scholarships, stipends, grants and fellowships shall be taxed as earned
income/compensation, if services are rendered in connection therewith.
See Appendix, § 601, 61 Pa. Code § 101.6, Compensation (b), for
determining whether scholarships, stipends, grants and fellowships are
taxable.
R. National Guard pay, Military Reserve pay and other such earned
income/compensation derived from the United States Government for
active duty outside the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as a member of
its armed forces, as determined to be taxable compensation by the
Pennsylvania Department of Revenue.
S. Premature profit distributions not rolled over into a qualified pension
plan, individual retirement account or an annuity plan.
T. Premature withdrawal or early distribution from retirement or pension
plan, on the contributions not taxed when earned. This can include
employer contributions, interest earned and employee contributions
actually received by the taxpayer from a regular IRA or from a Roth
IRA, to the extent that such employer and/or employee contributed
portion of the principal being withdrawn was not previously taxed for
local earned income/compensation tax, unless the premature principal
withdrawal is rolled over without passing to the taxpayer. The taxpayer
should use the cost recovery method of accounting to determine the
taxable portion of only the previously not taxed principal which the
employer contributed.
U. Cafeteria plan money, credits and cash reimbursements made by an
employer to an employee for dependent care, legal services or other
personal services. A cafeteria or flexible benefit plan is one in which an
§ 205 QUAKERTOWN CODE § 205
1:478
employee may choose from a package of employer-provided fringe
benefits, some of which may be taxable and some of which may be
nontaxable. Employer contributions to a cafeteria plan or flexible
benefit plan are included in gross compensation only to the extent the
employee has elected taxable benefits. Generally, a plan that provides
for deferred compensation is not a cafeteria plan. However, certain
profit sharing or stock bonus plans, and certain life insurance plans
can be offered through a cafeteria plan even though they provide for
deferred compensation. Where an employee has elected to participate
in a cafeteria plan or flexible benefit plan that provides for deferred
compensation, the cafeteria plan or flexible benefit plan will be
considered as taxable compensation for earned income/compensation
tax purposes.
V. Deferred compensation plan distribution (preretirement), to the extent
that it exceeds employee contributions into the plan. Distributions
received prior to the taxpayer's actual date of retirement, including but
not limited to ESOP, PAYSOP, 401k, 403b, cafeteria plans, etc., shall be
taxable on the interest and employer's contributed portion if the
distribution is not rolled into an individual retirement account, annuity
plan or another qualified retirement plan.
W. That portion of salary or wages which an employee contributes under a
plan which provides for an employee's election to contribute a portion
of his or her salary or wages to receive a benefit in lieu of receiving the
cash is taxable. The actual amount the employee elects not to receive in
cash is the amount which is taxable and shall be included as gross
salary or wages when filing the final individual tax return with the
Borough of Quakertown, as the employee has constructive control of
the cash. The amount is to be included in the W-2 total for local wages
and the applicable earned income/compensation tax is also to be
withheld on this portion of the employees gross salary or wages.
X. Back pay awards when the payment represents salary, wages,
commissions, bonuses, incentive payments, fees, tips or other
compensation to which the employee is entitled for services rendered is
taxable. However, back pay and retroactive wage increases which have
been proven to constitute punitive damages are generally not taxable.
Y. All other forms of earned income/compensation or remuneration for an
employee's services rendered, whether this compensation is received
directly or through an agent and whether it is paid in cash, property, or
services. This shall include prizes and awards when the recipient has
rendered substantial service as a condition to receive the prize or
award. The manner of employment, or the rate of payment, or the kind
of payment will not cause the person to be exempt from the applicable
tax. Compensation received in the form of property shall be taxed at its
fair market value at the time of receipt. Neither the kind nor the rate of
payment, nor the manner of employment exempts an employee from the
tax.

§ 206. What Is Included in Net Profits. [Ord. 1096, 3/3/2004, § 206]
Z. Covenants not to compete which arise "within an employment
relationship," such as when an employee signs a covenant not to
compete with his or her employer if and when he or she is no longer
employed. In such a case, the consideration for the agreement is usually
provided at the time the agreement is executed; often consists of the
employment itself. To the extent that explicit compensation is provided
to the employee during his or her employment, such compensation shall
be taxable as earned income/compensation. See Rauch v Philadelphia,
708 A.2d 142 (Pa. Cmwlth 1998)
AA. Termination or severance pay received by the taxpayer.
BB. Golden parachute payments.
CC. Taxpayer payments received in the form of "debt forgiveness" as
payment of compensable services provided by the taxpayer are taxable.
DD. Deceased taxpayer's earned income/compensation and net profits from
self-employment.
EE. Guaranteed payments received by individual partners of a partnership
are to be included on the individual taxpayer's Pennsylvania RK-1 form.
1. The statutory definitions of "net profits" can be found in § 202,
Definitions. The purpose of this section is not to modify this definition
but to provide additional clarification through various examples and
explanations. This list of examples and explanations is not exhaustive
and in no way limits what constitutes taxable profits.
2. Net profits shall be determined on a cash or accrual basis in accordance
with accepted accounting principles and practices but without
deduction of taxes based on income.
3. Persons, activities and property are subject to the tax on net profits.
Partnership income which is the net income from business, profession
or farming, including guaranteed payments is taxable.
4. Persons are subject to the tax on net profits. Any individual engaged in
a business, trade, profession or other activity carried on for a profit
shall pay the tax on the net profits therefrom. The form of business shall
not be the determining factor.
5. Examples of net profits (without intending in any way to limit the
provisions of the ordinances or resolutions to these examples) are:
A. The net profits of a business, profession or farm conducted by a
sole proprietor.
B. The net profits of a business, profession or farm conducted as a
partnership.
§ 205 QUAKERTOWN CODE § 206
1:480
C. Royalties and patent or copyright fees received by authors,
composers, inventors and other such individuals.
D. The net profits of a limited liability company as reference in Act 106
of 1994, known as the “Limited Liability Company Act, § 8925.”
E. Net profits from the operation of hotels, motels, trailer camps,
tourist homes, boarding houses, bed-and-breakfast establishments,
mobile home parks, child care, adult care, day care and other
similar businesses.
F. Net profits from the business of renting personal property.
G. Real estate rental net profits reported on Pennsylvania Schedule C,
received in the course of a trade or business, are taxable. Rental
income received from the operation of real estate is subject to this
tax when the owner actively manages and supervises the property
himself or herself or through agents or servants, by providing labor
and service in connection with it. The furnishing of labor and
service signifies activity and participation on the part of the owner
and classifies him or her as carrying on a business. When any
property falls within a taxable classification the manner of its
acquisition, i.e., purchase, gift, inheritance, fiduciary, or as a
fiduciary mortgagor in possession, etc., does not affect the
taxability of the income derived therefrom, unless specifically
stated otherwise in this Part.
H. All other net profits of business activities except any portion
thereof resulting from items not taxed under the provisions of the
ordinances or resolutions as set forth in § 207 hereof. In
calculations utilized to determine the correct net profits, the
following items are to be included, as they shall be considered to be
a part or component of business income:
(1) Interest received on credit sales.
(2) Interest received on working capital.
(3) Interest earned on withheld employee taxes.
(4) Discounts received from Pennsylvania Department of Revenue
for timely remittance of sales tax.
(5) Damages, awards and or settlements received, except for
personal injury cases. Both punitive and compensatory
damages, awards and/or settlements received in personal
injury cases are excluded when physical injury or sickness has
occurred. Punitive damages, awards and/or settlements
received in personal injury cases where no physical sickness or
injury has occurred, such as defamation of character actions, is
taxable income for determining net profits.
§ 206 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 206
1:481
§ 207. Exclusions From Tax. [Ord. 1096, 3/3/2004, § 207]
I. In determining net profits subject to tax under the provisions of the
ordinances and resolutions, the net profit of each business activity
is to be determined separately with reference only to the gross
income and expenses of that business and without mixing the
income of one activity with the expenses of another. Persons
engaged in more than one business activity during the tax year may
not offset a loss in one activity against the gain in another. The tax
is imposed on the net profit of each business activity separately. A
loss incurred from a profession, business activity or venture,
regardless of the nature, may not be deducted from the net profit of
any other business activity. (See Aronson vs. City of Pittsburgh, 86
Pa. Cmwlth. 591, 485 A.2d 890 (1985).
Example: A person who receives net profits from the operation of
a sole proprietorship may not offset against such profits the net
losses incurred as a partner in another business activity.
J. Each resident partner or member of a nonresident partnership,
association or other entity must pay the tax on his or her share of
the net profits, whether or not it is actually distributed to him or
her.
K. The net profits received by a general partner of a limited
partnership entity (15 Pa. C.S.A § 8925).
L. Guaranteed payments to partners/taxpayers as reported on
Pennsylvania Schedule RK-1.
M. Covenants not to compete executed after December 31, 2001,
which involve taxpayers who are not employees. The promise not to
compete and the subsequent undertaking of that effort pursuant to
a business arrangement is sufficient to bring this item within the
purview of the net profits tax. The fact that this is a negative
covenant or rather, a promise not to do something does not remove
it from the realm of business activity which is undertaken as part
and parcel of a contract for a fee. The act of not competing is the
consideration contributed to this contract by the taxpayer. It is
consideration that has a business purpose, not a personal purpose.
N. Bonus depreciation amounts are to be calculated for local income
tax purposes in the same manner as calculated for Pennsylvania
personal income purposes and not as according to federal income
tax provisions.
1. The following income sources are not considered to be earned income/
compensation and are not subject to the tax.
A. Sickness, disability or retirement benefits paid, other than regular
wages as provided in § 205N.
§ 206 QUAKERTOWN CODE § 207
1:482
B. Benefits paid under any public assistance, unemployment or
worker's compensation legislation, including supplemental
unemployment benefits (SUB pay) or strike pay.
C. Compensation or bonuses paid by a State or by the United States
for active military service in the armed forces, as determined by the
Pennsylvania Department of Revenue to be excluded from
compensation for personal income tax purposes.
D. Death benefit payments to an employee's beneficiary or estate,
whether payable in a lump sum or otherwise.
E. Proceeds of life insurance policies or annuities.
F. Cash or property received as a gift, by will or by statutes of descent
and distribution.
G. Personal interest and dividends. (Interest earned on working
capital must be included in the calculations of net profits and may
not be deducted.) All forms of interest, i.e., on obligations of the
United States or its possessions, the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania, or any political subdivision thereof, or on any bank or
postal savings accounts, mortgages, or loans received by an
individual, except those amounts representing compensation by
virtue of being remuneration for services provided, such as those
amounts reported as "wages, salaries, tips, etc." on the appropriate
lines of the taxpayer's W-2 form.
H. All forms of dividends received by a person, except those amounts
representing earnings or compensation by virtue of being
remuneration for services provided, such as those amounts
reported as "wages, salaries, tips, etc." on the appropriate lines of
the taxpayer's W-2 form.
I. Rents derived from mere "passive" or "investment" ownership or
subleasing of real estate without the furnishing by the lessor of
services to the leased premises or to the lessee other than gas,
electricity, water, sewage and heat. Such rents are considered to be
return solely from invested capital and not profits from the
operation of a business activity taxed by the ordinances or
resolutions.
J. Value of meals and lodging furnished by the employer to domestics
or other employees for the convenience of the employer on the
employer's premises. However, when board or lodging is provided
by the employer and the employee is not required to reside on the
employer's premises by his or her employer, the fair market value
of the board or lodging shall be included in the employee's earnings
as it shall be considered to be taxable earned income/
compensation.
K. Capital gain income.
§ 207 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 207
1:483
L. Social Security benefits.
M. Veterans Administration allotments for subsistence or disability.
N. Income from pensions or old age and retirement benefit plans
received upon retirement.
O. Lottery winnings.
P. Individual retirement account (IRA) payments received upon
retirement.
Q. Profits applicable to limited partners within a limited partnership
entity.
R. A net loss on a self-employment business schedule may be deducted
only from that individual's earned income/compensation for that
tax year. A Schedule E loss will not offset earned income/
compensation as a Schedule E net profit will not be taxed.
S. S corporation net profits. This does not include compensation paid
to the officers of an S corporation, nor does this include any
salaries, wages, commissions, fees, or other compensation received
by an officer, director, stockholder or employee of an S corporation.
T. Distributions from deferred compensation plans to the extent that
such distributions represent a return of the taxpayer's own
contribution upon which he originally paid the tax.
U. Damages for personal injuries.
V. Payments received for child support and alimony.
W. Scholarships and fellowships awarded from detached generosity on
the basis of financial need or academic achievement for the sole
purpose of encouraging or allowing the recipient to further his or
her educational development and not as compensation for past,
present or future services. A scholarship or fellowship shall
constitute earned income/compensation if the recipient must apply
his or her skills and training to advance research, creative work or
some other project or activity.
X. Prizes and awards unless the recipient must render substantial
service as a condition to receiving the prize or award.
Y. Profit from the casual exchange or sale of property.
Z. Parsonage/housing/rent/utilities payments received by a member of
the clergy.
AA. Jury duty pay.
§ 207 QUAKERTOWN CODE § 207
1:484
§ 208. Resident Taxation. [Ord. 1096, 3/3/2004, § 208]
The entire earned income/compensation and net profits received and/or
earned by a resident of Borough of Quakertown is subject to this tax.
Neither the source of the earned income/compensation or net profits nor
the place where it is received and/or earned exempts a resident from the
tax.
§ 209. Nonresident Taxation. [Ord. 1096, 3/3/2004, § 209; as
amended by Ord. 1111, 4/6/2005]
§ 210. Credits. [Ord. 1096, 3/3/2004, § 210]
2. The items listed and described within this section are not to be listed as
deductions against income as they are a list of nontaxable income
sources.
1. The entire earned income/compensation and net profits received and/or
earned by a nonresident of the taxing district who is employed in the
taxing district or engaged in the operation of a business, profession or
other activity for income or profit in the taxing district, and is not
required to pay a similar tax elsewhere, is subject to this tax; provided,
however, that nonresidents are not subject to taxation by school
districts.
2. Any person claiming nonresidency status must provide proof of
nonresidency, such as a passport with a valid student or exchange
visitor's visa, a driver's license, a local tax return from his or her
resident municipality, voter registration card, or other acceptable
documentation. Any person claiming nonresidency exemption status
must provide proof of payment of the local earned income/
compensation and net profits tax elsewhere for the concurrent time
period.
3. The earned income/compensation tax, as levied on nonresidents by the
ordinances and resolutions of the Borough of Quakertown shall relate
to and is imposed at the rate of 1% upon the salaries, wages,
commissions and other compensation paid by an employer or on his or
her behalf to a person who is employed by him or her. Therefore, if an
employer has its place of business within the Borough of Quakertown
and employs an individual and all salaries, wages, etc., are paid to the
employee from said employer, then all wages, salaries, etc. are taxable
at the rate of 1%. It makes no difference that the employee spends a
significant amount of time outside of the Borough of Quakertown on
business. The critical factor is whether the salaries, wages, etc., are
paid to the employee from the employer or business located within our
taxing jurisdiction(s). If this is the case, then the tax is properly levied,
and no refunds should be issued.
1. Credit for earned income/compensation and/or net profits tax paid for
the concurrent time period to another state or political subdivision will
§ 207 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 210
1:485
be allowed as a deduction from the liability of taxpayers for tax imposed
under the provisions of the ordinances and resolutions and as provided
by Act 511. Such allowable credit will be available up to the maximum
effective rate of the tax levied by the taxing district on the identical
income and/or net profits taxed by the Borough of Quakertown and
other Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and/or another state's political
subdivisions; provided, however, that this same credit has not already
been applied towards the taxpayer's liability for the Pennsylvania
personal income tax for the same period. Evidence of the amount of
gross earnings and payments of the applicable tax on earned income/
compensation or net profits is required before this credit is allowed.
2. Examples.
A. Taxpayer G, a resident within our taxing jurisdiction, is employed or
self-employed in Philadelphia and pays the Philadelphia income tax.
Taxpayer G is entitled to a credit of up to 1.5% (the current tax rate
for the Borough of Quakertown of the earning income/
compensation and/or net profits taxed by the City of Philadelphia,
towards his or her local earned income/compensation and or net
profits tax due to the Borough of Quakertown.
Since the City of Philadelphia is a "nonreciprocating" tax district
that derives its power to levy a local income tax by virtue of
the Sterling Act at a rate higher than that allowed by the Local
Tax Enabling Act, tax paid to Philadelphia cannot be applied as a
credit to earned income/compensation and/or net profits earned
outside the City of Philadelphia, not subject to the Philadelphia
local income tax. The Borough of Quakertown will not refund the
Philadelphia local income tax paid in excess of the tax due to
Taxpayer G's resident municipality.
B. Taxpayer H, a resident within our taxing jurisdiction, is employed
or self-employed in City A in the State of Delaware, which exacts a
1.3% on his or her earned income/compensation and/or net profits.
Taxpayer H is entitled to a credit of up to 1.5% (the current tax rate
for the Borough of Quakertown of the earning income/
compensation and/or net profits taxed by City A, Delaware).
C. Taxpayer I, a resident within our taxing jurisdiction, is a partner in
a national CPA firm with offices in our taxing jurisdiction, plus
Chicago, New York and New Orleans. Taxpayer I pays taxes on
income earned in some of these cities. Taxpayer I may take credit
towards the tax using the following method:
(1) Determine the income earned in each locality during the tax
year.
$50,000 in Bethlehem
$5,000 in New York City
$15,000 in Chicago
§ 210 QUAKERTOWN CODE § 210
1:486
$10,000 in New Orleans
$80,000 gross income – all taxable locally
(2) Determine the maximum credit that can be taken for taxes paid
to the other localities.
$5,000 x 1.5% = $75
$15,000 x 1.5% = 225
$10,000 x 1.5% = $150
$450 maximum allowable credit that can be applied towards
the tax
(3) List the amount of tax paid to each locality.
$200 to New York City
$400 to Chicago
$600 to New Orleans
$1,200 total paid to other localities.
(4) Subtract from the total the credit already taken on the
Pennsylvania state return PA-40.
$1,200 total paid to other localities.
$735 credit taken on PA-40
$465 credit remaining
The maximum credit that can be applied towards the tax is
$450 – see Step (2) above. This amount $450 can be entered
on our final individual earned income tax return as an out-of
state/miscellaneous credit. If the credit remaining after Step
(4) had been less than $450, then the lesser amount would be
allowed as a credit against the tax.
3. Residents who take credit for taxes paid in other jurisdictions shall
provide the Borough of Quakertown with an exact duplicate copy of the
tax return as filed with the other taxing jurisdictions, along with an
exact duplicate copy of their Commonwealth of Pennsylvania individual
income tax return (PA-40) and any additional documentation or
schedules requested by the Income Tax Officer.
4. Residents who pay taxes to any foreign country shall not be eligible for
credits against the earned income/compensation and/or net profits tax
as a result of Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision per the March 16,
1989, opinion by Justice McDermott in the O'Reilly case, in that it was
the intention of the General Assembly to limit the application of the
credit to taxes paid to other states of these United States; for absent
clear words evincing a manifest intent we can not presume that the
§ 210 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 210
1:487
§ 211. Deductions and Losses. [Ord. 1096, 3/3/2004, § 211]
General Assembly determines politics or their consequences based on
the laws of nations or states beyond the borders of the United States.
1. Deductions.
A. Employee's Unreimbursed Business Expenses. Business expenses
for which an employee has not been reimbursed are allowed as a
deduction from earned income/compensation provided such
expenses meet the four-part test as established by the Pennsylvania
Department of Revenue. That is, the expense must be "ordinary,
actual, reasonable, and necessary" in order to be deducted from
earned income/compensation. This means that any expense
claimed as a deduction from gross earnings must be:
(1) Customary and accepted in the industry or occupation in which
the taxpayer works.
(2) Directly related to the taxpayer's present occupation as
opposed to an occupation in which he plans to enter in the
future.
(3) Reasonable in amount and not lavish or excessive.
(4) Necessary to enable the taxpayer to properly perform the
duties of his present employment.
Those expenses not meeting the four-part test are not allowed
as a deduction from earned income/compensation. The
taxpayer has the burden of proving that any expense claimed
is ordinary, actual, reasonable and necessary and must
maintain adequate and sufficient records to substantiate any
such deduction taken.
B. Examples of expenses which may not be deducted from earned
income/compensation include but are not limited to travel
(commuting) to and from work; meals and lodging unless the "away
from home overnight test" is met; capital expenditures; moving,
educational and office-in-home expenses except as allowed by the
Pennsylvania Department of Revenue; and personal expenses such
as medical, dental, life insurance premiums, contributions,
interest, other taxes, gifts and entertainment, dues to professional
or fraternal societies, club memberships, subscriptions to
publications, alimony, babysitting, books, casualty or theft losses,
license fees, clothing suitable for everyday use, employee deferred
compensation plan contributions, Federal Form 1040 tax credits
and other taxes, individual retirement account (IRA) contributions,
employee contributions to simplified employee pension plans
(SEP), federal, state or local income taxes, gift estate or inheritance
taxes and personal taxes, penalties or interest paid on delinquent
§ 210 QUAKERTOWN CODE § 211
1:488
§ 212. Allocation/Apportionment of Earned Income/Compensation
and Net Profits Tax for Nonresidents. [Ord. 1096, 3/3/2004, § 212;
as amended by Ord. 1111, 4/6/2005]
income taxes, tools for use at home, Federal Form 1040 itemized
deductions or the occupational privilege tax.
C. Employees engaged in income producing activities separate and
apart from their earned income/compensation may be permitted
necessary, ordinary, reasonable and actual expenses. However,
employees whose activities do not generate supplemental income
shall not be permitted deductions for associated expenses.
D. Business expenses as documented on Pennsylvania Department of
Revenue Schedule UE are permitted. If employee business
expenses are claimed a copy of Pennsylvania Schedule UE, and all
supporting forms, schedules and/or worksheets must be provided.
If moving expenses are claimed, a copy of Pennsylvania Schedule
UE must be provided along with the Pennsylvania Tax Form 214.
E. Should the taxpayer omit the required expense deduction form, as
well as supporting forms, schedules and worksheets, or if the
expense deduction form is not fully completed, the expense
deduction will be systematically disallowed and denied without
notification to the taxpayer.
2. Losses.
A. Taxpayers are allowed to offset a gain in one class of income
against a loss in another class of income. O'Reilly v. Fox Chapel
Area School District, 555 A.2d. 1288, 521 Pa. 471, 1989.
B. If a net loss is incurred from the operation one or more business
activities, the amount of the net loss or losses must be listed
separately (not combined with the net profit of any other business
or businesses). Aronson v. City of Pittsburgh, 485 A.2d. 890, 86 Pa.
Cmwlth. 591, 1985.
C. Losses may only be applied in the year in which the loss was
actually incurred and may not be carried forward to subsequent
years.
D. One person's losses may not be deducted from his or her spouse's
earnings.
E. S Corporation losses may not offset the earned income/
compensation or net profit of any taxpayer.
F. Losses from items or activities which are excluded from the tax
may not be used to offset earned income/compensation or net
profits.
§ 211 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 212
1:489
1. Generally. A nonresident working or self-employed within the Borough
of Quakertown, which levies a tax on nonresidents, is subject to a 1%
tax on all earned income/compensation and/or net profits for work done
or services provided or originating in or directed from within the
Borough of Quakertown.
2. Compensation Allocation. Apportionment of earned income/
compensation tax to a nonresident's earnings generated from full time
employment within the Borough of Quakertown, which taxes
nonresidents:
A. Where the Pennsylvania borough, township, city or school district
(except Philadelphia) of which the employee is a resident imposes
and collects a tax of 1% or more on earned income/compensation,
the earnings of such employee are required to be taxed by the
employer in the Borough of Quakertown. The Income Tax Officer
will collect the withheld tax and forward it to the employee's
resident municipality and/or school district of record.
B. Where the Pennsylvania borough, township, city or school district
(except Philadelphia) of which the employee is a resident imposes
and collects a tax of less than 1% on earned income/compensation,
the earned income/compensation earned within the Borough of
Quakertown shall be taxed at 1% by the employer. The Income Tax
Officer will collect the withheld tax and forward the amount of tax
imposed by the employee's resident taxing jurisdiction. Any
difference between the tax actually imposed by the employee's
resident taxing jurisdiction(s) and the amount of tax withheld will
be retained by the municipality where the employer is located.
C. Nonresidents working full-time in one or more of our taxing
jurisdictions which tax residents, by virtue of a contract of
employment on a five day per week basis (Monday through Friday)
may not exclude from his or her earned income/compensation,
compensation for days which he or she is compensated but not
required to work (i.e., Saturdays, Sundays, holidays, vacations,
etc.).
3. Nonresidents Working Part-Time in the Borough of Quakertown.
A. Where a nonresident receives earned income/compensation for
work done or services provided or originating in or directed from
within the Borough of Quakertown and additionally receives
earned income/compensation for work done or services provided or
originating in or directed from areas outside the Borough of
Quakertown, only that income attributable to Quakertown shall be
subject to the tax.
B. The Borough of Quakertown does not allow non residents employed
within its taxing jurisdiction(s) to use the "days present" method of
apportioning income. Nonresidents are taxed on total earned
§ 212 QUAKERTOWN CODE § 212
1:490
income/compensation from sources within the Borough of
Quakertown.
4. Allocation of Net Profits of Nonresidents.
A. Where the Entire Business is Transacted Within the Borough of
Quakertown. A nonresident individual conducting any business,
trade, profession, or other activity is subject to the tax on the entire
net profits thereof if the entire business is conducted or carried on
in the tax jurisdiction(s).
B. Where the Sole Store or Office is in the Borough of Quakertown. A
nonresident who maintains his or her sole store or office in the
taxing jurisdiction and transacts business both within and outside
the taxing jurisdiction is not entitled to an allocation of his or her
net profits. The business status, in such instances, is considered
transacted as flowing through the municipality/taxing jurisdiction's
store or office.
Example: A nonresident surgeon who maintains an office within
the taxing jurisdiction and no other office outside the taxing
jurisdiction would not be permitted to allocate the tax as to fees
received for surgery actually performed outside the taxing
jurisdiction. The same example would apply to an attorney who
maintains his or her sole office within the municipality.
C. When a Nonresident is Entitled to an Allocation of Net Profits. A
nonresident who, in addition to having a place of business or office
within the taxing jurisdiction, also maintains a place of business or
office outside the taxing jurisdiction shall be entitled to an
allocation of his or her net profits. Such allocation is subject to the
approval of the Tax Administrator and shall only be considered if
sufficient proof is provided that the place of business or office
outside the taxing jurisdiction is an established, self-sustaining,
bona fide branch office or store.
5. Methods of Allocation.
A. Special Allocation Formula. Where it is impossible to allocate with
certainty the net profits subject to the tax by reason of the absence
of a place of business or office within the taxing jurisdiction, or
because the nonresident taxpayer's records do not disclose a
breakdown of the actual net profits earned within the taxing
jurisdiction, or for any other reason, the Tax Administrator, upon
request, may permit the use of a special allocation formula to effect
a fair and proper apportionment so that only that portion of the net
profits attributable to the taxing jurisdiction is included in the
measure of the tax. These factors are:
(1) Real and Tangible Property Factor. The taxpayer computes a
percentage on the basis of a fraction using the total average
book value of all such property located within the taxing
§ 212 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 212
1:491
§ 213. Employers Required To Withhold. [Ord. 1096, 3/3/2004,
§ 213]
jurisdiction as the numerator, and the total average book value
of all property located within and outside the taxing
jurisdiction as the denominator.
(2) Wages and Salaries Factor. A percentage is computed on the
basis of a fraction using the total amount of wages and salaries
paid to employees who work in or from or are attached to
places of business located within the taxing jurisdiction as the
numerator, and the total wages and salaries paid to all
employees within and outside the taxing jurisdiction as the
denominator.
(3) Gross Receipts Factor. A percentage is computed on the basis
of a fraction using as the numerator gross receipts from sales
or services attributable to the taxing jurisdiction and as the
denominator all gross receipts from sales or services made
within and outside the taxing jurisdiction.
(4) Averaging. The percentages obtained for the three factors
described herein above are to be added together and the total
thereof divided by three to obtain the average of the three
percentages. If the numerator and/or the denominator of any
fraction are zero, the factor is deemed to be nonexistent and
shall be omitted in calculating the average of the percentages.
Example:
(a) Average real and tangible
personal property in the taxing
jurisdiction
$25,000
Average real and tangible
personal property within and
outside the taxing jurisdiction
$100,000 25%
(b) Wages and salaries in taxing
jurisdiction
$10,000
Wages and salaries within and
outside the taxing jurisdiction
$50,000 20%
(c) Gross receipts in taxing
jurisdiction
$75,000
Gross receipts within and outside
the taxing jurisdiction
$300,000 25%
25% + 20% + 25% = 70%, then 70% divided by 3 factors
= 23 1/3%; 23 1/3% would be the allocation percentage for
taxable net profits
§ 212 QUAKERTOWN CODE § 213
1:492
1. Every employer having an office, factory, workshop, branch, warehouse
or other place of business located within the taxing district and who
employs one or more persons (other than domestic servants in a private
home) for a salary, wage, commission or other compensation shall
deduct the tax from the employee's wage at the time of payment
thereof.
2. Fiduciary Status. Employers who withhold earned income/
compensation tax from employees, and the person responsible for the
transmission of earned income/compensation tax withheld by a
corporate employer, shall be a fiduciary charged with all the
responsibilities of a fiduciary with respect to taxes withheld and shall
be subject to all duties imposed by law on fiduciaries, including criminal
penalties for breach of duties.
3. Withholding by Employers from Musicians, Entertainers, Sports
Participants, Clergy and Domestics:
A. Musicians.
(1) In the field of professional music, there has arisen the practice
of engaging musicians exclusively through a so-called
"contractor." The practice, which arose by prescription of the
American Federation of Musicians and of local union
regulations, enables the purchaser of music to deal with only
one of the number of musicians required for a particular event
or occasion.
(2) Contractor. The term “contractor” means that individual
through whom the purchaser and the musician(s) negotiate the
contract of service and the performance thereof. The
contractor may or may not perform actual music service under
a contract which he or she has negotiated.
(3) Purchaser of Music. The person, partnership, organization or
association for whom or which the musical services are to be
performed or furnished and who exercises an employer's
control over the conduct of the musicians. Where a contract for
the purchase of music has been executed between a purchaser
and a contractor, then the musicians shall be deemed to be the
employee of the purchaser. The purchaser shall be the person
responsible for the withholding, and remittance to the Income
Tax Officer, of the tax from the wages paid to the musicians.
(4) Name Bands and Orchestras. A name band or orchestra is one
which is identified or known by a name and which holds itself
out to the public as a permanent organization, and in addition
has either (i) a fixed personnel or (ii) the individual member
musician has contracted for his or her services with the leader
or owner of the band at a fixed salary, by term or by individual
engagement, and over whom the purchaser of music has no
direct control. The leader or owner of the band shall be
§ 213 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 213
1:493
§ 214. Voluntary Withholding. [Ord. 1096, 3/3/2004, § 214]
Any employer located outside the taxing district may voluntarily withhold
the tax from employees who are residents of taxing district but are
employed outside the taxing district. Such employers assume the fiduciary
responsibilities as outlined in § 213, Subsection 2.
§ 215. Registration of Employers. [Ord. 1096, 3/3/2004, § 215]
responsible for withholding the tax from the wages paid to
members of such name bands, and remitting the withheld tax
to the Income Tax Officer.
B. Entertainers Other Than Musicians.
(1) An entertainer other than a musician is usually engaged by a
purchaser through a booking agent. The booking agent once
the contract of employment has been executed does not
exercise an employer's control over the entertainer.
(2) The owner of a club, cafe, taproom, theater or of any place
which furnishes entertainment to the public or to its patrons,
shall be deemed the person liable as an employer of
entertainers. Such employer must deduct, and remit to the
Income Tax Officer, the tax withheld from the earned income/
compensation paid to the entertainer.
C. Promoters of boxing exhibitions and other sporting events are
required to withhold the tax from the earned income/compensation
paid to the contestants engaged in the particular sporting event
(where an employer/employee relationship exists).
D. Minister, Rabbis and Clergymen. Salaries paid by organized
religious bodies to ministers, rabbis, clergymen, evangelists or
other religious workers are taxable. The organized religious body
shall withhold the tax upon such salaries and make remittance to
the Income Tax Officer.
E. Domestics. The earned income/compensation received by
domestics is taxable. The employer may, with the consent of the
domestic, withhold the tax. Where the duties of domestics require
them to live at their place of employment, board and lodging shall
not be considered as wages or salary earned.
1. Each employer withholding or required to withhold tax pursuant to
§§ 213 and 214 shall register with the Borough of Quakertown such
employer's name and address and such other information as the Officer
may require within 15 days after becoming a withholding employer.
2. All employers who have a place of business located within the taxing
district shall maintain complete records of all employees for a period of
six years in such form as to enable the Officer to determine the
§ 213 QUAKERTOWN CODE § 215
1:494
§ 216. Liability of Employee. [Ord. 1096, 3/3/2004, § 216]
Failure or omission of any employer to withhold the tax shall not relieve the
employee from payment of the tax or from complying with the requirements
relating to the filing of declarations and returns.
§ 217. Liability of Employer. [Ord. 1096, 3/3/2004, § 217]
Employers who willfully or negligently fail or omit to make the required
deductions of its employees earned income taxes shall be directly liable for
payment of the taxes which the employer was required to withhold to the
extent that such taxes have not been recovered from the employee.
§ 218. Annual Returns of Taxpayers. [Ord. 1096, 3/3/2004, § 218]
employers' liability to withhold for each employee, the amount of
taxable income for each employee, the actual amount of tax withheld,
the actual amount transmitted to the Officer and such other information
available to such employers as will enable the Officer to carry out his or
her responsibilities.
1. On or before April 15 of each year, every person who was a resident of
the taxing district who was employed or engaged in the operation of a
business, profession or other activity for income or profit or who was a
nonresident of the taxing district who is subject to this tax and who was
employed in the taxing district or engaged in the operation of a
business, profession or other activity for income or profit in the taxing
district, for all or any part of the preceding calendar year; shall file with
the Borough of Quakertown an annual tax return showing all earned
income/compensation and net profits received and/or earned for the
previous year
2. Persons residing in more than one taxing district as a result of moving
during the calendar year must file an annual tax return with the Officer
for each district in which they resided during the year. Employees have
the authority to request and receive or view a pay stub or letter from
the taxpayer's employer or employers for the applicable period of time
relevant to the tax-filing period. The pay stub or letter from the
employer should indicate the gross earnings and earned income/
compensation tax withheld for each period and taxing authority. To
facilitate tax return processing this information must accompany each
tax return when it is received. Alternatively, the taxpayer's earned
income/compensation and/or net profits for the year may be divided by
12 months and multiplied by the number of months appropriate for
each taxing jurisdiction.
3. If a person receives an annual tax return from the Borough of
Quakertown and has no earned income/compensation to report, the
word "none" shall be entered on the annual tax return, and the return
shall be signed, dated, and returned to the Borough of Quakertown with
an explanation (military service, retired, disability income only,
§ 215 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 218
1:495
unemployment compensation only, S corporation only, housewife,
unemployed student or deceased).
4. If net profits are received, the type of business, profession or activity
shall be indicated on the annual tax return and the amount of the profit
shall be shown on the appropriate line of the return. If a net loss is
incurred in the operation of one business activity, it may not be offset
against the net profit of another business activities. Losses shall be
indicated as zero in all calculations involving net profits, and zero shall
be entered on the appropriate line of the annual tax return. There shall
also be attached to the annual tax return a copy of the appropriate
Pennsylvania Tax Form PA-40 and Pennsylvania Schedules C, E, F, UE,
Pennsylvania Schedule RK-1 or Pennsylvania NRK-1 to substantiate
profits and/or losses indicated. Schedule E profits are not taxed.
Schedule E losses cannot be used to offset earned income/
compensation or other profits.
5. When a return is made for a fiscal year, the return shall be filed within
105 days from the end of said fiscal year.
6. The annual tax return shall also show the taxpayer's name, Social
Security number, address, place or places of employment or business,
the amount of tax due, the amount of credit claimed for tax withheld by
an employer (with a copy of the earnings and tax statement showing the
amount of tax withheld) and such other information as may be indicated
on the return form or as may be required by the Officer.
7. Every person subject to the tax shall file such return regardless of the
fact that his or her wages may have been subject to withholding of the
tax by his or her employer and regardless of whether or not any tax is
due.
8. At the time of filing the annual return, the taxpayer shall pay any tax
due. Total balances less than $1 need not be paid. Tax installment
contracts are available to taxpayers meeting the requirements set forth
in § 237 when approved by the Tax Administrator.
9. The annual tax return must be signed and dated by the taxpayer in the
space provided.
10. Joint filing of an annual return by husband and wife shall not be
allowed.
11. Remittances shall be made payable to the Borough of Quakertown EIT.
12. Third party checks in payment of the tax due may be refused by the
Borough of Quakertown.
13. Bad Checks. A $25 charge will be levied each time a check is returned
from the bank unpaid. Checks issued in violation of the Pennsylvania
Crimes Code will be referred to appropriate authorities for possible
criminal prosecution.

G. Every taxpayer is required to file an annual return, pursuant to
§ 218, whether or not a declaration and/or quarterly installments
have been filed and/or paid.
1. Every employer required to withhold the tax shall file a quarterly return
(Form 511) on the proper form setting forth the name, Social Security
§ 219 QUAKERTOWN CODE § 220
1:498
number, address, municipality of residence, gross earnings and the
amount of tax withheld for each employee, and shall remit the total sum
thereof to the Borough of Quakertown at the following times:
For Quarter Comprising the
Following Months in Which
Wages are Paid
Employer's Quarterly Return
and Payment Due on or Before
January, February, March April 30
April, May, June July 31
July, August, September October 31
October, November, December January 31
2. Employers may utilize computer printouts or similar listings to transmit
quarterly and/or annual employee withholding data provided the
required information is furnished in a manner acceptable to the
Borough of Quakertown. By prior arrangement with the Administrator,
employers with fewer than 250 employees may furnish quarterly and/or
annual employee withholding data via magnetic media. In such cases an
employer's quarterly return "header" shall be completed and attached
as a cover sheet to transmit the data and withheld tax to the Borough of
Quakertown quarterly. The annual employee withholding Form W-2
data shall be reported to the Borough of Quakertown during February
of the succeeding calendar year and shall be accompanied by the
annual reconciliation Form 512.
3. Every employer with 250 or more employees shall be required to submit
employee quarterly and annual withholding data via acceptable
magnetic media. This reporting requirement shall become effective
with the tax year beginning January 1, 2000. Such employers shall
complete an employer's quarterly return "header" and attach it as a
cover sheet to transmit the data and withheld tax to the Borough of
Quakertown quarterly. The annual employee withholding Form W-2
data shall be reported to the Borough of Quakertown during February
of the succeeding calendar year and shall be accompanied by the
annual reconciliation Form 512.
4. The local earned income/compensation taxes withheld from an
employee's wages by an employer or business entity or a corporation
shall be held in trust for the taxing jurisdiction and the Tax
Administrator, even in the event of bankruptcy. These withheld tax
funds shall not be considered to be part of the "property of the bankrupt
estate." These withheld taxes shall not be commingled in the employer's
general cash or other operating accounts.
A. Trustee ex Maleficio. One who collects the earned income/
compensation tax as an agent for the taxing jurisdiction or the
taxing jurisdiction's tax administrator and fails to pay over such
withheld taxes to the appointed collector for the taxing jurisdiction
is a trustee ex maleficio.
§ 220 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 220
1:499
Example: An officer of a company that fails to remit the earned
income/compensation tax withheld from the company's employees
may be held personally liable for the tax withheld as a trustee ex
maleficio, where the officer has been active and/or in control over
the collection and remittance of taxes.
B. Businesses and corporations must act through individuals and
where such individuals are the acting and controlling officers and
agents of the corporation or business and they fail to administer the
trust responsibilities, liabilities are imposed upon the individuals
who are responsible for the performance of the trust duty.
Example: A corporation which files an employer's quarterly return
of tax withheld from employees, or the Forms W-2 documenting
collections from employees, but does not remit the tax withheld
in full to this office shall be liable for the withheld taxes as a
trustee through wrongdoing. The controlling corporate officer is
also liable for the tax as a trustee through wrongdoing, to the
extent that this officer has failed, permitted and/or directed the
corporation not to remit the withheld tax.
Example: An officer and/or director of a corporation or business
who has knowledge that the corporation has failed to remit
withheld earned income/compensation tax shall be personally
liable for such tax withheld because that person did not try to
prevent the corporation or business from spending its funds
without first remitting the withheld tax to the Income Tax Office.
C. Liabilities of Corporations and Officers. Where a corporation does
not remit the earned income/compensation tax withheld from its
employees and is subsequently is dissolved in bankruptcy, the
corporate officers shall be held personally liable, jointly or
severally, for the payment of the tax withheld.
Example: The officers are the sole owners of the shares of stock
and/or are the "guiding force" of the corporation. The officers are
trustees of the earned income/compensation tax collected since
they are responsible for the corporation's failure to remit the
withheld taxes and the resulting misappropriation of the tax funds.
The doctrine of separate entity of the corporation shall not defeat
this office's claims for tax withheld.
5. The employer or the business or the corporation shall not characterize
the tax withheld from employees as simply creating a debtor-creditor
relationship between the employer or business or corporation and this
office as collector for the tax district or taxing jurisdiction; therefore,
the employer is the conduit for the employees' tax payments.
Consequently, these taxes withheld are held in "express trust" or in
"constructive trust" for the taxing authority and its collector of these
taxes.
§ 220 QUAKERTOWN CODE § 220
1:500
6. Lowest Intermediate Balance Test (LIBT). This is a judicial test which
the Collector will apply to ease the burden of the beneficiary (the tax
collector, in this case the Borough of Quakertown) to trace the funds if
or when a trustee commingles trust funds due this office with other
monies in a single account. The LIBT allows trust beneficiaries to
assume that trust funds are withheld last from a commingled account.
Therefore the lowest intermediate balance in a commingled account
represents trust funds that have never been dissipated and which are
reasonably identifiable. The Borough of Quakertown will take the
position that the court will keep in mind a broad policy against allowing
a party to unilaterally make a trust unenforceable by commingling
assets. Also, in the event of bankruptcy, filing the LIBT is intended to
provide a method for this to demonstrate that amounts of withheld
taxes were/are still in the possession of the debtor at the
commencement of the case. See: 300-227 City of Farrell vs. Sharon
Steel Corp.; United States Office; Mueller Industries, Inc.; Citibank,
N.A. United States Court of Appeals, third Circuit, No. 94-3130,
November 14, 1994 case.
7. Interlocking Business Entities. A company that maintains separate
payrolls for its employees on a separate checking account or general
ledger system and reported to this office that it has withheld payroll
taxes from its employees shall be liable for the earned income/
compensation tax, plus interest, plus penalties, plus all costs of
collection when the tax has not been remitted to this office.
Example: The fact that a company is closely tied to a corporation
and that together the company and the corporation provide a single
overall set of services does not excuse the corporation from liability
for unremitted earned income/compensation tax withheld where the
entities have been kept separate for bookkeeping and operational
purposes.
8. Responsible Party.
A. An officer or employee of a business entity, including a corporation,
who is responsible or has the duty to collect or withhold the earned
income/compensation tax and/or possesses actual or implied
control over funds and tax accounts will be personally assessed for
collected or withheld earned income/compensation tax that is not
remitted to this office. Generally, the Borough of Quakertown will
issue an assessment, or file a legal action, against the chief
operating or financial officer and/or officers of any entity, including
corporations, if the facts of the particular case disclose that these
individuals are involved in the day to day operation of the business
entity and retain decision making authority over financial matters.
A responsible person need not be an officer of the entity. Managers
whose duties include authority and control over financial decisions
may likewise be held responsible.
§ 220 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 220
1:501
B. This office's process of determining the responsible person begins
with the "employer questionnaire" and/or the tax return itself.
Borough regulations do not restrict who may sign a tax return form.
However, it is important for the person signing the Form 511
understands that act, along with other factors, may subject him or
her to personal liability. Because signing the employer's tax return
(Form 511) evidences control over the funds of the entity and an
active involvement in the entity, this presumes the person signing
the tax return to be the person responsible for the payment of the
withheld tax unless the facts of each particular case do not support
that inference. Therefore, if the signatory is an officer of the entity,
it is likely that an assessment will be made.
9. Any employer who for two of the preceding four quarterly periods has
failed to deduct the proper tax, or any part thereof, or has failed to pay
over the proper amount of tax to the Borough of Quakertown, may be
required by the Officer to file the return and pay the tax monthly. In
such cases, payments of tax shall be made to the Officer on or before
the last day of the month succeeding the month for which the tax was
withheld.
10. On or before February 28 of the succeeding year, every employer shall
file with the Officer:
A. An annual return (Form 512) showing the employer's name,
address and identification number, the total number of withholding
statements transmitted with the annual return, the total income tax
withheld from wages during the year as shown by withholding tax
statements and the total income tax withheld as reported on the
quarterly returns. Any differences between the total income tax
withheld from wages as shown on the withholding statements and
the total income tax withheld as reported on the quarterly returns
must be fully explained in an attached note.
B. A withholding tax statement (Form 525 or W-2) for each employee
employed during all or any part of the period beginning January 1
of the current year and ending December 31 of the current year
setting forth the employee's name, address and Social Security
number, the amount of earned income/compensation paid to the
employee during said period, the amount of tax deducted, the
political subdivision imposing the tax upon such employee, and the
amount of tax paid to the Officer. Every employer shall furnish two
copies of Form 525 or at least four copies of Form W-2 to each
employee for whom it is filed.
11. Every employer who discontinues business prior to the completion of
taxable year, shall, within 30 days after the discontinuance of business,
file and furnish the returns required by this section covering the
periods between the last such return and the discontinuance of
business, and remit to the Officer all remaining tax due. Every employer
engaged in a business activity within the approving political subdivision
§ 220 QUAKERTOWN CODE § 220
1:502
§ 221. Fiscal Years. [Ord. 1096, 3/3/2004, § 221]
§ 222. Cash or Accrual Basis. [Ord. 1096, 3/3/2004, § 222]
shall withhold from resident and nonresident employees who work for
such employer within the approving political subdivision even though
the payroll records and place of payment are not located in the
approving political subdivision.
12. The failure or omission of any employer to make the deductions
required by this section shall not relieve any employee from the
payment of the tax or from complying with the requirements of the
ordinances or resolutions relating to the filing of declarations and
returns.
13. Bad Checks. A charge of $25 will be levied each time a check is
returned from the bank unpaid. Checks issued in violation of the
Pennsylvania Crimes Code will be referred to the appropriate
authorities for possible criminal prosecution.
1. Normally taxpayers shall use the calendar-year method for reporting
and paying the tax.
2. A business taxpayer, by filing with the Officer his written election to do
so, may make and file returns and pay tax on the same fiscal year basis
used for Pennsylvania personal income tax purposes. (See § 218,
Subsection 5.)
1. A taxpayer may calculate income on the cash or accrual basis as those
terms are used for Pennsylvania personal income tax purposes. The
basis used by the taxpayer shall be the same as used by the taxpayer for
the Pennsylvania personal income tax.
2. Illustrations of Computations of Net Profits. As amplification of the
definition contained in Subsection 1, but not a limitation thereof, the
following information and requirements for the determination of net
business profits are furnished:
A. Cash Basis Method. A taxpayer employing the cash basis of
accounting includes in gross income all income subject to tax
received during the year in cash or its equivalent. He or she
deducts all disbursements made during the year in cash or its
equivalent, provided deduction for such expenditures is authorized
by law.
B. The use of the cash basis is mandatory where no books or records
of account are maintained.
C. Items of income and expenditure which, as gross income and
deduction, are elements in computing taxable income need not
necessarily be in the form of cash. It is sufficient that such items, if
§ 220 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 222
1:503
otherwise properly included in the computation, can be valued in
terms of money.
Example: A taxpayer on the cash basis received shares of stock
in payment of services. Assuming that the stock has a fair market
value, the taxpayer has received the equivalent of cash to the
extent of its value and that amount must be included as income.
D. If a return is made on the cash basis, gross profit shall include
receipts from commissions, fees and interest, as well as the gross
profit or loss from sales of merchandise, chattels, goods, wares,
securities, notes, chooses-in-action and services.
E. Accrual Basis. If income is taken into consideration when earned,
even though not received in cash, and expenses are considered as
soon as incurred, whether paid or not, the system of accounting is
said to be on the accrual basis. These are the basic rules: (i) the
right to receive an item of income (as distinguished from actual
receipt) determines its inclusion in gross income under the accrual
basis; and (ii) a deduction cannot be accrued until an actual liability
is incurred.
Example: In September of last year a contractor performed work
for a customer. Payment for this work was not received until this
year. If the taxpayer reports on the accrual basis, the income will
be included in last year's return (when earned). If the taxpayer
reports on the cash basis, the payment will be included in this
year's return (when received).
3. A taxpayer engaged in more than one business activity may, in
computing taxable income, use a different method for each trade or
business activity.
4. Methods of accounting must clearly reflect income. No method of
accounting is allowed unless it clearly reflects income. Thus, even if the
taxpayer's accounts are kept and the return made on the cash basis,
unusual cases way arise in which a payment made during the year is not
deductible.
Example: Commissions, fees and costs paid in one year by a taxpayer
in securing a loan for 10 or 15 years covered by a mortgage on
property to be leased are not deductible in full in the year of payment
but should be spread over the period of the loan, even though the
taxpayer's accounts are kept and the return made on the cash basis.
5. Income or net profits shall be taxable in the year when they are actually
or constructively received by the taxpayer. Income or net profits,
although not actually reduced to a taxpayer's possession, will be
deemed to be constructively received by the taxpayer in the tax year
during which it is credited to the taxpayer's account, set apart for the
taxpayer, or otherwise made available so that the taxpayer may draw
§ 222 QUAKERTOWN CODE § 222
1:504
§ 223. Penalty and Interest. [Ord. 1096, 3/3/2004, § 223]
upon it at any time. However, income will not be deemed to be
constructively received if the taxpayer's control of its receipt is subject
to substantial limitations or restrictions, such as those relating to age,
death, disability, retirement or other similar factors.
1. If for any reason the tax is not paid when due, interest at the rate of 6%
per annum on the amount of said tax, and an additional penalty of 1 1/
2% of the amount of the unpaid tax for each month or fraction thereof
during which the tax remains unpaid, shall be added and collected.
Where suit shall be brought for recovery of any such tax, the person
liable therefore shall, in addition, be liable for the cost of collection and
the interest and penalty herein imposed.
2. Abatement of certain interest and penalty will be considered under the
following conditions:
A. Errors and Delays. In the case of any underpayment, the Income
Tax Office may abate all or any part of interest for any period for
the following:
(1) Any underpayment of tax finally determined to be due
attributable in whole or in part to any error or delay by the
office in the performance of a ministerial act. For the purposes
of this subsection, an error or delay shall be taken into account
only if no significant aspect of the error or delay can be
attributed to the taxpayer and after the Income Tax Officer has
contacted the taxpayer in writing with respect to the
underpayment of tax finally determined to be due or payable.
(2) Any payment of a tax to the extent that any error or delay in the
payment is attributable to an officer, employee or agent of the
Income Tax Office being erroneous or dilatory in the
performance of a ministerial act. The Collector shall determine
what constitutes timely performance of ministerial acts
performed under this subsection.
(3) The timely performance of ministerial acts shall mean that the
Income Tax Officer shall contact the taxpayer or employer
within 60 days of receiving a properly filed tax return. If the
Officer fails to notify the taxpayer or employer of an
underpayment of tax within 60 days of the receipt of a properly
filed return, that taxpayer or employer shall be given 30 days
to satisfy the underpayment without the accrual of penalty and
interest. If that taxpayer or employer fails to satisfy the
underpayment within 30 days penalty and interest shall be
applied from the date the tax was originally due.

or excess interest attributable to erroneous advice furnished to
the taxpayer in writing by and officer, employee or agent of the
acting in the officer's, employee's or agent's official capacity if:
(a) The written advice was reasonably relied upon by the
taxpayer and was in response to a specific written request
of the taxpayer.

interest did not result from the failure by the taxpayer to
provide adequate or accurate information.

Tax Office to provide written advice to the taxpayer.

fiscal year for which the return will be filed. A taxpayer who is granted
an extension of time for filing his or her federal or Pennsylvania income
tax return shall not automatically be entitled to a similar extension of
time for filing his or her local income tax return. A copy of the
taxpayer's federal or Pennsylvania tax extension form must be received
by the Borough of Quakertown on or before April 15, of the succeeding
year, for the extension to be approved. Such approved extension shall
be valid through August 15 of the succeeding year.
2. Any taxpayer who, after receiving an approved extension to August 15
of the succeeding year, finds that he or she needs additional time for
proper completion of the annual tax return, shall make written
application to the Borough of Quakertown on or before August 15 of the
succeeding year, requesting an additional extension of time to file. Such
approved second extension shall be valid through October 15 of the
succeeding year and will only be approved if a first extension was filed
and approved on or before April 15 of the succeeding year. Under no
circumstances will extensions be approved after October 15 of the
succeeding year.

(2) The Officer believes that collection of any eligible tax under the
installment plan is in jeopardy.
H. If the Income Tax Officer finds that the financial condition of the
taxpayer has significantly changed, the Officer may alter, modify or
terminate the agreement, but only if:
(1) Notice of the Officer's finding is provided to the taxpayer no later
than 30 days prior to the date of such action.
(2) The notice contains the reasons why the Officer believes a change
has occurred.
I. The Income Tax Officer may alter, modify or terminate an installment
plan agreement if the taxpayer fails to do any of the following:
(1) Pay any installment at the time the installment is due.
(2) Pay any other tax liability at the time the liability is due.
(3) Provide a financial condition update as requested by the taxpayer.
J. Nothing in this subsection shall prevent a taxpayer from prepaying in
whole or in part any eligible tax under any installment agreement with
the Income Tax Officer.
1. The Officer may sue in the name of the Borough of Quakertown taxing
district for the recovery of taxes, penalties, interest, and late filing fees

§ 237 QUAKERTOWN CODE § 238
1:516
§ 239. Wage Attachments. [Ord. 1096, 3/3/2004, § 239]
2. Any suit brought to recover the tax, penalty, interest and late filing fees
imposed by the ordinances or resolutions shall be begun within three
years after such tax is due, or within three years after the declaration or
return has been filed, whichever date is later; provided, however, that
this limitation shall not prevent the institution of a suit for the collection
of any tax due or determined to be due in the following cases:
A. Where no declaration or return was filed by any person although a
declaration or return was required to be filed by him or her under
provisions of the ordinances or resolutions, there shall be no
limitation.
B. Where an examination of the declaration or return filed by any
person or of any other evidence relating to such declaration or
return in the possession of the Officer reveals a fraudulent evasion
of taxes, there shall be no limitation.
C. In the case of substantial understatement of tax liability of 25% or
more and no fraud, suit shall be begun within six years.
D. Where any person has deducted taxes under the provisions of the
ordinances or resolutions and has failed to pay the amounts so
deducted to the Officer, or where any person has willfully failed or
omitted to make the deductions required by the ordinances or
resolutions, there shall be no limitation.
E. This section shall not be construed to limit the Borough of
Quakertown from recovering delinquent taxes by any other means
provided by Act 511.
3. The Officer may sue for recovery of an erroneous refund or credit
provided such suit is begun two years after making such refund or
credit, except that such suit may be brought within five years if it
appears that any part of the refund or credit was induced by fraud or
misrepresentation of material fact.
1. The Borough of Quakertown shall demand, receive and collect from all
corporations, political subdivisions, associations, companies, firms or
individuals employing persons owing delinquent earned income/
compensation taxes or having in possession unpaid commissions or
earnings belonging to any person or persons owing delinquent earned
income/compensation taxes, upon the presentation of a written notice
and demand certifying that the information contained therein is true
and correct and containing the name of the taxable and the amount of
tax due. Upon presentation of such written notice and demand, it shall
be the duty of any such corporation, political subdivision, association,
company, firm or individual to deduct from the wages, commissions, or
earnings of such individual employees, then owing or that shall within
60 days thereafter become due or from any unpaid commissions or
§ 238 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 239
1:517
earnings of any such taxable in its or his or her possession or that
shall within 60 days thereafter come into its or his or her possession,
a sum sufficient to pay the respective amount of the delinquent earned
income/compensation taxes, penalties, interest and costs, shown upon
written notice or demand and to pay the same to the Borough of
Quakertown 60 days after such notice shall have been given. No more
than 10% of the wages, commissions or earnings of the delinquent
taxpayer may be deducted at any one time for delinquent earned
income/compensation taxes, penalties, interest and costs. Such
corporation, political subdivision, association, firm or individual shall
be entitled to deduct from the moneys collected from each employee
the costs incurred from the extra bookkeeping necessary to record such
transactions, not exceeding 2% of the amount of money so collected
and paid over to the Borough of Quakertown. Upon the failure of any
such corporation, political subdivision, association, company, firm or
individual to deduct the amount of such taxes, penalties, interest, and
costs or to pay the same over to the tax collector, less the cost of
bookkeeping involved in such transaction, as herein provided, within
the time required, such corporation, political subdivision, association,
company, firm or individual shall forfeit and pay the amount of such tax,
penalty, interest and costs for each such taxable whose taxes, penalties,
interest and costs are not withheld and paid over, or that are withheld
and not paid over together with a penalty of 10% added thereto, to be
recovered by an action of assumpsit in a suit to be instituted by the
Borough of Quakertown Earned Income Tax Collector or by the proper
authorities of the taxing district, as debts of like amount are now by law
recoverable, except that such person shall not have the benefit of any
stay of execution or exemption law.
2. Upon presentation of a written notice and demand under oath or
affirmation to the State Treasurer or any other fiscal officer of the state
or its boards, authorities, agencies or commissions, it shall be the duty
of the Treasurer or officer to deduct from the wages then owing, or that
shall within 60 days thereafter become due to any employee, a sum
sufficient to pay the respective amount of the delinquent earned
income/compensation tax, penalty, interest and costs shown on the
written notice. The same shall be paid to the Borough of Quakertown,
which said delinquent tax, penalty and interest was levied within 60
days after such notice shall have been given.
3. The Borough of Quakertown shall, at least 15 days prior to the
presentation of a written notice and demand to the State Treasurer or
other fiscal officer of the State, or to any corporation, political
subdivision, association, company or individual, notify the taxpayer
owing the delinquent tax, penalty, interest and costs by registered or
certified mail that a written notice and demand shall be presented to his
or her employer unless such tax, penalty, interest and costs are paid.
The return receipt card for certified or registered mail shall be marked
delivered to addressee only, and the cost of notification by certified or
§ 239 QUAKERTOWN CODE § 239

§ 240. Bad Checks. [Ord. 1096, 3/3/2004, § 240]
When any person shall give or cause to be given to this Borough a check in
payment of any obligation, whether due to the Borough or others, including
but not limited to any tax, which is dishonored or unpaid by the bank upon
which it is drawn, the sum of $25 shall be added to the obligation and
interest and penalty provided by law or otherwise, to cover the additional
cost to the Borough, plus the issuer/maker may have a criminal complaint
court action filed against him or her.
§ 241. Changes in the Language of Act 511 By the PA General
Assembly. [Ord. 1096, 3/3/2004, § 241]
Should the Pennsylvania General Assembly amend Act 511 language, the
amended language shall be incorporated into this Part.
§ 242. Assessment and Collection of Underpayment of the Tax. [Ord.
1096, 3/3/2004, § 242]
§ 243. Paid Under Protest. [Ord. 1096, 3/3/2004, § 243]
A check endorsement shall not qualify as a refund claim. The words "paid
under protest" handwritten, typed or otherwise placed on a taxpayer's
check or money order, or the check or money order of an employer, shall
not qualify as a refund claim as the words are not sufficient to appraise
the Borough's personnel of the taxpayer's intent to seek a refund or of
the substance of their claim or of facts sufficient to permit the Borough to
undertake an investigation of the person's claim.
§ 244. Delinquent Tax Collection Postage Expense. [Ord. 1096, 3/3/
2004, § 244]
registered mail shall be added to the costs for collecting taxes,
penalties, and interest.
1. If, as a result of research or investigation conducted by or on behalf of
the Tax Administrator of the Borough, a declaration or return is found
or is reasonably believed to be incorrect, the Tax Administrator is
authorized to assess and collect any under payments of taxes withheld
at the source or any under payments of taxes withheld at the source or
any under payments of tax owed by any taxpayer with respect to
earnings or net profits or both. If no declaration or return has been filed
and a tax is found or determined to be due, the tax actually due may be
assessed and collected with or without the formality of obtaining a
delinquent declaration or return from the taxpayer.
2. Taxpayer Appeals. Any person aggrieved by an assessment made by the
Tax Administrator may, within 90 days after receipt of notice of the
assessment, appeal the assessment by following the appeal procedures
as outlined in § 227, Administrative Appeals.

§ 245. Indebtedness and Priority Claims. [Ord. 1096, 3/3/2004,
§ 245]
§ 246. Procedure When Taxation Is Not Defined in Rules and
Regulations. [Ord. 1096, 3/3/2004, § 246]
In cases where a question arises as to the taxation of earned income/
compensation or net profits not specified in these rules and regulations,
then the regulations promulgated by the Pennsylvania Department of
Revenue for the personal income tax shall apply, so long as they are not
contrary to the provisions of the Local Tax Enabling Act of 1965, as
amended by Act 166 of December, 2002.
§ 247. Rule on Apportioning Income on Professional Athletes. [Ord.
1096, 3/3/2004, § 247]
1. The first letter will be mailed by first class postage at the prevailing
postage rate.
2. The second letter, if required, will be mailed by certified mail, with
return receipt at the prevailing postage rate. The second letter will also
contain a "postage expense" amount which is to be included in the total
amount due indicated on the second letter to the taxpayer.
3. The postage amount will change if the postal rate fee for these services
is changed.
4. If a wage attachment is subsequently prepared, the postage expense
will become a part of and shall be included in the $40 wage attachment
amount when the wage attachment is prepared and mailed to the
employer.
1. In bankruptcy cases, the priority claim due to or held by this Borough
shall survive the confirmation of any bankruptcy claim and shall not be
subject to discharge of debt to the extent that such claims are not paid
by the bankruptcy plan of the debtor.
2. Amounts owing or which shall be determined to be due this Borough
shall be the amount of the priority claim due to this Borough when a
bankruptcy plan is filed with the Bankruptcy Court.
1. Apportioning the income is required by a nonresident who receives
earned income/compensation/compensation for services rendered
within the geographic boundary of a member taxing authority which
levies a nonresident tax, as a member of a professional athletic team, or
as an individual professional athlete. This rule shall not apply to
athletes domiciled within any states which have reciprocity agreements
with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
2. Generally, a nonresident professional athlete's income will be
apportioned to this Borough's applicable member taxing authority on
the basis of a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of duty
§ 244 QUAKERTOWN CODE § 247
1:520
days spent within the member taxing authority rendering services to
the team, or as an individual, and the denominator of which is the total
number of duty days spent both within and outside the member taxing
authority during the tax year. An alternative method may be prescribed
by this Borough or proposed by the athlete if the above method does
not fairly and equitably apportion the compensation.
3. Duty Days Defined. Duty days generally mean all days during the tax
year.
A. From the beginning of official preseason training through the last
scheduled or actually played game or event.
B. Other days, not in the period, during which the athlete renders a
service for the team. Rendering a service includes conducting
training and rehabilitation activities at the team's facilities.
C. Duty days include:
(1) Game days.
(2) Practice days.
(3) Days spent at team meetings, promotional caravans and
preseason training camps.
(4) Days spent participating in instructional leagues and at special
games such as all-star games.
(5) Days served with the team through all post-season games in
which the team competes or is scheduled to compete.
D. Duty days do not include days for which an athlete is suspended
without pay or prohibited from performing services for the team.
For athletes who switch teams during the tax year, a separate duty
day calculation, representing the number of duty days spent with
each team, must be made. Duty days are included in the
apportionment formula for the tax year in which they occur.
E. Disability and Travel Days. Days that an athlete is on a disabled list
and does not engage in rehabilitation at the team's facility or is not
otherwise rendering services for the team within a member taxing
authority are not considered duty days spent within the taxing
authority, but they are included in the total duty days spent within
and outside the taxing authority, i.e., they are included in the
denominator, but not in the numerator of the apportionment
formula.
F. Travel days not including a game, practice, team meeting,
promotional caravan or other similar team event shall not be
considered duty days spent within the taxing authority, but they
shall be included in the total duty days spent both within and
outside the taxing authority.

§ 248. Earned Income/Compensation. [Ord. 1096, 3/3/2004, § 248]
[§ 303 of the Act of March 4, 1971 (P.L 6, No. 2) 72 P.S. § 7303]
G. Bonuses. Performance bonuses earned as a result of play during
the season, such as a bonus received for championship, playoff or
all-star games are included in the apportionment formula. Bonuses
paid for signing a contract are included in the apportionment
formula unless:
(1) Payment is not conditioned on playing any games, performing
subsequent services or making the team.
(2) The bonus is payable separately from the salary or other
compensation.
(3) The bonus is nonrefundable.
1. Compensation. All salaries, wages, commissions, bonuses and incentive
payments whether based on profits or otherwise, fees, tips and similar
remuneration received for services rendered whether directly or
through an agent and whether in cash or in property except income
derived from the United States Government for active duty outside the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as a member of its armed force.
61 Pa. Code, Part I, Subpart B, Article V

Reference should be made to § 101.6 (relating to compensation).
61 Pa. Code, Part I, Subpart B, Article V
61 Pa. Code § 101.6, Compensation.
2. Compensation includes items of remuneration received, directly or
through an agent, in cash or in property, based on payroll periods or
piecework, for services rendered as an employee or casual employee,
agent or officer of an individual, partnership, business or nonprofit
corporation, or government agency. These items include salaries,
wages, commissions, bonuses, stock options, incentive payments, fees,
tips, dismissal, termination or severance payments, early retirement
incentive payments and other additional compensation contingent upon
retirement, including payments in excess of the scheduled or customary
salaries provided for those who are not terminating service, rewards,
vacation and holiday pay, paid leaves of absence, payments for unused
vacation or sick leave, tax assumed by the employer or casual employer
signing bonuses, amounts received under employee benefit plans and
deferred compensation arrangements, and other remuneration
received for services rendered.
3. Scholarships, stipends, grants and fellowships shall be taxable as
compensation, if services are rendered in connection therewith.
§ 247 QUAKERTOWN CODE § 248
1:522
A. For taxable compensation, the following words have the following
meanings, unless the context clearly indicated otherwise:
(1) FELLOWSHIP STIPEND or FELLOWSHIP AWARD – A fixed
sum of money paid periodically for services or to defray
expenses to a graduate student who is enrolled in a graduate
degree program at a university.
(2) GRANT-IN-AID – Financial support given by a public agency or
private institution to an individual to further the individual's
education.
(3) POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCH FELLOWSHIP STIPEND or
POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCH FELLOWSHIP AWARD – A fixed
sum of money paid periodically for services or to defray
expenses of an individual who has obtained a doctoral degree
at a university and is conducting research at a research facility.
(4) SCHOLARSHIP – A grant-in-aid to a student.
B. Scholarships, grants, awards and other types of student aid which
require no past, present or future services in return for receipt of
the funds are not taxable.
Examples:
(1) John has a high school diploma and is currently employed.
John's employer promises to pay for John's college tuition,
room and board for four years, and John agrees to return to his
employer after obtaining his degree and to work for the
employer for four consecutive years. John's grant-in-aid is
taxable compensation and is subject to employer withholding
and reporting.
(2) Peter is employed by ABC Company. Peter and ABC Company
agree that he will work for them for one year without receiving
any salary. In return, after that year Peter will attend XYZ
College and ABC Company will pay his tuition, room and board
for the entire year. ABC's payment of Peter's tuition, room and
board is taxable compensation and is subject to employer
withholding and reporting.
(3) John is employed by XYZ Corporation. XYZ Corporation has
established a scholarship program for the children of its
employees. The program does not qualify as an employer
scholarship program for federal income tax purposes. John's
child, Erin, received a scholarship from the plan to attend
college. The fair market value of the federally nonqualified
scholarship is taxable compensation to John and is subject to
employer withholding.
§ 248 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 248
1:523
C. Fellowship awards or fellowship stipends made to graduate
students enrolled in a graduate degree program at a university
chartered by a state or foreign country on the basis of need or
academic achievement for the purpose of encouraging or allowing
the recipient to further their educational development are not
taxable. When the fellowship awards or fellowship stipends are
made as compensation for past or present employment or in
expectation of future employment services they are taxable.
Example: Jane is enrolled in a graduate degree program in
biochemistry at a university. Jane is in the first year of a three
year graduate degree program. A pharmaceutical company enters
into an agreement to pay the remaining tuition, room and board
expenses necessary for Jane to obtain her graduate degree. In
return, Jane promises to work for the pharmaceutical company for
four years after graduation. Jane's receipt of these payments from
her future employer constitute taxable compensation.
D. Fellowship awards and fellowship stipends are taxable
compensation for services if the recipient is required to apply his or
her skill and training to advance research, creative work or some
other project or activity, unless the recipient can show that the
recipient is a candidate for a degree and the same activities are
required of all candidates for that degree as a condition to receive
that degree.
Example: Steven is enrolled in a graduate degree program in
education at ABC University. Degree candidates are required to
teach an undergraduate education course for five hours a week to
obtain their degree. Steven and two of the other 15 candidates in
the degree program are receiving federal stipends. If Steven does
not perform additional services for ABC University, his teaching
will not make his stipend taxable compensation.
E. For a payment received by a postdoctoral research fellow for
conducting research to be excludable from the definition of
compensation, the payment shall meet the following conditions. If
the payment fails to meet one or more of these 15 conditions, the
payment is taxable compensation:
(1) The source of funding for the payment is a governmental
agency, a private foundation as described in § 509 of the
Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C.A. § 509), a federally exempt
organization as described in §§ 501(c)(3) or (5) of the Internal
Revenue Code [26 U.S.C.A. § 501(c)(3) and (5)], or a public or
private university chartered by a state.
(2) The organization which is permitting the fellow to use its
facilities and which is sponsoring the fellow's research
(sponsoring organization) is a governmental agency, a federally
exempt organization as described in § 501(c)(3) of the Internal
§ 248 QUAKERTOWN CODE § 248
1:524
Revenue Code or a public or private university chartered by a
state.
(3) Prior to enrollment in the sponsoring organization's
postdoctoral research fellowship program, the fellow has
obtained a doctoral degree in a field of study which is related
to the field of study being research by the fellow.
(4) The amount of the fellow's stipend or grant is based on the
scale established by the source of funding.
(5) Each fellow formulates his or her own research project or
advances his or her own research project throughout the
stipend or grant period.
(6) The sponsoring agency serves only in an advisory capacity in
the selection of research projects and cannot establish or
control the fellow's hours or methods of research except as
control relates to legal or regulatory matters.
(7) The fellow is not required to perform administrative work,
teaching assignments or other duties for the sponsoring
organization or another entity as a condition for receiving a
payment and will not be penalized for not performing these
duties.
(8) The fellow is not required to enter a contractual commitment
for future employment with a specified entity as a condition for
obtaining or continuing to obtain the payments.
(9) Payments to the fellow for conducting research are limited to
no more than 36 months.
(10) Research results or writings made by the fellow during the
program do not become the property of the sponsoring
organization or another entity other than the fellow. Patent or
copyright royalties or other income derived directly or
indirectly from the fellow's research results or writings may
become the property of the sponsoring organization. Income or
gain derived from patent or copyright royalties by the
postdoctoral research fellow is taxable income to the fellow.
(11) The fellow is not required to assist employees of the
sponsoring organization in conducting research being
performed by employees of the sponsoring organization.
§ 248 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 248
1:525
Example: John is a postdoctoral research fellow at ABC
Cancer Research Institute. His research is being funded by
the National Institute of Health. The sponsoring organization,
ABC Cancer Research Institute, requires John to spend half
of his time assisting its own employees on their own research
project as a condition for sponsoring his research. John's
postdoctoral research fellowship stipend is taxable
compensation.
(12) The fellow does not receive fringe benefits to which an,
employee of the sponsoring organization is entitled, except to
the extent that the benefits are at no additional cost to the
sponsoring organization. For purposes of the subparagraph
"fringe benefits" means payer provided health, life, disability
income or group legal services insurance plans, payer provided
automobile and payer provided dependent care assistance,
educational assistance plans or retirement benefits.
(13) Pennsylvania unemployment compensation premiums are not
required to be paid by the sponsoring organization or another
entity on behalf of the fellow.
(14) Federal Social Security employment tax is not required to be
paid by the sponsoring organization or another entity or the
fellow with respect to the fellowship.
(15) The fellow is not under the coverage of the sponsoring
organization's workers' compensation insurance plan or policy.
F. Fellowship stipends paid to medical interns and residents under an
internship or residency program which conforms or substantially
conforms to standards set by the American Medical Association are
taxable compensation. If the program does not conform to the
referenced standards, the amount received will be taxable as
wages.
4. Compensation does not mean or include any of the following:
A. Periodic payments for periods of sickness or disability paid by or on
behalf of an employer under a program or plan unless the payments
are regular wages. Additionally, no amount of damages received
(whether by suit or agreement and whether as lump sums or as
periodic payments) if pain and suffering, emotional distress or
other like noneconomic element was or would have been a
significant evidentiary factor in determining the amount of the
taxpayer's damage. No payments made by third-party insurers for
periods of sickness or disability would be considered payments of
regular wages. A program or plan where any of the following occur
would not be considered payment of regular wages.
§ 248 QUAKERTOWN CODE § 248
1:526
(1) The periodic payments have no direct relationship to the
employee's usual rate of compensation.
(2) The periodic payments are computed with reference to the
nature of the sickness or disability and without regard to the
employee's job classification.
(3) Periodic payments would be reduced by payments arising
under Workmen's Compensation Acts, Occupational Disease
Acts, Social Security Disability or similar legislation by any
government.
(4) The periodic payments exceed the employee's usual
compensation for the period.
B. Disability, retirement or other payments arising under workers'
compensation acts, occupational disease acts or similar legislation
by any government.
C. Federal old age insurance benefits payable under 42 U.S.C.A. § 401,
Railroad Retirement Act benefits payable under 45 U.S.C.A. § 228
or § 231, or any retired or retainer pay of a member or former
member of a uniformed service computed under 10 U.S.C.A.
§ 1401.
D. Payments commonly known as public assistance or unemployment
compensation by a government agency.
E. Payments made by employers to employees to reimburse actual
expenses allowable as an ordinary, reasonable and necessary
business expense.
F. Payments made by an employer or labor union or elective
contributions deemed to be made by an employer under a cafeteria
plan for a nondiscriminatory health, accident or death plan.
Example: P is a partnership that is engaged in providing
accounting services. On a nondiscriminatory basis, it offers the
following fringe benefits to both employees and partners of the
firm:
Blue Shield medical coverage.
Dental and eyeglass coverage with a deductible.
Group term life insurance with coverage up to the equivalent of
the employee's annual salary.
§ 248 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 248
1:527
P pays the premiums on behalf of all employees and partners
for all medical dental, eyeglass and insurance coverage directly
to the insurance carrier or benefit provider. P does not add the
premium costs for the benefits to any employee's gross wages
and it accounts for the benefit costs as nonsalary fringe benefit
expenses. In other words, the value of the benefits are not shown
as an addition to any employee's wages on the pay stubs furnished
to employees.
The plan is not a federally qualifying cafeteria plan.
Conclusion: For the employees of P the employer-provided
hospitalization (Blue Shield), eyeglass, dental coverage and group
life insurance benefits are excludable from compensation and are
therefore not subject to withholding. The premiums paid on behalf
of the partners, however, are not deductible or excludable from
the income of the partnership or the partners.
G. The value of meals and lodging furnished for the convenience of an
employer or casual employer does not constitute compensation.
H. Old Age or Retirement Benefit Plans.
(1) Scope. For the purpose of this section, the term plan includes
individual retirement plans (IRA), simplified employee pension
plans (SEP), Keogh plans, federally qualified employee pension
plans and similar old age or retirement benefit plans.
(2) Contributions.
(a) Contributions to a plan made by employers or labor unions
on behalf of an employee are excludable from the
employee's income, except as otherwise provided in this
Part.
(b) Contributions to a plan made by an employee or other
individual directly or indirectly, whether through payroll
deduction, a salary reduction agreement or otherwise, are
not excludable from his or her income. Contributions by,
on behalf of or attributable to a self-employed person are
not excludable from either compensation or net profits
from a business, profession or other activity.
(3) Distributions.
(a) Amounts distributed to an individual from a plan shall be
included in income to the extent that contributions were
not previously included in this income except for either of
the following:
1) Distributions made upon or after his or her retirement
from service after reaching a specific age or after a
stated period of employment.
§ 248 QUAKERTOWN CODE § 248
1:528
2) Distributions transferred into another plan, where the
transferred amounts are not included in income for
federal income tax purposes.
(b) To determine the portion of a distribution to be included in
income, an individual shall use the cost recovery method.
Example 1: John contributed $1,000 to his IRA. He pays
tax on the $1,000 contribution. Three years later the
account has earned $750 in income. The total balance of
the account at that time is $1,000 + $750 = $1,750. John
receives a distribution of $750 from his IRA. Since the
amount of the distribution does not exceed $1,000, the
distribution is not includable in income.
Example 2: Same facts as Example 1, except that John
receives a distribution of $1,500. Since the amount of
the distribution exceeds $1,000, the excess of the
distribution, $500, is includable in his income, as
compensation.
(4) Income on plan assets. Income on assets held in a plan is not
includable in income.
I. Payments made by an employer or labor union for a
nondiscriminatory supplemental unemployment benefit or strike

selecting or purchasing benefits when so used shall be included in
the total amount of payment made during the year by the employer
on account of the plan and plan participant.
7. Compensation in the form of incentive, qualified, restricted or
nonqualified stock options shall be considered to be received:
A. When the option is exercised if the stock subject to the option is

value.
B. When the restrictions lapse if the stock subject to the option is
subject to restrictions having a significant effect on its market
value.
C. When exchanged, sold or otherwise converted into cash or other
property.
8. The following rules apply if, under a cafeteria plan, plan participants
may choose between benefits consisting of cash, additional paid
vacation days and other benefits; or if, outside a cafeteria plan, plan
participants can purchase additional paid vacation days:
A. If additional paid vacation days are elected or purchased and they
are used before the next calendar year, the following apply:
(1) The amount of cash foregone in exchange for the paid vacation
day is excluded from income.
§ 248 QUAKERTOWN CODE § 248
1:530
(2) The vacation pay is includable in income when paid.
B. If additional paid vacation days are purchased outside a cafeteria
plan and they are not used before the next calendar year, the
amount of cash foregone in exchange for the paid vacation days is
excludable for Act 166 of 2002 income tax purposes only if both of
the following apply:
(1) The value of the vacation day cannot be cashed out or used for
any other purpose.
(2) The vacation day cannot be carried over to the next taxable
year.
9. Employer payments to reimburse employees for uninsured medical or

during the taxable year or be carried over to any other taxable year,
normal cash compensation that is forgone by an employee under a
spending account or otherwise and credited to a self-insured medical
reimbursement account and drawn upon to reimburse the employee for
uninsured medical or dental expenses to which § 105(b) of the IRC [26
U.S.C.A. § 105(b)] applies is excludable from tax.
10. After December 31, 1996.
A. Payments made for employee welfare benefit plans under a
cafeteria plan will be deemed to be an "employer contribution" for
Act 166 of 2002 income tax purposes if the following apply:
(1) The payments were not actually or constructively received,
after taking § 125 of the IRC (26 U.S.C.A. § 125) into account.
(2) The payments were specified in a written cafeteria plan
document as being available to the participant:
(a) For the purpose of selecting or purchasing benefits under
a plan.
(b) As additional cash remuneration received in lieu of
coverage under a plan.
(3) The benefits selected or purchased are nontaxable under the
IRC when offered under a cafeteria plan.
(4) The payments made for the plan would be nontaxable under
the Act 166 of 2002 income tax if made by the employer
outside a cafeteria plan.
B. If the requirements of Subsection 10A are satisfied, cafeteria plan
contributions are taxed under such rules as they apply to employer
payments for employee welfare benefit plans. However, if the
benefits are taxable for federal income tax purposes when offered
§ 248 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 248
1:531
under a cafeteria plan, the payments will also constitute
compensation for Pennsylvania personal income tax purposes.
Payments will also constitute compensation if they would be
taxable under the Pennsylvania personal income tax if made by
the employer outside a cafeteria plan. For example, although not
taxable under the IRC, coverage under a dependent care plan
providing for the reimbursement of expenses for household or
dependent care services would constitute compensation under the
Pennsylvania personal income tax because it would be taxable if
made by an employer outside a cafeteria plan.
11. Compensation includes the entire cost of employer-provided coverage
provided to a highly compensated participant under any discriminatory
employee welfare benefit plan.
12. Contributions made by an employer for IRC 401(k) plans under a
cafeteria plan under which the employee unilaterally may elect to have
the employer either make the payments as contributions to a 401(k)
plan or other plan on behalf of the employee or to the employee directly
in cash are includable in the employee's compensation.
13. Compensation is taxable regardless of the form of the payment.
Examples of taxable forms of payment include:
A. Cash.
B. Foreign currency.
C. A check or other negotiable instrument.
D. Freely transferable, readily marketable obligations or other cash
equivalent.
E. Tangible property interests, intangible personal property or other
rights, claims or things that either:
(1) Can be enforced in courts of equity and transferred and have
an ascertainable fair market value.
(2) Can be reduced to cash or eliminate an expenditure.
F. A monetary payment in reimbursement of a personal expenditure
or to eliminate personal expenditure.
G. Below market rate loans.
H. A cancellation of indebtedness constituting a quid pro quo or
incentive that would be taxable had the amount by which the debt
had been forgiven or discharged instead been paid to the debtor in
cash or property.

A. A person seeking to claim an exemption from the local services tax

with the person's employer affirming that the person reasonably
expects to receive earned income and net profits from all sources
within the Borough of less than $12,000 in the calendar year for
which the exemption certificate is filed. In the event that the
Borough utilizes a tax collection officer, it shall provide a copy of
the exemption certificate to that officer. The exemption certificate
shall have attached to it a copy of all the employee's last pay stubs
or W-2 forms from employment within the Borough for the year
prior to the fiscal year for which the employee is requesting to be
exempted from the tax. Upon receipt of the exemption certificate
and until otherwise instructed by the Borough or except as
required by Subsection B, the employer shall not withhold the tax
from the person during the calendar year or the remainder of the
calendar year for which the exemption certificate applies.
Employers shall ensure that the exemption certificate forms are
readily available to employees at all times and shall furnish each
new employee with a form at the time of hiring.
B. With respect to a person who claimed an exemption for a given
calendar year from the tax, upon notification to an employer by the
person or by the Borough that the person has received earned
income and net profits from all sources within the Borough equal to
or in excess of $12,000 in that calendar year or that the person is
otherwise ineligible for the tax exemption for that calendar year, or

from the tax becomes subject to the tax for the calendar year under
Subsection B, the employer shall withhold the tax for the remainder
of that calendar year. The employer shall withhold from the person,
for the first payroll period after receipt of the notification under
Subsection B, a lump sum equal to the amount of tax that was not
withheld from the person due to the exemption claimed by the
person under this subsection, plus the per-payroll amount due for
that first payroll period. The amount of tax withheld per payroll
§ 404 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 404
1:541
§ 405. Duty of Employers to Collect. [Ord. 1137, 11/26/2007]
period for the remaining payroll periods in that calendar year shall
be the same amount withheld for other employees. In the event that
the employment of a person subject to withholding of the tax under
this subsection is subsequently severed in that calendar year, the
person shall be liable for any outstanding balance of tax due, and
the Borough may pursue collection under this Part.

subsection that employers shall not be responsible for investigating
exemption certificates, monitoring tax exemption eligibility or
exempting any employee from a local services tax.

for any tax paid by any person who is eligible for exemption, which
procedures shall be in accord with provisions of the general municipal
law relating to refunds of overpayments and interest on
overpayments.21 Refunds made within 75 days of a refund request or 75
days after the last day the employer is required to remit the tax for the

calendar year that do not exceed $1. The Borough Manager or the
collector shall determine eligibility for refunds to exempt persons and
provide refunds.
1. Each employer within the Borough of Quakertown, as well as those
employers situated outside the Borough of Quakertown but who engage
in business within the Borough of Quakertown, is hereby charged with
the duty of collecting the tax from each of his employees engaged by
him or performing for him within the Borough of Quakertown and
making a return and payment thereof to the collector. Further, each
employer is hereby authorized to deduct this tax for each employee in
his or her employ, whether said employee is paid by salary, wage or
commission and whether or not all such services are performed within
the Borough of Quakertown.
2. A person subject to the tax shall be assessed by the employer a pro-rata
share of the tax for each payroll period in which the person is engaging
in an occupation. The pro-rata share of the tax assessed on the person
for a payroll period shall be determined by dividing the combined rate
of the tax levied for the calendar year by the number of payroll periods
established by the employer for the calendar year. For purposes of
determining the pro-rata share, an employer shall round down the
amount of the tax collected each payroll-period to the nearest onehundredth
of a dollar. Collection of the tax shall be made on a payroll
period basis for each payroll period in which the person is engaging in
21.Editor's Note: With respect to refunds, see 53 Pa.C.S.A. § 8425; with respect to interest,

§ 406. Returns. [Ord. 1137, 11/26/2007]
Each employer shall prepare and file a return showing a computation of the
tax on forms to be supplied to the employer by the collector. If an employer
fails to file the return and pay the tax, whether or not the employer makes
collection thereof from the salary, wages or commissions paid by him or her
to an employee, except as provided hereafter in this Part, the employer shall
be responsible for the payment of the tax in full as though the tax had been
originally levied against the employer.
§ 407. Dates for Determining Tax Liability and Payment. [Ord. 1137,
11/26/2007]
In each tax year, each employer shall use his or her employment records to
determine the number of employees from whom such tax shall be deducted
an occupation, except as provided in Subsection 4 of this section. For
purposes of this subsection, "combined rate" shall mean the aggregate
annual rate of the tax levied by the school district and the Borough.
3. No person shall be subject to the payment of the local services tax by
more than one political subdivision during each payroll period.
4. In the case of concurrent employment, an employer shall refrain from
withholding the tax if the employee provides a recent pay statement
from a principal employer that includes the name of the employer, the
length of the payroll period and the amount of the tax withheld and a
statement from the employee that the pay statement is from the
employee's principal employer and the employee will notify other
employers of a change in principal place of employment within two
weeks of its occurrence. The employee's statement shall be provided on
the form approved by DCED.
5. The tax shall be no more than $52 on each person for each calendar
year, irrespective of the number of political subdivisions within which a
person may be employed. The Borough shall provide a taxpayer a
receipt of payment upon request by the taxpayer.
6. No employer shall be held liable for failure to withhold the tax or for the
payment of the withheld tax money to the Borough if the failure to
withhold taxes arises from incorrect information submitted by the
employee as to the employee's place or places of employment, the
employee's principal office or where the employee is principally
employed. Further, an employer shall not be liable for payment of the
local services tax in an amount exceeding the amount withheld by the
employer if the employer complies with the provisions of § 404,
Subsection 2, of this Part and this section and remits the amount so
withheld in accordance with this Part.
7. Employers shall be required to remit the local services taxes 30 days
after the end of each quarter of a calendar year.
§ 405 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 407
1:543
and paid over to the collector on or before the 30th day following the end of
each calendar quarter of each such tax year.
§ 408. Self-Employed Individuals. [Ord. 1137, 11/26/2007]

or engages in any occupation or profession within a primary place of
employment within the Borough of Quakertown shall be required to comply
with this Part and pay the pro-rata portion of the tax due to the collector on
or before the 30th day following the end of each quarter.

26/2007]
§ 410. Nonresidents Subject to Tax. [Ord. 1137, 11/26/2007]
All employers and self-employed individuals residing or having their places
of business outside of the Borough of Quakertown but who perform services
of any type or kind or engage in any occupation or profession within the
Borough of Quakertown do, by virtue thereof, agree to be bound by and
subject themselves to the provisions, penalties and regulations promulgated
under this Part with the same force and effect as though they were residents
of the Borough of Quakertown. Further, any individual engaged in an
occupation within the Borough of Quakertown and an employee of a
nonresidential employer may, for the purpose of this Part, be considered a
self-employed person; and in the event that his or her tax is not paid, the
Borough shall have the option of proceeding against either the employer or
the employee for the collection of this tax as hereinafter provided.
1. The situs of the tax shall be the place of employment on the first day the
person becomes subject to the tax during each payroll period. In the
event that a person is engaged in more than one occupation, that is,
concurrent employment, or an occupation which requires the person
working in more than one political subdivision during a payroll period,
the priority of claim to collect the local services tax shall be in the
following order:
A. First, the political subdivision in which a person maintains his or
her principal office or is principally employed;
B. Second, the political subdivision in which the person resides and
works if the tax is levied by that political subdivision;
C. Third, the political subdivision in which a person is employed and
which imposes the tax nearest in miles to the person's home.
2. In case of dispute, a tax receipt of the taxing authority for that calendar
year declaring that the taxpayer has made prior payment constitutes
prima facie certification of payment to all other political subdivisions.

office or at the office of an authorized collection agent after the due
date. The Borough shall impose a late payment charge or penalty
for remittances received by mail more than five days after the due
date. Such penalties will be calculated each billing period
thereafter only on the overdue portions of the bills, and in no event
shall the penalty charged exceed more than 18% simple interest
per annum.
C. If an undisputed bill remains unpaid for a period of 30 days from
the date the bill is mailed, the Borough reserves the right to
discontinue water service for nonpayment after 10 days' notice
shall have been given according to Subchapter E, Chapter 56, Title
52.

WATER SERVICE; RULES AND REGULATIONS
§ 201. Rules and Regulations a Part of Every Contract for Water
Service. [Ord. 942, 5/3/1989, § 1]
The following rules and regulations shall in the future form a part of every
contract for water service supplied by the Borough, and every consumer
taking water from the Borough agrees to be bound by these rules and
regulations.
§ 202. Application for Service Connections; Consumer Deposits.
[Ord. 942, 5/3/1989, § 2; as amended by Ord. 1109, 3/2/2005, § II]
1. Any property owner desiring the introduction of a service line or lines
from the Borough water mains into his premises must first make a
written application on the form furnished by the Borough, at least one
week before the service is required, stating the street and house
number or location, the name of the owner or tenant, the purpose for
which service will be used, the exact time when the trench from curb to
the property and his service will be ready for making the connection,
and shall guarantee that such service will be used continuously for at
least one year. The application must be signed by the owner of the
premises, or his duly authorized agent, which application, together with
the applicable provisions of this tariff, shall regulate and control the
service of water to such premises.
2. The Borough reserves the right to require a deposit equal to the
estimated gross bill for any single billing period plus one month, with a
minimum of $10, to secure payments for water service rendered where
the credit of the consumer has not been established to the satisfaction
of the Borough. Deposits and refunds shall be administered to the
satisfaction of the Borough. Deposits and refunds shall be administered
in accordance with 52 Pa. Code Chapter 56. Interest at the rate of 6%
per annum shall be paid annually to the consumer or, at the option of
either the Borough or the consumer, shall be applied to reduce bills for
water service in lieu of a cash refund.
3. The Borough will refund said deposit on notice to discontinue service
and after payment in full has been made for all service rendered or
when the consumer shall have paid undisputed bills for service over a
period of 12 consecutive months; and any consumer, having secured the
return of a deposit, shall not be required to make a new deposit unless
the service has been discontinued or the consumer's credit standing
has been impaired through failure to comply with tariff provisions.
4. The payment of any undisputed bill, within the meaning of the Public
Utility Law, shall be payment of the bill, with or without penalty, within
30 days following the period for which the bill was rendered or payment
within 30 days following presentation of the bill, or the payment of any

§ 203. Extension of Mains. [Ord. 942, 5/3/1989, § 3; as amended by
Ord. 1044, 2/4/1998, § 1]
contested bill, payment of which is withheld beyond the period herein
mentioned and the dispute is terminated substantially in favor of the
consumer and payment made by the consumer within 10 days
thereafter.
1. Within the corporate limits of the Borough, the regulations shall be as
follows:
A. Except where provisions of the Subdivision Ordinance [Chapter 22]
provide otherwise, the Borough will extend existing distribution
mains a distance of 25 feet for each bona fide prospective
consumer making application for water service from the main for a
period of one year or more under these rules and regulations.
Those extensions will be made without cost to the consumer.
B. When an extension greater than 25 feet in length for each bona fide
prospective consumer is required or requested, that extension will
be made under terms of an "extension deposit agreement," the
form of which is hereby approved and copies of which are available
at the Borough offices. The Borough shall have the exclusive right
to determine the type and size of mains to be installed and the
other facilities required to render adequate service; provided,
however, that where the Borough decides to install pipe larger than
eight inches in diameter and eight-inch pipe would render
adequate service throughout the extension, all estimated or actual
cost figures referred to in the "extension deposit agreement" shall
include the estimated material cost for pipe eight inches in
diameter. All estimated or actual cost figures referred to in the
"extension deposit agreement" shall include a reasonable
allowance for overhead costs.
C. In determining the length of and necessity for any extension
required pursuant to this section, the terminal point of the
extension shall, in all cases, be at the point in the curbline which is
equidistant from the side property lines of the last lot for which
water service is requested and a street service connection will be
provided only for service lines from the curb to the premises to be
served which are laid in a straight line at right angles to the
curbline.
D. For the purposes of this rule, the following terms are defined:
BONA FIDE PROSPECTIVE CONSUMER — Any owner or lessee
who is or will be the occupant of an existing developed property
having a curbline abutting on that part of a street or public
highway in which there is, or is to be, located a distribution main
of the Borough, who shall file a signed application for a new street
§ 202 QUAKERTOWN CODE § 203
1:562
service connection to those premises and for water service to begin
immediately following installation of the street service connection.
STREET SERVICE CONNECTION — A pipe with appurtenances
used to conduct water from a distribution main of the Borough to
the curbline of the property.
2. Outside of the corporate boundaries of the Borough of Quakertown, the
regulations shall be as follows:
A. Line Extensions. Whenever a developer, owner or occupant of a
property within the service territory of the company requests the
company to extend service to such property, the company will
extend service under the following conditions:
(1) Requests by Bona Fide Service Applicant. Each company shall
file with the Commission, as part of its tariff, a rule setting
forth the conditions under which facilities will be extended to
supply service to an applicant within its service area. Upon
request by a bona fide service applicant, a utility shall
construct line extensions within its franchised territory
consistent with the following directives:
(a) Line extensions to bona fide service applicants shall be
funded without customer advance where the annual
revenue from the line extension will equal or exceed the
company's annual line extension costs.
(b) If the annual revenue from the line extension will not equal
or exceed the company's annual line extension costs, a
bona fide service applicant may be required to provide a
customer advance to the utility's cost of construction for
the line extension. The utility's investment for the line
extension shall be the portion of the total construction
costs which generate annual line extension costs equal to
annual revenue from the line extension. The customer
advance amount shall be determined by subtracting the
utility's investment for the line extension from the total
construction costs.
(c) The company's investment for the line extension shall be
based on the following formula, where X equals the
utility's investment attributed to each bona fide applicant:
X = [AR - OM] / [I + D]
Where:
AR = the company's annual revenue
OM = the company's operating and maintenance
costs
I = the company's current debt ratio multiplied by the
company's weighted long-term debt cost rate
§ 203 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 203
1:563
D = the company's current depreciation accrual rate
(2) Customer Advance Financing, Refunds and Facilities on
Private Property.
(a) When a customer advance is required of a service
applicant and an additional customer or customers attach
service lines to the line extension within 10 years, the
utility shall refund a portion of the advance to the
customer. Deposits made for additional facilities other
than the line extension, such as booster pumps, storage
tanks and the like, are contributions in aid of construction
and need not be refunded.
(b) The company will refund to the applicant, during a period
of 10 years from the date of the extension deposit, a percustomer
amount for each additional bona fide service
applicant from whom a street service connection shall be
directly attached to such main extension as distinguished
from extensions or branches thereof; provided, however,
that the total amount refunded shall not exceed the
original deposit without interest; and provided that all or
any part of the deposit not refunded within said ten-year
period shall become the property of the company and shall
be treated as contributions in aid of construction for ratemaking
purposes. The per-customer refund amount shall
equal the utility's investment attributed to each bona fide
applicant as calculated in the formula contained in this
tariff.
(c) A utility shall require a customer to pay, in advance, a
reasonable charge for service lines and equipment
installed on private property for the exclusive use of the
customer.
(d) Special utility service shall mean residential or business
service which exceeds that required for ordinary
residential purposes. Subsection 2A(1)(a) through 2A(1)(c)
of this tariff does not apply to special utility service. By
way of illustration and not limitation, special utility service
shall include: the installation of facilities such as oversized
mains, booster pumps and storage tanks as necessary to
provide adequate flows or to meet specific pressure
criteria or service to large water-consuming commercial
and industrial facilities. An otherwise bona fide applicant
requesting service which includes a "special utility
service" component is entitled to bona fide applicant
status, including the corresponding company contribution
toward the costs to the line extension which do not meet
the special utility service criteria.
§ 203 QUAKERTOWN CODE § 203
1:564
(3) Requirement for Extension Deposit Agreement. Where
extension of facilities is not fully funded by the company
pursuant to Rule 1 of Subsection 2A(1) above, the execution by
the applicant of an extension deposit agreement for customer
contribution or advance shall be a condition of extending the
facilities. Upon notice that the company is prepared and able to
go forward with the work, the applicant will deposit with the
company the amount specified in the extension deposit
agreement.
(4) Size of Line. The company shall have the exclusive right to
determine the type and size of lines to be installed and the
other facilities required to render adequate service. However,
where the company decides to install a pipe larger than
necessary to render extension of adequate service to the
applicant, estimated or actual cost figures in the extension
deposit agreement shall include only the material and
installation cost for a pipe the size of which is necessary to
provide adequate service to the applicant. Any incremental
costs of a larger pipe will be the responsibility of the company.
All estimated or actual cost figures referred to in the extension
deposit agreement shall include a reasonable allowance for
overhead costs and taxes as appropriate. The minimum pipe
size for main extensions will be six inches pursuant to
Commission regulation at 52 Pa. Code § 65.17(b).
(5) Length of Extension. In determining the necessary length of an
extension, the terminal point of such extension shall be at that
point in the curbline which is equidistant from the side
property lines of the last lot for which water service is
requested. A company service connection will be provided only
for customer service lines that extend at right angles from the
curbline in a straight line to the premises to be served.
(6) Cost True-up. At the conclusion of the line extension project,
there shall be a reconciliation of the actual costs incurred to
the amount of extension deposit that has been paid by the
customer. If the actual cost exceeds the deposit, the applicant
shall be responsible for payment to the company of the
difference. If the deposit exceeds the actual cost, the company
shall refund the difference.
(7) For the purposes of this rule, the following terms are defined:
ANNUAL LINE EXTENSION COSTS — The sum of a company's
additional annual operating and maintenance costs, debt costs
and depreciation charges associated with the construction,
operation and maintenance of the line extension.

nature and size to the bona fide service applicant.
BONA FIDE SERVICE APPLICANT (FOR LINE EXTENSION
PURPOSES) — A person or entity applying for water service
to an existing or proposed structure within the utility's
certificated service territory for which a valid occupancy or
building permit has been issued if the structure is either a
primary residence of the applicant or a place of business. An
applicant shall not be deemed a bona fide service applicant if:
COMPANY SERVICE LINE — The water line from the
distribution facilities of the company which connects to the
customer service line at the hypothetical or actual line or
the actual property line, including the control valve and valve
box. The control valve and valve box determine the terminal
point for the company's responsibility for the street service
connection.

Whenever a supply of water is desired, or a request for pipe replacement
is made, the Manager shall, upon payment of any applicable fee, authorize
the Superintendent of the Water Department to lay and thereafter maintain
a pipe from the main to a point within the curbline, or in the case of
mains located in alleys, to a point within the nearest property line of the
applicant. At the terminus of that pipe he shall cause a stop cock to be
affixed, protected by a curb box. The Borough reserves the right to refuse to
install service lines until the consumer has first dug his trench as far as the
curb or property line in case of alley installations, and installed his service
line, ready to be connected to the Borough system.
§ 205. Private Fire-Protection Facilities. [Ord. 942, 5/3/1989, § 5]
Private fire-protection service facilities will be installed at the request of
a consumer or prospective consumer where water main facilities are of

or its duly authorized agent before the water will be turned on. When
requested in writing by the property owner, application for a supply of
water to property within the Borough may be received from a tenant under
the condition that the owner act as guarantor for the payment of all bills
as rendered. If a tenant neglects to make any payment within the time
specified, it will be the responsibility of the owner to make that payment. No
service will be furnished by the Borough to any applicant, whether owner
or tenant, until all arrears for water rents, water repairs or other charges
other variable costs based on the current total company level
of such costs, as well as costs particular to the specific needs
of that customer, such as line flushing.

be allowed to supply other persons or families or other premises, except by
written permit from the Borough. Under no circumstances will the Borough
furnish water for resale.
§ 208. Maintenance of Service Lines From Curb. [Ord. 942, 5/3/
1989, § 8]
The service line beyond the curb stop shall be installed and maintained
in good working order by and at the expense of the consumer. All leaks
between curb box and meter shall be repaired on discovery by the
consumer. The portion of the service line installed by the consumer shall
not be less in size and quality than the service line in the street laid by
the Borough, shall be laid not less than three feet, six inches below the
surface, and shall not be covered until the tap on the main is made and the
service line tested. If any defects in workmanship or material are found, the
service shall not be turned on until those defects are remedied. All plumbing
connections should be able to withstand a pressure of at least 125 pounds
per square inch. No service line shall be laid in the same trench with a
sewer or gas service connection without the approval of the Manager or his
designated representative.
§ 209. Meter Installation. [Ord. 942, 5/3/1989, § 9]
1. Water consumption shall be measured by meter registration. Meters
shall be provided by and installed at the expense of the Borough.
Meters larger than 1 1/2 inches shall be provided and installed by the
consumer at his own expense; provided, further, that the expense of
preparing the service pipe for receipt of the meter and the expense of
installing a cutoff valve between the curb box and the meter shall be
borne by the consumer. All meters provided by the Borough shall
remain the property of the Borough.
2. The location and type of meter and the type of connection shall be
subject to approval by the Borough. If the Borough decides that the
meter is to be placed within the building, the consumer shall provide,
free of charge and expense to the Borough, a readily accessible place in
the cellar or basement near the entrance of service pipes, with a stopand-
waste cock at the inlet side of the meter. If the Borough decides
that the meter is to be placed outside the building, it shall be placed in
an approved meter box furnished by the Borough at the expense of the
consumer and shall have suitable stop-and-waste valves approved by
the Borough. Access to premises for reading the meter, inspection,
testing, repairs, etc., shall be permitted by the consumer at all
reasonable times.

1:568
§ 210. Protection of Meters. [Ord. 942, 5/3/1989, § 10]
The consumer shall, at all times, properly protect the meter from injury
by frost or hot water or any other causes and will be held responsible
for repairs to a meter made necessary by his negligence. Damage from
freezing, hot water or external causes shall be paid for by the consumer.
In no case and under no circumstances shall any consumer or other person
interfere with the meter dials.
§ 211. Reading Meters. [Ord. 942, 5/3/1989, § 11; as amended by
Ord. 1196, 11/7/2012]
All meters shall be read monthly, insofar as possible, and the quantities
recorded by the meter shall be considered conclusive on both the consumer
and the Borough, except when the meter has been found to register
incorrectly or has ceased to register. In that event, the Borough will
estimate water consumption in accordance with § 213. The consumer shall
be responsible for arranging for access to the property by the Borough’s
meter reader. In the event that a scheduled reading of meters cannot be
obtained because of inability to gain access to the meter location, the
Borough reserves the right to estimate the amount of the bill. The bills
so determined shall have the same force and effect as if the meters had
been read and shall be paid in accordance with the terms of the applicable
schedule. The bills so rendered may be subject to review in the case of
unusual circumstances reported by the consumer or wherever irregularity
in use is readily apparent to the Borough, provided that the Borough is
under no obligation to make those adjustments when the reported
discrepancies are not readily apparent. The Borough reserves the right to
disconnect service to any consumer who refuses or persistently neglects to
arrange for access to meters by the Borough’s meter reader.
§ 212. Testing Meters. [Ord. 942, 5/3/1989, § 12; as amended by
Ord. 1004, 7/6/1994]
3. All meters shall be maintained by the Borough so far as ordinary wear
and tear is concerned, and the Borough will replace meters at its
expense, but the consumer will be held responsible for maintenance
and replacement costs in the case of meters damaged by freezing, hot
water, negligence or carelessness.
1. The Borough shall make a test of the accuracy of any meter when it
deems such test to be necessary, or upon the written request of a
consumer; and, in the latter case, upon payment of the fee hereinafter
specified. When the consumer desires personally, or by a
representative, to witness the testing of a meter, he may require the
seal of the meter to be broken in his presence or that of his
representative. Any deposit made by a consumer hereunder will be
returned if the meter is found to be in error more than 4% otherwise,
the deposit will be retained by the Borough to cover the cost of the test.

§ 213. Adjustment of Bills for Meter Errors. [Ord. 942, 5/3/1989,
§ 13]
§ 214. Meters and Water Facilities Shall Not be Tampered With.
[Ord. 942, 5/3/1989, § 14]
No person shall open or close or otherwise tamper with the curb stops,
valves or hydrants in any public or private water line without the express
permission of the Borough Manager or his representative; provided that fire
hydrants may be opened in case of fire and by fire companies to test the
hydrants under supervision of an agent of the Borough. No meter shall be
tampered with, nor shall any seal thereon be broken or otherwise tampered
with. When any seal is broken, the Borough reserves the right to remove the
meter for test at the expense of the consumer and to otherwise enforce any
penalties prescribed by law applicable under the circumstances.
§ 215. Leaks and Defective Plumbing. [Ord. 942, 5/3/1989, § 15]
2. Each request for test of a meter for accuracy shall be accompanied by a
deposit governed by the size of the meter and as established from time
to time by resolution of Borough Council.
1. Fast Meters. If, upon test of a meter, the meter is found to have an error
of more than 4% fast, the Borough shall refund to the consumer the
overcharge based upon what the meter would have registered had it
not been fast or slow for a period equal to 1/2 the time elapsed since the
last previous test but not to exceed 12 months. If the period of
registration error can be definitely fixed with a reasonable degree of
certainty, the overcharge shall be computed for the period.
2. Slow Meters. If upon a test of a meter, the meter is found to have an
error of more than 4% slow, the Borough may render a bill for the water
consumed but not covered by previously rendered bills equal to the
time elapsed since the last previous test but not to exceed 12 months. If
the period of registration error can be definitely fixed with a reasonable
degree of certainty, the charge may be computed for the period.
3. Nonregistering Meters. If a meter is found not to have registered for a
period or not to have fully measured the entire flow due to meter
interference, the Borough shall compute the water used by taking the
average of the water used for the nearest meter reading period
immediately preceding and the meter reading period immediately
following the date when the meter was found to be not registering or
interfered with, which amount shall be assumed to be the amount of
water used by the consumer during the billing period in which the
meter was found not to have registered. Exceptions may be made only if
the facts clearly show that the stated method does not give the correct
consumption for the period.
1. The Borough shall not be liable for any damage resulting from leaks,
broken pipes, or from any other cause, occurring to or within any house
§ 212 QUAKERTOWN CODE § 215
1:570
§ 216. Control of Water Supply. [Ord. 942, 5/3/1989, § 16]
§ 217. Vacating Premises. [Ord. 942, 5/3/1989, § 17]
or building, and it is expressly agreed that no claims shall be made
against the Borough for damage caused by the bursting or breaking of
any main or service pipe or of any attachment thereto.
2. The Borough may at any time require an owner or tenant to install in
connection with his service pipes, such valves, regulators, tanks, or
other apparatus as may be in the opinion of the Borough Engineer,
required for the safeguarding and protection of the Borough's property
or water supply.
3. In the case of leaks, the location of which are not readily apparent, the
Borough will, upon the request of the consumer, open the line in and
about the curb stop for the purpose of determining the responsibility for
same. The Borough shall assume the costs of the work incidental
thereto if it is found that the leak is located between the curb stop and
main; provided, however, that when the leak is determined to be
between the curb stop and the premises, the consumer shall reimburse
the Borough for the actual cost of the work engaged in to determine
responsibility.
1. The Borough reserves the right to restrict the supply of water in case of
scarcity, or whenever the public welfare may require it, and shall not be
liable for any claim or damage arising from a shortage of water, a
deficiency or failure in supply when occasioned by shutting off water for
repairs, the breaking of machinery or facilities, or any cause beyond its
control.
2. It is the determination of Borough Council that residential customers
must of necessity have priority in any available water supply, and it is
deemed that in case of emergency conditions, which may arise, it could
be necessary to temporarily restrict the use of water. If such emergency
conditions should arise, whereby there is not sufficient water to serve
customers, the Borough Manager is authorized to restrict the use of
available water as outlined in Borough ordinances.
1. When any premises is vacated, the consumer shall give at least 24
hours' notice at the office of the Borough, so that water may be turned

If the Borough experiences a short-term water supply shortage or other
emergency condition, the Borough may request general conservation of
water uses by its customers and may impose mandatory conservation
measures deemed necessary to reduce or eliminate nonessential uses of
water. Water emergency conservation measures will continue in effect until
terminated by the Borough. The Council of the Borough of Quakertown, or
the Borough Manager, is authorized to declare a water emergency and to
impose water use restrictions.
§ 322. Curtailment of Nonessential Use. [Ord. 943, 5/3/1989, § 2]
1. In the event of a short-term water supply shortage or any other

ARTICLE C.
Water Rationing Plan.
§ 331. Purpose. [Ord. 1028, 7/3/1996, § 1]
This local water rationing plan is intended to establish measures for
essential conservation of water resources and to provide for equitable
distribution of limited water supplies, in order to balance demand and
limited available supplies and to assure that sufficient water is available to
preserve public health and safety within the emergency service area.
§ 332. Scope. [Ord. 1028, 7/3/1996, § 1]
This local water rationing plan shall apply to all water uses within the
service area of the Borough of Quakertown Water Department, hereinafter
referred to as “Water Department.”
§ 333. Objective of the Plan. [Ord. 1028, 7/3/1996, § 1]
§ 334. Prohibited Nonessential Water Uses. [Ord. 1028, 7/3/1996,
§ 1]
1. It is imperative that water customers within the emergency service area
achieve an immediate and further reduction in the water use in order to
extend existing water supplies and, at the same time, assure that
sufficient water is available to preserve the public health and sanitation
and provide fire protection service.
2. The objective of this local water rationing plan is to effect an immediate
25% reduction in the water usage. This reduction equals 0.425 million
gallons per day, based on the DRBC Docket No. D-92-79 CP total
allocation for the system of 51.1 million gallons per 30 days. Should
drought conditions continue, further reduction in usage may be
required. If it is necessary to implement further reductions, this plan
will be modified as noted § 344 of this Part. It is the Water Department's
responsibility to continually monitor on-hand quantities to determine if
amendments are required.
3. The plan provides for equitable reductions in water usage on the part of
each water customer. The success of this plan depends on the
cooperation of all water customers in the emergency service area.
1. The following water uses are declared nonessential and are prohibited
within the emergency service area:
A. The watering of lawns.
B. The watering of outdoor gardens, landscaped areas, trees, shrubs
and other outdoor plants, except by means of a bucket, pail or
hand-held hose equipped with an automatic shutoff nozzle between
the hours of 5:00 p.m. and 9:00 a.m.
§ 331 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 334
1:583
C. The noncommercial washing of automobiles and trucks.
D. The washing of streets, driveways and sidewalks.
E. The serving of water in restaurants, clubs or eating places unless
specifically requested by the individual.
F. Ornamental use, including but not limited to fountains, artificial
waterfalls and reflecting pools.
G. The use of water for flushing sewers or hydrants by any public or
private individual or entity except as deemed necessary and
approved in the interest of public health or safety by municipal
health officials.
H. The use of fire hydrants by fire companies for testing fire apparatus
and for fire department drills except as deemed necessary in the
interest of public safety and specifically approved by the Borough
Council.
I. The use of fire hydrants by Borough road departments, contractors
and all others, except as necessary for fire-fighting or fire
protection purposes.
J. The use of water to fill and top off swimming pools.
2. Exemption or Variance from Nonessential Uses of Water Restrictions.
A. If compliance with the nonessential use of water restrictions would
result in extraordinary hardship upon a water user, the water user
may apply for an exemption or variance. For purposes of this
section, “extraordinary hardship” means a permanent damage to
property or other personal or economic loss which is substantially
more severe that the sacrifices borne by the water users subject to
the nonessential use of water restrictions.
B. A person or business entity believing he suffers an extraordinary
hardship and desiring to be wholly or partially exempt from the
restrictions or the nonessential use of water shall submit a written
request with full documentation supporting the need for the
requested relief to the Borough Manager. The application shall
contain information specifying:
(1) The nature of the hardship claimed and reason for the
requested exemption or variance.
(2) The efforts taken by applicant to conserve water and extent to
which water use may be reduced by the applicant without
extraordinary hardship.
C. The Borough Manager shall advise the applicant of its decision
regarding the application. An exemption or variance will be

§ 335. General Requirements for Water Use Reductions. [Ord. 1028,
7/3/1996, § 1]
Each and every water customer, regardless of whether residential,
commercial, industrial, municipal, institutional or other type of user, shall
achieve the water use reduction set forth in this local water rationing
plan. In order to achieve the overall objectives of the plan, the water use
restrictions and limitations set forth in §§ 336-338 shall apply.
§ 336. Water Use Restrictions for Residential Users. [Ord. 1028, 7/
3/1996, § 1]
granted only to the extent necessary to relieve extraordinary
hardship.
D. Any person aggrieved by a decision relating to such an exemption
or variance rendered by the Borough of Quakertown or the Public
Utility Commission may also file an appeal with the Commonwealth
Drought Coordinator, who shall render a final decision.
1. Metered Residential Water Customers and Allotments.
A. The number of permanent residents in each dwelling unit
(household) will determine the amount of water that each
household will be allowed.
B. Each dwelling unit (household) shall be allotted 40 gallons per day
for each resident of the household. Households with only one
permanent resident will have a daily allotment of 55 gallons.
C. Residential water customers are required to provide Water
Department personnel with reasonable access to read meters as
necessary to implement this rationing plan. Where access is not
readily available, the Water Department shall make all reasonable
efforts to contact customers in order to arrange for access to read
meters. In the event a water customer does not allow Water
Department personnel entry to read the meter, after the Water
Department has made reasonable efforts to arrange for such
access, the dwelling unit (household) allotment will be reduced to
55 gallons per day.
2. Variance and Exceptions.
A. Where the residential allotment provided under this section would
create extraordinary hardship, as in the case of special healthrelated
requirements, the water customer may apply to the
Borough Manager for an exemption or variance from these
requirements. If the Borough Manager finds that the allotment
provided in this section would impose extraordinary hardship, the
Borough Manager may establish a revised allotment for the
particular customer. For these purposes, an "extraordinary
hardship" means a permanent damage to property or economic loss

§ 337. Water Use Restrictions for Nonresidential Water Customers.
[Ord. 1028, 7/3/1996, § 1]
which is substantially more severe that the sacrifices borne by
other water users subject to this water rationing plan.
B. Any person aggrieved by a decision relating to such an exemption
or variance rendered by the Borough Manager may file a complaint
with the Public Utility Commission in accordance with the
procedures established under the Public Utility Code.
C. Any person aggrieved by a decision relating to such an exemption
or variance rendered by the Borough Manager or Public Utility
Commission may also file an appeal with the Commonwealth of
Drought Coordinator, who shall render a final decision.
1. Nonresidential customers include commercial, industrial, institutional,
public and all other users, with the exception of hospitals and health
care facilities.
2. Nonresidential water customers shall reduce their water usage by a
minimum of 25% of use levels for the same quarter of the preceding
year.
3. It is the primary responsibility of each nonresidential water customer to
meet its mandated water use reduction goal in whatever manner
possible.
4. The Water Department will establish a water allotment for each
nonresidential water customer, based upon a required 25% reduction of
water usage from the rate of water used by the customer in the same
quarter of the preceding year or the last recorded use level if no meter
readings record the rate of the customer's use in the same quarter of
the preceding year.
5. Each nonresidential water user shall provide to Water Department
personnel for purposes of meter reading and monitoring of compliance
with this plan. The Water Department shall make all reasonable efforts
to contact customers to arrange for access.
6. Variance.
A. If the mandated 25% reduction in water usage cannot be obtained
without imposing extraordinary hardship threatening health and
safety, the nonresidential customer may apply to the Borough
Manager for a variance. For these purposes, "extraordinary
hardship" means a permanent damage to property or economic loss
which is substantially more severe than the sacrifices borne by the
other water users subject to this water rationing plan. If the
Borough Manager finds that the 25% reduction would cause
extraordinary hardship or threaten health or safety, the Borough

may also appeal the decision to the Commonwealth Drought
Coordinator, who shall render a final decision.
1. Hospitals and health care facilities shall comply with all restrictions
imposed on residential and nonresidential water customers as may be
applicable to each individual institution, to the extent compliance will
not endanger the health of the patients or residents of the institution.
2. Each hospital and health care facility shall survey its water usage
patterns and requirements and implement such additional conservation
measures as may be possible without endangering the health of
patients or residents to achieve a 25% reduction in the institution's
water usage.
1. The Borough Manager will have lead responsibility for monitoring of
compliance with this water rationing plan.
2. The Borough Manager is also authorized to alter meter reading
schedules to assure adequate monitoring of compliance with the plan.
3. The Water Department shall institute procedures to closely monitor
supplies and current usage to determine if reductions are being
attained consistent with the target figures established in the plan. The
Borough Manager shall establish a mechanism to advise the water
users of the effect of rationing.
4. Proper law enforcement authorities and private citizens have additional

1. Purpose. The general intent of the Pedestrian-Oriented, Mixed-Use
Overlay District is to encourage the rehabilitation and reuse of existing
structures within the Borough of Quakertown (Borough) by promoting
the development of integrated, multi-use projects. This overlay district
also aims to preserve and encourage the pedestrian character of
downtown Quakertown and to promote street life and activity by
regulating the built environment and its interface with the public realm.
Redevelopment opportunities advocated by this overlay are intended to
ensure efficient use of land and public services; encourage human
interaction; foster a sense of place; create safe, attractive, and
convenient environments; and increase development alternatives. The
purpose of the Pedestrian-Oriented, Mixed-Use Overlay District is as
follows:
A. Economic development through the establishment of flexible
standards that maintain the community's unique identity while
allowing for changes in the marketplace.
B. Retain the historic streetscape by preserving existing historic
buildings to the greatest extent possible. Promote the reuse of
structures, and ensure that new buildings, additions, and
renovations are consistent with and enhance the surrounding
character and scale of historic Quakertown.
C. Allow a mixture of complementary land uses to create economic
and social vitality and to encourage the linking of trips. Encourage
retail uses on the ground floor street frontage, and make use of
second and higher floors to accommodate office, service,
§ 314 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 314.1
1:643
residential, and other uses that generate relatively low pedestrian
traffic from the general public.
D. Encourage lively, human-scaled activity areas and gathering places
for the community through a mix of uses. Develop sidewalks and
building features (e.g., entrances, weather protection) to maximize
safety, comfort, ease of movement, and convenience for pedestrians
of all physical abilities.
E. Establish a walkable community by promoting pedestrian-oriented
streets and buildings, and provide a safe and convenient
interconnected sidewalk network and access to land areas
remaining undeveloped or underdeveloped.
F. Facilitate development (land use mix, density, and design) that
supports multimodal travel and public transit, where applicable,
and minimizes the amount of land that is needed for surface
parking.
G. Accommodate parking in a convenient manner that does not
interfere with the rhythm of the street.
H. Promote the implementation of the Borough of Quakertown Urban
Vision and Revitalization Plan, adopted April 7, 2010.
2. Eligibility.
A. Establishment and Designation of the Pedestrian-Oriented, Mixed-
Use Overlay District. The provisions of the Pedestrian-Oriented
Mixed-Use Overlay Zoning District shall apply to all development
within the boundary of the designated area. If a use in an
underlying district is permitted differently from how the same use
is permitted in this overlay district (i.e., permitted by right, by

underlying zoning district shall apply. In cases where a use is
permitted in the underlying district but not in the overlay, all
provisions, such as area and dimensional requirements, of the
underlying district shall apply. Regardless of whether the overlay
or underlying district is used to determine how a use is permitted,
compliance with the design guidelines for the Pedestrian-Oriented,

(7) Architectural plans as submitted as part of approval.
Architectural plans shall be required to be submitted as part of
said application for conditional use.
(8) Building Character. New infill development shall employ
building types that are compatible with the historic
architecture of the area in massing and external treatment.
(9) Architectural Rhythm.
(a) New infill development shall retain the historic
architectural rhythm of building openings (including

Borough development and circulation patterns.
(15) When outdoor collection stations are provided for garbage and
trash removal, such stations shall be located to the rear of the
structure and screened from view.
B. Conditional Uses. Unless permitted differently in the underlying

7. Design Guidelines. The following design standards are applicable for all
new developments and additions/alterations along the street frontage
within the Pedestrian-Oriented, Mixed-Use Overlay District. These
design guidelines may be modified by Borough Council to take into
account the variety of buildings in the overlay district and to allow
flexibility.
A. Building Design Standards.
(1) Within the Historic Preservation Overlay Zone, any alterations
of existing buildings or new infill development shall meet all
applicable provisions of § 319, Historic Preservation, of this
chapter. New infill development should be consistent with the
scale and composition of existing historical structures and
compatible with the traditional architectural styles present in
the overlay district. For new construction, the applicant shall
be required to submit a report providing sufficient detail to
demonstrate how the proposed project design is consistent
with the traditional architectural styles present in the overlay.
The report shall contain architectural drawings of proposed
building(s) showing all sides, with information on building
materials and colors. The report shall also contain photographs
of the original site in which the proposed development will
occur, prior to any changes being made, showing surrounding
areas and how the new development will relate to the existing
surroundings.
(2) For infill development, the front wall of the structure (building
facade) shall be placed along the sidewalk. If adjacent
structures are set back from the sidewalk, the setback of the
infill building shall match either of the existing adjacent
setbacks with a maximum setback of 20 feet.
(3) Cornices or columns that have been reclad should be returned
to their original material where possible.
(4) Building Orientation and Entrances.
(a) The front facade of buildings shall be oriented toward the
higher-order street whenever possible, with the public
entrance in this front facade and with required off-street
parking at the rear or side of the lot.
(b) When buildings are located on corners, the entrance shall
be located on the corner with an appropriate building
articulation, such as a chamfered corner, turret, canopy, or
other similar building feature.
§ 314.1 QUAKERTOWN CODE § 314.1
1:650
(c) Building entrances shall incorporate elements such as
porches, alcoves, porticos, awnings, or any combination of
the foregoing that protects pedestrians from the rain and
wind.
(d) Fixed or retractable awnings are permitted at ground floor
level located at the building transom, if they complement a
building's architectural features, do not impair facade
composition, and are designed or added as an integral part
of the facade. Awnings should be traditional fabric foldout
awnings; metal and/or internally lit (backlighted) awnings
are prohibited. The lowest point of any awning shall be a
minimum of eight feet from the highest point of the
finished grade of the sidewalk, driveway or walkway to a
maximum of 12 feet above finished grade. Awnings shall
extend from the facade wall and may encroach within the
right-of-way but shall not extend past the curbline.
Awnings attached to a single building shall be consistent in
height and in design. Where striped awnings are used,
each stripe shall have a minimum width of six inches.
Awning lighting shall be recessed in the awning with no
lens extending below the awning surface. Awnings shall be
constructed of durable materials and shall be kept in good
condition and repair. Any awning which is allowed to
become dilapidated may, after notification, be removed by
the Borough at the expense of the owner or lessee of the
property on which it is located.
(e) New doors shall not swing into the minimum setback,
except for emergency exit doors.
(5) Walls and Windows.
(a) Blank walls shall not be permitted along any exterior wall
facing a street, parking area, or walking area. Walls or
portions of walls where windows are not provided shall
have architectural treatments that are similar to the front
facade, including materials, colors, and details. Expanses
of blank walls may not exceed 20 feet in length or 80%,
whichever is less, of any exterior wall facing a street,
parking area, or walking area. At least four of the following
architectural treatments shall be provided:
[1] Masonry (but not flat concrete block).
[2] Concrete or masonry plinth at the base of the wall.
[3] Belt courses of a different texture or color.

60% to a maximum of 75% window area, with views
provided through these windows into the business.
The base of the ground floor windows shall be a
minimum of 12 inches and a maximum of 20 inches
above the sidewalk.
[2] Upper-story windows of front facades shall not be
boarded or covered and shall comprise a minimum of
35% window area in the facade above the ground floor
and a maximum of 75%. Upper-story windows shall be
vertically proportioned.
[3] Smoked, reflective, or black-tinted glass in windows is
prohibited. Exterior window bars shall not be
permitted.
[4] Transom windows should not be covered.
[5] Window openings shall have a style and be spaced as
to be complementary to the desired rhythm of the
POMU District. Windows shall not be mounted flush to
the exterior of the facade.
(6) Roofs shall be in keeping with the character of adjacent
buildings or shall have pitched roofs. Pitched roofs shall have a
minimum slope of 4:12 and a maximum slope of 12:12.
(7) Architectural Rhythm.
(a) New infill development shall retain the historic
architectural rhythm of building openings (including
windows and entries) of the same block.
§ 314.1 QUAKERTOWN CODE § 314.1
1:652
(b) New infill development shall attempt to maintain the
horizontal rhythm of existing street facades by using a
similar alignment of windows, floor spacing, cornices,
awnings as well as other elements. This rhythm shall be
achieved by aligning the top, middle, and base floors.
Buildings shall have a distinct base at ground level using
articulation or materials such as stone, masonry, or
decorative concrete. The top level should be treated with a
distinct outline with elements such as projecting parapet,
cornice, or other projection.
(8) Massing.
(a) Buildings shall be similar in height and size or articulated
into massing that is more or less proportional to adjacent
structures and maintains the existing architectural
rhythm.
(b) The massing of any facade should generally not exceed 50
feet maximum (horizontal dimension). Shop fronts may be
broken down even further. Massing variations every 30
feet or less is preferred.
(c) Nonresidential buildings must have at least a three-foot to
five-foot break in depth in all street facades for every 50
feet of continuous facade. Such breaks may be met
through the use of bay windows, porches, porticos,
building extensions, towers, recessed doorways, and other
architectural treatments.
B. Pedestrian Design Standards.
(1) Sidewalks are required along all street frontages with a
minimum width of eight feet, unless, at the discretion of
Borough Council, a narrower sidewalk is determined to be
preferable.
(2) Sidewalks are required to connect the street frontage to all
front building entrances, parking areas, central open space,
and any other destination that generates pedestrian traffic.
Sidewalks shall connect to existing sidewalks on abutting
tracts and other nearby pedestrian destination points and
transit stops.
(3) The sidewalk pattern shall continue across driveways.
(4) Unless determined unnecessary by Borough Council, bicycle
racks and other bicycle-friendly facilities shall be provided
throughout the overlay district for all nonresidential uses
requiring 20 off-street parking spaces or more as calculated
through the requirements of Table 6.1 of this chapter,42
whether or not such use is located in the TC District. The
§ 314.1 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 314.1
1:653
number of bicycle parking spaces shall be equal to 5% of
the required off-street parking. Such racks and facilities shall
be provided with a metal anchor that will secure the frame
in conjunction with a user-supplied lock. Bicycle racks and
other bicycle-friendly facilities shall be located within 50 feet
of building entrances and placed to avoid conflicts with
pedestrians. Where placed on a sidewalk, the rack/facility must
be positioned to maintain five feet of clear pedestrian space.
C. Streetscape Standards.
(1) Street trees shall be provided at the discretion of Borough
Council.
(2) Street furniture, such as public benches, tables, and waste
receptacles, shall be included in design layout to encourage
pedestrian traffic and social interaction. Benches and waste
containers shall be provided at a minimum of one per every
100 feet along pedestrian walkways, sidewalks or street
frontages.
(3) The incorporation of beautifying elements such as hanging
flower baskets, street planters, and window boxes is strongly
encouraged to be incorporated into the design of facade
appearance. Such elements shall not obstruct sight triangles
and shall not encroach into the sidewalk so that less than five
feet of passageway is available for pedestrians. Window boxes
should be at least as wide as the window sill where they are
located (at least six inches by six inches deep). Hanging
baskets, planters, and window boxes shall contain live
plantings.

provided in Title 68, Part II, Subpart E, Chapter 55, of the
Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes, as amended, which are
hereby included by reference; to serve the overall objectives of
this chapter and the following purposes:
(a) To recognize the adverse secondary impacts of adultoriented
establishments that affect health, safety and

communicable diseases, increases in blight, decreases in
the stability of residential neighborhoods, decreases in
property values for surrounding homes, and decreases in
the marketability of nearby commercial business space.
The research conducted across the nation concludes that

self-regulation to control these secondary effects.

these secondary impacts can be minimized, particularly as
they affect residential neighborhoods and commercial
revitalization.

consisting of historic and architecturally significant buildings
identified in the Quakertown Historic Building Inventory
(hereinafter referred to as the "inventory") attached hereto.53
Demolition of historically and architecturally significant buildings
shall be as a conditional use that may be denied or allowed by
Quakertown Borough Council (hereinafter referred to as "Council")
after a recommendation from the Quakertown Planning
Commission (hereinafter referred to as the "Planning
Commission"). In making a decision on the conditional use
53.Editor's Note: See § 319, Subsection 3.
§ 318 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 319
1:701
application, Borough Council may attach reasonable conditions and
safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement the purposes of
these demolition provisions and any other provisions of the Zoning
Ordinance.
B. This section is created pursuant to authority contained in the Act of
1968, P.L. 805, No. 247, as enacted and amended, known as the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code (Sections 603, 604, and
605). The Borough shall hereby create an ordinance in order to: (1)
promote, protect, and facilitate the preservation of areas of historic
significance; (2) preserve the historic values in the community; (3)
provide for the protection of historic features and resources; and
(4) protect places having unique historical, architectural or
patriotic interest or value. This section is also established pursuant
to Article 1, Section 27, of the Pennsylvania Constitution, which
states that "the people have a right to clean air, pure water, and
preservation of the natural, scenic, historic and aesthetic values of
the environment."
2. Purpose and Intent. It is the purpose and intent of the Borough to
preserve and protect buildings of historic value that exist within the
Borough. The Borough has marry historic buildings worthy of
preservation from the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries. The Pennsylvania
Historical and Museum Commission has determined that the
Quakertown Historic District (hereinafter referred to as the "District")
is eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places.
Preservation of the historic buildings in the District and other buildings
outside the District and identified on the inventory is in the best interest
of the health, prosperity, welfare, cultural and environmental values of
the people of the Borough by enhancing property values, and improving
aesthetics of the built and natural environment.
3. Quakertown Historic Building Inventory.
A. The Planning Commission, based on the advice of a qualified
historic preservation consultant, shall recommend to Council that

official list of historic buildings regulated by this section.
B. Historic buildings newly designated as National Historic
Landmarks, or listed on the National Register of Historic Places, by

of the underlying zoning districts shall remain in full effect, except that
demolition of buildings in the Overlay Zone shall be allowed only by
conditional use.
5. Conditional Use Approval Criteria. In considering conditional use
approval, Council shall presume that the demolition of the buildings
listed on the inventory is not warranted. Council shall consider the
historical and architectural significance of the building, as well as its
current use, size, location, visibility and cultural value. Council may
seek testimony and documentary evidence from persons knowledgeable
about historic resources in the Borough, and may, based on the
evidence presented, deny the applicant's request for a conditional use
permit to demolish the building. Council shall also consider the
testimony of the applicant and the applicant's representative(s)
including any documentary evidence that may justify, structurally or
financially, that the historic building should be demolished.

building is acceptable, it may impose any or all of the following
conditions and safeguards on the applicant in order to implement
the purposes of this ordinance:

document the historical and architectural features of the
building proposed for demolition, including but not limited to,
photographs, floor plane, a videotaped recording, a site plan, a
historical narrative, or a written architectural description of
the building. Council may also require that recording and
documentation of the building be carried out by a qualified
historic preservation consultant. Council may require the
applicant to provide a sufficient number of copies of the
complete record and documentation as required in this
paragraph to the Borough. If the building proposed for

not immediately proposed after the demolition of an historic
building (such as properties proposed to be used as vacant lots,
parking lots, open space or parks) be appropriately
landscaped. Council may require landscape features, elements
and vegetation that are appropriate to the architectural
qualities and amenities of the surrounding historic buildings.
(7) Other reasonable conditions and safeguards may be imposed
upon the applicant in order to implement the purposes of this
section.
B. If the applicant does not agree with the conditions of the
conditional use approval, Council may choose to not approve the

period up to a maximum time extension period of three years.
B. Other Uses. If a nonconforming use other than a commercial or
industrial use of a building or land is discontinued, razed, removed
or abandoned for one year (365 consecutive days), subsequent use
of such building or land shall conform with the regulations of the
district in which it is located. For reasonable cause, Borough

are important.
C. The Planning Commission shall meet within 45 days of the date that
the complete site plans were submitted. The applicant shall be
afforded the opportunity to be present, answer questions and
provide further information.
D. The Planning Commission or the Zoning Officer may choose to have
the Borough Engineer review the site plans. If he does, the Borough
Engineer shall provide a written report within 30 days to the
Zoning Officer.
E. Unless an extension is agreed upon by the applicant within 40 days
of the first Planning Commission meeting, the Planning
Commission is to issue a written recommendation on the site plans
to the Zoning Officer. The recommendation is to include findings
and reasons affecting the recommendation including, but not
limited to, the findings of the Borough Engineer and the relevant
sections of any Borough ordinances. Failure to render this written
recommendation within 40 days shall be considered a
recommendation to issue the zoning permit.
F. The Zoning Officer shall then review the site plan and any and all
written recommendations of the Planning Commission. His
decision shall be in writing and shall be sent to the applicant at his

streets and any existing buildings in relation to property and street
lines. If the application relates to property which is scheduled to be
developed in successive stages, such plans shall show the
relationship of the portion scheduled for initial development to the
proposed layout of the entire property.
§ 408 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 408
1:719
C. The location, dimensions (numbers shown) and arrangements of all
open spaces and yards, landscaping, fences and buffer yards,
including methods and materials to be employed for screening.
D. The location, size (numbers shown), arrangement and capacity of
all areas to be used for motor vehicle access, off-street parking, offstreet
loading and unloading and provisions to be made for lighting

4. Site Design Guidelines. The following guidelines are divided into eight
categories to assist the applicant in the preparation of site and building
plans and to assist the Planning Commission and the Zoning Officer in
their reviews of all site plans. These guidelines are meant to encourage
creativity, innovation and well-designed developments. They apply to
principal buildings and structures and to all accessory buildings,
structures, signs and other site features.
A. Relation of Proposed Buildings to the Surrounding Environment.
Relate proposed structure(s) harmoniously to the terrain and to
existing buildings that have a visual relationship to the proposed
structure(s). To achieve this favorable relationship between
existing and proposed uses, create focal points with respect to
avenues of approach, terrain features or other buildings and relate
open space between all existing and proposed buildings.
B. Drive, Parking and Circulation. For vehicular and pedestrian
circulation (including walkways, interior drives and parking) give
special attention to the location and number of access points to
public streets, width of interior drives and access points, general
interior circulation, separation of pedestrian and vehicular traffic,
arrangement of safe and convenient parking areas. Design these
vehicular and pedestrian areas to enhance the appearance of and
access to the proposed buildings and structures and to the
neighboring properties.
C. Surface Water Drainage. Give special attention to proper site
surface drainage to ensure that removal of surface waters will not
adversely affect either neighboring properties or the public storm
drainage system. Remove and effectively carry away all stormwater
from all roofs, canopies and paved areas. Collect surface water
from all paved areas to permit vehicular and pedestrian movement.
§ 408 QUAKERTOWN CODE § 408
1:720
All stormwater plans and design must be in conformance with
§§ 801 through 875 of Chapter 22 of this Code of Ordinances.
D. Utility Service. Place electric and telephone lines underground,
where possible. Locate, paint and undertake any other treatment to
ensure that any utilities which remain above ground will have a
minimal adverse impact on neighboring properties.

the Borough and the surrounding communities to a 10 mile
radius shall be provided, based on emissions from similar
facilities measured during, normal operating conditions,
routine start-up and shut-down and upset conditions which
require an emergency shut-down. Where emission
measurements from comparable facilities are lacking, best
engineering judgments shall be used to estimate the emissions.
Where ambient monitoring data are lacking, an emission
dispersion model approved by the U.S. EPA or PA DER shall be
used to calculate ambient air concentrations and dustfall.

and extended shutdown (more than one day).
(4) Noise. An estimate shall be made as to the levels of noise which
will be produced at the exterior of the facility building, at the
property line and at nearby residential and commercial areas,
under normal operating conditions, start-up, shutdown and
upset requiring an emergency shutdown.
(5) Visible Emissions. An estimate shall be made as to the
conditions and percent of time that visible emissions are likely
to be observed and whether these conditions would exceed the
PA DER regulations.
(6) Water Use and Effluents.
(a) The quantities of water to be consumed per day in the
various systems of the facility, including steam loss, boiler
blowdown, ash quench tank and wet scrubber (if any), etc.,
shall be estimated based on measurements on comparable
facilities or best engineering judgment where data are
lacking. The sources of these water quantities shall be
identified.
(b) The quantities of pollutants to be released in the water
effluents from the facility under normal operating and
upset conditions, as described above and the nature of the
receiving waters shall be estimated, based on experience
§ 408 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 408

including (or in addition to the PA DER requirements) a set
of baseline measurements lasting at least one month prior
to the start of construction of the facility, a set of
measurements during the check-out and initial start-up of
the facility and a set of measurements at least monthly
during the first year of facility operation.
(b) The regular monitoring shall include measurements of
dioxins and furans in the emissions and settleable dust and
of priority pollutants in the effluents only once during the
initial start-up of the facility, and then only annually
thereafter.

(1) The Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged by
the appellant (the landowner affected, any office or agency of
the Borough or any person aggrieved) that the Zoning Officer
has failed to follow prescribed procedures, or has
misinterpreted or misapplied any valid provision of this
chapter or any valid rule or regulation governing the action of
the Zoning Officer.
§ 704 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 704

Hearing Board within 30 days of the Zoning Officer's alleged
error.
(3) Such appeals shall be in writing and shall explain fully the facts

provisions of the ordinance on which the appeal is based.
(4) Nothing contained herein shall be construed to deny the
appellant the right to proceed directly in court, pursuant to
Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure, Sections 1091-1098
(relating to mandamus).

(1) The Board shall hear challenges to the validity of this chapter
filed with the Board in writing by the landowner affected, any
officer or agency of the Borough, or any person aggrieved.

permission of such landowner) which allege that the provisions
of this chapter inflict unnecessary hardship upon the applicant.

where relevant, are made:
(a) There are unique physical circumstances or conditions
(including irregularity, narrowness or shallowness of lot
size or shape, or exceptional topographical or other
physical conditions peculiar to the particular property)
and that the unnecessary hardship is due to such
conditions and not the circumstances or conditions
generally created by the provisions of this chapter in the
neighborhood or district in which the property is located.
(b) Because of such physical circumstances or conditions,
there is no possibility that the property can be developed
in strict conformity with the provisions of this chapter, and
a variance is therefore necessary to enable the reasonable
use of the property.
(c) Such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
appellant.
§ 704 QUAKERTOWN CODE § 704
1:746
(d) The use that is being requested is a use permitted in the
zoning district where the request is being made. A
variance shall not be granted for any use which is not
permitted in the zoning district where the request is being
made.
(e) The variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the
property is located, nor substantially or permanently
impair the appropriate use or development of adjacent
property nor be detrimental to the public welfare.
(f) The variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance that will afford relief and will represent the least
modification possible of the regulation in issue.
(3) In granting any variance, the Board may attach such
reasonable conditions and safeguards as it may deem
necessary to implement the purposes of this chapter.
(4) Unless otherwise extended, ordered or authorized by the
Zoning Hearing Board, the grant of a variance shall
automatically expire and be deemed null and void if:
(a) Within one year of the date of the order granting the
variance no building or use permit has been issued
therefor.
(b) Within four months of the date of the issuance of a permit,
no substantial amount of work has been performed in
reliance thereon.
Extensions of the above time limitations shall only be

appropriate warning of its effect.

exceptions filed with the Board in writing by any landowner (or
any tenant with the permission of such landowner), as provided
in this chapter and in accordance with such standards and
criteria contained in this chapter.
(2) In granting a special exception, the Zoning Hearing Board may

shall include a specific reference to this section with an
appropriate warning of its effect.
