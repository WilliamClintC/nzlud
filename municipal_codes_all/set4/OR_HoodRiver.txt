5. If the City proves by a preponderance of the evidence that the respondent committed the infraction, the Court shall enter an order in favor of the City. The Court may enter an order directing the respondent to abate, correct or otherwise remedy the violation by a time certain, and the court may impose a civil penalty in accordance with this Chapter.
6. The Court shall retain jurisdiction over the matter until the violation is fully remedied, abated or otherwise corrected in compliance with the Court’s order and the applicable requirements of the Code, state law or city-issued permit.

Any such warrant shall allow access and the ability to inspect by any responsible and suitably qualified officer, inspector, state or local official.

Recovery of the City’s Enforcement Prosecution and Abatement Costs: Following entry of an order against a respondent under this chapter, the City may petition the Court to recover from respondent(s) all of its reasonable costs associated with bringing and prosecuting a civil enforcement action under this chapter and for any abatement action that may be necessary if the respondent(s) fail to abate the violation. Reasonable costs include the City’s attorney, administrative and staff time, inspection costs, contractor costs, materials and equipment, service and administrative expenses, the cost of work to demolish, remove, correct or otherwise abate the nuisance, and any associated disposal costs.

Purpose.
In order for the City government to operate effectively, persons selected for employment or as a public service volunteer with the City of Hood River must have the highest degree of public trust and confidence. Similarly, applicants for licenses issued by the City where a criminal record history review is required must also have the highest degree of public trust and confidence. All City employees and public service volunteers represent the City to its citizens. Many City employees and volunteers have responsibilities to regulate and maintain public health and safety. Some City employees have the ability and authority to bind the City contractually, have access to public funds and property, and possess access to privileged and proprietary information submitted to the City in confidence. There is a need to protect youths from harmful or dangerous encounters and to that end a review of the criminal records of those who volunteer with youth in the City is necessary and appropriate. City licensee, such as taxi cab owners and operators and tow truck drivers interact with the public in stressful situations (accidents, disabled vehicles, etc.) and in situations in which they can be taken advantage of. Therefore, it is necessary and appropriate that these licensee’s criminal record histories are reviewed prior to issuing a license. Liquor license applicants are required to apply to the City for recommendation to the Oregon Liquor Control Commission (OLCC) in their licensing process. It is necessary and appropriate that such applicants’ criminal record history is reviewed in the City’s recommendation process. Transient merchants and special event coordinators.

Applicants for employment and volunteer positions.
All applicants for employment and volunteer positions with the City for whom a criminal offender information check is required will be required to sign a written authorization authorizing the City to conduct a criminal offender information check through the Oregon State Police (OSP) Law Enforcement Data System (LEDS).

2.10.030
Process for obtaining criminal history.
A member of the Police Department trained and authorized to perform criminal history checks through LEDS will conduct the check on the prospective employee or volunteer and orally report to the Personnel Director that the applicant’s record indicates “no criminal record” or “criminal record”. If the applicant’s record is reported as “criminal record”, the Personnel Director will, under OAR 257-010-0025, request a written criminal history report from the OSP Identification Services Section. The Personnel Director will provide the written criminal history record available to the hiring Department Head.
2.10.040
Retention of criminal history records.
The written criminal history record on persons that are not hired or appointed as a volunteer will be retained in accordance with the requirements of OAR 166-200-0090 for a period of three years and thereafter will be destroyed. The criminal history record of applicants and volunteers with a criminal history that are hired or appointed will become a part of the confidential personnel files of that employee or volunteer. Unless required to do so by law, the City will under no circumstances release the criminal history record or information contained therein to any person, including the applicant. This statement will be included on the written authorization required in Section 2.10.020 above.
2.10.050
Criminal history checks provided to other entities.
Non-profit organizations serving youth in the community, including, but not limited to youth baseball, youth basketball, youth soccer and youth football organizations may request that the Police Department perform criminal history checks. Subject to workload priorities and staff availability, the Police Department may perform such criminal record checks on the prospective youth volunteers. The Police Department shall confirm only if a criminal record exists, without any detail of such record. The youth volunteer organization may request criminal record history directly with the Oregon State Police pursuant to state statute and administrative rule.

The Council further finds that many of such small projects are retarded by the fact that the property owners benefited cannot pay cash for the same and in some cares are unwilling to apply for the method of financing furnished through Bancroft bonds, and the high rate of interest accompanying the same over a ten-year period; and
C. The Council further finds that the application for, and the doing of the work of many of such small improvements could be promoted by the establishment by the city of a small revolving fund to be made available for the financing of such improvements; and
D. The Council further finds that there are moneys in excess of the sum hereinafter mentioned on hand in its water department which are not required for payment of indebtedness, and which are currently available for promoting such financing on the part of the city; and
E. Whereas it is desirable to establish a fund in the nature of that abovementioned, at this time. (Ord. 956, 1952)
3.16.020
Special revolving fund – Established – Transfer of funds – Purpose.
There is designated and appropriated from moneys now not earmarked for any special purpose within the funds held by the city, and credited to the water department, the sum of sixty thousand dollars which shall be known as “special revolving fund," which fund shall be used only for the purpose of financing such improvements to streets, sidewalks and sewers as may be designated by the Council by ordinance, resolution or motion duly entered in writing upon the minutes of a regular, special or adjourned meeting of the Council. (Ord. 1151, 1962; Ord. 956, 1952)

Procedures for alternate financing and loans.
Should the Council determine in writing, prior to, at, or after the passage of an ordinance determining that any improvement work within the city shall be done, the Council may provide that those especially benefited by such improvement work shall be permitted to take advantage of the alternate financing provided for in this chapter in lieu of cash payment or of financing under the Bancroft Bonding Act of the state. Such determination shall be entered upon the minutes of a regular, special or adjourned meeting of the Council. After such determination the procedure set forth in the charter and ordinances of the city for the collection and assessment of benefits against

The Hood River Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 2054, passed February 10, 2020.
all lots, parts of lots and parcels of land benefited by such improvement in accordance with the charter and ordinances of the city shall be followed in all particulars, except that after docketing the liens assessed against the lots, parts of lots and parcels of land benefited by the various projects, and in receiving payment therefor, the alternate procedure set out in this section shall be followed:
A. In the enactment of an ordinance providing for the assessing of the liens against said lots, parts of lots and parcels of land, such ordinance shall specifically direct the City Recorder to enter in the lien docket of the city a statement of the respective amounts of benefits assessed upon each lot, part of lot or parcel of land benefited by such improvement, together with the names of the owners thereof, and upon such entry in the lien docket the amount so entered shall be a lien and a charge upon the respective lots, parts of lots and parcels of land against which the same are pledged. Such liens shall be first and prior to all other liens that the laws of the state will allow them to be, against such property.
B. The property owners benefited by such improvement, within the time required by the Charter of the city, (twenty days after the same is entered in the lien docket), or such additional time as may be permitted by the Council, shall pay such liens in full, or shall make application under the Bancroft Bonding Act of the state, or shall make application for alternate financing through the special revolving fund set up in Section 3.16.020, and the city may proceed to foreclose any such liens other than a bonded lien under the Bancroft Bonding Act of the state, twenty days after the same have been entered in the lien docket if arrangements satisfactory to the city have not been made for the payment thereof either by cash payment or by application for financing under this chapter; or if the assessment so financed has become delinquent, whether or not previous payments have been made, and such liens may be foreclosed under Title V, Chapter 9, O.C.L.A. (ORS 88.010 – 88.100, 93.720, 93.760, 408.440) as now or hereafter amended, or as may be otherwise provided by the charter and ordinances of the city for the foreclosure of liens entered upon the lien dockets of the city.
C. The owners against whom liens are assessed under this chapter may make arrangements satisfactory to the city to pay such liens in accordance with the plan of the city herein set out; such owner shall make application for payment of such lien upon a form to be provided by the City Recorder for such application; provided, however, that in no case shall the alternate financing herein provided be larger in amount than the owner could have financed under the provisions of the Bancroft Bonding Act; and provided further, that no such lien shall be paid off in more then six semiannual installments. The city may prescribe a smaller number of equal semiannual installments for the retirement of such liens if the Council deems such shorter period proper, necessary or convenient in the premises. But nothing herein contained shall prevent the owner from paying off all or any part of such lien at any time together with interest to the date of such payment.
D. It is a special limitation under this chapter that the city may in no event have outstanding upon its general lien docket unpaid liens financed through such special revolving fund, payable in installments as provided herein, together with interest accruing thereon, in excess of the sum of sixty thousand dollars (but this provision shall have no effect with relation to the bonded lien docket of the city). Should there be such unpaid liens accruing interest upon the same in excess of the sum of sixty thousand dollars, the city may not permit further liens to be created under this chapter or financed through such special revolving fund.

Upon the discontinuance of such special revolving fund, all funds then on hand shall be paid into the appropriate fund and such fund shall be kept open only for the purpose of receiving payments and of enforcing the payment of liens until all payments financed by such fund have been repaid to the city through such fund, or are declared by the Council to be uncollectible, or unenforceable through foreclosure of lien or otherwise.

Legislative History: Ord. 1770 (1999); Ord. 1849 (2003); Ord. 1907 (2006)
3.20.010
General.
A. Upon review of any land use application to which Goal 11 applies, affirmative findings may be made that adequate public facilities exist with respect to a public facility if, in addition to the requirements of this code the hearing body can make the affirmative findings required in Section 3.20.020 below, and the public facility with respect to which the Section 3.20.020 findings are made is a qualified public facility pursuant to Section 3.20.030 below.
B. As used in this Chapter, the terms “development proposal” and “proposed development” refer to any land use application to which Goal 11 applies, except zone changes and comprehensive plan amendments.
C. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Chapter, the applicant shall have the burden of proving the adequacy of public facilities.
3.20.020
Findings required.
In order to find, under this Chapter, that adequate public facilities exist with respect to a public facility, or that the level of service on a street or at an intersection is acceptable, the following findings must first be made:
A. The public facility is currently, or as a result of the proposed development will become, an inadequate public facility and/or does not or will not operate at an acceptable level of service. This finding must point to the specific evidence in the record that supports this finding.
B. The proposed development will impact the public facility and to what extent the proposed development will impact the public facility. The finding addressing the extent of the impact shall point to specific evidence in the record in support of the finding.
C. A description of the improvements necessary to make the facility an adequate public facility and/or make it operate at an acceptable level of service (“Necessary Improvements”) and the estimated costs of the Necessary Improvements (“Improvement Costs”).
D. Why a condition of approval requiring the applicant to contribute to the improvement of the public facility is reasonably related to the impacts of the proposed development on the public facility.
E. The impact of the proposed development is or is not roughly proportional to the Necessary Improvements and Improvement Costs.
F. If the impact of the proposed development is not roughly proportional to the Necessary Improvements and Improvement Costs, the impact of the proposed development is roughly proportional to a specified dollar amount
Your Selections | Hood River, OR Page 45 of 753
The Hood River Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 2054, passed February 10, 2020.
of, or proportion in terms of percentages of the Improvement Costs for the public facility (“Proportionate Contribution”). This finding shall explain with reasonable particularity the determination of rough proportionality.
3.20.030
Qualified public facility.
A qualified public facility is a public facility that is subject to public facilities planning under the Comprehensive Plan – part of an existing public facilities plan – and for which the City has a designated improvement fund, which fund may or may not be currently funded.
3.20.040
Impact study.
The applicant shall provide adequate, reliable and quantifiable information as to the extent the proposed development will impact the public facility. If the information is not sufficient for the City to determine the impact proposed development will have on a public facility, the applicant shall provide, at the applicant’s cost, an impact study prepared by a registered professional engineer licensed in the State of Oregon with respect to the proposed development and facility being studied, if a study has not already been prepared by the City. The City Engineer has the authority to determine whether an impact study is required and to set the scope of the study. The cost of the study, whether provided by the applicant or by the City, shall be included in the Improvement Costs.
3.20.050
Alternative findings allowed.
This Chapter does not preclude the hearing body from otherwise finding that adequate public facilities exist or cannot exist (even if the findings under Section 3.20.020 can be made) with respect to a public facility or that a street or intersection is operating at an acceptable level of service or cannot so operate for other reasons supported by the record. In other words, if other reasons and evidence in the record support a finding of the existence of adequate public facilities, the applicant shall not be required to make a Proportionate Contribution payment.
3.20.060
Conditions and limits.
If the hearing body makes affirmative findings pursuant to Section 3.20.020 above and the development proposal is approved, approval shall be conditioned on the following:
A. The applicant’s written agreement to pay the Proportionate Contribution specified in Section 3.20.020(F) above. The agreement shall provide that full payment, partial payment or the posting of acceptable security must be made to the City on or before the commencement of any work on and issuance of any permit for the subject property under the development proposal. The condition shall also provide that if payment is not made as provided in this Chapter, the City Council shall assess the Proportionate Contribution against the subject property

The Hood River Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 2054, passed February 10, 2020.
by resolution and shall enter the assessment resolution in the docket of city liens and record the same in the Hood River County Assessor’s real property records.
B. The determination under this Chapter of the applicant’s Proportionate Contribution to the Necessary Improvements of the public facility shall be final and neither the applicant, nor the applicant’s successors and assigns, shall be entitled to a refund or credit in the event the total actual costs to the City of the Necessary Improvements are less than the Improvement Costs. Similarly, the City shall not be entitled to seek additional contribution from an applicant or the applicant’s successors and assigns if the total actual costs to the City of the Necessary Improvements exceeds the Improvement Costs.
3.20.070
Project determination.
An owner or owners of real property that is served by a public facility and who anticipate(s) that development may occur in phases, may apply to the City for a determination under this Section (“Project Determination”). The application form shall be provided by the City and the request shall be heard by the Planning Commission in accordance with the procedures under Chapter 17.09. The application shall describe the subject properties with respect to which the Project Determination is sought. The provisions of this section shall be in addition to the other applicable provisions of this Chapter.
A. The findings required by this Chapter shall also include the following:
1. Legal description(s) of the additional property(ies) to be covered by the findings in Section 3.20.020 above.
2. The findings in Section 3.20.020 above shall be based on the level and intensity of development that could occur on the subject property under the applicable zoning if the applicant does not have a development proposal, or on a proposed level and intensity of development under the applicable zoning to which the applicant agrees to commit. The level and intensity of allowable development shall be described with reasonable particularity.
B. Approval shall be conditioned upon development occurring at or below the level and intensity considered under the applicable zoning at the time the findings are made.
C. The applicant, and the applicant’s successors and assigns, shall be responsible for making the payment pursuant to Section 3.20.060(A) above and no work shall occur on or any permit (including any subsequent development permit) be issued for any of the subject properties prior to receipt by the City of the payment. All of the subject parcels shall be subject to the lien described in Section 3.20.060(A).
D. A Project Determination under this Section 3.20.070 shall constitute compliance with Goal 11 with respect to adequacy of public facilities and findings of adequate public facilities and/or acceptable level of service (with respect to a street or intersection) for all subsequent development proposals on the subject properties submitted in accordance with the condition in Section 3.20.070(B) above.

Final determination.
Subject to any right to appeal the City’s decision under this code and state and federal law, the determination under this Chapter of the applicant’s Proportionate Contribution to the Necessary Improvements of the public facility shall be final and neither the applicant, nor the applicant’s successors and assigns, shall be entitled to a refund or credit in the event the total actual costs to the City of the Necessary Improvements are less than the Improvement Costs. Similarly, the City shall not be entitled to seek additional contribution from an applicant or the applicant’s successors and assigns if the total actual costs to the City of the Necessary Improvements exceeds the Improvement Costs. This section does not preclude reimbursement of amounts paid in excess of the Proportionate Contribution pursuant to an agreement between the City and applicant, or as may otherwise be required by ordinance, statute, or other law.
3.20.090
Application of funds.
Proportionate Contribution funds received by the City shall be deposited in a designated fund and applied by the City to the construction and installation of the Necessary Improvements. (See Ord. 1849.) Any unused Proportionate Contribution funds remaining upon completion and the City’s acceptance of the Necessary Improvements shall remain in the designated City fund and may be used by the City only for improvements to public facilities in accordance with the designated fund.
3.20.100
Time limits.
Findings made pursuant to this Chapter shall be valid for as long as the underlying permit for the development proposal is valid, including any extensions thereof. A Project Determination shall be valid for a period of eighteen (18) months, but may be extended by the Planning Director upon application made to the Planning Director at least 30 days prior to expiration. The Project Determination may be extended for additional periods of up to one year each if there has been no substantial change in circumstances.

revenues and a calculation of the amount payable. The privilege tax may be paid monthly pursuant to a written agreement with the City Finance Director.
B. If the privilege tax is not received by the City on or before the due date, interest shall be owed on the privilege tax in the amount of 12% per annum from the date due to the date on which the payment is received by the City.
3.32.060
Accounting and audit.
A. The City may, at any time within 3 years of receipt of an accounting required in Section 3.32.060, investigate any accounting submitted and determine the accuracy of the amount reported. If the utility failed to submit the required accounting or as part of the investigation of an accounting and upon receipt of a written request from the City, the utility shall make available for investigation all records, including historical records and books of the utility necessary for verification of payments and/or accountings. The investigation may be done by the City or any person selected by the City. Neither acceptance of payment nor a failure to make an investigation shall be deemed to prevent subsequent investigation by the City, or to estop the City from collecting any amount due.
B. If, upon investigation or otherwise, the fee or tax paid is determined to be excessive, a refund of the excess will be paid. If the fee paid is found to be insufficient, the City shall notify the utility of the amount of the deficiency and demand payment of the amount. Any liability for underpayment or overpayment is limited to the 3 year audit period.
C. If a utility fails to properly report the true amount of gross revenue or other basis from all accounts within the City as determined by the City after investigation, a late payment charge of 2% of the total amount due will be owed on the under-reported gross revenue calculated from the 1st day of the calendar quarter in which the error occurred to the date on which the City received payment, compounded monthly. The late payment charge shall be due at the same time that the utility is required to make payment of any insufficiency of the privilege tax. If the insufficiency is greater than 15% of the total amount due or if at arbitration, trial or on appeal it is determined that the insufficiency is due to fraud and/or intent to evade the tax, a penalty of 25% of the amount of the total tax shall be paid in addition to the amount due and the late payment charge.
D. Within 10 days from the receipt of notice from the City that the privilege tax paid is insufficient and that payment is demanded, the utility may appeal to the City Council. The appeal must be in writing and specifying the grounds of appeal. If no appeal is taken, if the Council decides adversely, or if the Council decides that any other amount is due, the City shall proceed to collect the amount determined to be due and unpaid.
E. In addition to any other penalties prescribed by law, if a utility fails to make payment of any deficiency determined to be due and unpaid in accordance with the provisions of this subsection within 10 days of final determination, the City Manager may suspend any license or permit issued by the City to the utility.

3.32.080
Refunds.
In the event that a utility is ordered to refund any revenues by a governmental entity or agency with jurisdiction to make such an order and the refund will affect the privilege tax paid pursuant to this chapter, the calculation of the privilege tax shall not include the refund except pursuant to a mutually agreed upon schedule. If there is a substantial budgetary impact to the City, the schedule may include spreading the impact of the refund on the future privilege tax to be paid to the City over a period of time commencing the 1st full fiscal year following the ordering of the refund. The schedule shall minimize the administrative impact to the utility and may include interest on the unpaid refund. This section does not apply to credits or other rate adjustments that regularly occur pursuant to a utility’s OPUC approved tariff schedules.
3.32.090
Exemptions.
Any facility placed in the right of way solely to provide service for transportation or vehicular use of the right of way is exempt from the tax.
3.32.100
Notice of amendments.

3.32.110
Preemption and severability.
A. The provisions of this chapter shall be interpreted to be consistent with applicable federal and state law, and shall be interpreted, to the extent possible, to cover only matters not preempted by federal or state law.
B. If anything in this chapter is for any reason declared or held to be invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction or superseded by state or federal law, rule, regulation or decision, the remainder of this chapter shall not be affected thereby but shall be deemed as a separate and distinct and independent provision, and such holding shall not affect the validity of the remaining parts of this chapter and each remaining part shall be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law. In the event any provision is preempted by federal or state law, rule or regulation, the provision shall be preempted only to the extent required by law and any

Your Selections | Hood River, OR Page 77 of 753
The Hood River Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 2054, passed February 10, 2020.
Operators starting business after this chapter is adopted must register within fifteen calendar days after commencing business. The privilege of registration after the date of imposition of such tax shall not relieve any person from the obligation of payment or collection of the tax, regardless of registration. The registration shall set forth the name under which an operator transacts or intends to transact business, the location of his place or places of business, and such other information to facilitate the collection of the tax as the tax administrator may require. The registration shall be signed by the operator. The tax administrator shall, within ten days after registration, issue without charge a certificate of authority to each registrant to collect the tax from the occupant, together with a duplicate thereof for each additional place of business for each registrant. Certificates shall be non-assignable and non-transferable and shall be surrendered immediately to the tax administrator upon the cessation of business at the location named or upon its sale or transfer of the business. Each certificate and duplicate shall state the place of business to which it is applicable and shall be prominently displayed so as readily to be seen and come to the notice of all occupants and persons seeking occupancy.
The certificate shall, among other things, state the following:
A. The name of the operator;
B. The address of the hotel;
C. The date when the certificate was issued;
D. “This transient occupancy registration certificate signifies that the person named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of the transient room tax ordinance of the City of Hood River by registration with the tax administrator for the purpose of collecting from transients the room tax imposed by the City and remitting the tax to the tax administrator. This certificate does not authorize any person to conduct any unlawful business or to conduct any lawful business in an unlawful manner, or to operate a hotel without strictly complying with all local applicable laws, including but not limited to those requiring a permit from any board, commission, department or office of the City of Hood River. This certificate does not constitute a permit." (Ord. 1500, 1981)
5.09.080
Due date – Returns and payments.
A. The tax imposed by this chapter shall be paid by the transient to the operator at the time that rent is paid.

B. On or before the fifteenth day of the month following each month of collection by an operator, he shall file a return for the preceding month’s tax collections with the tax administrator. The return shall be filed in such form as the tax administrator may prescribe.

Any operator to whom an extension is granted shall pay interest at the rate of one percent per month on the amount of tax due without proration for a fraction of a month. If a return is not filed, and the tax and interest due is not paid by the end of the extension of time granted, then the interest shall become a part of the tax for computation of penalties described elsewhere in this chapter.
F. The tax administrator, if he deems it necessary in order to insure payment or facilitate collection by the City of the amount of taxes in any individual case, may require returns and payment of the amount of taxes for other than monthly periods. (Ord. 1500, 1981)
5.09.090
Penalties and interest.
A. Original Delinquency. Any operator who has not been granted an extension of time for delivery of return and payment of tax due, and who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter prior to delinquency, shall pay a penalty of ten percent of the amount of the tax due in addition to the amount of the tax.
B. Continued Delinquency. Any operator who has not been granted an extension of time for remittance of tax due, and who has failed to pay any delinquent remittance on or before a period of thirty days following the date on which the remittance first became delinquent, shall pay a second penalty of fifteen percent of the amount of the tax due, plus the amount of the tax and the ten percent penalty first imposed.
C. Fraud.

3. Recognize the need to limit short-term rental options within the neighborhoods to ensure compatibility, while recognizing the benefits of short-term rentals in in providing recreation and employment opportunities, as well as transitional housing and business or hospital related short stays.
4. Help maintain the City’s needed housing supply for residential use.
5. Protect the character of the City’s neighborhoods by limiting the number and concentration of full-time short-term rentals in residential zones. In the adoption of these regulations, the City finds that the transient rental of dwelling units has the potential to be incompatible with surrounding residential uses. Therefore, special regulation of dwellings listed for transient occupancy is necessary to ensure that these uses will be

“False Alarm” means an alarm system signal to which city resources respond with any personnel and/or equipment when a situation requiring such a response does not in fact exist, and which signal is caused by the inadvertence, negligence, intentional act or omission of an alarm user, a malfunction of the alarm system, or a malicious act. The following shall not be considered a false alarm:

Council to designate residential parking districts.
The City Council has the authority, on its own motion or upon approval of a petition from a majority of the residents of the district or proposed district, to designate, repeal, or revise residential parking districts, and to establish the parking restrictions (i.e. days, hours, exemptions) for each separate residential district.

If conditions make reading of the meters impracticable, an estimated reading shall be made by the city during the time such conditions exist. Estimated readings under other conditions affecting reading of a meter shall be made only on approval of the public works superintendent.
12.02.170

6. Reports of Potential Problems.
Your Selections | Hood River, OR Page 281 of 753
The Hood River Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 2054, passed February 10, 2020.
A. In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a non-routine, episodic nature, a non-customary batch discharge, or a slug load, that may cause potential problems for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the POTW of the incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the user.
B. Within five (5) days following such discharge, the user shall, unless waived by the City Engineer, submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this ordinance.
C. Failure to notify the City Engineer of potential problem discharges shall be deemed a violation of this ordinance.
D. A notice shall be permanently posted on the user’s bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a discharge described in paragraph A, above. Employers shall ensure that all employees, who may cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the emergency notification procedure.
7. Reports from Unpermitted Users. All users not required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports as required by the City Engineer.
8. Notice of Violation/Repeat Sampling and Reporting. If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify the City Engineer within twenty – four (24) hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the City Engineer within thirty (30) days after becoming aware of the violation. The user may not be required to resample if the City Engineer monitors at the user’s facility at least once a month, or if the City Engineer samples between the user’s initial sampling and when the user receives the results of this sampling.
9. Notification of the Discharge of Hazardous Waste.
A. Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and State hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than one hundred (100) kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following twelve (12) months. All notifications must take place no later than one hundred and eighty (180) days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this paragraph need be submitted only once for each

The Hood River Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 2054, passed February 10, 2020.
hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under Section 12.06.060 (5) of this ordinance. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by users under the self – monitoring requirements of Sections 12.06.060 (1), 12.06.060 (3), and 12.06.060 (4) of this ordinance.
B. Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of paragraph A, above, during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than fifteen (15) kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than fifteen (15) kilograms of non-acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one – time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification.
C. In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the City Engineer, the EPA Regional Waste
Management Waste Division Director, and State hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within ninety (90) days of the effective date of such regulations.
D. In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical.
E. This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this ordinance, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable Federal or State law.
10. Analytical Requirements. All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by EPA.
11. Sample Collection.
A. Except as indicated in Section B, below, the user must collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection techniques. In the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the City Engineer may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum of four (4) grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits.
B. Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques.

2. Search Warrants. If the City Engineer has been refused access to a building, structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this ordinance, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program of the City designed to verify compliance with this ordinance or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the City Engineer may seek issuance of a search warrant from the Municipal Court, District Court, or Circuit Court of the City.
12.06.080
Confidential information.
Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge permits, and monitoring programs, and from the City Engineer’s inspection and sampling activities, shall be available to the public without restriction, unless the user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the City Engineer, that the release of such information would divulge information, processes, or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable State law. Any such request must be asserted at the time of submission of the information or data. When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that such information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other “effluent data” as defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will not be recognized as confidential information and will be available to the public without restriction.
12.06.090
Publication of users in significant noncompliance.
The City Engineer shall publish annually, in the largest daily newspaper published in the municipality where the POTW is located, a list of the users which, during the previous twelve (12) months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. The term significant noncompliance shall mean.
A. Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those in which sixty – six percent (66%) or more of wastewater measurements taken during a six (6) month period exceed the daily maximum limit or average limit for the same pollutant parameter by any amount;
B. Technical Review Criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in which thirty – three percent (33%) or more of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant parameter during a six (6) month period equals or exceeds the product of the daily maximum limit or the average limit multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH);
C. Any other discharge violation that the City Engineer believes has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through, including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public;
Your Selections | Hood River, OR Page 285 of 753
The Hood River Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 2054, passed February 10, 2020.

12.06.100
Administrative enforcement remedies.
1. Notification of Violation. When the City Engineer finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this ordinance, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the City Engineer may serve upon that user a written Notice of Violation. Within five (5) days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the City Engineer. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the Notice of Violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the City Engineer to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a Notice of Violation.
2. Consent Orders. The City Engineer may enter into Consent Orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to Sections 12.06.100 (4) and 12.06.100 (5) of this ordinance and shall be judicially enforceable.
3. Show Cause Hearing. The City Engineer may order a user which has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this ordinance, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the City Engineer and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least fourteen (14) days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
Your Selections | Hood River, OR Page 286 of 753
The Hood River Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 2054, passed February 10, 2020.
4. Compliance Orders. When the City Engineer finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this ordinance, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the City Engineer may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self – monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
5. Cease and Desist Orders. When the City Engineer finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this ordinance, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user’s past violations are likely to recur, the City Engineer may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to:
A. Immediately comply with all requirements; and
B. Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.
Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
6. Administrative Fines.
A. When the City Engineer finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this ordinance, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the City Engineer may fine such user in an amount set by Resolution of the City Council. Such fines shall be assessed on a per violation, per day basis. In the case of monthly or other long term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation.
B. Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after thirty (30) calendar days, be assessed an additional penalty of ten percent (10%) of the unpaid balance, and interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of two percent (2%) per month. A lien against the user’s property will be sought for unpaid charges, fines, and penalties.
C. Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for the City Engineer to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine amount within thirty (30) days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has merit, the City Engineer may convene a hearing on the matter. In the event the user’s appeal is successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user. The City Engineer may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine.

The Hood River Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 2054, passed February 10, 2020.
D. Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
7. Emergency Suspensions. The City Engineer may immediately suspend a user’s discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The City Engineer may also immediately suspend a user’s discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment.
A. Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user’s failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the City Engineer may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The City Engineer may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the City Engineer that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in Section 10.8 of this ordinance are initiated against the user.
B. A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the City Engineer within five (5) days.
Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section.
8. Termination of Discharge. Any user that violates the conditions in Section 12.06.050 (6) of this ordinance is subject to discharge termination. Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under Section 12.06.100 (3) of this ordinance why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the City Engineer shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
12.06.110
Judicial enforcement remedies.
1. Injunctive Relief. When the City Engineer finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this ordinance, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the City Engineer may petition the Hood River County Circuit Court through the City Attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this ordinance on activities of the user. The City Engineer may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.
2. Civil Penalties.

The Hood River Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 2054, passed February 10, 2020.
A. A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this ordinance, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to the City for a civil penalty in an amount to be set by Resolution of the City Council. In the case of a monthly or other long – term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation.
B. The City Engineer may recover reasonable attorneys’ fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the City.
C. In determining the amount of civil liability, the Court shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the violation, any economic benefit gained through the user’s violation, corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice requires.
D. Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.
3. Criminal Prosecution.
A. A user who willfully or negligently violates any provision of this ordinance, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine in an amount to be set by Resolution of the City Council, or imprisonment for not more than one (1) year, or both.
B. A user who willfully or negligently introduces any substance into the POTW which causes personal injury or property damage shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor and be subject to a penalty of an amount to be set by Resolution of the City Council, or subject to imprisonment for not more than one (1) year, or both. This penalty shall be in addition to any other cause of action for personal injury or property damage available under State law.
C. A user who knowingly makes any false statements, representations, or certifications in any application, record, report, plan, or other documentation filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this ordinance, wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this ordinance shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine to be set by Resolution of the City Council, or imprisonment for not more than one (1) year, or both.
D. In the event of a second conviction, a user shall be punished by a fine in an amount to be set by Resolution of the City Council, or imprisonment for not more than one (1) year, or both.
4. Remedies Nonexclusive. The remedies provided for in this ordinance are not exclusive. The City Engineer may take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the City’s enforcement response plan. However, the City Engineer may take other action against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the City Engineer is empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant user.

12.06.120
Supplemental enforcement action.
1. Performance Bonds. The City Engineer may decline to issue or reissue a wastewater discharge permit to any user who has failed to comply with any provision of this ordinance, a previous wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless such user first files a satisfactory bond, payable to the City, in a sum not to exceed a value determined by the City Engineer to be necessary to achieve consistent compliance.
2. Liability Insurance. The City Engineer may decline to issue or reissue a wastewater discharge permit to any user who has failed to comply with any provision of this ordinance, a previous wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless the user first submits proof that it has obtained financial assurances sufficient to restore or repair damage to the POTW caused by its discharge.
3. Water Supply Severance. Whenever a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this ordinance, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, water service to the user may be severed. Service will only recommence, at the user’s expense, after it has satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to comply.
12.06.130
Affirmative defenses to discharge violations.
1. Upset.
A. For the purposes of this section, “upset” means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation.
B. An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of paragraph (C), below, are met.
C. A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that:
1. An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset;
2. The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman – like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and
3. The user has submitted the following information to the City Engineer within twenty – four (24) hours of becoming aware of the upset. If this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five (5) days:

b. The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and
c. Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
D. In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
E. Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards.
F. Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.
2. Prohibited Discharge Standards. A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in Section 12.06.020 (1) of this ordinance if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either:
A. A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or
B. No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user’s prior discharge when the City was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.
3. Bypass.
A. For the purposes of this section,
1. “Bypass” means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a user’s treatment facility.
2. “Severe property damage” means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
B. A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of paragraphs (C) and (D) of this section.
C.
1. If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the City Engineer, at least ten (10) days before the date of the bypass, if possible.

The Hood River Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 2054, passed February 10, 2020.
2. A user shall submit oral notice to the City Engineer of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within twenty-four (24) hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five (5) days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The City Engineer may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within twenty-four (24) hours.
D.
1. Bypass is prohibited, and the City Engineer may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless
a. Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage;
b. There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back – up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
c. (The user submitted notices as required under paragraph (C) of this section.
2. The City Engineer may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the City Engineer determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in paragraph (D)(1) of this section.
12.06.140

12.07.010
Purpose and policy.
A. New development within the City of Hood River contributes to the need for capacity increases for roads and other transportation improvements, sewer, water, parks and storm water systems to serve the demand that new development places on the City’s systems and facilities. Therefore, new development should contribute to the funding for such capacity increasing improvements. The system development charges (SDC) provided for in this Chapter will fund a portion of the system capacity upgrades to the City’s transportation, water, sewer, and stormwater systems needed due to new development.
B. ORS 223.297 through 223.314 authorizes the City to impose SDC for a variety of capital improvement systems to equitably spread the costs of essential capacity increasing capital improvements to new development.
C. SDCs for these City systems are incurred upon application to develop property for a specific use or at a specific density. The decision regarding uses, densities, and/or intensities causes direct and proportional changes in the amount of the incurred charge. SDC are separate from other fees provided by law or imposed as a condition of development. An SDC is a fee for service because it contemplates a development’s receipt of municipal system services based upon the nature of that development.
D. The SDCs imposed by this Chapter are not taxes on property or on a property owner as a direct consequence of ownership of property within the meaning of Section 11b, Article XI of the Oregon Constitution or legislation
Your Selections | Hood River, OR Page 293 of 753
The Hood River Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 2054, passed February 10, 2020.
implementing that section. This Chapter does not shift, transfer or convert a government product or service, wholly or partially paid for by ad valorem property taxes, to be paid for by a fee, assessment or other charge, within the meaning of Section 11g, Article XI of the Oregon Constitution.
E. SDCs are in addition to hook-up and similar charges required to be paid by new development to connect to public systems and facilities and are in addition to any applicable tax, assessment, charge, fee in lieu of assessment, or fee otherwise provided by law or imposed as a condition of development approval.
F. The funding provided by this Chapter constitutes a mandatory collection method based upon the guidelines set forth in ORS 223.297 through 223.314 to assure the construction of capacity increasing improvements to critical municipal systems and facilities that serve new development, including streets and other transportation system improvements, and similar system components of the City’s sewer, water, stormwater and parks systems.

An SDC imposed under this chapter is in addition to any connection fees that may be charged for a property, structure or tenant to connect to a public service or facility.
12.07.030
System development charges established.
A. Unless otherwise exempted by the provisions of this Chapter or any other applicable local or state law, a SDC is hereby imposed upon all New Development within the City, and upon all development outside the boundary of the City that connects to, contributes to the need for, or otherwise uses city water, sanitary sewer, stormwater drainage and flood control, transportation or parks and recreation facilities. SDCs shall be due and payable at the point in time at which the development imposes new or increased demand upon these public improvement systems, upon issuance of a Permit, upon the commencement of a change of use that does not require a Permit, whichever occurs first. Depending upon the circumstances, the City Manager may allow deferment of actual payment of an SDC until a later time, but only with appropriate financial guarantees.
B. SDCs for each type of capital improvement shall be established and may be revised from time to time by resolution of the council. The resolution shall set the amount of the charge, the type of permit to which the charge
Your Selections | Hood River, OR Page 296 of 753
The Hood River Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 2054, passed February 10, 2020.
applies, the methodology used to set the amount of the charge, and if the charge applies to a geographic area smaller than the entire city, the geographic area subject to the charge.
C. Once paid, an SDC remains with the property that incurred the charge and imposed the demand or impact on the City’s capital improvement system(s). SDCs are not personal and shall not be transferred to another or different property.
12.07.040
Methodology.
A. The methodology used to establish and calculate a reimbursement fee shall be based on ratemaking principles employed to finance publicly owned capital improvements, prior contributions by then-existing users, gifts or grants from federal or state government or private persons, the value of unused capacity available to future system users or the cost of the existing facilities, and other relevant factors identified by the City Council. The methodology shall promote the objective that future system users shall contribute no more than an equitable share of the cost of then-existing facilities and shall be available for public inspection.
B. The methodology used to establish an improvement fee shall demonstrate consideration of the projected cost of capital improvements identified in the Plan and list adopted pursuant to Section 12.07.070 that are needed to increase the capacity of the systems to which the fee is related and for which the need for increased system capacity will be required to serve the demands placed on the system by future users. Improvement fees shall be calculated to obtain the cost of capital improvements for the projected need for available system capacity for future users.
C. The methodology shall also provide for SDC credit for Qualified Public Improvements as authorized in Section 12.07.100.
D. Except when authorized in a methodology adopted pursuant to this section, any fees imposed or required to be paid, assessed or collected as part of a local improvement district or a charge in lieu of a local improvement district assessment shall not be used as a credit against any SDC. The cost of complying with requirements or Conditions of Development Approval imposed by a land use decision shall not be creditable against any SDC unless eligible for SDC credit under Section 12.07.100 of this Chapter.
E. The methodology used to establish the Improvement Fee or the Reimbursement Fee, or both, shall be adopted by resolution by the Council and may be amended from time to time. All New Development shall be subject to an SDC and any methodology in place at the time the Applicant applies for a Permit. Neither this Chapter nor an SDC methodology shall be considered land use standards or criteria for purposes of ORS 227.178(3).
F. The City shall maintain a list of people and organizations that have made a written request for notification prior to adoption or amendment of a methodology for any SDC. Written notice shall be mailed to people and organizations on the list at least 90 days prior to the first hearing to establish or modify a SDC, and the methodology supporting the adoption or amendment shall be available at least 60 days prior to the first hearing to adopt or amend. The failure of a person or organization on the list to receive a notice that was mailed shall not invalidate the City’s subsequent action. The City may periodically delete names from the list, but at least 30 days
Your Selections | Hood River, OR Page 297 of 753
The Hood River Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 2054, passed February 10, 2020.
prior to removing a name from the list the City must notify the person whose name is to be deleted that a new written request for notification is required if the person wishes to remain on the notification list. A change in the amount of a reimbursement fee or an improvement fee is not a modification of the SDC methodology if the change in amount is based on a change in cost of materials, labor or real property applied to projects or project capacity as set forth on the list adopted pursuant to Section 12.07.070 or the periodic application of one or more specific cost indices published by a recognized organization or agency and is incorporated as part of the established methodology or identified and adopted in a separate ordinance, resolution, or order.
12.07.050
Authorized expenditures.
A. Reimbursement fees. Reimbursement Fees shall be applied only to Capital Improvements (and not operating expenses) associated with the systems for which the fees are assessed, including expenditures relating to repayment of indebtedness.
B. Improvement Fees.
1. Improvement fees shall be spent only on capacity increasing Capital Improvements, including expenditures relating to repayment of debt for the improvements. An increase in system capacity may be established if a Capital Improvement increases the level of performance or service provided by existing facilities or provides new facilities. The portion of the improvements funded by Improvement Fees must be related to the need for increased capacity to provide service for future users.
2. A Capital Improvement being funded wholly or in part from revenues derived from the Improvement Fee shall be included in the plan adopted by the city pursuant to Section 12.07.070.
3. Notwithstanding subsections 12.07.050(B)(1) and (2), SDC revenues may be expended on the costs of complying with the provisions of subsections 12.07.050(B)(1), including the costs of developing SDC methodologies and providing an annual accounting of SDC expenditures.
12.07.060
Expenditure restrictions.
SDCs shall not be expended for:
A. Costs associated with the construction of administrative office facilities that are more than an incidental part of other Capital Improvements; or
B. Costs of the operation or routine maintenance of Capital Improvements.
12.07.070
Capital improvement plan.
Each SDC collected by the city shall be based upon a Capital Improvement Plan adopted for each Capital Improvement system that:
Your Selections | Hood River, OR Page 298 of 753
The Hood River Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 2054, passed February 10, 2020.
A. Lists the capital improvements that may be funded with Improvement Fee revenues;
B. Lists the estimated cost, and percentage of costs eligible to be funded with revenues from the Improvement Fee for each improvement; and
C. Describes the process for modifying the Plan. If a SDC will be increased by a proposed modification of the list to include a capacity increasing Capital Improvement, the City shall provide, at least 30 days prior to the adoption of the modification, notice of the proposed modification to the people and organizations that have requested written notice under Section 12.07.040(F). The City shall hold a public hearing if a written request for a hearing on the proposed modification is received within seven days of the date the proposed modification is scheduled for adoption.
12.07.080
Calculation and collection of sdc.
A. All Applicants for New Development shall pay all applicable SDCs, and all such SDCs shall be due and payable at the time of issuance of a Permit or whenever there is a change of use of a parcel or building, or part thereof that does not involve issuance of a Permit.
B. Unless a particular Capital Improvement SDC methodology provides otherwise, the City shall use the following means of measuring the demand or impact that a particular use will have on the City’s systems:
1. For transportation system impacts, the City shall rely upon the number of person-trips generated by the proposed new use (and previous use) according to the use categories in the current version of the ITE Trip Generation Manual or other comparable compilation of national average person-trips generated by different use classifications.
2. For water system impacts, the City shall rely upon the meter size serving the use and/or an average equivalent dwelling unit (EDU) calculation.
3. For stormwater and drainage system impacts, the City shall rely upon the amount of impervious surface that contributes stormwater run off to the City’s stormwater collection and disposal system.
4. For sanitary sewer system impacts, the City shall rely upon the average equivalent dwelling unit (EDU) calculation.
5. For park system impacts, the City shall rely upon the number of residents or employees at the site.
C. When the New Development constitutes a change or an enlargement of a Previous Use of the parcel, including a change in use or tenant within a multi-tenant building, the New Development shall trigger an SDC review and calculation under the current methodologies.
1. If the Proposed Use results in a greater demand or impact on a city Capital Improvement system under the current applicable methodology than for the Previous Use (e.g., the new use generates a larger number of person-trips than did the previous use), the Applicant shall pay the difference between the SDC rate ascribed to the Previous Use and the calculated SDC attributable to the Proposed Use. In the case of new construction
Your Selections | Hood River, OR Page 299 of 753
The Hood River Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 2054, passed February 10, 2020.
or a building where there has been no Previous Use, the New Development shall pay the full amount of all SDCs attributable to the use proposed for the New Development.
2. If the Proposed Use results in a lower demand or impact on a city Capital Improvement system (e.g., a smaller number of person-trips) under the current applicable methodology than for the Previous Use, no further SDC shall be due, but no refund shall be paid to the applicant.
3. It shall be the Applicant’s burden to prove and document the existence and extent of the Previous Use.
4. Where the New Development is a change in use or tenant for only part of a multi-tenant building, the SDC can be calculated and paid for only the particular space involved.
E. If New Development is commenced or connection is made to the water, sanitary sewer, stormwater drainage or transportation systems without first obtaining a Permit, where one is required, all applicable SDCs shall be due and payable immediately upon the earliest date that a Permit was required.
F. The City Building Permit Department shall collect the applicable SDC(s) from the Applicant or person responsible for or receiving the benefit of the New Development in accordance with this Section. No Department of the City shall issue any Permit or allow connection to a City Capital Improvement system until all applicable SDCs have been paid in full or, at the City Manager’s option, future payment is financially guaranteed under such terms as the City Manager deems reasonable.
G. The obligation to pay an unpaid SDC and interest thereon shall be secured by property, bond, deposits, letter of credit or other security acceptable to the City Manager.
H. If an SDC is not paid upon issuance of a Permit or the Applicant is otherwise allowed to defer or pay an SDC in installments, the obligation shall include the following amounts added to the principal amount due:
1. Interest on the obligation at 9% annual simple interest;
2. All costs associated with processing the particular form of security, such as title insurance, escrow fees, recording costs, collection costs and any other expense incurred by the City in connection with the security;
3. Any and all costs, as determined by the City Manager, incurred in establishing payment schedules and administering the collections process;
4. When the charge is secured by bond pursuant to ORS 223.205 to 223.295, all costs associated with administering the bond assessment program and issuing the bonds, as determined by the City Manager;
5. The intent of this subsection is to recognize that the payment of an SDC by installments increases the administrative expense to the City. It is the intent of this subsection to shift that added expense to the applicant, so that the City will not lose SDC revenue by accepting installment payments on such charges. Subject to the provisions of subsection 12.07.080(F), all costs added to the SDC will be determined by the City Manager.

12.07.090
Partial and full exemptions.
The uses listed and described in this section shall be exempt, either partially or fully, from payment of one or more SDCs that are otherwise due. Any Applicant seeking an exemption under this Section shall specifically request that exemption within 180 days after issuance of a Permit for the New Development. Where New Development consists of only part of one or more of the uses described in this section, only that/those portion(s) of the development that qualify under this section are eligible for an exemption. The balance of the New Development that does not qualify for any exemption under this section shall be subject to the full SDC. Should the Applicant dispute any decision by the City regarding an exemption request, the Applicant must apply for an Alternative Exemption Determination under Section 12.07.110. The Applicant has the burden of proving entitlement to any exemption so requested.
A. Any use allowed by the City pursuant to a Transient Use Permit or a Special Event Permit.
B. Low income housing that receives federal funding, whether directly or through tax credits, and for which a deed restriction is recorded for each housing unit that preserves the unit as affordable housing for no less than 40 years.
C. Alteration permits for tenant improvements, new construction or remodeling are exempt where
1. no additional dwellings are created. Dwelling means any building or portion thereof that serves or could serve as a separate living facility, with areas for sleeping, eating, cooking and sanitation; or
2. if the New Development is not reasonably expected to result in an increase in person-trips as compared to the trip generation of the previous use, it is exempt from transportation SDC.
D. The construction of accessory buildings or structures that will not create additional dwelling units or do not create additional demands on the City’s Capital Improvement systems.
E. For New Development that includes a mix of exempt and non-exempt forms of development, the applicable exemption(s) shall apply only to that portion of the New Development to which the exemption applies.
12.07.100
Credits.
The City shall grant a credit against an SDC that is otherwise assessed for a New Development, for any Qualified Public Improvement constructed or dedicated as part of that New Development. The Applicant bears the burden of proof and persuasion in establishing entitlement to an SDC Credit and to a particular value of SDC Credit.
A. To obtain an SDC Credit, the Applicant must specifically request a credit within 180 days after Permit issuance for the New Development. In the request, the Applicant must identify the improvement(s) for which credit is sought and explain how the improvement(s) meet the requirements for a Qualified Public Improvement. The Applicant shall also document, with credible evidence, the value of the improvement(s) for which credit is sought. If, in the City Manager’s opinion, the improvement(s) are Qualified Public Improvement, and the City Manager concurs with the proposed value of the improvement(s), an SDC Credit shall be granted. The value of SDC Credits
Your Selections | Hood River, OR Page 301 of 753
The Hood River Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 2054, passed February 10, 2020.
under this Section shall be determined by the City Manager based on the cost of the Qualified Public Improvement, or the value of land dedicated, as follows:
1. For dedicated lands, value shall be based upon a written appraisal of fair market value by a qualified, professional appraiser based upon comparable sales of similar property between unrelated parties in an arms-length transaction;
2. For improvements yet to be constructed, value shall be based upon the anticipated cost of construction. Any such cost estimates shall be certified by a professional architect or engineer or based on a fixed price bid from a contractor ready and able to construct the improvement(s) for which SDC Credit is sought;
3. For improvements already constructed, value shall be based on the actual cost of construction as verified by receipts submitted by the Applicant;
4. For all improvements for which credit is sought, only the fraction of Over Capacity in the Qualified Public Improvement is eligible for SDC Credit. There is a presumption that improvements built to the City’s minimum standards are required to serve the Applicant’s New Development and to mitigate for transportation system impacts attributable to the Applicant’s New Development and therefore have no increment of Over Capacity;
B. The City Manager will respond to the Applicant’s written credit request within 21 days of when the request is submitted. The City Manager shall provide a written explanation of the decision on the SDC Credit request.
C. If an Applicant disputes the City Manager’s decision with regard to an SDC Credit request, including the amount of the credit, the Applicant may appeal the City Manager’s decision to the City Council pursuant to Section 12.07.130. Any such appeal must be filed with the City Recorder in writing within 14 calendar days of the City Manager’s written decision on the credit request.
D. In no event shall the amount of an SDC Credit approved by the City Manager under this Section exceed the amount of the SDC assessed by the City upon a New Development. In no event shall the City issue or be liable for a refund when the value of a credit-worthy Qualified Public Improvement exceeds any SDC assessed for a New Development.
12.07.110
Alternative sdc rate request.
A. An Applicant may dispute an SDC rate calculation if the Applicant believes that the impact of the New Development is less than the impact assumed by the City based on the City’s adopted SDC methodology. An Applicant may dispute an SDC exemption determination if the Applicant believes that the New Development qualifies for exemption under Section 12.07.090. To challenge an SDC rate calculation or exemption determination, the Applicant must submit such a request under this section, within 180 days after issuance of a Permit for the New Development. The City shall not entertain any such a request filed after 180 days after issuance of a Permit for the New Development.

1. Transportation SDC: If the Applicant believes the number of trips generated by the New Development is less than the number of trips estimated by the City’s established transportation SDC methodology, including the assumed Person-trip generation, the Applicant must provide complete and detailed documentation, including verifiable trip generation data, analyzed and certified to by a Professional Traffic Engineer. The Applicant’s supporting documentation must rely upon generally accepted sampling methods, sources of information, cost analysis, traffic and growth projections and techniques of analysis as a means of supporting the proposed alternative SDC rate. The proposed Alternative SDC Rate calculation shall include an explanation by a registered engineer explaining with particularity why the rate established in the City’s transportation SDC methodology does not accurately reflect the New Development’s impact on the City’s capital improvements and that the Applicant’s alternative trip generation profile better or more accurately reflects the New Development’s trip generation.
2. Water and Sewer SDC: If the Applicant believes its New Development will use significantly less water or generate significantly less sanitary sewage than the amounts assumed in the City’s adopted water and sanitary sewer SDC methodologies, the Applicant must provide complete and detailed documentation certified to by a Professional Engineer that unusual or innovative fixtures, and water use and water recapture methods will be employed. To document that significantly less water will be used, the Applicant shall document that the New Development will use a water meter at least one size smaller than a comparable conventional New Development would use. To document that significantly less sanitary sewage will be generated, the Applicant shall document that the New Development will generate no more than 50% of the sewage generated by a comparable conventional New Development.
3. Stormwater Drainage and Flood Control SDC: If the Applicant believes its New Development will generate significantly less stormwater runoff than the volume assumed in the City’s adopted stormwater SDC methodology, the Applicant must provide complete and detailed documentation certified to by a Professional Engineer as to the innovative stormwater capture, retention and reuse methods that will be employed to retain on site all stormwater runoff and that none will be released or discharged off-site into the City’s stormwater system.
B. The City Manager shall apply the Alternative SDC Rate if, in the City Manager’s opinion, all of the following circumstances are found to exist:
1. The evidence and assumptions underlying the Alternative SDC Rate are reasonable, correct and credible and were gathered and analyzed by a suitable, competent professional in compliance with generally accepted engineering principles and methodologies and consistent with this Section, and
2. The calculation of the proposed Alternative SDC rate was by a generally accepted methodology and any innovative designs, systems or techniques are reasonable, proven and likely to function as designed, and
3. The proposed alternative SDC rate better or more realistically reflects the actual impact of the New Development than the rate derived from use of the City’s SDC methodology.
C. The City Manager shall approve, reject or modify the Applicant’s requested SDC calculation or exemption request and provide a written response to the Applicant’s request explaining the basis for the decision.

Definitions.
“Council” means the City Council for the City of Hood River.
“Public Improvement” means a sewer or sewer line improvement, a street or street improvement, a surface water quality or quantity facility, and a water or water line improvement, or any other public improvement authorized and so designated by the Council, any and all of which conform to City standards.
“Person” means an individual or any legal entity, including the City of Hood River.
“Reimbursement Charge” means the charge imposed pursuant to this Chapter designed to reimburse a person for the costs of financing a public improvement. The Reimbursement Charge is not intended to limit or replace, and is in addition to, any other existing fees or charges collected by the City.
“Reimbursement District” means the area benefited by the construction of the public improvement financed in whole or in part by a person without the formation of a local improvement district. A Reimbursement District may be formed in conjunction with a local improvement district where a person finances a share of the costs of the improvement that is larger than the share that would result from a uniform application of the local improvement district assessment formula to property located in the local improvement district and owned by the person.
“Special benefit” or “specially benefit” mean the value associated with a capital improvement that relates to a particular property to the extent that the property is, or may be, partially relieved of a cost or expense associated with development or construction of the improvement, and which is different in degree from the value or benefit received by the general public.

extension or oversizing of water, sewer, or storm water management lines. More than one public improvement may be the subject of a Reimbursement District.
B. The application shall be in writing and shall be accompanied by a nonrefundable processing fee set by Council resolution sufficient to cover the administrative and notice costs of processing the application pursuant to this Chapter. If the City is the applicant, the fee shall be waived. The application shall include the following:
1. A description of the location, type, and size of the public improvement, including detailed or as-built plans or drawings showing the location, nature and extent of the public improvement.
2. A narrative explaining why the applicant believes all or part of the cost of the improvement is eligible for reimbursement pursuant to this Chapter.
3. A map showing the properties to be included in the proposed district, including the City zoning designation, tax lot numbers, owners of the properties, according to the current records of the County Assessor’s office and their mailing addresses, the square footage or frontage of the properties, and identification of the properties owned by the applicant, if any.
4. Detailed costs of the public improvements to be reimbursed. If the application is filed after construction, the application shall include the actual costs of construction as evidenced by a contract, receipts, bids or other similar documents. If the application is filed prior to construction, the application shall include the estimated costs of the improvements as evidenced by bids, cost and labor projections, or other similar evidence satisfactory to the City Engineer.
5. A proposed methodology for spreading the cost among the properties within the Reimbursement District and, where appropriate, defining a “unit” for applying the Reimbursement Charge to property that may, subject to City approval, be partitioned, adjusted or subdivided at a future date.
6. The date that the City accepted the public improvements or the date on which they are estimated to be complete.
7. A signed Construction Agreement on a form provided by the City.
8. Any other relevant information required by the City Engineer.

Your Selections | Hood River, OR Page 345 of 753
The Hood River Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 2054, passed February 10, 2020.
containing the City Engineer’s recommendation to be submitted to the Council within 30 days after receipt of the complete application. The report shall include the following information.
1. An explanation as to why the applicant is or is not qualified for reimbursement pursuant to this Chapter.
2. A description of the proposed area for the Reimbursement District. The description shall indicate whether properties located in the Urban Growth Area should be considered for inclusion in the Reimbursement District upon annexation.

4. The extent to which the improvement have or will relieve other property owners or developers of the need to construct some or all of the improvement and whether or not the properties within the proposed Reimbursement District would be required, as a condition of approval for future development, to construct some or all of the improvement.
5. A methodology for spreading the cost among the properties within the Reimbursement District and, where appropriate, defining a “unit” for applying the Reimbursement Charge to property that may, subject to City approval, be partitioned, adjusted or subdivided at a future date. The methodology should consider the cost of the improvements, prior contributions of property owners (only if for the same type of improvement at the same location), the value of the unused capacity, rate making principles employed to finance public improvements, and other relevant factors.
6. A proposed Reimbursement Charge for the District.
13.17.040
Public hearing.
A. The Council shall schedule a public hearing within a reasonable time following receipt of the City Engineer’s report at which the Council shall consider the application, the City Engineer’s report and any testimony or evidence presented concerning the proposed Reimbursement District. The hearing shall be for informational purposes and any person may present testimony generally and ask questions regarding the proposed Reimbursement District. The Mayor may impose reasonable time limits on testimony.
B. The City Recorder shall cause notice of the public hearing to be mailed by regular mail at least 14 days prior to the date set for the hearing to the applicant and to all property owners within the proposed Reimbursement District as shown on the most recent assessment roll in the possession of the County Assessor’s office. Notice shall be deemed effective on the date of mailing. Failure to receive notice by the applicant or any affected property owner shall not invalidate or otherwise affect the formation of the Reimbursement District. The notice shall:
1. State that a Reimbursement District has been proposed that includes the property of the person receiving the notice;
2. Briefly describe the Reimbursement District, the type of public improvement to be reimbursed, the amount of the Reimbursement Charge, and the circumstances under which the charge must be paid;
Your Selections | Hood River, OR Page 346 of 753
The Hood River Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 2054, passed February 10, 2020.
3. Include a copy of the City Engineer’s report;
4. State that any person may appear and be heard; and

The Council may, in its sole discretion, approve, reject or modify the proposed Reimbursement District as set forth in the City Engineer’s report. The final decision shall be made upon adoption of a formal written resolution. A resolution approving formation of a Reimbursement District shall incorporate the City Engineer’s report including modifications, if any, and shall address the following:
1. Whether the properties against which the Reimbursement Charge is proposed to be established are or will be specially benefited by the public improvement.
2. Whether the costs for which the Reimbursement Charge is sought are based upon improvement construction contract documents or other appropriate information provided by the applicant and the extent to which the costs exceed prevailing market rates for similar projects.
3. Whether the method of apportionment is reasonably calculated to reflect the special benefits each property received from the improvement.
4. Whether the annual percentage rate multiplier to be applied to the cost of construction reasonably reflects prevailing market rates. The date of the resolution forming the Reimbursement District shall be considered the date the District was formed.
D. When the applicant is other than the City, the resolution shall instruct the City Manager to enter into an agreement with the applicant pertaining to the Reimbursement District improvements. If the agreement is entered into prior to construction, the agreement shall be contingent upon the public improvements being accepted by the City. The agreement shall contain at least the following provisions:
1. The public improvement(s) shall meet all applicable city standards.
2. The total amount of potential reimbursement to the applicant.
3. The total amount of potential reimbursement shall not exceed the actual cost of the public improvement(s).
4. The annual fee adjustment set by the Council, if any.
5. The applicant shall guarantee the public improvement(s) for a period of 12 months from the date of installation.
6. The applicant shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the City form any and all losses, claims, damage, judgments or other costs or expenses arising as a result of or related to the City’s establishment of the district, including the City’s costs or expenses related to collection of the Reimbursement Charges pursuant to this Chapter.

7. Any other provisions the Council determines necessary and proper to carry out the provisions of this Chapter.
E. Following adoption of the resolution establishing the Reimbursement District, the City Recorder may cause a copy of the resolution to be recorded in the County Assessor’s office to provide public notice of the Reimbursement Charge applicable to the properties within the Reimbursement District. The recording shall not create a lien. A copy of the resolution shall be sent by regular mail to the owners of the subject properties and to any other person who may have requested a copy. Failure of the City to record, send a copy of the resolution to a person or property owner, or failure of a person or property owner to receive the copy, shall not invalidate any proceeding in connection with the establishment of a Reimbursement District.
F. No legal action intended to challenge or contest the formation of the Reimbursement District or the methodology or amount of the Reimbursement Charge shall be filed after sixty (60) days following formation of the Reimbursement District pursuant to this section.
13.17.050
Determining reasonable actual costs.
A. The applicant shall not be entitled to reimbursement for any costs in excess of the reasonable actual costs. If the Reimbursement District is formed before the actual costs are known, the City Engineer’s report and the Council’s decision may be based on estimated costs. If estimated costs are used, the methodology or the certificate of payment, or both, shall provide for a recalculation of the cost no later than three months after completion and acceptance of the improvement by the City. An applicant shall demonstrate actual costs by submitting contracts, invoices, or such other documentation the City Engineer or Council deems sufficient. Actual costs shall not be deemed reasonable if the Council determines that the costs significantly exceed prevailing market rates for similar projects. If the Council finds that the actual costs are not reasonable, the Council may reduce the reimbursable costs to the prevailing market rate for similar projects.
B. The following costs shall not subject to reimbursement:
1. Costs for that portion of the public improvement that specially benefits the applicant’s property.
2. Costs for the improvement that are not dedicated to and accepted by the City as a public improvement.
3. Costs for a public improvement that is required as a condition of development approval, except in cases where the nature and degree of the public improvement is disproportionate to the impacts of the development or where the City desires an oversized or additional improvement beyond that which is roughly proportional to the impacts of the development.
4. Costs other than the costs of construction. Costs of construction may include the reasonable acquisition and condemnation costs of acquiring off-site right-of-way and/or easements, engineering services as demonstrated by invoice, and the estimated annual percentage increase in such costs over the ten years during which the Reimbursement District will be in effect. Engineering may include surveying and inspection, and shall not exceed 13.5 percent of the total eligible construction costs.
Your Selections | Hood River, OR Page 348 of 753
The Hood River Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 2054, passed February 10, 2020.
5. Costs for the relocation of electrical, telephone, cable television or natural gas utility that benefit the applicant’s property.
6. Costs for extra work and materials required to correct design deficiencies in construction to bring the improvement to City standards.
7. Costs for public improvements that are the minimum size necessary to meet City standards and serve the applicant’s property.
8. Costs for a minor street alignment, except for the cost of right-of-way acquisition beyond the limits of the applicant’s frontage along the improved street.
9. Costs attributable to profit or overhead of the person making the application.
10. Costs for improvements for which no application for a Reimbursement District has been received by the City within 180 days from the date of the City’s acceptance of the improvements. Reimbursement Charges may not be applied retroactively upon benefited properties that have applied for development or connected to the improvement within the six (6) months immediately preceding the City’s approval of a Reimbursement District application, or that have connected to or otherwise utilized the improvement before the City’s approval of the application.
11. All costs where the applicant has received a credit against impact fees, SDC’s or other connection fees for the same type of improvement.
12. Except with respect to the cost of traffic control signals, street improvement costs shall be recoverable only from those properties that lie adjacent or contiguous to a street improvement that would otherwise be required to be constructed, or a portion of which would otherwise be required to be constructed, by the adjacent or contiguous property upon development.
C. Nothing in this Chapter shall require inclusion of City-owned property within a Reimbursement District unless the Reimbursement District was established prior to the City’s acquisition of the property. Property that is dedicated or conveyed to the City for public right of way purposes may or may not be included in a Reimbursement District as determined by the Council.
13.17.060
Obligation to pay reimbursement charge.
A. An owner of property within any Reimbursement District shall pay to the City, in addition to any other applicable fees and charges, the Reimbursement Charge when any of the following events occur within ten (10) years from the District formation date:
1. A use of the property is expanded to create additional “units” as that term is defined in the City Engineer’s report.
2. A building permit that will use or increase the use of a public improvement.
Your Selections | Hood River, OR Page 349 of 753
The Hood River Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 2054, passed February 10, 2020.
3. A connection to a public improvement or otherwise use of a public improvement that will increase the use of the public improvement.

3. For street improvements, to make a physical change, following construction of the improvement for which the District was formed, requiring a building or development permit on the property that increases the trips on the street or creates a new entrance onto the street.
C. The Reimbursement Charge is due and payable in full, or provision for installment payments or other acceptable security has been made, and payment is a precondition to receiving the first City permit applicable to the development activity, or, in the case of a connection to a line, as a precondition to receiving the connection permit.
D. A person who becomes obligated to pay the Reimbursement Charge as the result of a connection to a line constructed through the local improvement district process and who owns property within the local improvement district against which an assessment is levied may also be assessed a Reimbursement Charge as an added portion of the local improvement district assessment.
E. Inclusion in a Reimbursement District and payment of a Reimbursement Charge may be made a condition of approval of annexation of property.
F. No person shall be required to pay a Reimbursement Charge on an application or upon property for which the Reimbursement Charge has been previously paid, or for which a Proportionate Contribution, as defined in Chapter 3.20, has been previously paid, unless payment was for a different public improvement.
13.17.070
Right of reimbursement.
A. The right to reimbursement under this Chapter is transferable and assignable after the applicant or their assignee delivers written notice to the City advising the City to whom future payments must be made.
B. No City officer or employee or agent, acting in their official capacity, shall be liable for payment of any Reimbursement Charge, accrued percentage rate or portion thereof. Only those payments that the City has received from or on behalf of properties within a Reimbursement District shall be payable to the person holding the right to reimbursement. The City’s general fund or other revenue sources shall not be liable for or subject to payment of outstanding but unpaid Improvement Finance Charges.

The Hood River Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 2054, passed February 10, 2020.
C. Upon receipt of a Reimbursement Charge, or portion thereof, the City shall record the payment on the City lien docket with respect to the property for which the payment is made. Within ninety (90) days of receipt, the City shall remit the funds to the person holding the right of reimbursement, less an amount equal to a certain percentage of the payment, to be set by Council resolution, for the cost of administration of the program by the City.
13.17.080
Ownership of public improvement.
Public improvements installed pursuant to Reimbursement District agreements shall become and remain the sole property of the City.
13.17.090
Prohibited conduct.

C. The remedies provided under this section are cumulative to any other remedies provided by law.
13.17.100
Unpaid reimbursement charges.
Whenever the full Reimbursement Charge has not been paid and collected for any reason after it is due, the City Manager shall report to the Council the amount of the uncollected reimbursement, the legal description of the property on which the Reimbursement Charge is due, the date when the Reimbursement Charge was due and the name of the property owner. The Council shall then set a public hearing date and direct the City Manager to give notice of the public hearing to each of the property owners, together with a copy of the City Manager’s report concerning the unpaid Reimbursement Charges. The notice may be either by certified mail or personal service. At the public hearing, the Council may accept, reject, or modify the City Manager’s report. If the Council determines that a Reimbursement Charge is due but has not been paid for whatever reason, the City may take any action including all legal or equitable means necessary to collect the unpaid amount. An unpaid Reimbursement Charge shall prohibit any issuance of permits by the City for the property.

When there has been an approved division of a parcel and that parcel has outstanding a property assessment remaining wholly or partially unpaid, and full payment or an installment payment is not due, then any owner, mortgagee, or lien holder of any property affected by the division may apply for a reapportionment of the property assessment. The Council shall reapportion the property assessment by resolution, and that resolution shall be filed with the lien docket. Where the property assessment is being paid in installments, the installments remaining unpaid shall be prorated among those smaller parcels so that each parcel shall be charged with the percentage of the remaining installment payments equal to the percentage of the unpaid property assessment levied on the parcel upon apportionment. Reapportionment shall be on the same basis as the original property assessment.
B. Reapportionment of a participant fee, if any, will be addressed in the assessment ordinance.

Expenditure of property assessments and participant fees.
A. Money derived from property assessments and participant fees imposed under this Chapter shall be spent only for economic improvements described in the economic improvement plan and for the costs of City administration of the EID, including formation expenses.
B. An assessment ordinance adopted under this Chapter may require creation of an advisory committee for each EID to recommend to the council, from time to time, how expenditures of moneys for economic improvements pursuant to the economic improvement plan shall be allocated. The Council shall consider the recommendations and may, by resolution, amend the expenditure provisions of the assessment ordinance. If an advisory committee is created, the Council shall, in appointing members to the committee, give strong preference to those property owners and business owners within the EID.

Permit – Required – Application requirements.
It is unlawful for any person, firm, corporation or association, to construct or install any service driveway across any sidewalk, parking strip, curb or in or upon any part of any street without first obtaining a permit from the City Engineer or their designee. Any person, firm, corporation or association desiring to construct or install a service driveway shall make application in writing, to the City Engineer or their designee for a permit, and such application shall state the location of the proposed service driveway, a description of the property in front of which such driveway is to be constructed or installed, the kind of material proposed to be used in the construction of such driveway, the width of the proposed driveway, and such other data and information as the City Engineer or their designee may require before issuance of a permit.
A. For service drive ways on property frontages of one hundred feet or less where the City Engineer or their designee finds that such driveways are not a menace to the safety of the city and will not seriously affect the parking area in that portion of the city where such driveway is proposed to be constructed and in line with the provisions of Section 13.28.020, the City Engineer or their designee shall issue a permit therefore.
B. If only one service driveway is desired, the maximum width shall be as follows:

Maximum Width of Cuts
Less than 16 feet
8 feet
16 to 30 feet
53 percent of width

C. In other than residential zones (R l, R 2, R 3 as set forth in the city’s zoning ordinance on file in the office of the city recorder) of the city, only one service driveway shall be allowed for a frontage up to fifty feet. For frontages in nonresidential zones over fifty feet and less than one hundred feet, if two service driveways are desired the maximum width of each driveway shall be not more than twenty five feet and not more than two such twenty-five foot driveways shall be permitted within that frontage. If service driveways less than twenty five feet in width are desired, three ten foot driveways will be permitted for each one hundred feet or more of frontage.
D. For any frontage in excess of one hundred feet, each additional one hundred feet or fraction thereof shall be considered as a separate frontage, any service driveway in excess of the above maximum width must receive the approval of the council.
E. Only one service driveway will be allowed for frontage of less than fifty one feet for residential properties in the R l, R 2, R 3 zone areas of the city except when the City Engineer finds that a residential property has unusual or severe access problems, he may allow two driveway cuts of not more than twelve feet each.

H. In cases where driveways are constructed on corner lots no driveway shall be built closer than three feet from the crosswalk at the curbline.
I. In all cases the City Engineer or their designee shall have the right to determine the location of each such driveway with reference to lot lines keeping in mind the use of the street, public safety, necessity for maximum parking space on street and the use for which the driveway is intended and the premises to be served.

Driveways and public street access spacing standards.
Driveway accesses shall be separated from other driveways and street intersections in accordance with the following standards and procedures.
A. Local Streets. A minimum of 22 feet separation (as measured by straight curb between access points) shall be required on local streets (i.e. streets not designated as collectors or arterials).
B. Arterial and Collector Streets. Access spacing on collector and arterial streets, and intersections shall be determined based on the policies and standards contained in the City’s Transportation System Plan and Manual for Uniform Traffic Control Devices. Access to state highways shall be subject to the requirements of the Oregon Highway Plan and OAR Chapter 734, Division 51.
C. Special Provision for all Streets. Direct street access may be restricted for some land uses. For example, access consolidation, shared access, and/or access separation greater than that specified, may be required by the City or ODOT for the purpose of protecting the function, safety and operation of the street for all users. Where no other alternative exists, the permitting agency may allow construction of an access connection along the property line farthest from an intersection. In such cases, directional connections (i.e., right in/out, right in only, or right out only) may be required. New connections shall not be permitted within the functional area of an intersection or interchange, unless no other reasonable access to the property is available.
The standards for driveway and street spacing on local public streets are established in Table 8 of the Transportation System Plan and are included below as Table 13.28-A.

If denied, the applicant may appeal to the City Council.
D. Permit Nonexclusive. The permit is not exclusive. The City expressly reserves the right to grant permits or rights to other persons, as well as the City’s right to use the right of way for similar or different purposes, as allowed hereunder.

Nothing in the permit shall be construed to prevent the City from constructing sewers, grading, paving, repairing and/or altering any right of way, laying down, repairing or removing water or sewer mains, or constructing or establishing any other public work, utility or improvement, including repairs, replacement or removal of City facilities. If any of user’s facilities interferes with the construction or repair of any right of way, public work, City utility, City improvement, or City facility, and the City and user are unable to find a reasonable alternative, user’s facilities shall be removed or relocated as provided in Section 13.36.050 below, in a manner acceptable to the City, and subject to industry standard engineering and safety codes.
F. Permit Fee. The permit fee is established by resolution of the City Council and will be in an amount which helps to defray the costs of design reviews, construction observation and administration of the requirements of this Chapter.

13.36.040
Construction.

The Hood River Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 2054, passed February 10, 2020.
C. Undergrounding Required – New Facilities. Whenever any existing facilities are located underground within a right of way, user must also locate new facilities underground. The City Engineer shall provide an exception for transmission facilities when such transmission lines are not customarily located underground in accordance with industry engineering standards or when the cost of placing the facilities underground substantially increases the cost of the project for the customers within the City receiving service from the facilities. Telecommunications users shall co-locate new facilities in existing underground ducts or conduits whenever surplus capacity exists, unless the user can demonstrate to the City Engineer’s satisfaction that collocation is not feasible. All new facilities shall be constructed underground pursuant to Chapter 12.05 or when required to do so by the City in conjunction with a publicly funded construction project. User is prohibited from installing any new aerial cables, wire, or conduit unless otherwise permitted by Chapter 12.05.
D. Hours of Work. Except for emergencies, work shall be performed between the hours of 7 AM and 7 PM, Monday through Friday, unless approved otherwise by the City Engineer in writing.
E. Notification. Except in the case of an emergency affecting the public safety, user shall notify the City Engineer not less than 2 business days in advance of any work in the right of way. In the event of an emergency affecting the public safety, work may be made in a right of way provided that user notifies the City Engineer within 48 hours of doing the work, and complies thereafter with all provisions of this Chapter, including submitting an application for a permit.
F. Coordination of Work. All users are required to make a good faith effort to cooperate and coordinate construction schedules with each other, with the City, and with other users of the right of way. At least annually by January 1 of each year, all users shall provide the City and all other users with a schedule of known proposed construction activities for that year to determine if joint projects are feasible to minimize duplication of work and excavation in the right of way. For those persons expressing an interest in a joint project, the user shall give them reasonable notice of the particular dates for the work to begin. Upon mutual agreement, the user shall make the trench available to those persons participating in the joint project for installation of equipment. The payment for the cost of trenching and installation will be as mutually agreed to by the parties.
G. Obtaining Required Permits. If the work in the right of way requires any additional permits, user shall obtain the permits and pay any applicable permit fees.
H. Plans.
1. When documentation, drawings, plans or specifications have been required for a permit application, the user shall furnish the City with 2 complete sets of record drawings drawn to scale and certified to the City as accurately depicting the location of all facilities constructed pursuant to the permit, one set on paper and the other set in electronic format. These record drawings shall be submitted to the City Engineer within 60 days following acceptance of the facilities by the City, in a format mutually acceptable to the user and City Engineer.
2. When requested by the user, and subject to the provisions of state law and the Oregon Public Records laws, the City shall treat as confidential any public record or information provided and designated by the user as confidential.

The Hood River Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 2054, passed February 10, 2020.
I. Use by City. The City, at its cost, may install pipes or conduit in any trench or excavation created by user, to the extent that space is reasonably available. The City may also require user to excavate trenches larger than needed by user, with the excess capacity to be utilized by the City and with the City responsible for the incremental cost provided that requiring the user to do so does not impose unreasonable delay on the user’s construction activities. This section does not apply where collocation would not comply with federal or state safety or environmental laws.
J. Safety. User shall perform all work in a manner that ensures safety of workers and the public. Safety requirements and traffic maintenance shall be in conformance with the City Engineer Standards.
K. Moving of Structures and Equipment. Whenever it becomes necessary to allow for the passage of buildings, machinery or other objects, user shall temporarily rearrange, remove, lower or raise its wires, cables or other facilities as necessary, at no cost to the City whether or not requested by the City. Whenever any person other than the City requests passage to move buildings, machinery or other objects, that person shall pay the entire actual cost incurred by user for changing, altering, moving, removing or replacing its wires, cables, or other facilities so as to permit passage, and shall deposit in advance with user a sum equal to such cost as estimated by user. The person undertaking the move shall pay all damages caused directly by the changing, altering, moving, removing or replacing of such wires, cables or other facilities, except for damages and claims that are the direct result of user’s negligent acts. Except in an emergency, user shall be given not less than 30 days written notice by the party desiring to move a building or other objects. The notice shall detail the route of movement of the buildings or other objects over and along the rights of way of the City. Upon receiving required notice, user shall complete the moves as soon as practicable, and without undue delay. Furthermore, the passage of buildings, machinery or other objects shall be with as much haste as possible and shall not be necessarily delayed or cause user unnecessary expense or waste of time. Moving buildings or part of buildings must also comply with Chapter 15.12.
L. Work in Right of Way by City. Whenever the City shall perform or cause or permit to be performed any work for the City in any right of way where the work may disturb or interfere with a user’s facilities, the City shall, or require its permittee, to notify the user in writing in a reasonable time prior to the contemplated work to enable the user to take those measures, including relocation or removal, as may be deemed necessary to protect its facilities, at the user’s own expense.
13.36.050
Relocation/undergrounding.
A. Whenever the City determines that it is necessary, the City may require user to change the location of its facilities, including relocating underground, or to remove its equipment from the right of way. Within a reasonable time period specified in written notice, or immediately in the case of an emergency, user shall, at user’s expense, temporarily or permanently (as specified by the City) relocate any of its equipment or facilities within the right of way whenever the City determines that relocation is reasonably necessary for:

The Hood River Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 2054, passed February 10, 2020.
2. The construction, installation or improvement of any public right of way by a private developer as a condition of property development, provided that neither the City nor the user are required to pay the relocation costs.
3. The operations of the City or other governmental entity in the right of way.
4. The public interest.
If any of the foregoing improvements eliminate space available for user’s existing overhead facilities within an existing public utility easement or within the right of way, user shall at no expense to the City, relocate facilities underground or secure a private utility easement. The City is not obligated to provide right of way solely for the use of any user’s facilities.
B. In cases of capital improvements (as opposed to public improvements to rights of way as described in subsection (A) above) undertaken by either the City or a private contractor on behalf of the City, user shall at user’s own expense, underground existing overhead facilities at the request of the City where other users are similarly required to do so.
C. Costs for moving facilities necessitated for anything other than publicly-funded projects shall be borne by the person requesting relocation or removal. User shall pay the cost for relocation of user’s equipment for publicly-funded projects to the extent the City is not reimbursed. When a project is funded with both private and public funds, user shall pay the percentage of the costs that is equal to the percentage of City funds that were spent on the relocation.
D. The City shall provide written notice as soon as practicable to affected users of a project planned by the City that would require relocation of users’ facilities. Prior to requesting relocation, the City shall make a reasonable effort to find an alternative location within a right of way for relocated facilities.
E. If user fails to move any facilities as requested by the City by the date specifiedin the written notice, the City may cause the facilities to be moved at user’s own expense. Upon receipt of a detailed invoice for payment from the City, user shall reimburse the City for the costs the City incurred within 60 days, including all labor and material costs and an administrative overhead fee of 20% plus interest after 30 days.
F. Nothing in this chapter prohibits a user from seeking reimbursement and/or payment for relocation costs under this section from a third party or the City in accordance with applicable state laws and rules, provided that such reimbursement or payment does not delay the user’s obligation to comply with this section in a timely manner.
13.36.060
Repairs and restoration.
A. When a user, or any person acting on their behalf, does any work in or affecting any public rights of way or City property, they shall, at their own expense, promptly remove any obstructions therefrom and restore the ways or property to a condition equal to or better than its condition prior to commencement of the work unless otherwise directed by the City Engineer, or unless otherwise specified by a permit.

The Hood River Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 2054, passed February 10, 2020.
B. If weather or other conditions do not permit the complete restoration required by this Section, the user shall temporarily restore and maintain the affected rights of way or property if directed to do so by the City Engineer. Temporary restoration shall be at the user’s own expense and the user shall promptly undertake and complete the required permanent restoration when the weather or other conditions no longer prevent permanent restoration. Any corresponding modification to the construction schedule is subject to approval by the City. Temporary restoration means restoring the property to a safe condition permitting the use of the property as was made prior to the work being undertaken. Temporary restoration does not require paving, landscaping or surfacing of a permanent nature.
C. If the user fails to restore rights of way or property to good order and condition, the City shall give the user written notice and provide the user a reasonable period of time, not exceeding 30 days, to restore the rights of way or property. If the user fails thereafter to restore the rights of way or property to good order and condition, the City may cause the restoration to be made at the expense of the user, and the user shall reimburse the City for such costs, including all labor and material costs and an administrative overhead fee of 20% plus interest after 30 days.
13.36.070

B. The City Engineer and the City’s representatives shall have access to the work site and any further information as they may require to insure compliance with this Chapter or the permit, or protection of the right of way.

If the Permit is not produced, the work shall be stopped until the Permit is produced.
C. Any work that does not comply with this Chapter or the Permit, shall be removed, replaced or corrected at the user’s own expense immediately following oral or written notification by the City Engineer.

Whenever user discontinues use of any facilities and does not intend to use the facilities within 12 consecutive months, user shall remove the facilities from the right of way unless the City agrees, in writing, that the facilities may remain in the right of way. The City shall not unreasonably withhold agreement and a condition requiring user to convey title or ownership of the facilities to the City shall not be considered unreasonable. If user fails to remove facilities that are no longer going to be used within a reasonable time not to exceed one year, and the City has not agreed to allow user to abandon the facilities in place, the City may remove the facilities at user’s own expense. Upon receipt of a demand for payment from the City, user shall pay the City for the estimated costs or a detailed invoice of the costs the City incurred within 60 days, including all labor and material costs and an administrative overhead fee of 20% plus interest after 30 days.
13.36.110

If the City vacates any right of way, or portion thereof, that user uses, user shall remove its facilities from the right of way at its own expense unless the City reserves a public utility easement, which the City shall make a reasonable effort to do. User shall be notified of proposed vacation at least 90 days before user is required to relocate or remove its facilities. If user fails to remove its facilities within 30 days, or as otherwise necessary to complete removal, after a right of way is vacated, the City may remove the facilities at user’s own expense. Upon receipt of a detailed invoice from the City, user shall reimburse the City for the costs the City incurred within 60 days, including all labor and material costs and an administrative overhead fee of 20% plus interest after 30 days.

The insurance shall provide coverage at all times of not less than the statutory maximum limits of liability imposed on municipalities of the State of Oregon and shall include costs of defense. The insurance shall be without prejudice to coverage otherwise existing and shall name as additional insureds the City and its officers, agents, and employees. The coverage must apply as to claims between insureds on the policy. The Certificate of Insurance shall provide that the insurance shall not be canceled or materially altered without 30 days’ prior written notice first being given to the City. If the insurance is canceled or materially altered, user shall provide a replacement policy with the terms as outlined in this Section. User shall maintain continuous uninterrupted coverage, in the terms and amounts required. User may self insure any or all of the above coverage. The insurance policy(s) may provide for self-retention or deductibles in reasonable amounts.

The Hood River Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 2054, passed February 10, 2020.
2. New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharge from the systems into flood waters; and,
3. On site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
D. Subdivision Proposals.
1. All subdivision proposals shall be reviewed to be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage;
2. All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage;
3. All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood damage; and,
4. Where base flood elevation data has not been provided or is not available from another authoritative source, it shall be generated for subdivision proposals and other proposed developments which contain at least fifty lots or five acres (whichever is less).
E. Review of Building Permits. Where elevation data is not available either through the flood insurance study or from another authoritative source (See Section 15.44.060 B), applications for building permits shall be reviewed to assure that proposed construction will be reasonably safe from flooding. The test of reasonableness is a local judgment and includes use of historical data, high water marks, and photo graphs of past flooding, where available. Failure to elevate at least two feet above grade in these zones may result in higher insurance rates. (Ord. 1610, 1989; Ord. 1490, 1981)

Specific standards for flood hazard.
In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in Section 15.44.030 or Section 15.44.060 B, the following provisions are required.
A. Residential Construction.
1. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above base flood elevation.
2. Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to flooding are prohibited, or shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of flood waters. Designs for meeting these requirements must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or must meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
a. A minimum of two openings have a total new area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided;
b. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade;
Your Selections | Hood River, OR Page 434 of 753
The Hood River Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 2054, passed February 10, 2020.
c. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other coverings or devices; provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.
B. Nonresidential Construction.
1. New construction and substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the level of the base flood elevation; or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, shall:
a. Be flood proofed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water;
b. Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy;
c. Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting provisions of this subsection based on their development and/or review of the structural design, specifications and plans. Such certifications shall be provided to the official as set forth in Section 15.44.060(B).
2. Non-residential structures that are elevated, not flood proofed, must meet the same standards for space below the lowest floor as described in subsection A of this section.
3. Applicants flood proofing nonresidential buildings shall be notified that flood insurance premiums will be based on rates that are one foot below the flood proofed level (e.g., a building constructed to the base flood level will be rated as one foot below that level).
C. Manufactured Homes. All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved within Zones Al 30, AH, and AE shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system in accordance with the provisions of Section 15.44.070 B2. (Ord. 1610, 1989; Ord. 1490, 1981)
15.44.090
Floodways.
Located within areas of special flood hazard established in Section 15.44.030 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions apply.
A. Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other development unless certification by a registered professional engineer or architect is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge;
B. If subsection A above is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Sections 15.44.070 and 15.44.080. (Ord. 1610, 1989)

16.12.010
General applicability.
All subdivisions and partitions must comply with the provisions of this chapter. Subdivisions and partitions that include the construction of a street may require detailed findings demonstrating compliance with each section. For partitions that do not include the construction of a street, fewer code provisions may apply.
16.12.020
Vehicular Access and Circulation.
A. Intent and Purpose. The intent of this section is to manage vehicle access to development through a connected street system, while preserving the flow of traffic in terms of safety, roadway capacity, and efficiency.
B. Applicability. This section shall apply to all public streets within the City and to all properties that abut these streets.
C. Access Permit. Access to a public street requires an access permit in accordance with the following procedures:
1. Permits for access to City streets shall be subject to review and approval by the City Engineer based on the standards contained in this Section, and the provisions of Section 16.12.060 – Public Facilities Standards. An access permit may be in the form of a letter to the applicant, or it may be attached to a land use decision notice as a condition of approval.
2. Permits for access to State highways shall be subject to review and approval by Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT), except when ODOT has delegated this responsibility to the City or the County. In that case, the City or County shall determine whether access is granted based on its adopted standards.
3. Permits for access to County highways shall be subject to review and approval by the County, except where the County has delegated this responsibility to the City, in which case the City shall determine whether access is granted based on adopted County standards.
D. Traffic Impact Analysis. The City or other agency with access jurisdiction may require a traffic study prepared by a qualified professional to determine access, circulation, and other transportation requirements. The City requires either a Transportation Assessment Letter or a Traffic Impact Analysis pursuant to Section 17.20.060 for proposed land use actions unless waived by the City Engineer. (See also, Public Facilities Standards, Section 16.12.060.)
E. Conditions of Approval. The City or other agency with access permit jurisdiction may require the closing or consolidation of existing curb cuts or other vehicle access points, recording of reciprocal access easements (i.e., for shared driveways), development of a frontage street, installation of traffic control devices, and/or other mitigation as a condition of granting an access permit to ensure the safe and efficient operation of the street and highway system. Access to and from off-street parking areas shall not permit backing onto a public street.
F. Access Options. When vehicle access is required for development (i.e., for off-street parking, delivery, service, drive-through facilities, etc.), access shall be provided by one of the following methods (a minimum of ten [10] feet per lane is required). These methods are “options” to the developer/subdivider, unless a method is specifically required by the City Engineer.
Your Selections | Hood River, OR Page 451 of 753
The Hood River Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 2054, passed February 10, 2020.
1. Option 1: Access is from an existing or proposed alley or mid-block lane.
2. Option 2: Access is from a private street or driveway connected to an adjoining property that has direct access to a public street (i.e., “shared driveway”). A private street may only be developed as part of a Planned Unit Development. A public access easement covering the driveway shall be recorded in this case to assure access to the closest public street for all users of the private street/drive.
3. Option 3: Access is from a public street adjacent to the development parcel. If practicable, the owner/developer may be required to close or consolidate an existing access point as a condition of approving a new access. Street accesses shall comply with the access spacing standards in Section G, below.
4. Frontage on an Arterial Street: New residential land divisions fronting onto an arterial street shall be required to provide alleys or secondary (local or collector) streets for access to individual lots. When alleys or secondary streets cannot be constructed due to topographic or other physical constraints, access may be provided by consolidating driveways for clusters of two (2) or more lots (e.g., includes Planned Unit Developments and mid-block lanes).
5. Double-Frontage Lots: When a lot has frontage onto two (2) or more streets, access shall be provided first from the street with the lowest classification. For example, access shall be provided from a local street before a collector or arterial street. Except for corner lots, the creation of new double-frontage lots shall be prohibited in all residential zones, unless topographic or physical constraints require the formation of such lots. When double-frontage lots are permitted in all residential zones, a landscape buffer with trees and/or shrubs and ground cover not less than ten (10) feet wide shall be provided between the back yard fence/wall and the sidewalk or street; maintenance shall be assured by the owner (i.e., through homeowner’s association, etc.).
G. Access Spacing. Driveway accesses shall be separated from other driveways and street intersections in accordance with the following standards and procedures:
1. Local Streets: A minimum of twenty-two (22) feet separation (as measured from the sides of the driveway/street) shall be required on local streets (i.e., streets not designated as collectors or arterials), except as provided in subsection 3, below.
2. Arterial and Collector Streets: Access spacing on collector and arterial streets, and at controlled intersections (i.e., with four-way stop sign or traffic signal) shall be determined based on the policies and standards contained in the City’s Transportation System Plan. Access to state highways shall be subject to the requirements of the Oregon Highway Plan and OAR Chapter 734, Division 51.
The standards for driveway and street spacing on local public streets are established in Table 8 of the Transportation System Plan and are included below as Table 16.12-A.

cOR 281 and US 30 are currently classified as District Highways
H. Shared Driveways. The number of driveways and private street intersections with public streets shall be minimized by the use of shared driveways with adjoining lots where feasible. The City shall require shared driveways as a condition of land division or site design review, as applicable, for traffic safety and access management purposes in accordance with the following standards:
1. Shared driveways and frontage streets may be required to consolidate access onto a collector or arterial street. When shared driveways or frontage streets are required, they shall be stubbed to adjacent developable parcels to indicate future extension.
2. Access easements (i.e., for the benefit of affected properties) shall be recorded for all shared driveways, including pathways, at the time of final plat approval.
3. Exception. Shared driveways are not required when existing development patterns or physical constraints (e.g., topography, parcel configuration, and similar conditions) prevent extending the street/driveway in the future.
I. Street Connectivity and Formation of Blocks Required. In order to promote efficient vehicular and pedestrian circulation throughout the City, land divisions and large site developments shall produce complete blocks bounded by a connecting network of public and/or private streets, in accordance with the following standards:
1. Block Length and Perimeter: The maximum block length and perimeter shall not exceed
a. Four Hundred (400) feet length and 1,200 feet perimeter in the in the Central Business District;
b. Six Hundred (600) feet length and 1,600 feet perimeter in residential zones (R-1, R-2, and R-3);
c. Not applicable to the Industrial zone (I); and
d. Eight Hundred (800) feet length and 2,000 feet perimeter in all other zones.
2. Street Standards: Public and private streets shall also conform to criteria in Public Facilities Standards (Section 16.12.060), Pedestrian Access and Circulation (Section 16.12.030), and applicable Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) design standards.
3. Exception: Exceptions to the above standards may be granted when blocks are divided by one (1) or more pathway(s), in conformance with the provisions of Section 16.12.030. Pathways shall be located to minimize out-of-direction travel by pedestrians and may be designed to accommodate bicycles.
J. Future Street Plan (FSP) Required. Future Street Plans provide a guide for transportation circulation to the developing site and in the immediate area. A future street plan demonstrates how access can be provided to

The Hood River Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 2054, passed February 10, 2020.
parcels within 600 feet of the boundaries of the site, and is a conceptual plan in that its adoption does not establish a precise alignment.
1. Applicability: The provisions of section 16.12.020(J) apply to all tentative major partition and subdivision plans within the Urbanizing Area as shown in Local Street Connectivity standards of the Transportation System Plan. A FSP shall be filed in conjunction with all applications for subdivisions and major partitions. The FSP shall contain the information in Subsection (2) and shall be subject to review and approval under Subsection (4), below. The Planning Director may reduce the amount of off-site area to be considered below 600 feet in one (1) or more directions in the following situations:
a. Due to topography, the existing street pattern, or other constraints, the proposed future street plan does not need to consider access for adjacent parcels or continuation of an appropriate street system within 600 feet.
b. The proposed street layout is consistent with a street pattern of an existing approved FSP.
2. Submittal Requirements: The Future Street Plan shall include sufficient dimensions and other data to verify conformance to the FSP criteria. The FSP shall incorporate the following details, both on-site and off-site:
a. The FSP shall be no larger than eleven (11) inches x seventeen (17) inches and may include several sheets;
b. The topography for slopes of fifteen percent (15%) or greater with contour intervals not more than ten (10) feet;
c. The name, classification, location, right-of-way width, centerline radius, grade of all existing and proposed streets, bike-ways, and pedestrian ways within the subject site;
d. Property lines and dimensions;
e. Existing and proposed streets and pedestrian/bicycle facilities and destinations, within 600 feet of the development;
f. Site access points for autos, pedestrians, bicycles; and
g. The conceptual future alignments of streets extending to allow for future traffic circulation and how access could be provided to adjacent parcels within 600 feet of the boundaries of the site.
3. Review Criteria: A proposed FSP shall comply with the relevant portions of the Title 17, the Transportation System Plan, and the following:
a. A future street plan shall:
1. Adequately serve local traffic (i.e., traffic with an origin in, and destination to, the area of the plan);
Your Selections | Hood River, OR Page 456 of 753
The Hood River Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 2054, passed February 10, 2020.
2. Provide for the logical extension, continuation, and interconnection of streets, to serve circulation and access needs;
3. Provide multi-directional access and circulation to the street system, avoiding maze-like and discontinuous street patterns;
4. Balance traffic distribution within an area, rather than concentrating traffic on a few streets;
5. Minimize the impact to natural resources and fit the landscape; and
6. Provide pedestrian access and create neighborhoods.
b. Wherever feasible, streets, alleys, and pedestrian-bicycle accessways shall connect on both ends to other streets, within the development and to existing and planned streets outside the development. Pedestrian/ bicycle accessways may connect on one (1) end to pedestrian and bicycle destinations. Exceptions for cul-de-sacs and dead-end streets are provided in 16.12.060(B)(13).
c. Pedestrian accessways shall be provided as required under 16.12.030.
4. Filing a Future Street Plan: Upon approval by the review authority, a FSP shall be made a matter of record by being recorded by the Planning Director on a future street index to be maintained by the Planning Department.
5. Compliance with or Revision to Future Street Plans. New developments shall be consistent with adopted FSP. Where proposed new development is not consistent with an existing plan, the applicant shall seek revision through a separate application or in conjunction with a land division or site plan review application. A revision to an approved future street plan shall be reviewed by the Planning Director as an administrative procedure. All revisions to future street plans must comply with review criteria for FSP.
K. Fire Access and Parking Area Turn – Arounds. A fire equipment access drive shall be provided for any portion of an exterior wall of the first story of a building that is located more than 150 feet from an existing public street or approved fire equipment access drive. Parking areas shall provide adequate aisles or turn-around areas for service and delivery vehicles so that all vehicles may enter the street in a forward manner.
16.12.030
Pedestrian and bicycle access and circulation.
A. Pedestrian and Bicycle Access and Circulation. To ensure safe, direct, and convenient pedestrian and bicycle circulation, all developments, except single family detached housing (i.e., on individual lots), shall provide a continuous pedestrian and/or multi-use pathway system. (Pathways only provide for pedestrian circulation. Multi-use pathways accommodate pedestrians and bicycles.) The system of pathways shall be designed based on the standards below.
1. Continuous Pathways: A continuous pathway system, including sidewalks along streets, shall extend throughout the development site, and connect to all future phases of development, adjacent trails, public parks, and open space areas whenever possible. The developer may also be required to connect or stub

pathway(s) to adjacent streets and private property, in accordance with the provisions of Section 16.12.020 – Vehicular Access and Circulation, and Section 16.12.060 Public Facilities Standards.
2. Street Connectivity: Multi-use pathways (for pedestrians and bicycles) shall be provided at or near mid-block where the block length exceeds the length required by Section 16.12.020(I). Multi-use pathways shall also be provided to connect cul-de-sacs or dead-end streets with other public streets, and/or to other developments where feasible. Multi-use pathways used to comply with these standards shall conform to all of the following criteria:
a. Multi-use pathways (i.e., for pedestrians and bicyclists) are no less than ten (10) feet wide and located within a fifteen (15) foot-wide right-of-way. The pathway shall generally be located within the center of the right-of-way or easement unless otherwise constrained by topography;
b. Stairs or switchback paths using a narrower right-of-way or easement may be required in lieu of a multi-use pathway where grades are steep;
c. The City may require landscaping within the pathway right-of-way;
d. The hearings body or Planning Director may determine, based upon facts in the record that a pathway is impracticable due to
1. Physical or topographic conditions (e.g., freeways, railroads, extremely steep slopes, sensitive lands, and similar physical constraints);
2. Buildings or other existing development on adjacent properties that physically prevent a connection now or in the future, considering the potential for redevelopment; and
3. Sites where the provisions of recorded leases, easements, covenants, restrictions, or other agreements recorded as of the effective date of this Code prohibit the pathway connection.
B. Design and Construction. Pathways shall conform to all of the standards below as follows. Sidewalks that are part of required public roadway right-of-way shall conform to the standards in Section 16.12.060 Public Facilities Standards.
1. Vehicle/Pathway Separation: Where pathways are parallel and adjacent to a driveway or street (public or private), they shall be raised six (6) inches and curbed, or separated from the driveway/street by a five (5) foot minimum strip with bollards, a landscape berm, or other physical barrier. If a raised path is used, the ends of the raised portions must be equipped with curb ramps.
2. Housing/Pathway Separation: Pathways shall be separated a minimum of five (5) feet from all residential living areas on the ground-floor, except at building entrances. Separation is measured from the pathway edge to the closest dwelling unit. No pathway/building separation is required for commercial, industrial, public, or institutional uses.
3. Crosswalks: Where pathways cross a parking area, driveway, or street (“crosswalk”), they shall be clearly marked with contrasting paving materials, humps/raised crossings, or painted striping. An example of
Your Selections | Hood River, OR Page 458 of 753
The Hood River Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 2054, passed February 10, 2020.
contrasting paving material is the use of a concrete crosswalk through an asphalt driveway. If painted striping is used, it shall consist of thermo-plastic striping or similar type of durable application.
4. Pathway Surface: Pathway surfaces shall be concrete, asphalt, brick/masonry pavers, or other durable surface, at least six (6) feet wide, and shall conform to ADA requirements. Multi-use paths (i.e., for bicycles and pedestrians) shall be the same materials, at least eight (8) feet wide. (See also, Public Facilities Standards, Section 16.12.060 for public, multi-use pathway standard.)
5. Accessible Routes: Pathways and multi-use paths shall comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act, which requires accessible routes of travel.
6. Fencing adjacent to pathway rights-of-way shall not exceed four (4) feet in height in order to improve visibility and safety of path users.
16.12.040
Landscape conservation.
A. Applicability. All subdivision and partition developments containing significant trees and shrubs, as defined below, shall comply with the standards of this section. The purpose of this section is to incorporate significant native vegetation into the landscapes of development. The use of mature, native vegetation within developments is a preferred alternative to removal of vegetation and re-planting. Mature landscaping provides summer shade and wind breaks, and allows for water conservation due to larger plants having established root systems.
B. Significant Trees and Shrubs. Individual native trees and shrubs with a trunk diameter of six (6) inches or greater, as measured four (4) feet above the ground (DBH – “diameter, breast, height”), and all plants within the drip line of such trees and shrubs, shall be protected. Except that protection shall not be required for plants listed as non-native, invasive plants by the Oregon State University Extension Service in the applicable OSU bulletins for the County.
C. Mapping and Protection Required. Significant trees shall be mapped individually and identified by species and size (diameter at four (4) feet above grade, or DBH). A “protection” area shall be defined around the edge of all branches (drip-line) of each tree (drip lines may overlap between trees). The City also may require an inventory, survey, or assessment prepared by a qualified professional when necessary to determine vegetation boundaries, building setbacks, and other protection or mitigation requirements.
D. Protection Standards. All of the following protection standards shall apply to significant trees and shrubs areas:
1. Protection of Significant Trees and Shrubs: Significant trees and shrubs identified as meeting the criteria in Section B shall be retained whenever practicable. Preservation may become impracticable when it would prevent reasonable development of public streets, utilities, or land uses permitted by the applicable zone.
2. Conservation Easements and Dedications: When necessary to implement the Comprehensive Plan, the City may require dedication of land or recordation of a conservation easement to protect sensitive lands, including groves of significant trees.
Your Selections | Hood River, OR Page 459 of 753
The Hood River Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 2054, passed February 10, 2020.
E. Construction. All areas of significant vegetation shall be protected prior to, during, and after construction. Grading and operation of vehicles and heavy equipment is prohibited within significant vegetation areas, except as approved by the City for installation of utilities or streets.

B. Transportation Standards.
1. Development Standards: No development shall occur unless the development has frontage or approved access to a public street, in conformance with the Access and Circulation standards of this chapter. The development shall comply with the Engineering Standards and the following standards:
a. Streets within or adjacent to a development shall be improved in accordance with Transportation System Plan and the provisions of this chapter.
b. Development of new streets, and additional street width or improvements planned as a portion of an existing street, shall be improved in accordance with this section, and public streets shall be dedicated to the applicable city, county, or state jurisdiction;
c. New streets and drives street shall be hard-surfaced; and
d. The City may accept a future improvement guarantee (e.g., owner agrees not to remonstrate [object] against the formation of a local improvement district in the future) in lieu of street improvements if one (1) or more of the following conditions exist:
1. A partial improvement may create a potential safety hazard to motorists or pedestrians;
2. Due to the developed condition of adjacent properties it is unlikely that street improvements would be extended in the foreseeable future and the improvement associated with the project under review does not, by itself, provide increased street safety or capacity, or improved pedestrian circulation;
3. The improvement would be in conflict with an adopted capital improvement plan; or
4. The improvement is associated with an approved land partition on property zoned residential and the proposed land partition does not create any new streets.
2. Modifications: A modification to the street design standards in this section and the Transportation System Plan may be granted by the City Engineer under this provision if a required improvement is not feasible due to topographic constraints or constraints posed by sensitive lands (e.g., wetlands, significant trees and shrubs) or if necessary for safety or improved function of the transportation facility.

The Hood River Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 2054, passed February 10, 2020.
Legislative History: Ord. 1488 (1980); Ord. 1774 (1999); Ord. 1806 (2001); Ord. 1904 (2006); Ord. 1918 (2006); Ord. 1924 (2006); Ord. 1994 (2011)
17.07.010
Purpose.
The purposes of the planned development are.
1. To provide a means for creating planned environments that are equal or better than that resulting from traditional lot-by-lot land use development, through the application of flexible standards such as zero-lot lines, narrower streets, and other innovative planning practices;
2. To facilitate the efficient use of land;
3. To promote an economic arrangement of land use, buildings, circulation systems, open space, and utilities;
4. To preserve to the greatest extent possible the existing landscape features and amenities through the use of a planning procedure that can relate the type and design of a development to a particular site;
5. To encourage development that recognizes the relationship between buildings, their use, open space, and access ways, and thereby maximizes the opportunities for innovative and diversified living environments; and
6. To encourage commercial and industrial development that includes a mix of uses, is designed in a manner that mitigates impacts to surrounding uses, includes well designed buildings that contribute the character of Hood River, and includes a thoughtful site plan.

1. A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in a new use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the building and its site and environment.
2. The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of historic material or alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided.

Replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or pictorial evidence.
7. Chemical or physical treatments, such as sand blasting that cause damage to historic material shall not be used. The surface cleaning of structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means possible.

Introduction.
It is the policy of the City of Hood River to promote orderly, efficient, and fiscally responsible annexation of territories in conjunction with urban growth or expected or desired urban growth within the urban growth area. Accordingly, the City shall annex property where.
1. The proposed annexation represents the natural extension of the existing City boundary consistent with urban growth;
2. The proposed annexation would not, when developed or as developed, unreasonably limit the ability of the City to provide a level of services to City residents consistent with community needs and the financial capabilities of the City, as determined by the City;
3. The proposed annexation would not cause the City to pledge extension of services beyond its resources so as to result in a deficit operation of the service;
4. The proposed annexation would serve the interests of the entire community and not solely the interests or convenience of those within the territory proposed to be annexed.
17.15.020
Application and process.
An annexation may be proposed by the City of Hood River, landowners, or a group of residents and shall include the following elements.
Your Selections | Hood River, OR Page 610 of 753

17.15.050
Evaluation criteria – Developed land.
Prior to approving a proposed annexation of developed land, affirmative findings shall be made relative to the following criteria.
1. The territory is contiguous to the city limits and within the Urban Growth Area;
2. The annexation represents the natural extension of the existing City boundary to accommodate urban growth;
3. The development of the property is compatible and consistent with the rational and logical extension of utilities and roads to the surrounding area;
4. The City is capable of providing and maintaining its full range of urban services to the territory without negatively impacting the City’s ability to adequately serve all areas within the existing city limits;
5. The fiscal impact of the annexation is favorable, as determined by the City of Hood River because of existing development;
6. The proposed annexation does not negatively impact nearby properties, whether located within the city limits or the urban growth area; and
7. The annexation conforms to the Comprehensive Plan.

Evaluation criteria – Undeveloped land.
Prior to approving a proposed annexation of undeveloped land, affirmative findings shall be made relative to the following criteria.
1. The territory is contiguous to the city limits and within the Urban Growth Area;
2. The annexation represents the natural extension of the existing City boundary to accommodate urban growth;
3. The annexation of the territory is compatible and consistent with the rational and logical extension of utilities and roads to the surrounding area;
4. The City is capable of providing and maintaining its full range of urban services to the property without negatively impacting the City’s ability to adequately serve all areas within the existing city limits;
5. The fiscal impact of the annexation is favorable, as determined by the City of Hood River, either upon approval or because of a commitment to a proposed development, unless the City determines that a public need outweighs the increase;
6. The annexation meets the City’s urban growth needs, and it is to the City’s advantage to control the growth and development plans for the territory; i.e., to be able to address the issues of traffic, density, land use, and the level and timing of necessary facilities and services;
7. If the criteria in 17.15.060(6) does not apply, the annexation provides a solution for existing problems resulting from insufficient sanitation, water service, needed routes for utility or transportation networks, or other service-related problems;
8. The proposed annexation does not negatively impact nearby properties, whether located within the city limits or the urban growth area; and
9. The annexation conforms to the Comprehensive Plan.
17.15.070
Evaluation criteria – Fiscal impact.
The following factors are to be taken into consideration when determining fiscal impact for both developed and undeveloped land and may include, but are not be limited to:
1. The additional revenues, if any, available to the City as a result of the annexation;
2. Whether any unusual or excessive costs will be incurred as a result of the annexation; and
3. The impact on the City’s tax base, if any, as a result of the annexation.

The purpose of this section of the code is to implement Section 660-012-0045(2)(e) of the State Transportation Planning Rule that requires the city to adopt a process to apply conditions to development proposals in order to protect and minimize adverse impacts to transportation facilities. This section establishes the standards for when a proposal must be reviewed for potential traffic impacts; when a Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA) must be submitted with an application in order to determine whether conditions are needed to minimize impacts to and protect transportation facilities; what must be in a TIA; and who is qualified to prepare the analysis.
B. Typical Average Daily Trips and Peak Hour Trips. The latest edition of the Trip Generation manual, published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) shall be used as standards by which to gauge average daily and peak hour (weekday and/or weekend) vehicle trips, unless a specific trip generation study that is approved by the City Engineer indicates an alternative trip generation rate is appropriate. A trip generation study may be used to determine trip generation for a specific land use which is not well represented in the ITE Trip Generation Manual and for which a similar facility is available to count.
C. Applicability and Consultation. A Traffic Impact Analysis shall be required to be submitted to the city with a land use application when (1) a change in zoning or plan amendment is proposed or (2) a proposed development shall cause one or more of the following effects, which can be determined by field counts, site observation, traffic impact analysis, field measurements, crash history, Institute of Transportation Engineers Trip Generation; and information and studies provided by the local reviewing jurisdiction and/or ODOT:

The Hood River Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 2054, passed February 10, 2020.
a. The proposed action is estimated to generate 250 Average Daily Trips (ADT) or more, or 25 or more weekday AM or PM peak hour trips (or as required by the City Engineer);
b. An increase in use of adjacent streets by vehicles exceeding the 20,000 pound gross vehicle weights by 10 vehicles or more per day
c. The location of the access driveway does not meet minimum intersection sight distance requirements, or is located where vehicles entering or leaving the property are restricted, or such vehicles queue or hesitate, creating a safety hazard; or
d. The location of the access driveway does not meet the access spacing standard of the roadway on which the driveway is located; or
e. A change in internal traffic patterns that may cause safety problems, such as back up onto public streets or traffic crashes in the approach area.
The applicant shall consult with the City Engineer or his/her designee at the time of a pre-application conference (see Section 17.09.120 Pre-Application Conferences) about whether a TIA is required and, if required, the details of what must be included in the TIA.
D. Traffic Assessment Letter. If a TIA is not required as determined by Section 17.20.060.C, the applicant shall submit a Transportation Assessment Letter (TAL) to the City indicating that TIA requirements do not apply to the proposed action. This letter shall present the trip generation estimates and distribution assumptions for the proposed action and verify that driveways and roadways accessing the site meet the sight distance, spacing, and roadway design standards of the agency with jurisdiction of those roadways. Other information or analysis may be required as determined by the City Engineer. The TAL shall be prepared by an Oregon Registered Professional Engineer who is qualified to perform traffic engineering analysis.
The requirement for a TAL may be waived if the City Engineer determines that the proposed action will not have a significant impact on existing traffic conditions.
E. Traffic Impact Analysis Requirements.
1. Preparation. A Traffic Impact Analysis shall be prepared by an Oregon Registered Professional Engineer who is qualified to perform traffic engineering analysis and will be paid for by the applicant.
2. Transportation Planning Rule Compliance. See Chapter 17.08.050 Transportation Planning Rule Compliance.
3. Pre-application Conference. The applicant will meet with the City Engineer prior to submitting an application that requires a Traffic Impact Analysis. The City has the discretion to determine the required elements of the TIA and the level of analysis expected.
F. Study Area. The following facilities shall be included in the study area for all Traffic Impact Analyses (unless modified by the City Engineer):
1. All site-access points and intersections (signalized and unsignalized) adjacent to the proposed site. If the proposed site fronts an arterial or collector street, the analysis shall address all intersections and driveways

along the site frontage and within the access spacing distances extending out from the boundary of the site frontage.
2. Roads through and adjacent to the site.
3. All intersections that receive site-generated trips that comprise at least 10% or more of the total intersection volume.
4. All intersections needed for signal progression analysis.
5. In addition to these requirements, the City Engineer may determine any additional intersections or roadway links that may be adversely affected as a result of the proposed development.
6. Those identified in the IAMP Overlay Zone (see Subsection I).
G. When a Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA) is required, the TIA shall address the following minimum requirements:
1. The TIA was prepared by an Oregon Registered Professional Engineer; and
2. If the proposed development shall cause one or more of the effects in Section 17.20.060(C), above, or other traffic hazard or negative impact to a transportation facility, the TIA shall include mitigation measures that are attributable and are proportional to those impacts, meet the City’s adopted Level-of-Service standards, and are satisfactory to the City Engineer and ODOT, when applicable; and
3. The proposed site design and traffic and circulation design and facilities, for all transportation modes, including any mitigation measures, are designed to:

5. Construction or proportionate contribution toward roadway improvements necessary to address site generated traffic impacts, i.e. construction or modification of turns lanes or traffic signals.
I. Traffic Analysis within an IAMP Overlay Zone. All development applications located within an IAMP Overlay Zone that are subject to the provisions of Chapter 17.16 (Site Plan Review) or Chapter 16.08 (Land Divisions) may be required to prepare a Traffic Impact Analysis. City of Hood River Transportation System Plan policies call for the City, in coordination with Hood River County and ODOT, to monitor and evaluate vehicle trip generation impacts at Hood River interchanges and on street systems in interchange areas from development. This requirement will not preclude Oregon Department of Transportation, City of Hood River, or Hood River County from requiring analysis of IAMP study intersections under other conditions. Development approved under this article shall be subject to the following additional requirements.
1. The Traffic Impact Analysis must include an account of weekday p.m. peak hour site generated trips through IAMP study intersections. Intersections impacted by 25 or more weekday p.m. peak hour site generated trips, or weekend peak hour site generated trips, shall be analyzed for level of service and volume to capacity ratio during day of opening conditions.
2. The City shall provide written notification to ODOT and Hood River County when an application concerning property in the IAMP Overlay Zone and subject to Site Plan Review or Title 16 is received. This notice shall include an invitation to ODOT and the County to participate in the City’s pre-application conference with the applicant, pursuant to Section 17.09.120.
3. The City shall not deem the land use application complete unless it includes a Traffic Impact Analysis prepared in accordance with the applicable requirements of Section 17.20.060.
4. Pursuant to Section 17.09.030(F), ODOT shall have 14 calendar days from the date a completion notice is mailed to provide written comments to the City.

The Hood River Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 2054, passed February 10, 2020.
The intent of this section is to meet these goals by modifying the location, but not the intensity of development, where possible. The requirements for wetlands restricts filling, grading, excavation and vegetation removal in significant wetlands for their protection and limits new structures in significant wetlands in Hood River. This section provides procedures for correcting map errors and for granting a variance for parcels that have no buildable site through application of this section.
B. Definitions. The following words and phrases, unless the context otherwise requires, shall have the meanings given them in this section.
FUNCTIONS AND VALUES. Functions means the environmental roles served by wetlands and buffer areas including, but not limited to, water quality protection and enhancement, fish and wildlife habitat and flood storage. Values means the qualities ascribed to a wetland such as educational and recreational opportunities, open space, and visual aesthetic qualities.
RESTORATION means to rehabilitate a previously drained or degraded wetland area by providing wetland hydrology, removing fill material, restoring native vegetation or other means of reestablishing wetland features.
WETLAND means an area that is inundated or saturated by surface water or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances does support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions.
WETLAND DELINEATION means a determination of wetland presence by a qualified professional that includes marking the wetland boundaries on the ground and/or on a detailed map prepared by professional land survey or similar accurate methods.
C. Requirements for All Wetlands.
1. Compliance with State and Federal Regulations. All activities wholly or partially within wetlands are subject to Division of State Lands permit requirements under the Removal-Fill Law and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers permit requirements under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. Where there is a difference between local, state or federal regulations, the more restrictive regulations shall apply.
2. Division of State Lands Notification Required.
a. The City shall provide notice to the Division of State Lands, the applicant and the owner of record, within five (5) working days of the acceptance of any complete application for the following activities that are wholly or partially within areas identified as wetlands on the Local Wetlands Inventory or within twenty-five (25) feet of such areas:
1. Subdivisions;
2. Building permits for new structures;
3. Other development permits and approvals that allow physical alteration of the land involving excavation and grading, including permits for removal or fill, or both, or development in floodplains and floodways;
Your Selections | Hood River, OR Page 642 of 753
The Hood River Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 2054, passed February 10, 2020.
4. Conditional use permits and variances that involve physical alterations to the land or construction of new structures; and
5. Planned unit development approvals.
b. This section does not apply if a permit from the Division of State Lands has been issued for the proposed activity.
c. City approval of any activity described in this section shall include one of the following notice statements:

2. Notice from the Division of State Lands that no permit is required; or
3. Notice from the Division of State Lands that no permit is required until specific proposals to remove, fill or alter the wetlands are submitted.
d. If the division of State Lands fails to respond to any notice provided under this section within thirty (30) days of notice, the City approval may be issued with written notice to the applicant and the owner of record that the proposed action may require state or federal permits
e. The City may issue local approval for parcels identified as or including wetlands on the Local Wetlands Inventory upon providing to the applicant and the owner of record of the affected parcel a written notice of the possible presence of wetlands and the potential need for state and federal permits and providing the Division of State Lands with a copy of the notification of comprehensive plan map or zoning map amendments for specific properties.
D. Procedures for Identifying Significant Wetlands. The regulations of this section apply to wetlands identified and mapped as significant in the Hood River Local Wetlands Inventory located in the City and the Urban Growth Area. Significance determinations are based on criteria contained in Oregon Administrative Rules 141-86-0300 through 0350 as adopted by the Division of State Lands (DSL). This section applies to wetlands inside the Hood River city limits and to wetlands outside the city limits and inside the urban growth boundary upon annexation of such land.
Wetlands identified in the Hood River Local Wetlands Inventory are shown on maps that may not have site-specific accuracy.
1. The Division of State Lands is the final arbiter of wetland presence and boundaries.
2. Precise wetland boundaries may vary from those shown on the Hood River Local Wetland Inventory map. For any proposed development impacting a significant wetland or within twenty-five (25) feet of a significant wetland, the applicant shall conduct a wetland delineation and submit it to the Division of State Lands for review and approval. The more precise boundary obtained through a DSL-approved wetland delineation shall be used for review and development, and can be identified, mapped, and used for review and development without a change in the Hood River Local Wetland Inventory mapping.

17.22.020
Requirements for riparian corridors.
A. Purpose and Intent. The purpose of this section is to protect and restore water bodies and their associated riparian areas, in order to protect and restore the multiple social and environmental functions and benefits these areas provide individual property owners, communities, and the watershed. The requirements for riparian corridors is based on the “safe harbor” approach as defined in Oregon Administrative Rules 660-23-0090(5) and (8). Specifically, this section is intended to;
1. Protect habitat for fish and other aquatic life,
2. Protect habitat for wildlife,
3. Protect water quality for human uses and aquatic life,
4. Protect associated wetlands,
Your Selections | Hood River, OR Page 645 of 753
The Hood River Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 2054, passed February 10, 2020.
5. Control erosion and limit sedimentation,
6. Promote recharge of shallow aquifers,
7. Provide a stream “right of way” to accommodate lateral migration of the channel and protect the stream and adjacent properties,
8. Reduce the effects of flooding,
9. Protect open space;
10. Reserve space for storm water management facilities, other utilities, and linear parks, and
11. Minimize the economic impact to affected property owners.
The intent is to meet these goals by modifying the location, but not the intensity of development, where possible. The requirements excludes new structures from buffer areas established around rivers, streams and other water bodies in Hood River and also prohibits vegetation removal or other alteration in these buffers and establishes a preference for native vegetation in the buffers. For cases where buffer establishment creates a hardship for individual property owners, this section provides a procedure to apply for a variance. In limited circumstances, changes to the buffer width shall be allowed provided the changes are offset by appropriate restoration or mitigation, as stipulated in this section.
The Columbia River Infill Area that is addressed under the ESEE analysis and is shown on the Columbia River Infill Waterfront map is exempt from the Riparian Corridors section of this chapter.
B. Definitions. The following words and phrases, unless the context otherwise requires, shall have the meanings given them in this section:
BANKFULL STAGE means the elevation at which water overflows the natural banks of streams or other waters and begins to inundate upland areas. Physical characteristics that indicate the elevation include a clear, natural line impressed on the shore, a change from upland vegetation (e.g. oak, Douglas fir) to bare soil or substrate, a change in vegetation from upland (e.g. oak, fir) to aquatic (e.g. willows, rushes), a textural change of depositional sediment or changes in the character of the soil (e.g. from upland soils to sand, sand and cobble, cobble and gravel), absence of fine debris (needles, leaves, cones, seeds), the presence of water-borne litter or debris, water-stained leaves, or water lines on tree trunks. In the absence of physical evidence, the two-year recurrence interval flood elevation may be used to approximate the bankfull stage.
FISH HABITAT OR FISH BEARING means those areas upon which fish depend in order to meet their requirements for spawning, rearing, food supply, and migration.
IMPERVIOUS SURFACE means any material which reduces and prevents absorption of storm water into previously undeveloped land.
INTERMITTENT STREAM means any stream that flows during a portion of every year and which provides spawning, rearing or food-producing areas for food and game fish (OAR 141-085-0010)

The Hood River Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 2054, passed February 10, 2020.
LAWN means grass or similar materials maintained as a ground cover of less than 6 inches in height. For purposes of this ordinance, lawn is not considered native vegetation regardless of the species used.
MAINTENANCE means periodic repair or upkeep of a structure in order to maintain its original function. Maintenance does not include any modification that changes the character or scope, or increases the adverse impact to the riparian corridor. Maintenance does not include reconstruction.
MITIGATION means taking one (1) or more of the following actions listed in order of priority:
1. Avoiding the impact altogether by not taking a certain development action or parts of that action;
2. Minimizing impacts by limiting the degree or magnitude of the development action and its implementation;
3. Rectifying the impact by repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring the affected environment;
4. Reducing or eliminating the impact over time by preservation and maintenance operations during the life of the development action by monitoring and taking appropriate corrective measures;
5. Compensating for the impact by replacing or providing comparable substitute resources or environments.
NATIVE VEGETATION means plant species indigenous to Hood River. A list of native plant species is in the Appendix.
NET LOSS means a permanent loss of riparian corridor area or function resulting from a development action despite mitigation measures having been taken.
NON-CONFORMING means a structure or use that does not conform to the standards of this ordinance but has been in continuous existence from prior to the date of adoption of this ordinance up to the present. Non-conforming uses are not considered violations and are generally allowed to continue, though expansion, re-construction, or substantial improvement may be regulated
RIPARIAN AREA means the area adjacent to a river, stream, lake, or pond consisting of the area of transition from an aquatic ecosystem to a terrestrial ecosystem.
RIPARIAN CORRIDOR means the water areas, fish habitat, adjacent riparian areas, and wetlands within the riparian corridor boundary.
STREAM means a channel that carries flowing surface water and was created naturally by geological and hydrological processes, including channels that would be natural but for human-caused disturbances (e.g., channelized, rerouted or culverted streams, or impounded waters), including perennial streams and intermittent streams with defined channels, and excluding irrigation and drainage channels that are human-created.
STREAM OR POND EDGE means bankfull stage elevation.

The Hood River Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 2054, passed February 10, 2020.
STRUCTURE: A building or other major improvement that is built, constructed, or installed, not including minor improvements, such as fences, utility poles, flagpoles, or irrigation system components, which are not customarily regulated through zoning ordinances.
TOP OF BANK means the break in slope between the bank and the surrounding terrain (Division of State Lands Water definitions). Where top of bank is not clear defer to bankfull stage.
WATER AREA means the area between the banks of a lake, pond, river, or perennial or fish-bearing intermittent stream, excluding man-made farm ponds.
WETLAND means an area that is inundated or saturated by surface water or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances does support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions.
C. Procedures for Identifying Significant Riparian Corridors. The inventory of riparian corridors contained in the Comprehensive Plan includes maps of riparian corridors and specifies which water areas are fish-bearing. Inventory information on fish presence and use of waters may become outdated over time or new information may become available. In all cases the most current available information on fish presence and use from the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife shall be used to identify riparian corridors subject to the requirements of this section. Based on the classification contained in this inventory, the following significant riparian corridors shall be established:
1. Along all fish-bearing rivers, streams and other waters with an average annual stream flow greater than 1,000 cubic feet per second (cfs) the riparian corridor boundary shall be seventy-five (75) feet from the top of bank; i.e. Columbia River and Hood River.
2. Along all lakes, and fish-bearing streams with average annual stream flow less than 1,000 cfs, the riparian corridor boundary shall be 50 feet from the top of bank; i.e. Indian Creek and Phelps Creek.
3. Wells Island in its entirety.
4. At any location specified in a conditional use permit as mitigation for permitted development in a significant riparian corridor.
5. For the safe harbor area only the measurement of distance to the riparian corridor boundary along the Columbia River shall be from the full pool elevation of seventy-seven (77) feet. For all other waters the measurement of distance to the riparian corridor boundary shall be from the stream or pond edge, except that Wells Island is included in its entirety within the riparian corridor boundary. The measurement in all cases shall be a horizontal distance.
6. Significant riparian corridors identified in the Comprehensive Plan are shown on maps that may not have site-specific accuracy. Property owners who believe the maps are in error or that their properties lie outside the depicted significant riparian corridor can request a site review by City planning staff. City staff can correct the map or request that the property owner submit a survey, performed by a qualified surveyor (Public Land Surveyor), showing the correct significant riparian corridor boundaries. The survey must show the stream or pond edge and the applicable significant riparian corridor boundaries on a scaled parcel base map.

D. Land Use Requirements.
1. The permanent alteration of significant riparian corridors by grading or by the placement of structures or impervious surfaces is prohibited, except for the following uses provided they are designed to avoid and minimize intrusion into the riparian corridor, no other options or locations are feasible, and any applicable state and/or federal permits are obtained:
a. Streets, roads and bridges, excluding parking or storage areas.
b. Construction of permeable trails, boardwalks and viewing platforms, information kiosks and trail signs.
c. Drainage facilities, utilities, and irrigation pumps.
d. Stormwater treatment facilities when they are located in severely degraded parts of significant riparian corridors and designed so as to enhance overall function of the riparian resource (for example a grassy swale or constructed wetland with a buffer of native vegetation and that is located within previously farmed or cleared area).
e. Water-related and water-dependent uses (for example boat launch, fishing dock).
f. Replacement of existing structures with structures in the same location that do no disturb additional riparian corridor surface area.
g. Structures or other non-conforming alterations existing fully or partially within significant riparian corridors may be expanded provided the expansion does not occur within the significant riparian corridor.
h. Existing garden, lawn and non-native plantings within significant riparian corridors may be maintained, but not expanded within the significant riparian corridor. Development activities on the property shall not justify replacement of the riparian area with lawn.
i. Existing shoreline stabilization and flood control structures may be maintained. Any expansion of existing structures or development of new structures shall be evaluated by the local government and appropriate natural resource agency staff, for example Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, Division of State Lands, Department of Environmental Quality, Water Resources Department. Such alteration of the significant riparian corridor shall be approved only if less-invasive or nonstructural methods will not adequately meet the stabilization or flood control needs.
2. Removal of riparian vegetation in significant riparian corridors is prohibited, except for:
a. Removal of non-native vegetation and subsequent replacement with native plant species. The City of Hood River shall maintain a list of native and non-native plant species. The replacement vegetation shall cover, at a minimum, the area from which vegetation was removed, and shall maintain or exceed the density of the removed vegetation.

The Hood River Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 2054, passed February 10, 2020.
b. Removal of vegetation necessary for the development of approved water-related or water dependent uses. Vegetation removal shall be kept to the minimum necessary to allow the water-dependent or water-related use.
c. Removal of poisonous or noxious vegetation.
d. Trees in danger of falling and thereby posing a hazard to life or property may be removed. If no hazard will be created, property owners are encourage to leave trees, once felled, in place in the riparian corridor.
e. Incidental removal of vegetation associated with recreational, educational, scientific research and land survey activities.
3. Exceptions: The following activities are not required to meet the standards of this section if applicable:
a. Normal and accepted farming and ranching practices other than buildings or structures, occurring on land zoned for exclusive farm use and existing in the protected riparian corridor since prior to the date of adoption of this ordinance.
b. Commercial forest practices regulated by the Oregon Forest Practices Act.
E. Variances. In cases where a property owner believes the application of this section imposes a hardship or renders an existing lot or parcel unbuildable, a property owner may request a variance. Granting of a variance requires findings that satisfy all three (3) of the following criteria:
1. The proposed development requires deviation from the Riparian Corridor requirements; and
2. Strict adherence to the requirements of this section and other applicable standards would effectively preclude a use of the parcel that could be reasonably expected to occur in the zone, and
3. The property owner would be precluded a substantial property right enjoyed by the majority of landowners in the vicinity.
F. Compliance with State and Federal Requirements. All activities wholly or partially within riparian corridors are subject to applicable Division of State Lands permit requirements under the Removal-Fill Law and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers permit requirements under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. Where there is a difference between local, state or federal regulations, the more restrictive regulations shall apply.
