§ 75-1. Title; purpose; findings.
A. Title. This chapter shall be known as the "White Township Adult
Business Ordinance."
B. Purpose. Pursuant to the authority granted in the Second Class
Township Code to promote and secure the health, cleanliness, comfort
and safety of the citizens of White Township, to regulate and inspect the
use and occupancy of public buildings, to regulate places of public
entertainment, amusement and recreation and to prevent and prohibit
public nuisances due to adverse secondary effects, White Township
(hereafter "Township") enacts this chapter to minimize and control the
adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses and thereby
protect the health, safety and welfare of its citizens, protect the citizens
property values and character of surrounding neighborhoods and deter
the spread of blight.
(1) The Board of Supervisors has determined that licensing is a
legitimate and reasonable means of accountability to ensure that
operators of sexually oriented businesses comply with reasonable
regulations and to ensure that operators do not knowingly allow
their establishments to be used as places of illegal sexual activity or
solicitation.
(2) The Board of Supervisors does not intend this chapter to suppress
any speech activities protected by the First Amendment, but to
enact a content neutral ordinance that addresses the secondary
effects of sexually oriented businesses. It is not the intent of the
Board of Supervisors in enacting this chapter to deny any person
rights of speech protected by the Constitution of the United States
or the Constitution of Pennsylvania, or both, nor is it the intent of
the Board of Supervisors to impose by this chapter any additional
limitations or restrictions on the contents of any communicative
materials, including sexually oriented films, videotapes, books and
other materials. Further, by enacting this chapter, the Board of
Supervisors does not intend to deny or restrict the rights of any
adult to obtain or view, or both, any sexually oriented materials or
conduct protected by the Constitution of the United States or the
§ 63-1 WHITE CODE § 75-1
1:20
Constitution of Pennsylvania, or both, nor does it intend to restrict
or deny any constitutionally protected rights that distributors or
exhibitors of sexually oriented materials may have to sell,
distribute or exhibit these materials.
C. Legislative findings. The Board of Supervisors finds:
(1) Law enforcement personnel have determined and statistics and
studies performed in a substantial number of communities in this
commonwealth and in the United States indicate that sexually
oriented businesses have adverse secondary effects, including
those specified and recognized at 68 Pa.C.S.A. § 5501(a), which
secondary effects should be regulated to protect the public health,
safety and welfare. These secondary effects include, but are not
limited to, the spread of communicable diseases, performance of
sexual acts in public places, presence of discarded sexually
oriented materials on public and private property, sexual
harassment, obscenity, prostitution and other illegal sexual
activities, crime, decreased property values and neighborhood
deterioration.
(2) Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of
adult uses on the community presented in depositions and hearings
conducted by the United States District Court for the Middle
District of Pennsylvania, Case No. 3CV99-1801 (Judge Munley), and
by the United States District Court for the Western District of
Pennsylvania, Case No. 98-1140 (Judge Lancaster) and in reports
made available to the Township and on findings incorporated in the
cases of City of Renton v. Playtime Theaters, Inc., 475 U.S. 41
(1986), Young v. American Mini Theaters, 426 U.S. 50 (1976) and
Barnes V. Glen Theater, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991) and on studies in
other communities, including, but not limited to, Phoenix, Arizona;
Minneapolis, Minnesota; Houston, Texas; Indianapolis, Indiana;
Amarillo, Texas; Biloxi, Mississippi; Seattle, Washington; Oklahoma
City, Oklahoma; Cleveland, Ohio and Beaumont, Texas and also on
findings from the report of the Attorney General's Working Group
on the Regulation of Sexually Oriented Businesses (June 6, 1989,
State of Minnesota), the Township finds:
(a) Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary
unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently
uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments. Further,
there is presently no mechanism to make the owners of these
establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their
premises.
(b) Certain employees of sexually oriented businesses defined in
this chapter as adult theaters and cabarets engage in higher
incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than
employees of other establishments.
§ 75-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 75-1
1:21
(c) Sexual acts, including masturbation and oral and anal sex,
occur at sexually oriented businesses, especially those that
provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing
films, videos or live sex shows. Furthermore, adult bookstores
tend to attract homosexual men who engage in unprotected,
high-risk sexual activities.
(d) Offering and providing such space encourages such activities,
which creates unhealthy conditions.
(e) Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades and
other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging
in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented
businesses.
(f) At least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities
occurring in sexually oriented businesses, including, but not
limited to, syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus
infection (HV-AIDS), genital herpes, hepatitis B, Non A, Non B
amebiasis, salmonella infections and shigella infections.
(g) The Surgeon General of the United States in his report of
October 22, 1986, has advised the American public that AIDS
and HIV infections may be transmitted through sexual contact,
intravenous drug abuse, exposure to infected blood and blood
components and from an infected mother to her newborn.
(h) According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV
infection, as well as syphilis and gonorrhea are principally
transmitted by sexual acts.
(i) Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are
unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are
unhealthy and, in part, because of the unregulated nature of
the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of
the facilities to self-regulate those activities and maintain those
facilities.
(j) Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is
found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where
persons view "adult" oriented films.
(k) Numerous studies have indicated that sexually oriented
businesses have a substantial negative impact on property
values and cause neighborhood blight.
(l) The findings noted in Subsection C(2)(a) through (k) raise
substantial governmental concerns.
(3) Sexually oriented businesses have adverse secondary effects in the
nature of a public nuisance, which secondary effects should be
regulated to protect the public health, safety and welfare.
§ 75-1 WHITE CODE § 75-1
1:22
(4) Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics that
should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those
substantial governmental concerns.
(5) A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to
place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and
the operators of the sexually oriented business. Further, such a
licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive
on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in
a manner consistent with the health, safety and welfare of its
patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the Township. It is
appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is
the actual operator of the sexually oriented business, fully in
possession and control of the premises and activities occurring
therein.
(6) Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting
on premises with adult booths advances a substantial
governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual
activity occurring in adult theaters and bookstores.
(7) Requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep
information regarding current employees and certain past
employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of
criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential
witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in
such establishments.
(8) The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately
responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the
sexually oriented business, where such information is substantially
related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of
such uses, will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted
diseases.
(9) It is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable
diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding
certain employees who may engage in the conduct that this chapter
is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such
activity.
(10) The fact that an applicant for an adult or sexually oriented use
license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the
rational assumption that the applicant is likely to engage in that
conduct in contravention of this chapter.
(11) The barring of such individuals from the management of sexually
oriented uses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and
prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually
transmitted diseases.

Street Light and Fire Hydrant Assessments
[Adopted 4-23-2003 by Res. No. R-4-03]
§ 94-1. Street light assessment policy.
§ 94-2. Fire hydrant assessment policy.
A. It should be understood that the purpose of a street light is to illuminate
the roadway and not an individual's property.
B. All property owners whose front and/or side property boundary lines, or
portions thereof, are located within 250 feet radius of a public street
light are considered to benefit from the street light, and such property
owners shall be assessed by the Township for the cost of providing
street light service.
C. The Township shall assess benefiting property owners on a foot-front
basis. The assessment shall be by equal assessment on all properties
within the subject lighting district in proportion to the number of feet
the property fronts on the street, or portion thereof, being lighted.
D. The assessment for each foot front against vacant lots shall be only 25%
of the assessment for each foot-front against property with
improvements.
E. Where a property is located at an intersection of two streets, a full footfront
assessment as well as 25% of the side yard will be assessed,
provided the side yard fronting the street is within the two-hundredfifty-
foot distance.
F. Regarding irregularly shaped lots, only the portion of the lot that is
within the two-hundred-fifty-foot distance will be assessed.
G. Where, for taxing purposes, property owners have had two or more
adjoining properties in common ownership "tied" together in order to
facilitate real estate tax billing procedures, the Township shall consider
the properties individual and separate until such time that the
properties are legally joined through the land subdivision procedure.
A. All property owners having buildings located within 780 feet, radius, of
a public fire hydrant are considered to benefit from the fire hydrant and
shall be assessed by the Township for the cost of providing fire hydrant
service.
B. The Township shall assess benefiting property owners on a flat-rate,
per-lot basis. The assessment shall be by equal assessment on all
properties containing buildings within the subject hydrant district.
Where multiple buildings are located on one property (for example, two
or more multifamily or commercial buildings on one property), the
Township, at their sole discretion, may assign an equal assessment to
each individual building on the property.
§ 94-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 94-2
1:53
C. There shall be no assessment against vacant lots. Where, for taxing
purposes, property owners have had two or more adjoining properties
in common ownership "tied" together in order to facilitate real estate
tax billing procedures, the Township shall consider the properties
individual and separate until such time that the properties are legally
joined through the land subdivision procedure.
D. Property owner(s) may elect to install hydrants for their benefit without
seeking a petition from neighboring property owners provided they
agree to pay the full cost of the hydrant(s) being requested and
provided the hydrant is situated within a public road right-of-way. In
this case, neighboring property owners will not be assessed for the
benefit of the hydrant, although the installed hydrant will be available
for their emergency use if needed. The location of the hydrant within
the public road right-of-way shall be at the sole discretion of the
Township, the Fire Chief, and the water utility.
E. An assessment on a property may be removed where a property owner
has obtained a building permit to remove all buildings on the property
and has, in fact, completed the removal of the buildings.

or level of cable services or other services provided over the
system.
(6) Future needs. Consideration may be given to the franchisee's
ability to meet the future cable-related community needs and
interests, taking into account the cost of meeting such needs and
interests.
(7) Additional considerations. The Township may consider any
additional information that it deems applicable.
C. Initial application fee. A reasonable nonrefundable application fee
established by the Township in its request for proposals shall
accompany the application for a franchise within the Township. Such
application fee shall not be deemed to be "franchise fees" within the
meaning of § 622 of the Cable Act (47 U.S.C. § 542), and such payments
shall not be deemed to be "payments in kind" or any involuntary
payments chargeable against the compensation to be paid by the
franchisee to the Township. The application fee shall be limited to an
amount necessary to reimburse the Township for incidental costs
incurred in connection with processing and publicizing the franchise
requests, but in no event shall such fee be less than $500.
A. During the term of any franchise granted pursuant to this chapter, the
franchisee shall pay to the Township for the use of its streets, public
places and other facilities, not including poles or underground conduits,
as well as the maintenance, improvements and supervision for
administrative costs thereof, an annual franchise fee in an amount
equal to 5% of its annual gross revenues, as defined herein. This
payment shall be in addition to any other tax or payment owed to the
Township by the franchisee and does not include rental of poles or
underground conduits.
B. Sales tax or other taxes levied directly on a per subscription basis and
collected by franchisee shall be deducted from the gross revenues
before computation of sums due the Township is made. Payments due
the Township under the terms of this chapter shall be computed
semiannually as of December 31 and June 30 for the preceding sixmonth
period and shall be paid on or before the 60th calendar day from
each said computation date at the office of the Township Manger. The
Township shall be furnished a statement with each payment, certified
as correct by the franchisee, reflecting the total amount of gross
revenues and the above charges, deductions and computations for the
six-month payment period covered by the payment. With the payment
each year for the semiannual period ending on December 31, a
statement prepared by the appropriate company representative shall
§ 111-4 WHITE CODE § 111-5
1:66
§ 111-6. Term and termination of franchise.
be submitted certifying that the statements filed and payments made by
the franchisee for the preceding year were correct. Upon reasonable,
but in no event less than 15 days, prior written notice, the Township
shall have the right to conduct an independent audit of franchisee's
records, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
and if such audit indicates a franchise fee underpayment of 5% or more,
the franchisee shall assume all reasonable costs of such an audit. Any
additional amount due to the Township as a result of such audit shall
be paid within 30 days following written notice by the Township to the
franchisee, which notice shall include a copy of the audit report.
C. No acceptance of any payment shall be construed as a release or as an
accord and satisfaction of any claim the Township may have for further
or additional sums payable as a franchise fee under this chapter or for
the performance of any other obligation hereunder.
D. Failure to pay any undisputed fee required by this section, within 10
days of receipt of written notice of such failure from the Township, shall
be grounds for termination of the franchise as set out in § 111-6 below.
A. No franchise granted hereunder, nor any renewal thereof, shall be for a
term of more than 15 years.
B. In addition to all other rights and powers of the Township by virtue of
the franchise or by this chapter, the Township may terminate and cancel
the franchise and all rights and privileges of the franchise thereunder in
the event that the franchisee either:
(1) Substantially violates any material provision of the franchise
agreement or this chapter.
(2) Attempts to dispose of any of the facilities or property of its cable
system to prevent the Township from purchasing same, as provided
for herein.
(3) Attempts to evade any of the material provisions of this chapter or
the franchise agreement or practices any fraud or deceit upon the
Township.
C. In such event, the Township may initiate procedures to terminate and
cancel the franchise held by the franchisee. Such procedures shall be as
set out in § 111-47.
D. Any such termination and cancellation shall be made by resolution of
the Township Board of Supervisors duly adopted after not less than 30
days' notice to the franchisee and shall in no way affect any of the
Township's rights under this franchisee or any provisions of law;
provided, however, that before the franchise may be terminated and
canceled under this section, the franchisee shall be provided with an
opportunity to be heard at a public hearing before the Township Board
§ 111-5 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 111-6
1:67
of Supervisors, upon 20 days' written notice to the franchisee of the
time and place of the public hearing. Said notice shall affirmatively
cite the reasons alleged to constitute cause for revocation and shall be
published in a local newspaper of general circulation at least 15 days
before the date of the hearing.

and provisions of the franchise as negotiated between the Township and

and the Township to be technically reliable, economically feasible and
adaptable to the system at a cost to the subscriber that is acceptable
in areas of similar size and demographic. In the event the Township
determines, in its sole discretion and based upon reasonable information,
that the franchisee is not in compliance with this section, the Township may,
at any time during the franchise, invoke the procedure in § 111-28G of this
chapter.
§ 111-10. Number of channels.
A franchisee must provide access channels. If there is more than one

this section.

adjacent cable systems in the Township, surrounding townships or county,
as set out in the franchise agreement. Interconnection of cable systems
may be done by direct cable connection, microwave link, satellite or other
appropriate method. Upon reaching a mutual agreement to interconnect,
franchisee shall immediately initiate negotiations with the other affected
cable system or systems in order that all costs may be shared equally among

franchise has taken place and the provisions of this section governing
the consent of the Township to such change in control or ownership
shall apply.
D. For the purpose of determining whether it shall consent to such a sale,
assignment or transfer, the Township may inquire into the qualifications
of the prospective transferee or controlling party and the franchisee
shall assist the Township in any such inquiry. In seeking the Township's
consent to any change in ownership or control, the franchisee shall
have the responsibility of ensuring that the transferee completes an
application in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Township, which application shall include the information required
under state and federal law. The transferee shall be required to
establish that it possesses the legal, technical and financial
qualifications to operate and maintain the system and comply with all

Township in its discretion and during said period of time it shall have
the right to petition the Township to transfer the franchise to another
franchise.

denied and the Township acquires ownership of the cable system such
acquisition shall be to the extent permitted by local, federal and state
law, upon payment to the franchisee of the cable system's fair market
value as a going-concern, exclusive of any value allocated to the
franchise itself.

to be compensated for funds expended as a result of the franchise renewal
process, as allowed by local, state and federal laws. The preceding
statement does not constitute any agreement by an applicant to reimburse
the Township for such costs. Franchisee reserves any rights it may have
under local, state and federal laws. Neither adoption of this franchise by the
Township nor acceptance by the franchisee shall be construed as a waiver,
modification, termination or discharge of any right that either the Township
or franchisee may now or hereafter have.

coaxial cables in addition to the cables, conduits and pipes of the
utility systems, such as electrical, power, telephone, gas and
sewerage.
(2) The impact on the community of having multiple franchises.
(3) The disadvantages that may result from cable system competition,
such as the requirement for multiple pedestals on residents
property and a disruption arising from numerous excavations of the
rights-of-way.
(4) The legal, technical and financial capabilities of the applicant and
its guaranteed commitment to make the necessary investment to
erect, maintain and operate the proposed system for the duration
of the franchise term.
B. Each franchisee awarded a franchise to serve the entire Township shall
offer service to all residences in the Township, in accordance with the
line extension requirements set forth in Article 3, § 1, of the franchise

evidenced by a statement in writing signed by a duly authorized
representative of the Township. Waiver of any provision in one instance
shall not be deemed a waiver of such provision subsequent to such
instance nor be deemed a waiver of any other provision of the franchise
unless that statement so recites. In the event the Township has granted
multiple franchises and waives any provision of this chapter with
regard to one franchisee, the other franchisees can seek waiver of the
same provision and such waiver will be granted.

agreement by any applicant to reimburse the Township for such costs.
Franchisee reserves any rights it may have under local, state and federal

§ 111-47. Procedure for remedying franchise violation.
If franchisee fails to perform in a timely manner any material obligation
required by this chapter or a franchise granted hereunder, following notice
from the Township and an opportunity to cure such nonperformance,
Township may act to remedy such violation in accordance with the following
procedures:
A. The Township, by action of the Board of Supervisors, shall first notify
franchisee of the violation, in writing, by personal delivery or registered
or certified mail and demand correction within a reasonable time,
which shall not be less than 15 days in the case of the failure of the
franchisee to pay any sum or other amount due the Township under this
chapter or a franchise agreement hereunder and 30 days in all other
cases. If franchisee falls to correct the violation within the time
prescribed or if franchisee fails to commence corrective action within
the time prescribed and diligently remedy such violation thereafter, the
franchisee shall then be given a written notice of not less than 20 days
of a public hearing to be held before the Board of Supervisors. Said
notice shall specify the violations alleged to have occurred.
B. At the public hearing, the Board of Supervisors shall hear and consider
all relevant evidence and thereafter render findings and its decision.
C. In the event the Board of Supervisors finds that franchisee has
corrected the violation or has diligently commenced correction of such
violation after notice thereof from the Township and is diligently
proceeding to fully remedy such violation, or that no material violation
has occurred, the proceedings shall terminate and no penalty or other
sanction shall be imposed. In determining whether a violation is
material, the Township shall take into consideration the reliability of the
evidence of the violation, the nature of the violation and the damage, if
any, caused to the Township or the Township's residents thereby,
whether the violation was chronic and any justifying or mitigating
circumstances and such other matters as the Township may deem
appropriate.
D. In the event the Board of Supervisors finds that a material violation
exists and that franchisee has not corrected the same in a satisfactory
manner or has not diligently commenced correction of such violation,
the Board of Supervisors may terminate and cancel the franchise held
by the franchisee as provided in § 111-6 hereof, or impose liquidated
damages, payable from the performance bond, of up to $150 per day,
§ 111-46 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 111-47
1:97
§ 111-48. Force majeure, franchisee's inability to perform.
§ 111-49. Nonenforcement not estoppel.
The franchisee shall not be relieved of its obligation to comply with any of
the provisions of the franchise by any failure of the Township to enforce
prompt compliance.
§ 111-50. No recourse against Township.
Franchisee's recourse against the Township shall be limited as provided in
§ 635A of the Cable Act.
for failure to meet its upgrade or construction schedule as set out in the
franchise agreement and up to $100 per day or per incident for all other
violations of a material nature, provided that all violations of a similar
nature occurring at the same time shall be considered one violation.
A. In the event franchisee's performance of any of the terms, conditions or
obligations required by this chapter or a franchise granted hereunder is
prevented by a cause or event not within franchisee's control, such
inability to perform shall be deemed excused and no penalties or
sanctions shall be imposed as a result thereof.
B. For the purpose of this section, causes or events not within the control
of franchisee shall include, but not be limited to, acts of God, strikes,
sabotage, riots or civil disturbances, restraints imposed by order of a
governmental agency or court, failure or loss of utilities, explosion, acts

issued until this determination has been made.

proper credentials, at any reasonable hour to enforce the provisions of
this chapter.
F. In the event the floodplain administrator discovers that the work does
not comply with the permit application or any applicable laws and
ordinances, or that there has been a false statement or
misrepresentation by any applicant, the floodplain administrator shall
revoke the permit and report such fact to the White Township Planning
Commission for whatever action it considers necessary.
G. The floodplain administrator shall maintain all records associated with
the requirements of this chapter including, but not limited to,

partially within any identified floodplain area, applicants for permits
shall provide all the necessary information in sufficient detail and
clarity to enable the floodplain administrator to determine that:

§ 178-2. Posting of addresses.
§ 178-3. Procedures.
§ 178-4. Addressing system.
A. Within 30 days of receipt of written notification, in accordance with this
chapter, by White Township or its designated representatives, of the
assignment of or change of a structure address number, the owner of
said structure shall post the assigned structure address number in
compliance with the requirements herein.
B. All address numbers shall be constructed of durable material with a
color which shall contrast with the color scheme of the surface on which
it is posted. The minimum size for all such posted address numbers
shall be three inches in height. In every case the posted numbers shall
be clear and readable from the street or roadway along which the
structure is addressed.
C. The numbers shall be posted upon the structure within three feet of the
main entrance thereto unless the structure is more than 75 feet from
the road right-of-way or not visible from the roadway. In such cases, the
address numbers shall be posted on the property within 10 feet of the
road right-of-way line and within 15 feet of either side of the driveway
to the structure; or on the mail box serving the property, provided the
location of the mail box is in compliance with current postal
regulations.
D. Following the posting of the assigned address numbers, as required
herein, the owner shall maintain the posted address number at all times
in compliance with this chapter. Posted address numbers, as viewed
from the public roadway, shall not be obstructed from view by
landscaping, shrubs, vegetation, screen doors, canopies, ornaments, or
any other plant or structure.
A. When an owner or resident of any structure in White Township receives
notification of a new or changed address, that owner or resident shall
promptly provide all information requested by completing the questions
on the notification; sign the appropriate place on the form to
acknowledge receipt of the notification; and return the completed and
signed return portion of the notification form to the address listed on
the notification form.
B. No building permit will be issued for any new or remodeled building or
structure in White Township until the owner or developer has been
issued a street address.
A. One-hundred-block-style addressing. White Township shall have the
sole authority to verify the validity of the addressing system in areas of
the Township which are currently addressed with a one-hundred-blockstyle
addressing system, and to determine which areas of the Township
§ 178-2 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 178-4
1:139
will use the one-hundered-block-style system. New structures in these
areas of White Township will be assigned an address which complies
with the existing valid system. White Township shall have the sole
authority to modify or assign new street addresses in these areas.
B. Distance-based addressing system. White Township shall have the sole
authority to determine which areas of the Township will use the
distance-based addressing system. The distance-based addressing
system is based on a calculated street address which uses:
(1) The measured distance along the roadway from an intersection to
the property to be addressed.
(2) The orientation of the roadway in relation to the intersection of
Philadelphia Street and 1st Street, and north along Martin Road,
south along Wayne Avenue, east along East Pike and west along
West Pike/Old Route 422.
(3) The side of the roadway on which the property is situated.
C. Philadelphia Street and 1st Street in Indiana Borough are considered
the baselines for the distance-based addressing system. The
intersection of Philadelphia Street and 1st Street in Indiana Borough is
considered the point of origin for these baselines. All assigned
addresses on each roadway will start with the lowest assigned
numerical address at that end of the roadway which is the closest to the
point of origin of the baselines. In the case of dead-end roads the
numbers will begin at the end of the road which intersects another
named roadway.
D. The numbering of all roads which cross either of the baseline roads will
begin at the baseline and progress upward away from the baseline.
Such roads will then also be designated with an east, west, north, or
south prefix. For those roads which cross more than two baselines, the
directional prefix will be based solely upon the north-south baseline,
6th Street north to Marion Road and south to Wayne Avenue in Indiana
Borough.
E. Individual addresses will be the product of the division of the measured
distance along the roadway by the number 5.28 so that every address
will reflect the mileage along the roadway. For example, an address of
1600 will be located 1.6 miles along the roadway. Numbers will be
assigned with even numbers on the right side of the roadway, odd
numbers on the left side of the roadway, as one would stand with their
back towards the beginning point. All inhabitable structures will be
addressed. Structures which are obviously facing a named road will be
addressed with respect to that roadway. Addresses will be assigned
based upon the measured distance to the front door of the structure.
Buildings which are more than 75 feet from the roadway will be
addressed based upon the measured distance to the center of the
driveway to the structure.

§ 263-2. Findings.
The governing body of the municipality finds that:
§ 263-3. Purpose.
These regulations are adopted and implemented to promote health, safety,
and welfare within the municipality and its watershed by minimizing the
harms and maximizing the benefits described in this chapter, through
provisions designed to:
A. Inadequate management of accelerated runoff of stormwater resulting
from development throughout a watershed increases runoff volumes,
flows and velocities, contributes to erosion and sedimentation,
overtaxes the carrying capacity of streams and storm sewers, greatly
increases the cost of public facilities to carry and control stormwater,
undermines floodplain management and flood control efforts in
downstream communities, reduces groundwater recharge, threatens
public health and safety, and increases nonpoint source pollution of
water resources.
B. A comprehensive program of stormwater management (SWM),
including reasonable regulation of development and activities causing
accelerated runoff, is fundamental to the public health, safety, and
welfare and the protection of people of the commonwealth, their
resources, and the environment.
C. Stormwater is an important water resource that provides groundwater
recharge for water supplies and supports the base flow of streams.
D. The use of green infrastructure and low-impact development (LID) are
intended to address the root cause of water quality impairment by using
systems and practices which use or mimic natural processes to:
(1) Infiltrate and recharge;
(2) Evapotranspire; and/or
(3) Harvest and use precipitation near where it falls to earth.
E. Green infrastructure practices and LID contribute to the restoration or
maintenance of predevelopment hydrology.
A. Manage and control stormwater runoff resulting from land alteration
and disturbance activities pursuant to the Pennsylvania Storm Water
§ 263-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 263-3
1:235
§ 263-4. Statutory authority.
The municipality is empowered to regulate land use activities that affect
runoff by the authority of the Act of July 31, 1968, P.L. 805, No. 247, The
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code39, as amended, and/or the Act of
October 4, 1978, P.L. 864 (Act 167), 32 P.S. § 680.1, et seq., as amended,
The Stormwater Management Act.
§ 263-5. Applicability.

quality requirements under state law, including regulations at 25 Pa.
Code 93 to protect, maintain, reclaim and restore the existing and
designated uses of the waters of the commonwealth.
B. Utilize and preserve the desirable existing natural drainage systems
and to preserve the flood-carrying capacity of the streams and to
prevent the scour and erosion of stream banks and streambeds.
C. Manage stormwater runoff close to the source, reduce runoff volumes
and mimic predevelopment hydrology.
D. Encourage natural infiltration of rainfall to preserve groundwater
supplies and stream flows.
E. Provide for adequate design, construction and maintenance of all
permanent stormwater structures, facilities, best management
practices (BMPs) and all conveyance systems in the Township.
F. Provide standards to meet National Pollution Discharge Elimination
System (NPDES) permit requirements.
A. All regulated activities and all activities that may affect stormwater
runoff, including land development, land redevelopment, subdivisions
and earth disturbance activity, are subject to regulation by this chapter.
B. It shall be unlawful for any person or firm to develop or improve any
property within White Township for land development, as regulated by
the Code of the Township of White, Chapter 275, the White Township
Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance, without first receiving
approval of a stormwater management plan from the White Township
Planning Commission. No building permit shall be issued for a land
development that has not received said stormwater management plan
approval.
C. Regardless of size, all land developments shall provide adequate on-site
stormwater controls to protect neighboring properties from harm.

specific example but is intended to extend its meaning to all other
instances of like kind and character.
(3) The words "shall" and "must" are mandatory; the words "may" and
"should" are permissive.
B. These definitions do not necessarily reflect the definitions contained in
pertinent regulations or statutes, and are intended for this chapter only.
ACT  The Storm Water Management Act (Act of October 4, 1978, P.L.
864, No. 167; 32 P.S. §§ 680.1 through 680.17, as amended by Act of
May 24, 1984, No. 63).
AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITY  Activities associated with agriculture
such as agricultural cultivation, agricultural operation, and animal
heavy use areas. This includes the work of producing crops including
tillage, land clearing, plowing, disking, harrowing, planting, harvesting
crops, or pasturing and raising of livestock, and installation of
conservation measures. Construction of new buildings or impervious
area is not considered an agricultural activity, unless said building or
impervious area is part of a conservation practice (such as a manure
management facility) and approved by the Indiana County Conservation
District and meeting Natural Resources Conservation Service design
standards.
ALLOWABLE DISCHARGE RATE  The predevelopment peak rate of
runoff that is discharged from an outfall on the site after development.
It applies uniformly to all land development or alterations within the
project area.
APPLICANT  A landowner, developer, or other person who has filed
an application to the Township for approval to engage in any regulated
activity at a project site in the Township.
BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICE (BMP)  Activities, facilities,
designs, measures, or procedures used to manage stormwater impacts
from regulated activities, to meet state water quality requirements, to
promote groundwater recharge, and to otherwise meet the purposes
of this chapter. Stormwater BMPs are commonly grouped into one
of two broad categories or measures: "structural" or "nonstructural."
§ 263-12 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 263-12
1:239
In this chapter, nonstructural BMPs or measures refer to operational
and/or behavior-related practices that attempt to minimize the contact
of pollutants with stormwater runoff, whereas structural BMPs or
measures are those that consist of a physical device or practice that
is installed to capture and treat stormwater runoff. Structural BMPs
include, but are not limited to, a wide variety of practices and devices,
from large-scale retention ponds and constructed wetlands, to smallscale
underground treatment systems, infiltration facilities, filter strips,
low impact design, bioretention, wet ponds, permeable paving, grassed
swales, riparian or forested buffers, sand filters, detention basins, and
manufactured devices. Structural stormwater BMPs are permanent
appurtenances to the project site.
BIORETENTION AREA/RAIN GARDEN  A bioretention area/rain
garden is a planted depression that collects rainwater runoff from
impervious areas, like roofs, driveways, walkways, parking lots, and
compacted lawn areas. The bioretention area/rain garden must have a
soil mix that is capable of allowing rainwater to infiltrate. This reduces
rain runoff by allowing stormwater to soak into the ground. Plantings
for the bioretention area/rain garden would preferably be native plants
and the Township recommends that they be designed by a licensed
landscape architect. The purpose of a bioretention area/rain garden is
to improve water quality in nearby bodies of water.
CHANNEL  A perceptible natural or artificial waterway which
periodically or continuously contains moving water or which forms a
connecting link between two bodies of water. It has a definite bed and
banks which confine water.
CONSERVATION DISTRICT  A conservation district, as defined in
Section 3(c) of the Conservation District Law (3 P.S. § 851(c)) that
has the authority under a delegation agreement executed with DEP to
administer and enforce all or a portion of the regulations promulgated
under 25 Pa. Code 102.
CONSERVATION DISTRICT  The Indiana County Conservation
District.
CULVERT  A conduit for the free passage of surface drainage under a
highway, railroad, canal or other embankment.
DEP  Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection.
DESIGN CRITERIA 

within the drainage system.
DETENTION BASIN FOREBAY  A forebay is a small pool located
near the inlet of a detention basin or other stormwater management
facility. These devices are designed as initial storage areas to trap and
settle out sediment and heavy pollutants before they reach the main
basin. Installing an earth berm, gabion wall, or other barrier near the
inlet to cause stormwater to pool temporarily can form the pool area.
Forebays act as a pretreatment feature on a stormwater pond and
can greatly reduce the overall pond maintenance requirements. The
minimum forebay volume shall be equal to 25% of the two-year, twentyfour-
hour storm volume.
DETENTION FACILITY  Any pond, reservoir, or basin, or any
combination of underground pipes or tanks constructed to impound or
temporarily retard surface runoff.

released into the waters of the commonwealth at a controlled rate.
DEVELOPER  The person, persons or any corporation, partnership,
association or other entity or any responsible person therein or agent
therefore that undertakes the activities associated with changes in land
cover or contour. The term "developer" is intended to include but not
necessarily be limited to the term "subdivider," "owner" and "builder"
even though the individuals involved in successive stages of a project
may vary.
DEVELOPMENT  Any activity, construction, alteration, change in
land cover or contour, or any practice that affects stormwater runoff
characteristics.
DISCHARGE  In general, the removal of surface water from a given

studies as being a special flood hazard area. Also includes areas that
comprise Group 13 Soils, as listed in Appendix A of the Pennsylvania
DEP Technical Manual for Sewage Enforcement Officers (as amended
or replaced from time to time by DEP).
FLOODPLAIN RESTORATION  Floodplain restoration is the use of
bioengineering practices, removal of fill material, restructuring of
stream channels and/or the restoration or management of riparian
corridors in order to create a floodplain to compensate for the past loss
of floodplains.
FLOODWAY  The channel of the watercourse and those portions of
the adjoining floodplains that are reasonably required to carry and
discharge the 100-year flood. Unless otherwise specified, the boundary

1:242
of the floodway is as indicated on maps and flood insurance studies
provided by FEMA. In an area where no FEMA maps or studies have
defined the boundary of the 100-year floodway, it is assumed, absent
evidence to the contrary, that the floodway extends from the stream to
50 feet from the top of the bank of the stream.
FOREST MANAGEMENT/TIMBER OPERATIONS  Planning and
activities necessary for the management of forestland. These include
conducting a timber inventory, preparation of forest management
plans, silvicultural treatment, cutting budgets, logging road design and
construction, timber harvesting, site preparation, and reforestation.
FOREST RESTORATION  Forest restoration is the planting of trees
in areas that have become devoid of original forest cover. The new
tree plantings must be native species of trees. New trees must be
a minimum height of four feet for evergreen trees and six feet for
deciduous trees. It is recommended that forest restoration plans be
prepared by a professional forester who is a member of the Society
of American Foresters or the Association of Consulting Foresters. A
professional forester is a person who has a B.S. or higher degree in
forestry from a four-year school of forestry accredited by the Society of
American Foresters.

natural processes to infiltrate, evapotranspire, or reuse stormwater on
the site where it is generated.
GREEN ROOF  A green roof is a conventional roof that is covered with
a layer of vegetation. Also known as "living roofs," green roofs serve
several purposes for a building, such as absorbing rainwater, providing
insulation, creating a habitat for wildlife, and helping to lower urban air
temperatures, and combat the heat island effect. There are two types of
green roofs: intensive roofs, which are thicker and can support a wider
variety of plants but are heavier and require more maintenance, and
extensive roofs, which are covered in a light layer of vegetation and are
lighter than an intensive green roof.

widely and are affected by subsurface permeability as well as surface
intake rates. Soils are classified into four HSGs (A, B, C, and D)
according to their minimum infiltration rate, which is obtained for
bare soil after prolonged wetting. The Natural Resources Conservation
Service (NRCS) defines the four groups and provides a list of most of
the soils in the United States and their group classification. The soils in
the area of the development site may be identified from a soil survey
report that can be obtained from local NRCS offices or conservation
district offices. Soils become less pervious as the HSG varies from A to
D (NRCS1,2).
IMPERVIOUS  Not allowing or allowing only with great difficulty the
movement of water; impermeable.
IMPERVIOUS SURFACE (IMPERVIOUS AREA)  A surface that
prevents the infiltration of water into the ground. Impervious surfaces
(or areas) shall include, but not be limited to: roofs; additional indoor

LOW-IMPACT DEVELOPMENT (LID)  Site design approaches and
small-scale stormwater management practices that promote the use
of natural systems for infiltration, evapotranspiration, and reuse of
rainwater. LID can be applied to new development, urban retrofits, and
revitalization projects. LID utilizes design techniques that infiltrate,

(garage, shed, pool, etc.), and/or driveway creation or modification
thereof.
RETENTION BASIN (POND)  An impoundment designed to collect
and retard stormwater runoff by temporarily storing the runoff and
releasing it at a predetermined rate. Retention basins may also be
designed to permanently retain additional stormwater runoff. Retention
basins are designed to retain a permanent pool of water during dry
weather.

§ 263-15. Volume controls.
D. Exemptions from any provisions of this chapter shall not relieve the
applicant from the requirements in § 263-15D through N.
E. The Township may deny or revoke any exemption pursuant to this
section at any time for any project that the Township believes may pose
a threat to public health and safety or the environment.
A. The stormwater management practices to be used in developing a
stormwater management plan for a particular site shall be selected
according to the following order of preference:
(1) Nonstructural BMPs.
(2) Structural BMPs.
(3) Stormwater detention/retention structures.
B. Infiltration practices shall be used to the extent practicable to reduce
volume increases and promote groundwater recharge. A combination of
successive practices may be used to achieve the applicable minimum
control requirements. Design calculations must be provided for all
stormwater facilities, including detention ponds, BMPs, ditches, swales,
inlets, pipes, culverts, etc. All BMPs must be shown on the recorded
plan.
C. Required BMPs (for all developments not qualifying for water quality
volume retention). A minimum of 80% of the ten-year, twenty-four-hour
storm runoff volume must be treated by stormwater BMPs. All
stormwater management plans must include a minimum of two of the
following BMPs with the plan:
(1) Bioretention area/rain garden.
(2) Grassed waterway/channel.
(3) Pervious (porous) pavement.
(4) Detention basin forebay.
(5) Water quality inlets.
(6) Stormwater reuse.
(7) Green roof.
D. Other BMPs may be used as approved by the municipal engineer.
E. The following restoration items may be used in lieu of the required
BMPs. Use of these items must be approved by the municipal engineer.
(1) Wetland/wetland restoration.
(2) Stream restoration.
§ 263-14 WHITE CODE § 263-15
1:254
(3) Floodplain restoration.
(4) Forest restoration.
F. Water quality volume retention.
(1) Water quality volume retention will be the calculated volume of
stormwater runoff from impervious or semi-impervious areas which
is required to be captured and mitigated through various BMPs.
(2) This may be achieved through the use of structural or
nonstructural BMPs.
(3) The water quality volume is the difference in stormwater runoff
volume between the predevelopment conditions and the postdevelopment
conditions as calculated for the two-year storm event.
(4) All impervious areas must drain to a stormwater BMP.
G. The green infrastructure and low-impact development practices
provided in the BMP Manual shall be utilized for all regulated activities
wherever possible. Water volume controls shall be implemented using
the Design Storm Method in Subsection G(1) or the Simplified Method
in Subsection G(2) below.
(1) The Design Storm Method (CG-1 in the BMP Manual48) is
applicable to any size of regulated activity. This method requires
detailed modeling based on site conditions.
(a) Do not increase the post-development total runoff volume for
all storms equal to or less than the two-year, twenty-four-hour
duration precipitation.
(b) For modeling purposes:
[1] Existing (predevelopment) nonforested pervious areas
must be considered meadow in good condition.
[2] 20% of existing impervious area, when present, shall be
considered meadow in good condition in the model for
existing conditions. If constructing facilities to
accommodate the resulting volume requirement is
believed by the developer to be unfeasible on site, the
developer may submit a modification request along with
technical support documentation for review by the
Township. The Township may grant a modification to
alternatively construct off-site volume controls providing
that the alternative site is located within the same
subwatershed as the project site and the peak discharge
rates downstream of the project site are not increased
above predevelopment magnitudes. The developer shall
48.Editor's Note: See § 263-39C.
§ 263-15 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 263-15
1:255
§ 263-16. Rate controls.
consider on-site facilities to the maximum extent
practicable before considering off-site alternatives.
[3] Design and construction of the off-site controls shall be
subject to review and approval by the Township. Costs
shall be the responsibility of the developer. Design
documentation shall demonstrate that the proposed
facilities are effective in removing an amount equal to the
project's increase in the two-year storm volume from the
overall runoff where the facility is to be located.
[4] In lieu of construction of off-site controls, the developer
may request and the Township may accept payment into
the Township stormwater fund. The cost shall be based
upon the Township's current fee schedule (adjusted
annually) based upon an established cost per cubic foot of
storage.
(2) The Simplified Method (CG-2 in the BMP Manual49) provided below
is independent of site conditions and should be used if the Design
Storm Method is not followed. This method is not applicable to
regulated activities greater than one acre or for projects that
require design of stormwater storage facilities. For new impervious
surfaces:
(a) Stormwater facilities shall capture at least the first two inches
of runoff from all new impervious surfaces.
(b) At least the first one inch of runoff from new impervious
surfaces shall be permanently removed from the runoff flow,
i.e., it shall not be released into the surface waters of this
commonwealth. Removal options include reuse, evaporation,
transpiration, and infiltration.
(c) Wherever possible, infiltration facilities should be designed to
accommodate infiltration of the entire permanently removed
runoff; however, in all cases at least the first 0.5 inch of the
permanently removed runoff should be infiltrated.
(d) This method is exempt from the requirements of § 263-16, Rate
controls.
A. For areas not covered by a release rate map from an approved Act 167
stormwater management plan:
(1) Post-development discharge rates shall not exceed the
predevelopment discharge rates for the one-, two-, five-, ten-,
twenty-five-, fifty-, and 100-year, twenty-four-hour storm events. If

it is shown that the peak rates of discharge indicated by the postdevelopment
analysis are less than or equal to the peak rates
of discharge indicated by the predevelopment analysis for one-
, two-, five-, ten-, twenty-five-, fifty-, and 100-year, twenty-fourhour
storms, then the requirements of this section have been met.
Otherwise, the applicant shall provide additional controls as
necessary to satisfy the peak rate of discharge requirement.
B. For areas covered by a release rate map from an approved Act 167
stormwater management plan:
(1) For the one-, two-, five-, ten-, twenty-five-, fifty-, and 100-year,
twenty-four-hour storm events, the post-development peak
discharge rates will follow the applicable approved release rate
maps. For any areas not shown on the release rate maps, the postdevelopment
discharge rates shall not exceed the predevelopment
discharge rates.
A. In order to protect and improve water quality, a riparian buffer
easement shall be created and recorded as part of any subdivision or
land development that contains a riparian buffer.
B. Except as required by 25 PaChapter 102, the Riparian Buffer Easement
shall be measured to be the greater of the limit of the 100-year
floodplain or a minimum of 50 feet from the top of the streambank (on
each side).
C. Minimum management requirements for riparian buffers.
(1) Existing native vegetation shall be protected and maintained within
the riparian buffer easement.
(2) Whenever practicable, invasive vegetation shall be actively
removed and the riparian buffer easement shall be planted with
native trees, shrubs and other vegetation to create a diverse native
plant community appropriate to the intended ecological context of
the site.
D. The riparian buffer easement shall be enforceable by the Township and
shall be recorded in the appropriate county recorder of deeds office, so
that it shall run with the land and shall limit the use of the property
located therein. The easement shall allow for the continued private
ownership and shall count toward the minimum lot area as required by
the municipal Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance.50
E. Any permitted use within the riparian buffer easement shall be
conducted in a manner that will maintain the extent of the existing

§ 263-16 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 263-17
1:257
§ 263-18. Redevelopment criteria.
100-year floodplain, improve or maintain the stream stability, and
preserve and protect the ecological function of the floodplain.
F. The following conditions shall apply when public and/or private
recreation trails are permitted within riparian buffers:
(1) Trails shall be for nonmotorized use only.
(2) Trails shall be designed to have the least impact on native plant
species and other sensitive environmental features.
G. Septic drain fields and sewage disposal systems shall not be permitted
within the riparian buffer easement and shall comply with setback
requirements established under 25 Pa. Code Chapter 73.
A. The purpose of these criteria is to provide post-construction
requirements for redevelopment projects. The intent of these criteria is
to improve stormwater runoff and drainage patterns on existing
properties while encouraging redevelopment and urban renewal. Since
these properties would have been developed under a previous version
of this chapter, and in some cases, even previous to any related
ordinance, the predevelopment condition to be used for the new
stormwater management plan and related calculations shall be the
condition of the property previous to the existing development
occurring.
B. When redevelopment occurs, an additional opportunity exists to receive
credit toward the existing White Township Municipal Authority
stormwater management system user fee, established under Resolution
No. MA-2-15, dated December 21, 2015. A developer shall work with
the White Township municipal engineer or other designated staff to
determine the level of credit, where applicable. Please refer to the
White Township Appeal and Credit Manual for Stormwater Fees for
more details about this policy.
C. When a development qualifies as a redevelopment project, the existing
stormwater facilities (if any) may be used provided they meet the
requirements of this chapter.
D. If the existing stormwater facilities are in place, a report detailing the
condition of the infrastructure to be used is required. This report must
be signed and sealed by a professional engineer licensed in
Pennsylvania.
E. The developer shall make all necessary repairs or modifications to the
existing facilities as detailed in the engineer's report.
F. If no or insufficient stormwater facilities exist at the time of the
proposed redevelopment, the developer shall submit a plan that meets
the requirements of this chapter for the entirety of the development and
§ 263-17 WHITE CODE § 263-18
1:258
that falls into accord with the criteria established in § 263-5 and the
subsequent requirements of this chapter.
G. Additionally, land development that qualifies as redevelopment shall
meet at least one of the following criteria:
(1) Reduce impervious cover. Reduce existing site impervious cover by
at least 20%.
(2) Provide treatment. Provide water quality treatment for at least 20%
of the site's predevelopment impervious cover and 100% of any
new impervious cover, not to exceed 150% of the total new
impervious.
(a) This can be accomplished through stormwater BMPs designed
in accordance with the criteria from the Pennsylvania
Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual (BMP
Manual).51
(b) Runoff reduction may be used instead of water quality
treatment on parcels where the lot size is at least 2.5 acres and
impervious cover is less than 10%.
(3) Apply innovative approaches. Utilize innovative approaches to
reduce stormwater impacts across the site. Examples include green
roofs and pervious parking materials.
(4) Provide off-site treatment. Provide equivalent stormwater
treatment at an off-site facility within the same watershed and as
immediately downstream of the site as feasible.
(5) Address downstream issues. Address downstream channel and
flooding issues through channel restoration, increase in existing
system capacity and/or other off-site remedies.
(6) Combination of measures. Any combination of (1) through (5)
above that is acceptable to White Township.

that at any time any portion of the road or bridge or section thereof that is
under permit becomes damaged, impassable, unsafe or otherwise not in the
condition of a public thoroughfare due to the activity or use of the road or
bridge by the permittee.

ARTICLE I
General Provisions
§ 275-1. Authority and jurisdiction.
White Township has the power to review and approve or disapprove plans
for the subdivision of land, for the arrangement and administration of land
developments, and for the layout of multifamily residential developments
within its corporate limits under the authority vested in the Board of
Supervisors by the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, Act 247 of
1969, as amended.59
§ 275-2. Purpose.
This chapter is adopted for the following reasons:
§ 275-3. Short title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "White Township
Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance."
§ 275-4. Subdivision and development definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
COMMERCIAL OR INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT  The arrangement of
nonresidential building or buildings and supporting facilities on a parcel of
land for use by a commercial or industrial business, or a nonprofit entity
when the building is used for any use except a single-family dwelling.
Examples of the latter include, but are not limited to, hospitals, places
of worship and assembly, or educational facilities. Supporting facilities
will normally include, but not necessarily be limited to, access drives into
the site, car parking, truck servicing areas, storm drainage system and
A. To promote the public health, safety and general welfare of the
residents and property owners.
B. To guarantee that a vehicular circulation system, a safe means of
sewage disposal, a potable water supply of sufficient capacity and
control of storm drainage are provided for in each subdivision and
development plan.
C. To safeguard lands subject to flooding or subsidence, and to prevent
erosion, unnecessary destruction of plant materials and excessive
grading.
D. To assure property owners and residents of the Township that all plans
will be considered on an established public policy, objectively and
uniformly enforced.

landscaping. The impact of the development on adjacent roads and the
surrounding neighborhood, as the result of site grading and traffic
generation among other considerations, are of sufficient concern to the
public health and safety to require the Township's review and action prior
to construction.[Amended 12-7-2016 by Ord. No. 1076]
MAJOR SUBDIVISION  A subdivision in which five or more lots, tracts or
parcels are created, and/or new streets or extensions of existing streets,
public or private, required to serve at least one of the lots, tracts, or parcels
in order to provide the minimum street frontage for the lot or lots, and/or
sewer or water lines or both must be extended to serve one or more of the
lots.
MINOR SUBDIVISION  A subdivision in which less than five lots, tracts
or parcels are created, all of which abut a public street in existence prior
to presentation of the subdivision, each lot with sufficient frontage thereon;
and further, no extension of public or private sewer or water lines is
required to serve any or all of the lots, tracts or parcels.
MOBILE HOME PARK  A tract of land in one ownership which has been
planned and improved for the placement of two or more mobile homes, each
on a prepared site at which sanitary sewage and water supply connections
are available. Improvements within the tract shall include paved roads
abutting all mobile home sites connecting to a public street and community
facilities. Each mobile home to be accommodated on the site shall contain
its own bathing and toilet enclosure, as well as its own cooking and food
storage facilities. The mobile home park regulations are incorporated into
this chapter as Article VIII.
PLANNED MULTIFAMILY RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT  A design
concept to be applied to a tract of land which is proposed for improvement
as a single plan for a number of dwelling units. The arrangement of
buildings and density of development may be more intense on the more
accessible and easily developed parts of the property, provided a
compensating portion of the property is permanently set aside for open
space and recorded as such. The purposes of the concept are to safeguard
forever steep slopes, woods, floodplains and other environmentally sensitive
areas, permit shorter lengths of streets and utilities with less land surface
disturbance and encourage a wider range of housing types.
SUBDIVISION 
The division by the owner, grantor or devisor, of a single lot, tract
or parcel of land, or a part thereof, into two or more lots, tracts or
parcels of land, including lots, tracts or parcels to be retained by
the owner, grantor or devisor, and those lots, tracts and parcels to
be conveyed, or leased, whether now or in the future, to others for
immediate or later development. The rearrangement of property lines,
although not creating any new properties, and the combining of several
lots, tracts, or parcels or parts thereof to create a new property or
properties, whether resulting in fewer properties in number or not,
shall be considered subdivisions for the purpose of this chapter.
A.
§ 275-4 WHITE CODE § 275-4
1:292
§ 275-5. Applicability.
The division of land for agricultural purposes into lots, tracts, or parcels
of more than 10 acres and not involving the construction of any new
streets, utilities or access easements shall be exempted provided each
such lot, tract or parcel thus created has access to at least a usable,
permanent recorded easement not less than 20 feet wide connecting to
a public road.
B.
A. On and after the effective date of this chapter, no lot in a subdivision
may be sold, no permit to erect, alter, repair or remove any building
upon land in a subdivision or a land development may be issued and no
building may be erected in a subdivision or land development or mobile
home placed in a mobile home park unless and until a subdivision plan
or land development plan has been approved by the Board of
Supervisors or its designated representative, the Planning Commission
and recorded in the office of the Indiana County Recorder of Deeds, and
until the improvements required by this chapter have either been
constructed or guaranteed.
B. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter
shall be held to be the minimum requirements adopted for the
protection of the public health, safety and welfare.
C. This chapter shall not apply to any lot or lots, plan of lots, development,
or mobile home park plan created and lawfully recorded prior to
February 14, 1963, except as regards the development of such lots or
plan.
D. Any redivision or combination of lots within a plan previously recorded
or any rearrangement of structures, parking areas, graded land
surfaces or other elements within a development plan or mobile home
park shall be subject to this chapter.
E. Any lot or plan of lots or development or mobile home park plan illegally
recorded or not lawfully recorded prior to adoption of this chapter shall
not be given legal status by adoption.
F. It is not the intent of this chapter to annul or interfere with existing
laws or ordinances or with private restrictions placed upon property by
deed, covenant or other private agreement or with restrictive
covenants running with the land to which the Township is a party,
except that where this chapter imposes greater restrictions upon land
and development than are imposed or required by such existing
provisions of law, ordinance, contract or deed, it shall be interpreted
that they are in addition to the restrictions of such other existing
regulation or ordinance.

Commission to act and to have full authority in the administration of this
chapter and any subsequent amendments thereto. The Planning
Commission shall have the power to grant reasonable modifications, in
accordance with § 275-66 herein, and to propose and to hold public

ARTICLE III
Processing of Plan Applications
§ 275-9. Preliminary considerations.
§ 275-10. Minor subdivision procedure.
Developers seeking approval of a minor subdivision as defined in § 275-4 or
a division of land into tracts of at least 10 acres for agricultural purposes
may disregard the preliminary plan stages and proceed to final plan
application. Four copies of the final plan shall be submitted. All steps in the
final review procedure, with the exception of those guaranteeing provision
of streets and public utilities, shall apply to a minor subdivision. If approved
the final plan shall be officially stamped as approved, dated and signed by
the Chairman and Secretary of the Commission, and recorded within 90
days with the Indiana County Recorder of Deeds, or the approval will be
voided.
§ 275-11. Preliminary plan application.
A. Activities denied prior to final approval. No person, firm or corporation
contemplating subdivision or development of a tract of land shall
proceed with any grading of the site until preliminary approval has
been granted or shall record or sell any lots until he has received final
approval of his plan from the Planning Commission.
B. Unsuitable conditions jeopardizing approval. The Township may refuse
to grant approval of all or a part of certain plans that provide
inadequate access, or that are unsuitable for development by reason of
flooding hazard, steep slopes, poor drainage, slide-prone soils or
nonconformity with the Township Comprehensive Plan.
C. Preliminary sketch plan. Any developer may present at his option a
preliminary sketch plan for the Planning Commission's review at a
regular meeting. The developer is urged to attend to answer questions
and receive advice. The sketch plan shall show the entire property,
slopes and grading, parking if a multifamily, commercial or industrial
project, streams and storm drainage, easements, natural features of the
property and relationship of the site to major roads and landmarks in
the vicinity. In addition the plan shall indicate the name of the property
owner, developer, and preparer of the plan, proposed number of
dwelling and/or commercial units and average area and frontage of lots.
The purpose of this part is to provide guidance. No recommendations of
the Commission are binding on the developer.
D. Exchanges of property. When property is being divided or property lines
rearranged with particular buyers and sellers involved, each parcel to
be transferred in title shall be indicated with the seller's and buyer's
name so the line of conveyance is clear.
§ 275-9 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 275-11
1:305
§ 275-12. Final plan application.
A. Submission. Any person, firm or corporation proposing to subdivide or
develop land, except for minor subdivisions or divisions of land into
tracts of at least 10 acres for agricultural purposes, shall submit seven
copies of the information, plans and profiles required by this section to
the Planning Commission at a regular monthly meeting. The
Commission may, at its option, postpone consideration of the plan and
official receipt of it until the developer can be present at a regular
meeting.
B. Review. The Planning Commission shall review the submitted
documents for conformance with this chapter and inclusion of
recommendations made at the preapplication meeting. It shall submit
one copy of the submission to the Board of Supervisors, one copy to the
Township Engineer, one copy to the Planning Commission files and
other copies to state or federal agencies as appropriate.
C. Approval. The Planning Commission shall render its decision granting
preliminary approval, denying it or granting preliminary approval with
conditions, and shall inform the applicant not later than 90 days after
officially receiving the plan at a regular meeting. The decision shall be
in writing and shall be communicated to the applicant personally or
mailed to him at his last known address not later than 15 days following
the decision. The decision shall set forth the reasons for the
disapproval, if that is the decision, specifying the defects found,
describing the requirements which were not met and citing the
provisions of the statute or ordinance relied upon. Failure of the
Commission to reach a decision or to communicate it within the time
limits shall be deemed an approval of the plan as presented. Failure of
the developer to accept any and all conditions upon approval shall
render the approval void. No amendment to this chapter after official
receipt of a subdivision plan shall detrimentally affect the plan or its
processing unless the plan is withdrawn and resubmitted, nor shall
such intervening amendment adversely affect the right of a developer
to commence and complete any approved plan or portion of a plan
within five years of the date of preliminary approval. Preliminary plan
approval shall only be an expression of tentative approval and
authorization to proceed to the final plan application. The plan shall be
stamped, dated and signed by the Commission Chairman and Secretary
upon granting of the preliminary approval. [Amended 8-9-1989 by
Ord. No. 907; 12-22-2004 by Ord. No. 1001]
A. Submission. Having received preliminary approval, the developer or his
authorized representative shall within three years submit a final plan
application for all or part of the plan given preliminary approval. The
application shall be provided in seven copies plus a reproducible
transparency for recording of the plan. If the developer does not appear
at the meeting at which his plan is received, the Commission may
§ 275-11 WHITE CODE § 275-12
1:306
postpone review until he can be present at a regularly scheduled
meeting.
B. Review. The Planning Commission shall review the submitted
documents for conformance with this chapter and inclusion of any
conditions attached to preliminary approval. Copies of the submission
materials shall be distributed as for the preliminary plan application. In
making its review and before granting final approval, the Commission
shall determine that adequate means of sewage disposal, as determined
by the Township Sewage Enforcement Officer, are available on each lot,
or if each lot or building is to be connected to the public sewage
collection system that sufficient sewer tap-in permits have been
assigned to accommodate all the lots in the plan or all the buildings in a
multifamily residential, or commercial or industrial development
connected to a water supply.
C. Approval. The Planning Commission shall render its decision granting
final approval or denying it and shall inform the applicant of its decision
not later than 90 days after officially receiving the plan at a regular
meeting. The decision shall be in writing and shall be communicated to
the applicant personally or mailed to him at his last known address not
later than 15 days following the decision. The decision shall set forth
the reasons for the disapproval, if that is the decision, specifying the
defects found, describing the requirements that were not met and
citing the provisions of the stature or ordinance relied upon. Failure of
the Commission to reach a decision or to communicate it within the
time limits shall be deemed an approval of the plan as presented. The
final plan shall be dated and signed by the Chairman and Secretary of
the Commission if approved, using the official stamp. The developer
shall within 90 days of final approval record the approved plan in the
Indiana County Office of the Recorder of Deeds. Failure to record within
the time limit shall void the plan. At the time of submittal of the final
plan, the developer shall pay a fee in accordance with § 275-71 of this
chapter. [Amended 12-22-2004 by Ord. No. 1001]
D. Guarantee that improvements will be completed. Before approving any
final plan application the Planning Commission shall require that the
developer deposit with the Board of Supervisors a guarantee of
completion of all improvements agreed upon at the time of final
approval in the form of a bond or the deposit of funds or securities to be
held in escrow, to the benefit of the Township, such guarantee equal to
110% of the value of the improvement as estimated by a qualified
engineer. The form and type of guarantee shall be approved by the
Township Supervisors. The Township may permit partial release of the
guarantee funds as construction proceeds provided sufficient funds
remain to complete all the improvements in the estimation of the
Township Engineer. [Amended 8-9-1989 by Ord. No. 907]
E. Maintenance bond as condition of immediate acceptance. If the
developer requests the Board of Supervisors to accept the
improvements covered under the guarantee immediately after their

securities to be held in escrow to the benefit of the Township, such bond
or deposit to equal 15% of the value of the improvements as completed
and to run for a period of 12 months. As a condition of accepting
the developer's offer of a maintenance bond or escrow deposit, the
Board of Supervisors shall take responsibility for the improvements
upon their completion. The form and type of maintenance guarantee
shall be approved by the Township Supervisors. [Amended 8-9-1989
by Ord. No. 907]

ARTICLE IV
Subdivision Development Standards
§ 275-15. Streets. [Amended 8-9-1989 by Ord. No. 907; 10-14-1998
by Ord. No. 954]
A. Access.
(1) The street layout shall provide access to all lots and parcels of land
within the subdivision. Where streets cross other streets, offsets
shall not be created. The minimum distance between center lines of
parallel or nearly parallel streets intersecting a cross street from
opposite directions shall be 150 feet. There shall be no reserve
strips controlling access to streets except where the control of such
strips is definitely placed with the Township.
(2) The arrangements of streets shall make provision for the direct
continuation of the principal existing streets in adjoining
subdivisions (or their proper projection when adjoining property is
not subdivided) insofar as they may be necessary for public
requirements. In general, such streets shall be of a width at least as
great as the existing streets, and in no case less than the minimum
requirement specified in this chapter.
(3) When the tract is subdivided into lots of an acre or more, the
Planning Commission may require an arrangement of streets such
as to permit a later subdivision in conformity with the street
requirements specified in these regulations.
(4) In general, streets shall not be laid out on the boundaries of the
tract, except where such streets are desirable for further expansion
or connection to existing streets or where a previously dedicated
half-street adjoins the tract, in which case sufficient additional
width of street shall be dedicated to make the street width conform
to the minimum requirements in this chapter.
(5) Proposed streets shall be adjusted to the contour of the land so as
to produce usable lots and streets of reasonable gradient.
B. Intersections.
(1) In general, minor streets should intersect main highways at right
angles. As far as is practicable, acute angles at intersections are to
be avoided and where a deflection angle of more than 10° in the
street line occurs at any point between two intersecting streets, a
curve of reasonably long radius shall be introduced. Intersections
of more than two streets at one point shall be avoided.
(2) All new subdivisions abutting federal or state highways shall be
arranged to provide access to such highways at intervals of not less
than 1,320 feet, except where impractical or impossible due to
existing property division or topography. All roads and streets
§ 275-15 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 275-15
1:311
within such subdivisions shall be arranged to permit access to
adjacent future subdivisions without modifying this regulation.
C. Street widths.
(1) Right-of-way widths. The minimum width for a vehicular right-ofway
shall be 50 feet measured between opposite front lot lines.
Where a property abutting or traversed by an existing road is
subdivided, the right-of-way width of the road shall be assumed to
be 50 feet for purposes of calculating setbacks within the lots
created by the subdivision and for calculating lot area. The
Township may require a sixty-five-foot right-of-way for the segment
of road providing the principal access to a very large lot plan or
development.
(2) Pavement widths. The Planning Commission may, at its option,
require street widths greater than those listed below where
alignment, topography and potential traffic indicate increased
width would be in the public interest. The Commission may also, at
its option, require curbs in certain locations where stormwater
runoff control, topography or other factors may dictate curbing
should be installed. Developers in any case shall not construct
streets with widths less than the following between curbs or
between the edges of the paved surface:
(a) Within lot plans where lot widths are at least 100 feet:
[1] Without curbs: 20 feet with six-foot stabilized berms each
side.
[2] With deck curbs and underdrains: 27 feet.
(b) Within lot plans where lot widths are predominantly less than
100 feet:
[1] With deck curbs and underdrains: 27 feet.
[2] Where a plan is extended, the streets in the extension shall
continue the street design contained in the original plan.
(c) Within commercial or industrial developments or multiplefamily
residential developments:
[1] With or without deck curbs and underdrains: 34 feet.
[2] Deck curbs and underdrains may be required, at the
Planning Commission's option, in commercial or industrial
developments.
(d) Street and curb construction and other roadway improvements
shall comply with the minimum standards established in
Attachment 2 of this chapter, and said road construction
standards set forth in Attachment 263 may be amended in the
§ 275-15 WHITE CODE § 275-15
1:312
future from time to time by resolution of the White Township
Board of Supervisors. [Amended 12-22-2004 by Ord. No.
1001]
D. Street alignment.
(1) Streets shall be laid out so that there will be unobstructed sight
distances along the center lines, measured three feet above the
grade line, to permit horizontal visibility of at least 150 feet at any
point.
(2) Minor streets intersecting a major highway shall be separated by at
least 800 feet between center lines. Within a lot plan two streets
intersecting or crossing a third street shall be separated by at least
300 feet, or 150 feet if entering from opposite sides of the third
street. The angle of intersection shall be as nearly 90° as possible,
but shall not in any case be less than 70° or more than 110°.
E. Street grades.
(1) Center line grades shall not exceed 10%.
(2) Vertical curves shall be used at changes of grade exceeding 1% and
shall be not less than 100 feet in arc length.
(3) The minimum grade along a street center line shall be not less than
1/2%.
(4) Where street grades at intersections exceed 7%, a leveling area
shall be provided so that within a distance of 50 feet of the right-ofway
line of the intersected street a grade of not more than 4% shall
be created.
(5) A clear sight distance of at least 150 feet in each direction shall be
provided motorists entering an intersection. The sight distance
shall be measured three feet above the finished pavement 15 feet
back from the edge of the intersected street pavement. Vegetation
and embankments impeding the sight lines shall be cut back.
F. Alleys. Alleys will not be approved in residential districts, but may be
required where applicable in business districts.
G. Cul-de-sac streets.
(1) Streets designed to have one end closed, whether permanently or
not, shall generally not exceed 1,000 feet in length and shall be
equipped at the closed end with a vehicular turnaround not less
than 80 feet in diameter outer edge, so as to provide a continuous
paved surface at least 20 feet wide all around and surrounded by a
utility easement having an outside diameter of not less than 100
63.Editor's Note: Attachment 2, Road Construction Standards, is included as an attachment
to this chapter.
§ 275-15 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 275-15
1:313
feet. The center of the circle may be paved or covered with a low
maintenance crushed limestone surface or equivalent.
(2) The length of a cul-de-sac street shall be measured from the center
line of the through street that the open end intersects to the center
point of the closed circular end. A through street shall mean a
street that connects to other streets at each end.
(3) The length of a cul-de-sac street may be increased if a modification
is granted by the Planning Commission based on topographical
conditions or other hardship not of the property owner's making.
The potential future connection of a cul-de-sac to streets or future
streets in adjacent plans or properties shall be considered in the
decision.
(4) The number of single-family detached dwelling lots abutting only
the same street or street system having one only entrance to a
through street shall not exceed 50 or in the case of attached
dwellings, multifamily buildings or projects with a mix of dwelling
types, 62 dwelling units.
H. Private roads. Private roads may be permitted only when they serve not
more than two separate properties that have no other feasible access to
a public road, not counting the original tract from which the two
properties were subdivided. Private roads shall be within an easement
at least 25 feet in width. Exceptions may be permitted where
topography or peculiar property shape indicate no other alternative
solution to access than a private road. If the original tract is to be
further divided into more than three parcels, the owner shall provide,
and have approved, a plan for the entire tract.
I. Private streets in a development plan. The Planning Commission may
approve a plan containing a private street or streets if the following
conditions can be met:
(1) The developer shall state on the recorded plan that the street or
streets are private and that the Township has no interest or
obligation in their maintenance.
(2) The plan shall state that the street abutting each lot to be sold in
the plan is private, and the deed for each lot shall indicate that fact
also. Any utility easements within a private street shall be clearly
marked on the plan and identified as to width and use.
(3) A private street shall be permanently marked as private at its
intersection with a public road.
(4) A building on a lot abutting a private street shall be set back at
least 50 feet from the street center line. All private streets shall be
in a right-of-way of not less than 50 feet although the width and
surfacing of the street is left to the developer's discretion.

§ 275-16. Blocks.
§ 275-17. Lots. [Amended 5-8-1985 by Ord. No. 892; 8-9-1989 by
Ord. No. 907; 5-27-1992 by Ord. No. 917; 10-14-1998 by Ord. No.
954]
(5) The right of passage over the private street or streets for the
maintenance of public utilities or for access of emergency vehicles
shall be guaranteed in writing to each utility and emergency
service involved. The developer shall file with the Township a letter
granting such right of passage.
(6) An association shall be established by the developer for the
perpetual maintenance of the street or streets in the plan at no cost
to the Township, such association made up of all the owners of
property in the plan, each to share equally in the expenses of the
association.
(7) The bylaws of the association shall be approved by the Township
Solicitor, prior to recording of the plan, to guarantee protection of
the plan residents and the Township.
(8) If at a future time the lot owners petition the Township to adopt the
street or streets as a public street or streets, they, at their expense,
shall widen, reconstruct or otherwise improve the street or streets
to meet the Township road specifications current at the time, and
shall have completed the work to the Township's satisfaction prior
to adoption of the street or streets by the Township Board of
Supervisors.
A. Length. Residential blocks shall ordinarily not exceed 1,200 feet in
length, and commercial blocks 600 feet, except for unit shopping
centers. Where a residential block exceeds 1,200 feet in length, a
pedestrian right-of-way shall be provided approximately in the center of
the block except where impaired by the natural terrain.
B. Width. Blocks shall be of sufficient width to permit two tier of lots of
appropriate depth, except where an interior street parallels a limited
access highway or major traffic street, or except where it backs up to a
railroad, creek, or other natural terrain.
A. Depth. The minimum depth of lots shall be 120 feet. No lots with double
frontage (through lots) shall be plotted. Each lot shall front on a road or
street dedicated for public use, except as provided by § 275-15H.
B. Side yards. Side yards shall be required. The combined side yards of a
lot shall be a minimum 25% of the lot width, and in no case shall the
vertical wall of a building be closer than seven feet to a side lot line.
Roof overhangs may extend to four feet of the lot line.
C. Arrangement. On all lots, so far as is practical, the side lot lines shall be
at right angles to straight street lines or radial to curved street lines.
§ 275-15 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 275-17
1:315
D. Setback lines.
(1) Building setback lines shall be established on all lots. On lots
abutting the intersection of two streets, the setback from each
street shall be at least that required for the state or local street
abutting the lot.
(2) On residential lots a setback from the rear property line of not less
than 25 feet for principal buildings shall be established. On all
other lots, and in the case of accessory structures on residential
lots, a rear setback of not less than seven feet shall be established.
(3) Where a lot abuts a Township-maintained road or one that may
ultimately become a Township road, the setback line shall be
established 25 feet from the street right-of-way line or 50 feet from
the center line of the abutting Township road, whichever is greater.
(4) Where a lot abuts a federal or state maintained road, the setback
line shall be established 75 feet from the center line of the abutting
road.
(5) When existing lots of record containing less area and/or having less
lot frontage than required by Subsection E are proposed for
development, the following rules shall apply:
(a) On lots, except corner lots, less than 56 feet wide along the
front building line, side yard setbacks of not less than seven
feet each side of the lot shall be maintained.
(b) On corner lots with less than 44 feet of width along the front
building line, the side yard abutting the adjacent lot shall be
not less than seven feet and the opposite side yard abutting the
street shall be not less than seven feet, increasing by one foot
for each additional foot of lot width between 44 feet and 62
feet, when the side yard abutting the street will be 25 feet.
(c) All new buildings or additions to existing buildings shall be set
back at least 25 feet from the street right-of-way line on which
the lots containing such buildings front, or 50 feet from the
street center line, whichever is greater, regardless of the area
or width of the lots or setback of buildings on neighboring lots.
(6) On a lot with irregular lot lines (several tangents and/or arcs), the
setback lines shall be always parallel with such irregular lot lines
and separated from the adjacent property lines by the minimum
distances required by this section.
E. Lot width and area.
(1) Lots served by both public sewer and water systems or by
community sewer and water systems, acceptable to the state
agency having jurisdiction, or a combination of systems: 7,200
square feet of lot area and a lot width of 60 feet.
§ 275-17 WHITE CODE § 275-17
1:316
§ 275-18. Other considerations.
(2) Lots served by either a public sewer or public water system or by
either a community sewer or water system, acceptable to the state
agency having jurisdiction: 20,000 square feet of lot area and a lot
width of 100 feet.
(3) Lots not served by public sewer: 1.25 acres (54,450 square feet) of
lot area and a lot width of 150 feet. [Amended 6-24-2015 by Ord.
No. 1066]
(4) The final determination of the minimum size of any lot supporting
an on-lot disposal system shall be made by the Sewage
Enforcement Officer. [Amended 6-24-2015 by Ord. No. 1066]
(5) Lot width exceptions.
(a) Lot width shall be measured along the front building line.
However, no lot shall have less than 50 feet of frontage on a
public road, except for lots of less than 10,000 square feet in
the area abutting the closed end of a cul-de-sac, when the
minimum frontage shall be 30 feet.
(b) On pie-shaped lots, the front setback line may be established
behind the normal setback depth to provide sufficient width for
the building proposed on the lot and seven-foot side yard
setbacks each side as long as the rear yard setback of 25 feet is
not compromised.
F. Lot occupancy.
(1) On any lot to be occupied by dwelling units, only one building
containing a dwelling or dwellings shall be permitted, except in the
following situations.
(2) In a multifamily residential development as many apartment or
townhouse dwelling units are permitted by this article may be
placed on one property, but single-family dwellings and two-family
dwellings shall be on their own lots abutting public streets.
(3) Additional single-family or two-family dwellings may be placed on a
lot already occupied by a single-family or two-family dwelling,
provided the additional dwellings are located so that later
subdivision of the property will allow each dwelling to occupy a
separate lot meeting at least the minimum applicable lot area,
width and setback requirements without the need for a variance,
and provided each lot will abut a public or private street.
A. Easements. Where alleys are not provided, easements not less than
eight feet in width shall be provided on each side of all rear lot lines as
necessary for public utilities. Easements of greater width may be
required along lot lines or across lots where necessary for sewer mains,
§ 275-17 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 275-18
1:317
stormwater sewers, drainage ditches, watercourses and similar
conditions.
B. Natural features. The developer shall plan the subdivision or
development plan to preserve the natural features of the site.
C. Public sites designated by Comprehensive Plan. The Planning
Commission may require the developer to dedicate to the Township,
School District, Recreation and Park Commission or County any portion
of his property indicated in the Township or County Comprehensive
Plan as the future location of a park, playground, school, or other public
use. However, the appropriate public body shall complete acquisition of
the property before final approval of the developer's plan or within 30
days, whichever is later. The developer may disregard the Commission's
requirement if the public body fails to complete acquisition within the
one-year limit unless the developer and public body have gone to
arbitration to determine a settlement on the property.
D. Dedication of open and community space. The Planning Commission
may require a developer to dedicate a part or parts of his plan as open
space or for community use, and shall require the developer to note
such areas on his plan as "permanent open space" or other specific
purpose, described by bearings and distances. Such areas as
floodplains, exceptionally wet ground, steep slopes or heavily wooded
land may be included in the common open space, but in a large
residential plan, land for a park or playground or other community use
may be included at the Commission's discretion. The developer shall
offer to dedicate the open space to the Township. In the event the
Township does not agree to accept the offer, the developer shall retain
ownership of the open space areas until he sells properties in the plan.
At that point he shall establish a home owners' association responsible
for taxes, insurance and maintenance of the open and/or community
space. Each property owner in the plan shall be required to be a
member of the association. The form and content of the bylaws of the
association shall be approved by the Township Solicitor prior to their
recording with the final plan. Each piece of common and/or community
land shall have access, either directly or by easement, to a public street.
E. Freestanding structures. Land development plans subject to this
section shall illustrate the location of all freestanding structures upon
the plan submittal. The following subsections must be complied with
pursuant to the land development process to ensure adequate sight
distance, access to light and air, and minimal uniform standards for
proposed improvements. Billboard signs are considered freestanding
structures and shall comply with the requirements of Subsection F
below. [Added 10-10-2007 by Ord. No. 1026; amended 6-24-2015
by Ord. No. 1066; 1-18-2016 by Ord. No. 1073]
(1) The site development plan shall show precisely the location of all
freestanding structures relative to the location of ingress/egress
§ 275-18 WHITE CODE § 275-18
1:318
areas, buildings, parking, rights-of-way, utility easements, and
neighboring property lines.
(2) To protect neighboring properties' access to light and air, as well as
ensuring safe vehicular sight distances, all freestanding structures
that are not buildings shall be set back from public rights-of-way
and utility easements adjacent to public rights-of-way, by at least 10
feet, plus one foot for every foot of height over four feet. No part of
a freestanding structure, regardless of its height, may block any
vehicular line of sight consistent with street alignment standards of
this chapter. To prevent interference with overhead utility lines or
traffic controls, as well as preventing access to light and air, no
freestanding structure shall be erected pursuant to this section in
excess of 35 feet in height, except as specifically provided for under
Subsection E(6)(a)[1], (b), (c) and § 275-35J(6) relative to
communications towers.
(3) No portion of a freestanding structure pursuant to this section may
be located within 50 feet of a neighboring dwelling unit.
(4) No part of a freestanding structure, regardless of its height, may
block any vehicular line of sight consistent with street alignment
standards of this chapter.
(5) All lighting associated with freestanding structures shall be aimed,
located, designed, fitted and maintained so as not to present a
hazard to drivers or pedestrians by impairing their ability to safely
traverse and so as not to create a nuisance by projecting or
reflecting objectionable light onto a neighboring use or property, or
onto any public or private roadway or pedestrian way. Directional
fixtures, such as floodlights and spotlights, shall be so shielded,
installed and aimed that they do not project their output into the
windows of neighboring residences, adjacent uses, past the face of
the sign, skyward or onto a public roadway or pedestrian way.
Cutoff fixtures are to be employed as feasible.
(6) Freestanding structure height, setbacks and buffer yards.
(a) Allowable height increases:
[1] Nonhabitable structures limited to silos, smoke stacks,
and exterior conveyors, standpipes, church spires,
stadium/sporting event lights and elevated water tanks
may increase height above 35 feet provided that the
setback from all property lines and public rights-of-way is
increased to 10 feet plus one foot for every foot in
structure height. If such nonhabitable structure is
attached to a building, the height increase shall entail not
more than 15% of the total roof area of the building.
(b) Maximum building height may increase to 50 feet provided
that the following setbacks and buffer yard requirements are
§ 275-18 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 275-18
1:319
met. All buildings shall comply with the following setbacks
as they uniformly relate to site context and the type of land
development.

(c) Occupied buildings in a multibuilding land development
containing at least four nonresidential buildings may increase
height to a maximum of 70 feet provided that setback increases
of one foot for each foot in building height from any property
line containing a residential building are provided plus an
additional ten-foot buffer yard is installed along any such
property line. Such buildings shall be allowed only as part of a
planned campus or other unified development that ensures
adequate light, air and emergency access, and has uniform
internal street systems, parking, pedestrian interconnections,
and landscaping between four or more buildings.
(d) Buffer yard requirements. No structure is permitted within any
required buffer yard, except for fences for screening and
decorative purposes, or essential service utility structures
limited to electrical, natural gas, sewer, water, and cable/
internet/telecommunications for the lot being served. Buffer
strips shall not be used for parking, storage of vehicles,
equipment, or materials, nor for any other use incompatible
with their purpose as a visual, noise, dust, and pollution
barrier. The ten-foot buffer strip shall contain suitable
screening, defined as either of the following:
[1] A solid fence or wall, architecturally compatible with
existing structures in the area, no less than five feet nor
more than eight feet in height; or
[2] A sight-obscuring planting of evergreens, not less than
four feet in height at the time of planting and of a variety
that will maintain full, dense growth from the ground up to
a height of not less than six feet upon maturity, planted at a
spacing of the lesser of four feet or the diameter of a
mature specimen of the species being planted.
(e) Five-foot buffer strips and areas of the ten-foot buffer strip not
covered with a fence, wall, or screening plantings, shall be
planted with grass or other appropriate ground cover
vegetation, or mulched to prevent weed growth. Installation
and maintenance of the buffer and screening shall be the
responsibility of the owner of the property on which the land
development is located. Installation must be completed prior to
issuance of a certificate of occupancy. Fences or walls must be
maintained in safe and structurally sound condition. Dead or
diseased plants shall be removed and replaced within six
months.
(7) In all cases of height increase above 35 feet, the Planning
Commission may refer applications to applicable fire and
emergency service providers to ensure that the design does not
create a hazard. Applications may also be referred to the Indiana
County Office of Planning and Development for compliance with
§ 275-18 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 275-18
1:321
airport hazard regulations. The Commission may require
documentation that no hazard exists to airspace including Federal
Aviation Administration Part 77 certification, FAA approval and
consent of any established airport or helicopter landing site.
F. Billboard signs. Billboard signs are considered a type of freestanding
structure and are subject to this chapter as a division or allocation of
space pursuant to land development and/or a subdivision by lease.
Billboard signs shall comply with the following: [Added 10-10-2007
by Ord. No. 1026]
(1) A plan shall be prepared to show the site, described by bearings
and distances, within the property from which the site will be
leased and dimensions to the nearest boundary line of the property
from the sign. In addition, a scaled site development plan shall be
prepared to show precisely the location of the billboard structure
relative to the lease site, ground level support structures, sign
surface dimensions, access to the site and parking area, and any
other structures within the lease area or within 100 feet of the
lease area.
(2) No other structure shall be permitted within the leased property.
(3) To protect neighboring properties' access to light and air, and to
avoid interference with overhead utility lines or traffic controls, no
billboard shall exceed 35 feet in height. The distance in any
direction from the base of the sign to the boundaries of the lease
area shall be no less than the height of the billboard structure, and
no portion of the billboard sign shall be within 20 feet of any
portion of the lease area boundary or any public right-of-way or
utility easement.
(4) One parking space, together with adequate right-of-way to access
the parking space from a public road, shall be provided for a
maintenance vehicle within the lease area. The size of this space
shall be consistent with § 275-35D(2).
(5) No portion of the billboard sign structure may be within 100 feet of
a dwelling unit.
(6) No part of the sign structure may block any vehicular line of sight
consistent with street alignment standards of this chapter.
(7) All lighting related to a billboard structure shall be aimed, located,
designed, fitted and maintained so as not to present a hazard to
drivers or pedestrians by impairing their ability to safely traverse
and so as not to create a nuisance by projecting or reflecting
objectionable light onto a neighboring use or property or onto a
public roadway of pedestrianway. Directional fixtures, such as
floodlights and spotlights, shall be so shielded, installed and aimed
that they do not project their output into the windows of
neighboring residences, adjacent uses, past the face of the sign,
§ 275-18 WHITE CODE § 275-18
1:322
skyward or onto a public roadway or pedestrianway. Cutoff fixtures
are to be employed as feasible.
(8) Only one billboard sign or freestanding sign structure shall be
permitted per leased property.

ARTICLE V
Minimum Public Improvements
§ 275-19. Requirements.
The subdivider shall, at his own expense, provide the following public
improvements which shall meet the minimum design standards of this
chapter, and shall be shown on his final subdivision plan.
§ 275-20. Monuments and markers.
§ 275-21. Street improvements.
A. Type. Monuments shall be of concrete or stone with a minimum size of
four inches by 36 inches long, and shall be marked on top with a onehalf-
inch round brass pin, or a drilled hole. Markers shall consist of iron
pipes or iron or steel bars at least 24 inches long, and not less than 1/2
inch in diameter.
B. Placement. Monuments and markers shall be placed so that the scored
or marked point shall coincide exactly with the intersection of lines to
be marked, and shall be set so that the top of the monument or marker
is level with the surface of the surrounding ground. Monuments shall be
set at the intersection of all lines forming angles in the boundary of the
subdivision, at points where street right-of-way lines cross a boundary
and at points of intersection of streets within the subdivision. Markers
shall be set:
(1) At the beginning and ending of all curves along street property
lines.
(2) At all points where lot lines intersect curves, either front or rear.
(3) At all angles in property lines of lots.
(4) At all other lot corners.
C. Replacement. Any monuments or markers that are removed shall be
replaced by a registered engineer or surveyor, at the developer's
expense, until such time as the developer's involvement in the
subdivision ceases.
A. Minimum paving requirements. Streets shall be graded, surfaced and
improved to the grades and dimensions shown on plans, profiles and
cross sections submitted by the subdivider and approved by the Board
of Supervisors after receiving recommendations from the Planning
Commission.
(1) A private road (see § 275-15H) connecting to a public road will not
be subject to the street specifications.
(2) Where an approved plan contains not more than six lots each at
least 30,000 square feet in area, and none attached to public sewer
§ 275-19 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 275-21
1:325
or water systems, the street abutting each lot, if not an existing
public street, shall be within a fifty-foot right-of-way but only a
base course not less than 20 feet in width built to meet the street
specifications need be provided. The Township, however, will have
no maintenance responsibilities on the street until or unless it is
paved to the street specifications.
(3) Where an approved plan of not more than six lots with an unpaved
street developed as permitted by Subsection A(2) (above) is
extended to more than six lots, the developer shall pave in
accordance with the street specifications, the portion of the street
serving the original plan as well as the portion serving the
extension. In the event that a second developer extends the plan,
the owners of the lots in the original plan shall share
proportionately the cost of paving the portion of the street serving
their plan as well as the installation of stabilized berms six feet
wide each side. The deeds conveying each of the lots in the original
plan shall indicate the purchaser's obligation or that of his
successor in this matter. In no case shall more than one plan served
by an unpaved street be permitted on a property existing as of
January 1, 1979.
B. Other improvements. The Township may require a heavier pavement
and subbase than stipulated by the Township street specifications if a
proposed street will function as the main access to a large residential
development or if the street will serve a commercial or industrial plan.
(1) Subsurface drainage. Prior to placing the street surface, adequate
subsurface drainage and all subsurface utilities shall be provided
or installed by the developer. The size of the stormwater drainage
structures shall be computed by using Talbot's formula for runoff.
(2) Slopes. Slopes of banks measured perpendicular to the center line
of the street shall not exceed 3:1 for fills, and 2:1 for cuts.
(3) In all respects in which standards for required improvements are
not set forth in these regulations, the applicable standard
requirements of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation
shall govern, and all work shall be performed in the manner
prescribed in the standard specifications of that Department for the
type of construction under consideration.
C. Approval, maintenance and security.
(1) The work of constructing streets or roads, including the methods
and materials incident thereto, shall be subject to the approval of
the Township Engineer. Final acceptance of the completed streets
or roads shall rest with the Board of Supervisors. The developer
shall enter into a contract with the Board which provides that in
consideration of the acceptance of the roads or streets for inclusion
in the Township highway system, the developer agrees to construct
the roads or streets in the subdivision or development to the
§ 275-21 WHITE CODE § 275-21
1:326
standards prescribed herein at his own expense with no cost to the
Township.
(2) In the event that the developer or subdivider desires to complete
the construction of the streets after the plan is placed on record, he
shall be required to submit a cost estimate prepared by a
registered professional engineer, setting forth all items of work to
be performed and the estimated cost. Said estimate shall be subject
to the approval of the Township Engineer. A certified check or
contract performance bond issued by a surety company, subject to
the approval of the Board of Township Supervisors, in an amount
equal to the approved estimate to insure the completion of the
work, shall be filed with the Board of Township Supervisors. All
construction items shall be completed within one year after the
plan is placed on record, except where bituminous paving
construction is required. When bituminous construction is
required, it shall be completed within two years after the plan is
placed on record.
(3) The certified check shall be made payable to the Township. In the
event the work is satisfactorily completed within the time specified,
the certified check or surety bond shall be returned.
(4) The developer or subdivider shall be required to maintain all
culverts, ditches, backslopes, and shoulders until the Township
takes over the street.
D. Traffic safety improvements. Developers shall comply with the
following standards and procedures regarding the need to install traffic
safety improvements in order to provide adequate and safe access and
egress to subdivisions and land developments, said improvements to be
properly installed and fully operational prior to occupancy of the
subdivision and/or land development: [Added 10-10-2007 by Ord.
No. 1026]
(1) Traffic impact studies. The White Township Planning Commission
may include in their review process the requirement for developers
to provide a traffic impact study completed by a registered
professional engineer in order to analyze the impact that a
proposed subdivision or land development may have on traffic
access points and on adjoining public roadways. Traffic impact
studies shall be completed in accordance with the standards
established by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation and
the Institute of Transportation Engineers, as best applicable to the
Township or state road being impacted. Developers shall be
responsible to pay for the cost of completing the study and any
engineering/professional consultant review costs incurred by the
Township in reviewing the traffic impact study, all in accordance
with the requirements of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning
Code, Article V, Subdivision and Land Development and § 275-71,
Fees, of this chapter. The applicant shall provide the appropriate
§ 275-21 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 275-21
1:327
escrow to ensure the payment of the Township's costs of such
traffic study review. If the traffic study concludes that traffic
improvements are necessary, the Township shall require such onsite
traffic improvements to be provided by the applicant as the
Township deems appropriate. The study shall identify
improvements/facilities to be installed or actions to be undertaken
by the applicant.
(2) High traffic roadways.
(a) The following roadways within White Township are identified
as arterial or collector roads where significant development
has occurred, or will occur, and which are considered high
traffic areas:
[1] Philadelphia Street West, from Borough line to Barclay
Road.
[2] Warren Road, from Route 286 to Barclay Road.
[3] Oakland Avenue, from Borough line to Hilltop Road.
[4] Ben Franklin Road, from Route 286 to Fleming Road.
[5] Indian Springs Road, from Route 286 to Route 954.
[6] Wayne Avenue, from Borough line to Old Route 119.
[7] South Sixth Street, from Borough line south to Township
line.
[8] Route 286 East, from Borough line to Musser Road.
[9] East Pike Road, from Route 286 to Ramsey Run Road.
[10] North Fourth Street, from Borough line to Hamill Road.
[11] Shelly Drive, from Philadelphia Street West to Ben
Franklin Road.
[12] Plaza Road, from Route 286 to terminus.
[13] Rustic Lodge Road, from Route 286 to Simpson Road.
[14] Rose Street, from Route 286 to Wayne Avenue.
[15] South 13th Street, from Borough line to Rose Street.
[16] Lucerne Road, from Route 954 to Township line.
[17] Ferguson Road, from Route 954 to Township boundary.
[18] Barclay Road, from Warren Road to Philadelphia Street
West.
§ 275-21 WHITE CODE § 275-21
1:328
(b) While the above-listed roadways are considered high traffic
roadways that exhibit traffic safety and capacity concerns, the
White Township Planning Commission shall have the discretion
to apply requirements of this section to any subdivision or land
development located along any roadway in White Township
where it is felt that a traffic safety or capacity issue may result
from a proposed subdivision or land development.
(3) Coordination of access points. Where proposed access points (new
parking lot entries, driveways, intersecting roads, intersecting
local streets, etc.) connect to a high traffic roadway that already
has access points located on the opposite side of the high traffic
roadway, the proposed access points shall be coordinated to
directly coincide with the existing access points, as approved by
the Planning Commission. Off-set intersections may be permitted
as a traffic calming measure within the local internal road network
of a subdivision, provided no intersection meets a collector road or
identified high traffic roadway.
(4) Turn lanes.
(a) New access points (parking lot entries, driveways, intersecting
roads, intersecting local streets, etc.) shall provide turning
lanes along high traffic roadways based upon anticipated
average daily traffic (ADT), as follows:
ADT Turn Lanes Required
Less than 100
vehicles
None required
100 to 500 vehicles One turning lane required, the direction
of which shall be based upon principal
anticipated flow direction, normally this
would be towards the next intersection
with a higher traffic count
500 or more
vehicles
Turn lanes as warranted by Township
Engineer
(b) Turning lane(s) may also be required to mitigate level of
service deficiencies as identified in a traffic impact study, as
required by the Township, or to fulfill a recommendation of an
existing traffic impact study or official traffic study, including,
but not limited to, the "Indiana Area Multi-Modal Mobility
Study."
(5) Traffic control devices. The developer shall submit an estimate of
peak hour trips, based upon the Institute of Transportation
Engineers (ITE) standard land use classifications. For any
subdivision or land development estimated to generate more than
five peak hour exiting trips, and in the event of a signal warrant
study conducted within 10 years of the date of approval of a final
§ 275-21 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 275-21
1:329
§ 275-22. Sanitary sewage disposal.
subdivision or land development plan, the developer shall agree
in writing (developer's agreement) to pay a proportionate share of
costs for any traffic control device that abuts his access point(s).
Said proportionate share shall be established at the time the signal
warrant study is conducted that establishes the need to erect a
signal or other traffic control device. Cost sharing for this traffic
control device would be based upon peak hour exiting trips,
expressed as a proportionate share of the signal warrant threshold.
This would typically be between 70 and 100 peak hour exiting trips.
The proportionate cost share for a traffic control device shall be
identified by the Township, and shall become a part of a developer's
agreement that shall be properly signed by the developer and
forwarded to the Township for review and approval as to both form
and substance. The developer's agreement shall be recorded at the
Indiana County Courthouse prior to the subdivision and/or land
development receiving final approval.
(6) Access management alternatives. To preserve capacity and traffic
flow within high traffic areas, the developer may have the option of
preparing a coordinated access management plan in lieu of
entering into a developer's agreement. This plan should show the
ultimate build out of properties that would share an access point,
consistent with this chapter, an estimate of peak hour trips, and
how the proposed coordinated access management plan would use
such techniques as deceleration lanes, jug handles, turning lanes
and other techniques to manage traffic and preserve road capacity.
The plan shall include shared access agreements and cost share
agreements between all present and future developers. This plan
shall be prepared by a qualified transportation engineer pursuant
to PA Department of Transportation Model Access Management
standards or the Institute of Transportation Engineers standards.
The Township may utilize its own professional consultants to
review such plan consistent with § 503 of the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code and this chapter.
A. Every structure in any subdivision, development plan or mobile home
park connected to a water supply shall be connected to a sanitary
sewage disposal system, either on-lot approved by the Township
Sewage Enforcement Officer, or a private, public or community system
approved by the state agency having jurisdiction.
B. Connection to the public system shall be in accordance with the rules of
the White Township Municipal Authority.
C. On-lot disposal systems shall not be backfilled until approved by the
Sewage Enforcement Officer.
D. No stormwater sewers, footer drains or downspouts shall be connected
to any sanitary sewage disposal system.
§ 275-21 WHITE CODE § 275-22

all other cases grades shall be not greater than one-foot vertical
rise to each two feet of horizontal run unless the developer can
provide an engineering report prepared and signed by a registered
professional engineer indicating steeper grades, up to a maximum
grade recommended by the engineer, will provide permanently
stable ground surfaces considering the soils involved.
(3) Fill slopes shall be keyed into previously undisturbed earth and
built up in layers not to exceed eight inches in depth. The toes and
tops of slopes shall be drained to a stormwater sewer or recognized
drainageway.
(4) Graded slopes shall be planted immediately upon completion with a
fast-catching vegetative cover. During construction and until cover
is established proper erosion control measures shall be practiced
as recommended by the Indiana County Soil Conservation Service.
H. Recreation. In any planned multifamily residential development
containing dwellings with two or more bedrooms, an area equal to at
least 50 square feet for each two-bedroom unit and at least 100 square
feet for each three-bedroom or larger unit shall be set aside by the
developer for recreational purposes only if such area aggregates to at
least 500 square feet. Such area may be an equipped recreation room
or rooms in one or more of the residential buildings, or an exterior
space or spaces on level ground equipped and maintained for the use of
the residents, or a combination of these. If the developer's interest, or
that of a successor owner ceases, the recreation areas shall pass to a
homeowners' association for maintenance.
I. Commencement of construction. Starting on the date of final approval
of any multifamily residential development, the developer shall
commence construction within five years and continue in a timely
manner. Failure of the developer to start work and/or to move diligently
towards completion within this time limit shall render the original
approval null and void. The developer may reapply for final approval
after the time limit has expired but his project shall be subject to any
amendments to this chapter that may have been adopted in the
meantime.
A. Vehicular access into the site and traffic flow on adjacent properties:
(1) Location of access points relative to maximum sight distances for

protect adjacent properties.
(3) Amount of disturbance to existing land surface to be created by the
development.
A. If a developer proposes to sell any or all the dwellings in his plan
individually, he shall establish a homeowners' association, membership
in which shall be a condition of purchasing a dwelling unit. Membership
shall pass from each dwelling owner to each successor owner. The
owner of each dwelling unit shall be entitled to one vote for acting on
association affairs. The text of the bylaws establishing and governing
the association shall be reviewed and found acceptable by the Township
Solicitor as providing adequate safeguards for the Township and for the
plan residents.
B. All land in the plan that is not sold to individual dwelling owners or is
not developed for dwelling buildings and supporting facilities to be
retained by the developer and his successors, shall be recorded as
common open space with its area, and bearings and distances of its
perimeter noted on the recording plan. The developer shall be
responsible for maintenance of the common open space until and unless
he or a successor liquidates his interest by sale of the remaining
dwelling units. In that case the common open space shall be deeded to
the homeowners' association, which shall assume the responsibilities
that were formerly the developer's or his successor's. Until then the
association shall be responsible for a prorated share of the maintenance

for persons who require assistance with normal living functions but are
otherwise ambulatory (a personal care home), for persons who are
moving from institutional to independent living (a transitional dwelling)
or persons who require continuous medical supervision and are mostly
bed ridden (a nursing home).
B. Such facilities shall require approval by the Planning Commission prior
to establishing the use or commencement of any construction or
renovation. A condition of approval shall be the submission of
applications by the operator to the appropriate state agencies. Any
proposed transitional dwelling shall, in addition, provide proof that it is
a responsible organization as evidenced by references from supporting
agencies.
C. The operator shall provide a site plan of the facility showing buildings,
vehicular access, parking areas and signs on the site. At least one

tower or other elevated location, such as a church steeple,
chimney, stack, water tower or similar place. If he proves that
all existing towers and elevated locations within two miles of
his proposed site are not adequate or available, the
Commission may grant permission to erect the tower in
conformance with this section. Reasons for approval shall be
that there is no existing location that can support the weight of
the equipment, that there is no adequate space available on
any elevated location, that the proposed equipment would
cause electronic interference with existing equipment already
in place or that all owners of elevated locations have refuse
permission, in writing, for the use of their premises.
(c) The tower and its foundations shall be designed by a registered
professional engineer who shall supervise installation.

1:385
§ 282-18. Exempt parties.
The United States, the Commonwealth, or any of their instrumentalities,
agencies or political subdivisions shall be exempt from payment of the tax
imposed by this article. The exemption of such governmental bodies shall

tax.
§ 282-19. Excluded transactions.
A. Every person who makes, executes, delivers, accepts or presents for
recording any document or in whose behalf any document is made,
executed, delivered, accepted or presented for recording shall be

person or transfer then the tax levied by the Township of White under
the authority of that Act shall during the time such duplication of the
tax exists, except as hereinafter otherwise provided, be 1/2 of the rate
and such 1/2 rate shall become effective without any action on the part
of the Township of White; provided, however, that the Township of
White and any other political subdivision which impose such tax on the
same person or transfer may agree that, instead of limiting their
respective rates to 1/2 of the rate herein provided, they will impose
respectively different rates, the total of which shall not exceed the
maximum rate permitted under the "Local Tax Enabling Act."
D. If for any reason the tax is not paid when due, interest at the rate in
effect at the time the tax is due shall be added and collected.

pursuant to acquisition by the municipality, township, school
district or county of a tax delinquent property at sheriff sale or tax
claim bureau sale.

confirms a transfer previously recorded, but which does not extend
or limit existing record legal title or interest.
(5) A transfer of division in kind for no or nominal actual consideration
of property passed by testate or intestate succession and held by
cotenants; however, if any of the parties take shares greater in
value than their undivided interest, tax is due on the excess.
(6) A transfer between husband and wife, between persons who were

was acquired by the husband and wife or husband or wife prior to

child or the spouse of such child, between brother or sister or
spouse of a brother or sister and brother or sister or the spouse of a

ordinary trust where the transfer of the same property would be
exempt if the transfer was made directly from the grantor to all of
the possible beneficiaries, whether or not such beneficiaries are
contingent or specifically named. No such exemption shall be
granted unless the recorder of deeds is presented with a copy of
the trust instrument that clearly identifies the grantor and all
possible beneficiaries.
(9) A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration from a trustee to a
beneficiary of an ordinary trust.

party where, if the agent or straw party were his principal, no tax
would be imposed under this article. Where the document by which
title is acquired by a grantee or statement of value fails to set forth

benefit of his principal, there is a rebuttal presumption that the
property is the property of the grantee in his individual capacity if
the grantee claims an exemption from taxation under this
subsection.

of a corporation or statutory division of a nonprofit corporation,

record in the name of the corporation or association where the
grantee owns stock of the corporation or an interest in the

purpose of manufacturing, fabricating, compounding,
processing, publishing, research and development,
transportation, energy conversion, energy production,
pollution control, warehousing or agriculture; and
(b) The agency or authority has the full ownership interest in the
real estate transferred.
(16) A transfer by a mortgagor to the holder of a bona fide mortgage in
default in lieu of a foreclosure or a transfer pursuant to a judicial

(17) Any transfer between religious organizations or other bodies or
persons holding title for a religious organization if such real estate
is not being or has not been used by such transferor for commercial
purposes.

§ 282-20. Documents evidencing transfer.
Except as otherwise provided in § 282-19, documents which make, confirm

corporations and associations are entities separate from their members,
partners, stockholders or shareholders.

taxes of any kind or nature heretofore levied by the Township of White.
The tax shall be no more than $52 on each person for each calendar
year, irrespective of the number of political subdivisions within which a
person maybe employed.
A. Exemption. Any person whose total earned income and net profits from
all sources within the political subdivision is less than $12,000 for any

Army Reserve, United States Navy Reserve, United States Marine
Corps Reserve, United States Coast Guard Reserve, United States
Air Force Reserve, the Pennsylvania Army National Guard or the

B. Procedure to claim exemption.
(1) A person seeking to claim an exemption from the local services tax
may annually file an exemption certificate with the Township of
White and with the person's employer affirming that the person
reasonably expects to receive earned income and net profits from
all sources within the Township of White of less than $12,000 in the
calendar year for which the exemption certificate is filed. In the
event the Township of White utilizes a tax collection officer, it shall
provide a copy of the exemption certificate to that officer. The
exemption certificate shall have attached to it a copy of all the
employee's last pay stubs or W-2 forms from employment within the
Township of White for the year prior to the fiscal year for which the
employee is requesting to be exempted from the tax. Upon receipt
of the exemption certificate and until otherwise instructed by the
Township of White, except as required by Subsection B(2) of this
section, the employer shall not withhold the tax from the person
during the calendar year or the remainder of the calendar year for
which the exemption certificate applies. Employers shall ensure
that the exemption certificate forms are readily available to
employees at all times and shall furnish each new employee with a
form at the time of hiring. The exemption certificate form shall be
the uniform form provided by the political subdivision.
(2) With respect to a person who claimed an exemption for a given
calendar year from the tax, upon notification to an employer by the
person or by the Township of White or the Collector, that the person
has received earned income and net profits from all sources within
the Township of White equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that
calendar year or that the person is otherwise ineligible for the tax
exemption for that calendar year, or upon an employer's payment to
the person of earned income within the municipality in an amount
equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that calendar year, an employer
shall withhold the local services tax from the person under
Subsection B(3) of this section.
(3) If a person who claimed an exemption for a given calendar year
from the tax becomes subject to the tax for the calendar year under
Subsection B(2) of this section, the employer shall withhold the tax
for the remainder of that calendar year. The employer shall
withhold from the person, for the first payroll period after receipt
of the notification under Subsection B(2) of this section, a lump sum
equal to the amount of tax that was not withheld from the person
due to the exemption claimed by the person under this subsection,
plus the per-payroll amount due for that first payroll period. The
§ 282-40 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 282-40
1:399
§ 282-41. Duty of employers to collect.
amount of tax withheld per payroll period for the remaining payroll
periods in that calendar year shall be the same amount withheld
for other employees who are subject to the tax. In the event the
employment of a person subject to withholding of the tax under this
clause is subsequently severed in that calendar year, the person
shall be liable for any outstanding balance of tax due, and the
Township of White may pursue collection under this article.

of this subsection that employers shall not be responsible for
investigating exemption certificates, monitoring tax exemption
eligibility or exempting any employee from the local services tax.

DCED, shall establish procedures for the processing of refund claims
for any tax paid by any person who is eligible for exemption, which
procedures shall be in accord with provisions of the general municipal
law relating to refunds of overpayments and interest on overpayments.
Refunds made within 75 days of a refund request or 75 days after the
last day the employer is required to remit the tax for the last quarter of
the calendar year, whichever is later, shall not be subject to interest. No
refunds shall be made for amounts overpaid in a calendar year that do
not exceed $1. The Township of White or the Collector shall determine
eligibility for exemption and provide refunds to exempt persons.
A. Employer charged to collect tax. Each employer within the Township of
White, as well as those employers situated outside the Township of
White but who engage in business within the Township of White, is
hereby charged with the duty of collecting the tax from each of his
employees engaged by him or performing for him within the political
subdivision and making a return and payment thereof to the Collector.
Further, each employer is hereby authorized to deduct this tax for each
employee in his or her employ, whether said employee is paid by salary,
wage or commission and whether or not all such services are performed
within the Township of White.
B. Pro rata assessment of tax. A person subject to the tax shall be assessed
by the employer a pro rata share of the tax for each payroll period in
which the person is engaging in an occupation. The pro rata share of
the tax assessed on the person for a payroll period shall be determined
by dividing the rate of the tax levied for the calendar year by the
number of payroll periods established by the employer for the calendar
year. For purposes of determining the pro rata share, an employer shall
round down the amount of the tax collected each payroll period to the
nearest 1/100 of a dollar. Collection of the tax shall be made on a
payroll-period basis for each payroll period in which the person is
engaging in an occupation, except as provided in Subsection D of this
section. For purposes of this subsection, "combined rate" shall mean
§ 282-40 WHITE CODE § 282-41
1:400
§ 282-42. Returns.
Each employer shall prepare and file a return showing a computation of the
tax on forms to be supplied to the employer by the Collector. If an employer
fails to file the return and pay the tax, whether or not the employer makes
collection thereof from the salary, wages or commissions paid by him or her
to an employee, except as provided hereafter in this article, the employer
shall be responsible for the payment of the tax in full as though the tax had
been originally levied against the employer.
§ 282-43. Dates for determining tax liability and payment.
In each tax year, each employer shall use his or her employment records to
determine the number of employees from whom such tax shall be deducted
the aggregate annual rate of the tax levied by the school district and
the municipality.
C. Limit on collection. No person shall be subject to the payment of the
local services tax by more than one political subdivision during each
payroll period.
D. Principal employer. In the case of concurrent employment, an employer
shall refrain from withholding the tax if the employee provides a recent
pay statement from a principal employer that includes the name of the
employer, the length of the payroll period and the amount of the tax
withheld and a statement from the employee that the pay statement is
from the employee's principal employer, and the employee will notify
other employers of a change in principal place of employment within
two weeks of its occurrence. The employee's statement shall be
provided on the form approved by DCED.
E. Maximum tax payment. The tax shall be no more than $52 on each
person for each calendar year, irrespective of the number of political
subdivisions within which a person maybe employed. The political
subdivision shall provide a taxpayer a receipt of payment upon request
by the taxpayer.
F. Employer nonliability. No employer shall be held liable for failure to
withhold the tax or for the payment of the withheld tax money to the
Township of White if the failure to withhold taxes arises from incorrect
information submitted by the employee as to the employee's place or
places of employment, the employee's principal office or where the
employee is principally employed. Further, an employer shall not be
liable for payment of the local services tax in an amount exceeding the
amount withheld by the employer if the employer complies with the
provisions of § 282-40B of this article and this section and remits the
amount so withheld in accordance with this article.
G. Remitting tax. Employers shall be required to remit the local services
taxes 30 days after the end of each quarter of a calendar year.
§ 282-41 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 282-43
1:401
and paid over to the Collector on or before the thirtieth day following the
end of each calendar quarter of each such tax year.
§ 282-44. Self-employed individuals.
Each self-employed individual who performs services of any type or kind
or engages in any occupation or profession within a primary place of
employment within the political subdivision shall be required to comply with
this article and pay the pro rata portion of the tax due to the Collector on or
before the 30th day following the end of each quarter.
§ 282-45. Individuals engaged in more than one occupation or
employed in more than one political subdivision.
§ 282-46. Nonresidents subject to tax.
All employers and self-employed individuals residing or having their places
of business outside of the political subdivision but who perform services
of any type or kind or engage in any occupation or profession within the
political subdivision do, by virtue thereof, agree to be bound by and subject
themselves to the provisions, penalties and regulations promulgated under
this article with the same force and effect as though they were residents of
the political subdivision. Further, any individual engaged in an occupation
within the political subdivision and an employee of a nonresidential
employer may, for the purpose of this article, be considered a self-employed
person, and in the event his or her tax is not paid, the Township of White

for the collection of this tax as hereinafter provided.
§ 282-47. Administration of tax.
A. The situs of the tax shall be the place of employment on the first day the
person becomes subject to the tax during each payroll period. In the
event a person is engaged in more than one occupation, that is,
concurrent employment, or an occupation which requires the person
working in more than one political subdivision during a payroll period,
the priority of claim to collect the local services tax shall be in the
following order:
(1) First, the political subdivision in which a person maintains his or
her principal office or is principally employed;
(2) Second, the political subdivision in which the person resides and
works if the tax is levied by that political subdivision;
(3) Third, the political subdivision in which a person is employed and
which imposes the tax nearest in miles to the person's home.
B. In case of dispute, a tax receipt of the taxing authority for that calendar
year declaring that the taxpayer has made prior payment constitutes
prima facie certification of payment to all other political subdivisions.

subject to this tax who are in his or her employment, or whoever fails or
refuses to file any return required by this article shall be guilty of a violation
and, upon conviction thereof, shall be sentenced to pay a fine of not more
A. Duties of Collector. The Collector shall be appointed by resolution of the

hereby charged and empowered, subject to municipal approval, to
prescribe, adopt and promulgate rules and regulations relating to any
matter pertaining to the administration and enforcement of this article,

have occurred. Any person aggrieved by any decision of the Collector
shall have the right to appeal consistent with the Local Taxpayers Bill of
Rights under Act 50 of 1998, locally identified as Chapter 282, Article
III, of the Code of the Township of White Township, adopted February
24, 1999, as amended.
C. Collector's right to examine records. The Collector is hereby authorized
to examine the books and payroll records of any employer in order to
verify the accuracy of any return made by an employer or, if no return
was made, to ascertain the tax due. Each employer is hereby directed
and required to give the Collector the means, facilities and opportunity
for such examination.
A. Unpaid taxes. In the event that any tax under this article remains due or
unpaid 30 days after the due dates above set forth, the Collector may
sue for the recovery of any such tax due or unpaid under this article,
together with interest and penalty.
B. Penalties and interest for nonpayment. If for any reason the tax is not
paid when due, interest at the rate of 6% on the amount of such tax
shall be calculated beginning with the due date of the tax and a penalty
of 5% shall be added to the flat rate of such tax for nonpayment thereof.
Where suit is brought for the recovery of this tax or other appropriate
remedy undertaken, the individual liable therefor shall, in addition, be
responsible and liable for the costs of collection.

tax, plus applicable penalties and interest, for calendar year 2005 and all
prior calendar years, or of an emergency and municipal services tax, plus
applicable penalties and interest, for calendar years 2006 and 2007, as the

The tax imposed by this article shall be effective on January 1, 2008, and all
calendar years thereafter unless repealed or modified by ordinance of the

occupation not within the taxing power of the political subdivision
under the Constitution of the United States and the laws of the

B. If the tax hereby imposed under the provisions of this article shall be
held by any court of competent jurisdiction to be in violation of the

affect or impair the right to impose or collect said tax or the validity of
the tax so imposed on other persons or individuals as herein provided.
