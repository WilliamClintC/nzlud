Authority
§ 220-1. Statutory authority.
The Legislature of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has, by the passage
of the Pennsylvania Flood Plain Management Act of 1978,26 delegated the
responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management
regulations to promote public health, safety, and the general welfare of its
citizenry. Therefore, the Borough Council of the Borough of Indiana does
hereby order as follows.

ARTICLE II
General Provisions
§ 220-2. Intent.
The intent of this chapter is to:
§ 220-3. Applicability.
§ 220-4. Abrogation and greater restrictions.
This chapter supersedes any other conflicting provisions that may be in
effect in identified floodplain areas. However, any other ordinance
provisions shall remain in full force and effect to the extent that those
provisions are more restrictive. If there is any conflict between any of the
provisions of this chapter, the more restrictive shall apply.
§ 220-5. Warning and disclaimer of liability.
A. Promote the general health, welfare, and safety of the community.
B. Encourage the utilization of appropriate construction practices in order
to prevent or minimize flood damage in the future.
C. Minimize danger to public health by protecting water supply and
natural drainage.
D. Reduce financial burdens imposed on the community, its governmental
units, and its residents by preventing excessive development in areas
subject to flooding.
E. Comply with federal and state floodplain management requirements.
A. It shall be unlawful for any person, partnership, business or corporation
to undertake, or cause to be undertaken, any construction or
development anywhere within the Borough of Indiana unless a permit
has been obtained from the Floodplain Administrator.
B. A permit shall not be required for minor repairs to existing buildings or
structures.
A. The degree of flood protection sought by the provisions of this chapter
is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on
accepted engineering methods of study. Larger floods may occur or
flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes, such as
ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris. This chapter does not
imply that areas outside any identified floodplain areas or that land uses
permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood
damages.
B. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the Borough of
Indiana or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that
§ 220-2 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 220-5

Floodplain Areas
§ 220-15. Identification.
§ 220-16. Description; special requirements.
The identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific areas:
A. The identified floodplain area shall be any areas of the Borough of
Indiana classified as special flood hazard areas (SFHAs) in the Flood
Insurance Study (FIS) and the accompanying Flood Insurance Rate
Maps (FIRMs) dated April 3, 2012, and issued by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or the most recent revision
thereof, including all digital data developed as part of the Flood
Insurance Study.
B. The above-referenced FIS and FIRMs, and any subsequent revisions
and amendments, are hereby adopted by the Borough of Indiana and
declared to be a part of this chapter.
A. The Floodway Area/District shall be those areas identified as floodway
on the FIRM as well as those areas which have been identified in other
available studies or sources of information for those special floodplain
areas where no floodway has been identified in the FIS. The floodway
represents the channel of a watercourse and the adjacent land areas
that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation by more than one
foot at any point.
(1) Within any floodway area, no encroachments, including fill, new
construction, substantial improvements, or other development,
shall not be permitted unless it has been demonstrated through
hydrologic and hydraulic analysis performed in accordance with
standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment
would not result in any increase in flood levels within the
community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
(2) No new construction or development shall be allowed unless a
permit is obtained from the Department of Environmental
Protection Regional Office.
B. The AE Area/District without floodway shall be those areas identified as
an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for
which base flood elevations have been provided in the FIS but no
floodway has been delineated.
(1) In AE Area/District without floodway, no new development shall be
permitted unless it can be demonstrated that the cumulative effect
of all past and projected development will not increase the base
flood elevation by more than one foot.
§ 220-15 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 220-16
1:69
§ 220-17. Changes in identification of area.
The identified floodplain area may be revised or modified by the Borough
Council where studies or information provided by a qualified agency or
person documents the need for such revision. However, prior to any such
change, approval must be obtained from FEMA. Additionally, as soon as
practicable, but not later than six months after the date such information
becomes available, a community shall notify FEMA of the changes by
submitting technical or scientific data.
§ 220-18. Boundary disputes.
Should a dispute concerning any identified floodplain boundary arise, an
initial determination shall be made by the Indiana Borough Planning

ARTICLE III
Wastes Discharged to Public Sanitary Sewerage System
§ 360-8. Purpose of sewer system; sewer connections required.
The public sanitary sewerage system is primarily intended to transport and
treat sanitary sewage from dwellings, commercial, industrial and public
establishments located in the Borough of Indiana and the Township of
White. All sanitary sewage from any residence or establishment in the
Borough of Indiana and/or the Township of White is required to be
discharged into the public sanitary sewerage system, where said public
sanitary sewer system is available to the property upon which such
residence or establishment is situated.
§ 360-9. Conditions for discharge of industrial waste.
The economy and desirability of the combined treatment and transportation
of certain industrial wastes together with sanitary sewerage is recognized.
The incompatibility of many industrial wastes to the treatment processes
employed for treating sanitary sewage is also recognized. Certain industrial
wastes may be discharged to the public sanitary sewerage system which
are determined not to be harmful to said system, nor to be of such volume
nor of such a total organic or solids loading as to impair the capacity
of the public sewerage system. No industrial wastes shall be admitted to
the public sewerage system until the Borough has issued a written permit
accepting such waste and describing the conditions under which such waste
shall be accepted and limiting the amount of such waste. The written permit
or permission to discharge such waste shall be revocable by the Borough for
changes in either the character or composition of the waste, or the volume
discharged, or for departure from the conditions specified in the permit
issued accepting such waste. It is also recognized that the transportation
and treatment of industrial wastes may add to the cost of operating and
maintaining the public sanitary sewerage system. Such additional costs
shall be borne by the person or persons receiving the benefit of such
transportation and treatment as herein provided.
§ 360-10. Authority to refuse connections.
Nothing contained herein shall limit or diminish the right of the Borough
Council to refuse connection to the public sanitary sewerage system for
deleterious industrial wastes, or to compel discontinuance of the use of
the public sanitary sewerage system for such wastes, or to require
pretreatment or regulated rate of discharge thereof in order to prevent
harmful or adverse effect upon the system.
§ 360-11. Determination of harmful industrial waste.
In general, industrial waste will be considered harmful to the public
sanitary sewerage system if it may cause any of the following damaging
effects:
§ 360-8 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 360-11

(1) Inspection.
(a) The Borough shall require to be provided and operated, at the
user's own expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection,
sampling, and flow measurement of the building sewer and/or
internal drainage systems. The monitoring facility should
normally be situated on the user's premises, but the Borough
may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue
hardship on the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the
public street or sidewalk area and located so that it will not be
obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles.
(b) There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole
or facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of
samples for analysis. The facility, sampling, and measuring
equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper
operating condition at the expense of the user.
(c) Whether constructed on public or private property, the
sampling and monitoring facilities shall be provided in
accordance with the Borough's requirements and all applicable
local construction standards and specifications. Construction
shall be completed within 90 days following written
notification by the Borough.
(2) Right to access. The Borough shall inspect the facilities of any user
to ascertain whether the purpose of this Part 2 is being met and all
requirements are being complied with. Persons or occupants of
premises where wastewater is created or discharged shall allow
the Borough or their representative ready access at all reasonable
times to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection,
sampling, records examination or in the performance of any of their
duties. The Borough, approval authority and (where the NPDES
State is the Approval Authority) EPA shall have the right to set up
on the user's property such devices as are necessary to conduct
sampling inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering
operations. Where a user has security measures in force which
would require proper identification and clearance before entry into
their premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with
their security guards so that upon presentation of suitable
identification, personnel from the Borough, approval authority and
EPA will be permitted to enter, without delay, for the purposes of
performing their specific responsibilities.
(3) Operating procedure plans. Users shall provide necessary
wastewater treatment as required to comply with this Part 2 and
shall achieve compliance with all Federal Categorical Pretreatment
Standards within the time limitations as specified by the federal
§ 360-13 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 360-13

§ 360-14. Information and data to be made public; exception.
pretreatment regulations. Any facilities required to pretreat
wastewater to a level acceptable to the Borough shall be provided,
operated, and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans
showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall
be submitted to the Borough for review, and shall be acceptable to
the Borough before construction of the facility. The review of such
plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user from
the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce
an effluent acceptable to the Borough under the provisions of this
Part 2. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or
method of operation shall be reported to and be acceptable to the
Borough prior to the user's initiation of the changes.
C. The Borough shall annually publish in the Indiana Evening Gazette a list
of the users which were not in compliance with any pretreatment
requirements or standards at least once during the 12 previous months.
The notification shall also summarize any enforcement actions taken
against the user during the same 12 months.
D. All records relating to compliance with pretreatment standards shall be
made available to officials of the EPA or approval authority upon
request.
A. Information and data on a user obtained from reports, questionnaires,
permit applications, permits and monitoring programs and from
inspections shall be available to the public or other governmental
agency without restriction unless the user specifically requests and is
able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Borough that the release
of such information would divulge information, processes or methods of
production entitled to protection as trade secrets of the user.
B. When requested by the person furnishing a report, the portions of a
report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not
be made available for inspection by the public but shall be made
available upon written request to governmental agencies for uses
relating to this Part 2, the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination
System (NPDES) Permit, state disposal system permit and/or the
pretreatment programs; provided, however, that such portions of a
report shall be available for use by the state or any state agency in
judicial review or enforcement proceedings involving the person
furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics will
not be recognized as confidential information.
C. Information accepted by the Borough as confidential shall not be
transmitted to any governmental agency or to the general public by the
Borough until and unless a ten-day notification is given to the user.

charge for the treatment of waste discharged into said system, payable
as hereinafter provided in the amounts hereinafter provided. The service
charge shall begin to accrue from and after April 1, 1973, and said owners
and users shall be jointly and severally liable for the payment of the service
charge and the penalty herein (§ 360-30) prescribed for delinquent payment
thereof.
§ 360-22. Residential service. [Amended 2-4-1986 by Ord. No. 1402;

shall be rendered to owners of the property at the address of the property
served, and shall be the responsibility of the owner. Billings may be sent to
a different address if requested in writing by the owner.
§ 360-23. Commercial housing service.
There has developed within the service area of the public sewerage system
a substantial number of dwelling units for semipermanent residents. These
dwelling units are principally due to the Indiana University of Pennsylvania
operating within the service area. All housing structures containing more
than six dwelling units shall be classed as commercial housing customers,
and shall be billed upon the basis of water consumption in accordance
with the rate schedule set forth in § 360-28 hereof. The billing unit for
each commercial housing account shall be identical with each commercial
housing unit or portion thereof served by a single water meter by the water
company for water consumption determination. The billing for service to
commercial housing customers shall be rendered to the holder of the water
account for the commercial housing unit, but the owner shall be finally
liable and responsible for payment of said billing.
§ 360-24. Commercial service.
The sewage treatment service charge for commercial units shall be billed
upon the basis of water consumption in accordance with the rate schedule
set forth in § 360-28 hereof. The billing unit for each commercial

The sewage treatment service charge to industrial customers, for treating
sanitary sewage wastes only, and not including any industrial waste arising
from or created by any processes employed by such industrial customer,
shall be based upon the equivalent employees at such industrial location.
The number of equivalent employees shall be determined by taking the total
man-hours worked at the industrial location being billed during the previous
year by all persons working at such location, or using such location as his
base of operation, and dividing these total man-hours by 2,040. The result
of this calculation shall be multiplied by the rate established by the PUC
by tariff following the Borough's application for rate change with the PUC,
to determine the quarterly service charge to the industrial customer being
billed.

(i.e., residential, commercial housing, commercial, public or industrial) the
basis of billing shall be as follows:
A. Where the entire building is served by a single water meter, the entire
building shall be billed as a commercial building in accordance with
§ 360-24 hereof.
B. Where separate water meters are provided for each customer located
within the building, each unit shall be billed separately under the
appropriate classification set forth in §§ 360-22 through 360-27 hereof.

SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESSES
GENERAL REFERENCES
Zoning  See Ch. 460.
§ 365-1. Purpose and findings.
A. Purpose.
(1) Pursuant to the authority granted in the Borough Code to prohibit
nuisances; and to promote the health, welfare, cleanliness, comfort
and, safety of the citizens of Indiana Borough; and to regulate the
time of opening and closing, and the conduct of places of public
entertainment, amusement and recreation, the Borough of Indiana
enacts this chapter to minimize and control the adverse secondary
effects of sexually oriented businesses and thereby protect the
health, safety and welfare of its citizens; protect the citizens from
increased crime; preserve the quality of life; preserve the property
values and character of surrounding neighborhoods; and deter the
spread of blight.
(2) The Borough Council has determined that licensing is a legitimate
and reasonable means of accountability to insure the operators of
sexually oriented businesses comply with reasonable regulations
and to insure that operators do not knowingly allow their
establishments to be used as places for illegal sexual activity or
solicitation.
(3) The Borough Council does not intend this chapter to suppress
speech activities protected by the First Amendment, but to enact a
content-neutral ordinance which addresses the secondary effects of
sexually oriented businesses.
B. Legislative findings. The Borough Council finds:
(1) Sexually oriented businesses have adverse secondary effects that
should be regulated to protect the public health, safety and
welfare. These secondary effects include, but are not limited to, the
spread of communicable diseases, performance of sexual acts in
public places, presence of discarded sexually oriented materials on
public and private property, sexual harassment, obscenity,
prostitution, and other illegal sexual activities, crime, and
neighborhood deterioration.76

§ 360-67 INDIANA CODE § 365-1
1:198
(2) A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to
place the burden of reasonable regulations on the owners and the
operators of the sexually oriented businesses. Further, such a
licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive
on the operators to see that their sexually oriented business is run
in a manner consistent with the health, safety and welfare of its
patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the Borough. It is
appropriate to require reasonable assurance that the licensee is
the actual operator of the sexually oriented businesses, fully in
possession and control of the premises and activities occurring
therein.
(3) Removal of doors on viewing booths and requiring sufficient
lighting on premises with viewing booths advances a substantial
governmental interest in discouraging the illegal and unsanitary
sexual activity occurring in adult theaters.
(4) Requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep
information regarding current employees and certain past
employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of
criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential
witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working at
such establishments.
(5) The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately
responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the
sexually oriented business will help limit and control the adverse
secondary effects of such businesses.
(6) It is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable
diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding
certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this
chapter is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to
such activity.
(7) The fact that an applicant for a sexually oriented business license
has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational
assumption that the applicant is likely to engage in that conduct in
contravention of this chapter.
(8) The barring of such individuals from the management of sexually
oriented businesses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to
and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually
transmitted diseases.
(9) The general welfare, health, and safety of the citizens of the
Borough will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter.
(10) Limitation of operating hours of sexually oriented businesses to
10:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m., Monday through Saturday, and closure of
such businesses on Sundays and holidays reduces the adverse
secondary effects of such businesses, including particularly, but not

ARTICLE I
General Provisions
§ 395-1. Short title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Borough of Indiana
Stormwater Management Ordinance."
§ 395-2. Statement of findings.
The governing body of the municipality finds that:
A. Inadequate management of accelerated runoff of stormwater resulting
from development throughout a watershed increases runoff volumes,
flows and velocities, contributes to erosion and sedimentation,
overtaxes the carrying capacity of streams and storm sewers, greatly
increases the cost of public facilities to carry and control stormwater,
undermines floodplain management and flood control efforts in
downstream communities, reduces groundwater recharge, threatens
public health and safety, and increases nonpoint source pollution of
water resources.
B. A comprehensive program of stormwater management (SWM),
including reasonable regulation of development and activities causing
accelerated runoff, is fundamental to the public health, safety, and
welfare and the protection of people of the commonwealth, their
resources, and the environment.
C. Stormwater is an important water resource that provides groundwater
recharge for water supplies and supports the base flow of streams.
D. Green infrastructure and LID development.
(1) The use of green infrastructure and low-impact development (LID)
are intended to address the root cause of water quality impairment
by using systems and practices which use or mimic natural
processes to:
(a) Infiltrate and recharge;
(b) Evapotranspire; and/or
(c) Harvest and use precipitation near where it falls to earth.
(2) Green infrastructure practices and LID contribute to the
restoration or maintenance of predevelopment hydrology.
E. Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to
implement a program of stormwater controls. These municipalities are
required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their
separate storm sewer systems under the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES) program.
§ 395-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 395-3
1:229
§ 395-3. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to promote health, safety, and welfare within
the municipality and its watershed by minimizing the harms and maximizing
the benefits described in § 395-2 of this chapter, through provisions
designed to:
§ 395-4. Statutory authority.
The municipality is empowered to regulate land use activities that affect
runoff by the authority of the Act of July 31, 1968, P.L. 805, No. 247, the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code,82 as amended, and/or the Act of
October 4, 1978, P.L. 864 (Act 167), 32 P.S. § 680.1, et seq., as amended, the
Stormwater Management Act.
§ 395-5. Applicability.
All regulated activities and all activities that may affect stormwater runoff,
including land development and earth disturbance activity, are subject to
regulation by this chapter.
§ 395-6. Repealer.
Any other ordinance provision(s) or regulation of the municipality
inconsistent with any of the provisions of this chapter is hereby repealed to
the extent of the inconsistency only.
A. Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including
regulations at 25 Pa. Code Chapter 93 to protect, maintain, reclaim, and
restore the existing and designated uses of the waters of this
commonwealth.
B. Preserve natural drainage systems.
C. Manage stormwater runoff close to the source, reduce runoff volumes,
and mimic predevelopment hydrology.
D. Provide procedures and performance standards for stormwater
planning and management.
E. Maintain groundwater recharge to prevent degradation of surface and
groundwater quality and to otherwise protect water resources.
F. Prevent scour and erosion of stream banks and streambeds.
G. Provide proper operation and maintenance of all stormwater best
management practices (BMPs) that are implemented within the

§ 395-3 INDIANA CODE § 395-7
1:230
§ 395-7. Severability.
If any provision of this chapter, or any subsection thereof, is found to be
illegal or invalid, such illegality or invalidity shall not affect or impair any of
the remaining provisions of this chapter, or any subsections thereunder. It
is hereby declared as the intent of the Borough that this chapter would not
have been enacted if any per se illegal or invalid provisions were included
herein. If any such provision would be found to exist, such invalid provision
would be stricken.
§ 395-8. Compatibility with other requirements.
Approvals issued and actions taken under this chapter do not relieve the
applicant of the responsibility to secure required permits or approvals for
activities regulated by any other code, law, regulation or ordinance.
§ 395-9. Erroneous permit.
Any permit or authorization issued or approved based on false, misleading
or erroneous information provided by an applicant is void without the
necessity of any proceedings for revocation. Any work undertaken or use
established pursuant to such permit or other authorization is unlawful. No
action may be taken by a board, agency or employee of the municipality
purporting to validate such a violation.
§ 395-10. Waivers.
A. If the municipality determines that any requirement under this chapter
cannot be achieved for a particular regulated activity, the municipality
may, after an evaluation of alternatives, approve measures other than
those in this chapter, subject to § 395-10B and C.
B. Waivers or modifications of the requirements of this chapter may be
approved by the municipality if enforcement will exact undue hardship
because of peculiar conditions pertaining to the land in question,
provided that the modifications will not be contrary to the public
interest and that the purpose of the chapter is preserved. Cost or
financial burden shall not be considered a hardship. Modification may
be considered if an alternative standard or approach will provide equal
or better achievement of the purpose of the chapter. A request for
modifications shall be in writing and accompany the stormwater
management site plan submission. The request shall provide the facts
on which the request is based, the provision(s) of the chapter involved
and the proposed modification.
C. No waiver or modification of any regulated stormwater activity
involving earth disturbance greater than or equal to one acre may be
granted by the municipality unless that action is approved in advance
by the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) or the delegated
county conservation district.

Sewage Enforcement Officers (as amended or replaced from time to time by
DEP).
§ 395-12 INDIANA CODE § 395-12
1:234
FLOODWAY  The channel of the watercourse and those portions of the
adjoining floodplains that are reasonably required to carry and discharge
the 100-year flood. Unless otherwise specified, the boundary of the floodway
is as indicated on maps and flood insurance studies provided by FEMA. In
an area where no FEMA maps or studies have defined the boundary of the
100-year floodway, it is assumed, absent evidence to the contrary, that the
floodway extends from the stream to 50 feet from the top of the bank of the
stream.
FOREST MANAGEMENT/TIMBER OPERATIONS  Planning and activities
necessary for the management of forestland. These include conducting

and are affected by subsurface permeability as well as surface intake rates.
Soils are classified into four HSGs (A, B, C, and D) according to their
minimum infiltration rate, which is obtained for bare soil after prolonged
wetting. The NRCS defines the four groups and provides a list of most of the
soils in the United States and their group classification. The soils in the area
of the development site may be identified from a soil survey report that can
be obtained from local NRCS offices or conservation district offices. Soils
become less pervious as the HSG varies from A to D (NRCS83).
IMPERVIOUS SURFACE (IMPERVIOUS AREA)  A surface that prevents
the infiltration of water into the ground. Impervious surfaces (or areas)
shall include, but not be limited to: roofs; additional indoor living spaces,
patios, garages, storage sheds and similar structures; and any new streets

LOW-IMPACT DEVELOPMENT (LID)  Site design approaches and smallscale
stormwater management practices that promote the use of natural
systems for infiltration, evapotranspiration, and reuse of rainwater. LID can
be applied to new development, urban retrofits, and revitalization projects.
LID utilizes design techniques that infiltrate, filter, evaporate, and store
runoff close to its source. Rather than rely on costly large-scale conveyance
and treatment systems, LID addresses stormwater through a variety of
small, cost-effective landscape features located onsite.

STORMWATER  Drainage runoff from the surface of the land resulting
from precipitation or snow or ice melt.
STORMWATER MANAGEMENT FACILITY  Any structure, natural or
human-made, that, due to its condition, design, or construction, conveys,
stores, or otherwise affects stormwater runoff. Typical stormwater
management facilities include, but are not limited to: detention and
retention basins; open channels; storm sewers; pipes; and infiltration
facilities.
STORMWATER MANAGEMENT SITE PLAN  The plan prepared by the
developer or his representative indicating how stormwater runoff will be
managed at the development site in accordance with this chapter.
"Stormwater management site plan" will be designated as "SWM site plan"
throughout this chapter.
SUBDIVISION  As defined in the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning
Code, Act of July 31, 1968, P.L. 805, No. 247.90
SURFACE WATERS OF THE COMMONWEALTH  Any and all rivers,
streams, creeks, rivulets, impoundments, ditches, watercourses, storm
sewers, lakes, dammed water, wetlands, ponds, springs, and all other bodies
or channels of conveyance of surface water, or parts thereof, whether
natural or artificial, within or on the boundaries of this commonwealth.
USDA  United States Department of Agriculture.
WATERCOURSE  A channel or conveyance of surface water, such as
a stream or creek, having defined bed and banks, whether natural or
artificial, with perennial or intermittent flow.
WATERS OF THIS COMMONWEALTH  Any and all rivers, streams,
creeks, rivulets, impoundments, ditches, watercourses, storm sewers, lakes,
dammed water, wetlands, ponds, springs, and all other bodies or channels
of conveyance of surface and underground water, or parts thereof, whether
natural or artificial, within or on the boundaries of this commonwealth.
disturbance activities must be designed to protect and maintain
existing uses and maintain the level of water quality necessary to
protect those uses in all streams and to protect and maintain water
quality in special protection streams.
Water quality involves the chemical, biological and physical
characteristics of surface water bodies. After regulated earth
disturbance activities are complete, these characteristics can be
impacted by the addition of pollutants such as sediment, and changes
in habitat through increased flow volumes and/or rates as a result
of changes in land surface area from those activities. Therefore,
permanent discharge to surface waters must be managed to protect
the stream bank, streambed and structural integrity of the waterway, to
prevent these impacts.

§ 395-14. Exemptions.
Exemptions from any provisions of this chapter shall not relieve the
applicant from the requirements in § 395-13D through K.
§ 395-15. Volume controls.
The green infrastructure and low-impact development practices provided
in the BMP Manual98 shall be utilized for all regulated activities wherever
possible. Water volume controls shall be implemented using the Design
Storm Method in Subsection A or the Simplified Method in Subsection B
below. For regulated activity areas equal or less than one acre that do not
require hydrologic routing to design the stormwater facilities, this chapter
establishes no preference for either methodology; therefore, the applicant
may select either methodology on the basis of economic considerations, the
intrinsic limitations on applicability of the analytical procedures associated
with each methodology and other factors.
L. For all regulated activities, SWM BMPs shall be designed,
implemented, operated, and maintained to meet the purposes and
requirements of this chapter and to meet all requirements under Title
25 of the Pennsylvania Code, the Clean Streams Law, and the Storm
Water Management Act.96
M. Various BMPs and their design standards are listed in the BMP
Manual.97
A. Regulated activities that result in cumulative earth disturbances of less
than 6,000 square feet are exempt from the requirements.
B. Agricultural activity is exempt from the SWM site plan preparation
requirements of this chapter provided the activities are performed
according to the requirements of 25 Pa. Code Chapter 102.
C. Forest management and timber operations are exempt from the SWM
site plan preparation requirements of this chapter provided the
activities are performed according to the requirements of 25 Pa. Code
Chapter 102.
D. The municipality may deny or revoke any exemption pursuant to this
section at any time for any project that the municipality believes may
pose a threat to public health and safety or the environment.
A. The Design Storm Method (CG-1 in the BMP Manual99) is applicable to
any size of regulated activity. This method requires detailed modeling
based on site conditions.

§ 395-13 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 395-15
1:243
(1) Do not increase the postdevelopment total runoff volume for all
storms equal to or less than the two-year twenty-four-hour-duration
precipitation.
(2) For modeling purposes:
(a) Existing (predevelopment) nonforested pervious areas must be
considered meadow in good condition.
(b) Twenty percent of existing impervious area, when present,
shall be considered meadow in good condition in the model for
existing conditions. If constructing facilities to accommodate
the resulting volume requirement is believed by the developer
to be unfeasible on site, the developer may submit a
modification request along with technical support
documentation for review by the Borough. The Borough may
grant a modification to alternatively construct off-site volume
controls providing that the alternative site is located within the
same subwatershed as the project site and the peak discharge
rates downstream of the project site are not increased above
predevelopment magnitudes.
[1] Design and construction of the off-site controls shall be
subject to review and approval by the Borough. Costs shall
be the responsibility of the developer. Design
documentation shall demonstrate that the proposed
facilities are effective in removing an amount equal to the
project's increase in the two-year storm volume from the
overall runoff where the facility is to be located.
[2] In lieu of construction of off-site controls, the developer
may request, and the Borough may accept, the payment
into a stormwater fund. The cost shall be based upon the
Borough's current fee schedule (adjusted annually) based
upon an established cost per cubic foot of storage.
B. The Simplified Method (CG-2 in the BMP Manual100) provided below is
independent of site conditions and should be used if the Design Storm
Method is not followed. This method is not applicable to regulated
activities greater than one acre or for projects that require design of
stormwater storage facilities. Twenty percent of existing impervious
area, when present, shall be considered meadow in good condition.
Then, for new (additional) impervious surfaces:
(1) Stormwater facilities shall capture at least the first two inches of
runoff from all new impervious surfaces.
(2) At least the first one inch of runoff from new impervious surfaces
shall be permanently removed from the runoff flow, i.e., it shall not

§ 395-16. Rate controls.
be released into the surface waters of this commonwealth. Removal
options include reuse, evaporation, transpiration, and infiltration.
(3) Wherever possible, infiltration facilities should be designed to
accommodate infiltration of the entire "permanently removed"
(first one inch, minimum) runoff; however, in all cases, at least the
first 0.5 inch of the permanently removed runoff should be
infiltrated.
(4) This method is exempt from the requirements of § 395-16, Rate
controls.
A. For areas not covered by a release rate map from an approved Act 167
stormwater management plan: Postdevelopment discharge rates shall
not exceed the predevelopment discharge rates for the one-, two-, five-,
ten-, twenty-five-, fifty-, and 100-year twenty-four-hour storm events. If
it is shown that the peak rates of discharge indicated by the
postdevelopment analysis are less than or equal to the peak rates of
discharge indicated by the predevelopment analysis for one-, two-, five-,
ten-, twenty-five-, fifty-, and 100-year, twenty-four-hour storms, then the
requirements of this section have been met. Otherwise, the applicant
shall provide additional controls as necessary to satisfy the peak rate of
discharge requirement.
B. For areas covered by a release rate map from an approved Act 167
stormwater management plan: For the one-, two-, five-, ten-, twentyfive-,
fifty-, and 100-year, twenty-four-hour storm events, the
postdevelopment peak discharge rates will follow the applicable
approved release rate maps. For any areas not shown on the release
rate maps, the postdevelopment discharge rates shall not exceed the
predevelopment discharge rates.
C. Calculation methods for development sites: For the purpose of
computing peak flow rates and runoff hydrographs from development
sites, calculations shall be performed using one of the following: USDA
NRCS publications, Technical Release (TR) 55 or 20, HEC1 or Penn
State Runoff Model (PSRM) or Modified Rational Method. Under
special circumstances other computation methods may be used subject
to the approval of the Borough. No times of concentrations less than
five minutes shall be accepted.
D. Routing of hydrographs through detention/retention facilities for the
purpose of designing those facilities shall be accomplished using the
Modified-Puls Method or other recognized reservoir routing method
subject to the approval of the Borough.
E. Design criteria for stormwater management controls.
(1) General criteria.
§ 395-15 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 395-16
1:245
(a) Applicants may select runoff control techniques, or a
combination of techniques, which are most suitable to control
stormwater runoff from the development site. All controls shall
be subject to approval of the Borough Engineer. The Borough
Engineer may request specific information on design and/or
operating features of the proposed stormwater controls in
order to determine their suitability and adequacy in terms of
the standards of this section.
(b) The applicant should consider the effect of the proposed
stormwater management techniques on any special soil
conditions or geological hazards which may exist on the
development site. In the event such conditions are identified on
the site, the Borough Engineer may require in-depth studies by
a competent geotechnical engineer.
(c) Not all stormwater control methods may be advisable or
allowable at a particular development site. In developing a
stormwater management plan for a particular site, stormwater
controls shall be selected according to the following order of
preference:
[1] Infiltration of runoff on site.
[2] Flow attenuation by use of open vegetated swales and
natural depressions.
[3] Stormwater detention/retention structures.
(d) Infiltration practices shall be used to the extent practicable to
reduce volume increases and promote groundwater recharge.
A combination of successive practices may be used to achieve
the applicable minimum control requirements. Justification
shall be provided by the applicant for rejecting each of the
preferred practices based on actual site conditions.
(e) Open detention/retention facilities shall be permitted within
residential areas. However, ponding depths, slope rates,
structure types, fencing, etc., shall be considered by the
Borough prior to approval.
(2) Criteria for infiltration systems.
(a) Infiltration systems shall be sized and designed based on local
soil and groundwater conditions. Design rates shall be justified
by the designer, including field tests if required.
(b) Infiltration systems greater than three feet deep shall be
located at least 10 feet from basement walls.
(c) Infiltration systems may not be approved for handling runoff
from commercial or industrial working areas. Drainage areas
§ 395-16 INDIANA CODE § 395-16
1:246
shall be suitably protected from the effects of the commercial/
industrial activities.
(d) Infiltration systems may not receive runoff until the entire
drainage area to the system has received final stabilization.
(e) The stormwater infiltration facility design shall provide an
overflow system with measures to provide a nonerosive
velocity of flow along its length and at the outfall.
(3) Criteria for flow attenuation facilities.
(a) If flow attenuation facilities are employed to assist in the
control of peak rates of discharge, their effects must be
quantified using the SCS Technical Release (TR) 55 Urban
Hydrology for Small Watersheds or other approved method.
The effects of the flow attenuation facilities on travel time
should be reflected in the calculations.
(b) Flow attenuation facilities, such as swales and natural
depressions, should be properly graded to ensure positive
drainage and avoid prolonged ponding of water.
(c) Swales shall be properly stabilized with vegetation or
otherwise lined to prevent erosion. The applicability of swales
shall be in accordance with this section.
(d) Swales shall be designed according to the recommendations
contained in the commonwealth of Pennsylvania Erosion and
Sediment Pollution Control Program Manual, latest edition.
(4) Criteria for stormwater detention facilities.
(a) All detention facilities shall be equipped with outlet structures
to provide discharge control for the seven designated storm
frequencies. Provisions shall also be made to safely pass the
postdevelopment 100-year storm runoff without damaging
(i.e., impairing the continued function of) the facilities. Should
any stormwater management facilities qualify as a dam under
PA DEP Chapter 105, a dam permit shall be obtained from the
DEP. A minimum of one foot of freeboard shall be provided
between the top of the 100-year storm elevation and the top of
the berm.
(b) Shared-storage facilities which provide detention of runoff for
more than one development site within a single subarea are
encouraged wherever feasible and provided such facilities
meet the criteria contained in this section. In addition, runoff
from the development sites involved shall be conveyed to the
facility in a manner that avoids adverse impacts (such as
flooding or erosion) to channels and properties located
§ 395-16 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 395-16
1:247
§ 395-17. Drainage design.
between the development site and the shared-storage
facilities.
(c) Where open detention facilities will be utilized, multiple use
facilities, such as wetlands, lakes, ball fields or similar
recreational/open space uses are encouraged wherever
feasible, subject to the approval of the Borough and PA DEP's
Chapter 105 regulations.
(d) Other considerations which should be incorporated into the
design of open detention facilities include:
[1] Inflow and outflow structures shall be designed and
installed to prevent erosion, and bottoms of impoundment
type structures should be protected from soil erosion.
[2] Control and removal of debris both in the storage
structure and in all inlet or outlet devices shall be a design
consideration. Provisions shall be made for trapping
sediment and grit upstream of storage facilities.
[3] Inflow and outflow structures, pumping stations, and other
structures shall be designed and protected to minimize
safety hazards.
[4] The facility shall be located to facilitate maintenance,
considering the frequency and type of equipment that will
be required.
[5] Where an open detention facility is installed, the design
configuration should be based on public health and safety;
the water depth at the perimeter of a storage pond shall be
limited to that which is safe for children. All open
detention facilities shall be surrounded by a secure fence
not less than five feet high. All fences must have at least
one lockable gate, minimum twelve-foot-wide opening, to
facilitate maintenance operations.
[6] Side slopes of storage ponds shall not exceed a ratio of
2.5:1 horizontal to the vertical dimension.
[7] Landscaping which is compatible with the surrounding
area shall be provided for the facility.
[8] Bottoms of detention basins should be graded with a
minimum slope of 1.5% to provide positive surface
drainage. A subdrainage system may be required
depending on the location of the pond bottom relative to
groundwater levels.
§ 395-16 INDIANA CODE § 395-17
1:248
A. Calculation methods for stormwater collection/conveyance facilities:
For the purposes of designing storm sewers, open swales and other
stormwater runoff collection and conveyance facilities, the Rational
Method or other method as approved by the Borough shall applied.
Rainfall intensities for design should be obtained from the appropriate
PennDOT region rainfall chart.
B. Criteria for collection/conveyance facilities:
(1) All stormwater runoff collection or conveyance facilities, whether
storm sewers or other open or closed channels, shall be designed in
accordance with the following basic standards:
(a) All sites shall be graded to provide drainage away from and
around the structure in order to prevent any potential flooding
damage.
(b) Collection/conveyance facilities should not be installed parallel
and close to the top or bottom of a major embankment to avoid
the possibility of failing or causing the embankment to fail.
(c) All collection/conveyance facilities shall be designed to convey
the twenty-five-year storm peak flow rate from the contributing
drainage area and to carry it to the nearest suitable outlet such
as a stormwater control facility, curbed street, storm sewer or
natural watercourse without damage to the drainage structure
or roadway, with runoff from the twenty-five-year design storm
at a minimum one foot of freeboard measured below the lowest
point along the top of the roadway. Roadway crossings located
within designated floodplain areas must be able to convey
runoff from a 100-year design storm while providing a
minimum finished roadway grade 1.0 foot above the 100-year
flood elevation. When it can be shown that, due to topographic
conditions, natural drainageways on the site cannot adequately
provide for drainage, open channels may be constructed
conforming substantially to the line and grade of such natural
drainageways. Work within natural drainageways shall be
subject to approval by PA DEP through the Joint Permit
Application process, or, where appropriate by PA DEP, through
the General Permit process.
(d) Where drainage swales or open channels are used, they shall
be suitably lined to prevent erosion and designed to avoid
excessive velocities. For drainage facilities to be conveyed to
the Borough, grass-lined facilities shall be provided. If grass
lining is not stable at the design velocity(ies), storm sewers
shall be provided.
(e) Stormwater drainage systems shall be provided in order to
permit unimpeded flow along natural watercourses, except as
modified by stormwater management facilities or open
channels consistent with this section.
§ 395-17 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 395-17
1:249
(f) Existing points of concentrated drainage that discharge onto
adjacent property shall not be adversely impacted and shall be
subject to any applicable discharge criteria specified in this
section.
(g) Areas of existing diffused drainage discharge shall be subject
to any applicable discharge criteria in the general direction of
existing discharge, whether proposed to be concentrated or
maintained as diffused drainage areas, except as otherwise
provided by this section. If diffused flow is proposed to be
concentrated and discharged onto adjacent property, the
developer must document that easements, satisfactory to the
Borough, have been obtained and that adequate downstream
conveyance facilities exist to safely transport the concentrated
discharge, or otherwise prove that no erosion, sedimentation,
flooding, or other harm will result from the concentrated
discharge.
(h) Where a development site is traversed by watercourses,
drainage easements shall be provided conforming to the line of
such watercourses. The terms of the easements shall prohibit
excavation, the placing of fill or structures, and any alterations
that may adversely affect the flow of stormwater within any
portion of the easement. Also, maintenance, including mowing
of vegetation within the easement shall be required, except as
approved by the appropriate governing authority.
(i) In order to promote overland flow and infiltration/percolation
of runoff where it is advantageous to do so, roof drains must
not be connected to streets, storm sewers, or roadside ditches.
When it is more advantageous to connect directly to streets or
storm sewers, then it shall be permitted on a case-by-case
basis by the Borough.
(2) Wherever storm sewers are proposed to be utilized, they shall
comply with the following criteria:
(a) If constructed within 10 feet of road paving, walks or other
surfaced areas, drains shall have a narrow trench and
maximum compaction of backfill to prevent settlement of the
superimposed surface or development.
(b) Installed after excavating and filling in the area to be traversed
is completed, unless the drain is installed in the original
ground with a minimum of three feet cover and/or adequate
protection during the fill construction.
(c) Designed with cradle when traversing fill areas of
indeterminate stability, anchors when gradient exceeds 20%,
and encasement or special backfill provisions when traversing
under a paved area.
§ 395-17 INDIANA CODE § 395-17
1:250
§ 395-18. Erosion and sediment control during regulated earth
disturbance activities.
(d) Designed to adequately handle the anticipated peak discharge
and be economical to maintain. The minimum pipe size shall be
15 inches in diameter. The capacity shall, at a minimum,
convey a ten-year, five-minute-duration peak discharge
(without surcharging the system) unless the storm sewer is
part of a stormwater facility with a more severe design
frequency in which case, the capacity shall adequately convey
the peak discharge associated with the more severe design
frequency.
(e) Specifications for materials and construction methods for drain
pipe, trenching, bedding and backfilling requirements shall
conform to the requirements of the Borough and/or applicable
PennDOT Specifications, Publication 408, the Standards for
Roadway Construction, Publication 72, and the Borough
details available at the Planning/Zoning Office.
(f) Design criteria, including acceptable pipe types, shall conform
to PennDOT Design Manual Part 2.
(g) Storm inlets and structures shall be designed to be adequate,
safe, unobtrusive and consistent with Borough standards.
Inlets and structures within a Borough right-of-way shall
comply with the PennDOT Standards for Roadway
Construction, Publication 72. Inlets and manholes shall be
sumped at least six inches and shall be easily entered for
cleaning and inspection.
(h) Appropriate grates shall be designed for all catch basins,
stormwater inlets, and other entrance appurtenances. Bicyclesafe
grates shall be provided.
(i) Manholes shall be designed so that the top shall be at finished
grade and sloped to conform to the slope of the finished grade.
Top castings of structures located in roads or parking areas
shall be machined or installed to preclude "rattling."
(j) Where proposed storm sewer connects with an existing storm
sewer system, the applicant shall demonstrate that discharge
rates and volumes are not being increased.
(k) Storm sewer outfalls shall be equipped with energy dissipation
devices to prevent erosion and conform with applicable
requirements of the PA DEP for stream encroachments
(Chapter 105 of PA DEP Rules and Regulations).
A. No regulated earth disturbance activities within the municipality shall
commence until approved by the municipality or its designee of an
erosion and sediment control plan for construction activities.

This article shall be known and may be cited as the "Street Excavation
Permit Ordinance."
§ 400-14. Definitions.
The following words, when used in this article, shall have the meanings
ascribed to them in this section, except in those instances where the context
clearly indicates otherwise:
APPLICANT  Any person or entity that makes application for a permit.
EMERGENCY  Any unforeseen circumstance or occurrence, the existence
of which constitutes a clear and immediate danger to persons or properties.
MANAGER  The Manager of Indiana Borough or their authorized
designee.
PERMITTEE  Any person, corporation, or entity that has been issued a
permit and has agreed to fulfill all the terms of this article.
PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSION  Any entity subject to the jurisdiction of
and control by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission.
STREET  A public street, public easement, right-of-way, public highway,
public alley, public sidewalk, public way or public road accepted or
maintained by the municipality or open for travel and use by the public,
whether or not so accepted or maintained, including the entire area within
the right-of-way thereof.
§ 400-15. Activities requiring issuance of permit.
A. It shall be unlawful for any person or entity to make any tunnel, opening
or excavation of any kind in or under the surface of any street without
first securing a permit from the Manager for each separate
undertaking; provided, however, that any person or entity maintaining
pipes, lines or other underground facilities in or under the surface of
any street may proceed with an opening without a permit when
emergency circumstances demand the work to be done immediately,
provided that the permit could not reasonably and practically have been
obtained beforehand. In such cases where emergency openings are
necessary, however, the municipality shall be notified prior to such
openings by:
(1) Fax notification.
110. Editor's Note: This ordinance, originally adopted as Ch. 234, superseded former Art. II,
Openings and Excavations, adopted 6-6-1950 by Ord. No. 595 (Chapter XXI, Part 3,
Subpart B, Sections 111 to 118, of the 1971 Code of Ordinances, as amended.
§ 400-13 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 400-15
1:273
§ 400-16. Work to be done pursuant to permit.
No person or entity to whom a permit has been granted shall perform
any of the work authorized by such permit in any amount greater than
that specified in the permit, except that where the permittee desires to
perform additional work not in excess of an amount greater than 10%
of the amount specified in the permit, the permittee may apply to the
Manager for an amended permit to authorize the additional work. If the
additional work desired to be performed by the permittee exceeds 10% of
the amount specified in the original permit, an application for a new permit
shall be made. Any deposit or bond posted in connection with the original
permit shall be deemed to cover any such additional work as may be added
pursuant to the issuance of an amended permit within the limit specified
herein.
§ 400-17. Time for commencement of work.
Work for which a permit has been issued shall commence within 30 days
after the issuance of the permit therefor. If not so commenced, the permit
shall be terminated automatically unless the permittee applies for an
extension of time within which to commence work. If such an extension is
granted, the original permit shall remain in force for the period of time
specified in the extension. Permits which terminate because of failure to
commence work within 30 days after issuance or within any extension of
time granted hereunder may be renewed only upon the payment of an
additional permit fee as originally required.
§ 400-18. Time limit on permit.
Every permit shall expire at the end of the period of time which shall be
set out in the permit. If the permittee shall be unable to complete the
work within the specified time, he or she shall, prior to expiration of the
permit, present, in writing, to the Manager a request for an extension of
time setting forth therein the reasons for the requested extension. If the
Manager finds that the failure to complete the work under the permit within
the time specified therein was due to circumstances reasonably beyond the
control of the permittee and that an extension of time to complete the work
under the permit is necessary and not contrary to the public interest, the
permittee may be granted additional time for the completion of the work.
(2) Telephone notification.
(3) PA One Call.
B. The person or entity shall thereafter apply for a permit on the first
regular business day on which the office of the Manager is open for
business, and said permit shall be retroactive to the date when the work
was begun.

1:274
§ 400-19. State and county roads.
The provisions of this article shall not be applicable in those instances
where the street or highway is maintained by the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania or by Indiana County; provided, however, that any person or
entity applying for a permit to do work within the right-of-way of a street
or highway maintained by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or by Indiana
County which would otherwise require a permit under the terms of this
article shall notify the Manager at the time that said application is made
and at the time that the work under any permit issued pursuant to said
application is begun, so that proper safety precautions may be taken by the
municipality during the continuation of said work.
§ 400-20. Revocation of permit.
§ 400-20.1. Requirements and specifications.
A. Any permit may be revoked by the Manager, after notice to the

G. When work performed by the permittee interferes with the established
drainage system of any street, provision shall be made by the permittee
to provide proper drainage.
H. Any earth, gravel or other excavated material must be maintained with
the use of erosion and sediment controls. Additionally, when any earth,
gravel or other excavated material is caused to flow, roll or wash upon
any street, the permittee shall cause removal of the same from the
street within eight hours after deposit to permit safe flow of traffic. In
the event that the earth, gravel or other excavated material so

removal, and the cost incurred shall be paid by the permittee or
deducted from his/her deposit.
I. Every permittee shall place around the project such barriers,
barricades, lights, warning flags and danger signs as shall be

(1) Whenever any permittee fails to provide or maintain the required
safety devices, such devices shall be installed and maintained by
the municipality. The amount of the cost incurred shall be paid by
the permittee or deducted from his/her deposit.
(2) No person shall willfully move, remove, injure, destroy or
extinguish any barrier, warning light, sign or notice erected, placed
or posted in accordance with the provisions of this section.
(3) Permittees are required to maintain erosion and sedimentation (E

K. Excavated materials shall be laid compactly along the side of the trench
and kept trimmed up so as to cause as little inconvenience as possible
to public travel. In order to expedite the flow of traffic or to abate dirt or
dust nuisance, the Manager may require the permittee to provide toe
boards or bins; and if the excavated area is muddy and causes
inconvenience to pedestrians, temporary wooden plank walks shall be
installed by the permittee as directed by the Manager. If the street is
not wide enough to hold the excavated material without using part of
the adjacent sidewalk, the permittee shall keep a passageway at least 1/
2 the sidewalk width open along such sidewalk line. The permittee is
responsible for proper pedestrian traffic controls at all times. When
required by the manager, "sidewalk closed" and directional signs must
be utilized to direct pedestrians to use the opposite side of the street.
L. Work authorized by a permit shall be performed between the hours of
7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m., Monday through Saturday, unless the

case of an emergency or in the event that the work authorized by the
permit is to be performed in traffic-congested areas.
M. In granting any permit, the Manager may attach such other conditions
thereto as may be reasonably necessary to prevent damage to public or
private property or to prevent the operation from being conducted in a
manner hazardous to life or property or in a manner likely to create a
nuisance. Such conditions may include, but shall not be limited to:
(1) Limitations on the period of the year in which the work may be
performed.
(2) Restrictions as to the size, weight and type of equipment.
(3) Designation of routes upon which materials may be transported.

and backfilled properly by the permittee according to Indiana Borough
specifications using PennDOT PUB 408 regulations. Unless the
permittee has been granted permission to restore the street surface, as
provided in Subsection D, the permittee also shall place a temporary
cold patch a maximum of three inches on the pavement cut, opening or
excavation in accordance with municipal specifications. If the permittee
has been granted permission to restore the street surface, but weather
conditions are such as to prevent the completion of permanent
restoration of the street surface at the time backfilling is completed, the
permittee shall install a temporary surface in accordance with
municipal specifications until such time as weather conditions will
permit permanent restoration of the street surface.
B. The Manager shall be notified by the permittee during the forty-eighthour
periods preceding the beginnings of backfilling and restoration
and the approximate time each will be begun.
C. No backfilling or restoration shall be accomplished unless or until the
Manager or his/her designee is present or permission has been granted
for backfilling or restoration after inspection by the Manager or his/her
designee.
D. The work of final restoration, including both paving surface and paving
base, shall be performed directly by the permittee or agent under the
supervision of the Manager. All restoration work shall be performed by
the permittee according to Indiana Borough specifications and shall be
subject to inspection by the municipality.
E. If the Manager finds that paving surfaces adjacent to the street
openings may be damaged where trenches are made parallel to the
street or where a number of cross trenches are laid in proximity to one
another or where the equipment used may cause such damage, he or
she may require negotiated contributions from the permittee for the
resurfacing in place of patching of such street if the total area of the
proposed patch or damaged area exceeds 25% of the total pavement
surfacing between curb faces or between concrete gutter edges. Such
§ 400-20.1 INDIANA CODE § 400-20.2

§ 400-20.3. Deposit.
negotiations shall be carried on and contributions agreed upon prior to
issuance of a permit.
F. After excavation is commenced, the work of making and backfilling the
same shall be prosecuted with due diligence. Unless the provisions of
Subsection A of this section apply, the permittee is required to complete
permanent restoration of the street surface in accordance with
municipal specifications within 30 days after repairs and/or installation
are completed. Furthermore, the permittee shall be required to install
and maintain a temporary surface in accordance with municipal
specifications during:
(1) The period between the completion of repairs and/or installation
and the commencement of final restoration; and
(2) The periods during the actual work when workers do not require
access to the excavation.
G. Inspections of all work authorized by a permit shall be made by the
Manager at such times and in such manner as required to assure
compliance with provisions of this article. If the nature of the work to be
performed under any permit is such as to require the services of a fulltime
inspector, the Manager shall provide for the services of such an
inspector.
H. All inspection costs shall be borne by the permittee. Such costs shall be
based upon a schedule of charges on file in the office of the Manager.
I. Upon completion of all work accomplished under the provisions of a
permit, the permittee shall notify the Manager, in writing. A certificate
of final inspection shall be issued by the Manager to each permittee no
sooner than one year and not later than 18 months after the permanent
restoration of the excavation has been made, provided that the work
authorized by the permit has been performed according to municipal
specifications. Prior to the issuance of a certificate, the Manager shall
make a final inspection of the restoration to determine whether
municipal specifications have been adhered to.
J. If any settlement in a restored area occurs within a period of 18 months
from the date of completion of the permanent restoration and the
permittee fails to make such correction after notification, any expense
incurred by the municipality in correcting such settlement shall be paid
by the permittee or recovered from his/her bond, unless the permittee
submits proof, satisfactory to the Manager, that the settlement was not
due to defective backfilling.
A. Computation of deposit. The Manager, upon receipt of a properly
completed application, shall determine the amount of the deposit to be
made by the permittee in accordance with the fee schedule; provided,
however, that the minimum deposit required shall be $2,400 plus the
§ 400-20.2 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 400-20.3

cost of the street excavation permit. The deposit shall be paid at the
time the permit is issued, and the deposit shall be used to reimburse
the municipality for the cost of any work and/or materials furnished by
it in connection with work authorized by the permit, to cover the cost of
all necessary inspections of said work or any other expenses incurred
by the municipality in carrying out the provisions of this article.
B. Form of deposit. The deposit may be either in the form of a certified,
treasurer's or cashier's check or in lawful money of the United States.
C. Insufficient deposit. If any deposit is less than sufficient to pay all costs,
the permittee shall, upon demand, pay to the municipality an amount
equal to the deficiency. If the permittee fails or refuses to pay such
deficiency, the municipality may institute an action to recover the same
in any court of competent jurisdiction. Until such deficiency is paid in
full, no additional permits shall be issued to such permittee.
D. Yearly deposit. Whenever any public utility company shall anticipate
applying for permits for more than one street opening or excavation per
calendar year and does not elect to file a corporate bond as
hereinbefore provided, such public utility company may post one
deposit in an amount and form as hereinbefore provided for the
calendar year or part thereof to cover the cost of deposits which would
otherwise be required for the anticipated permits.
E. Deposit and cost schedules. The Manager shall establish a schedule of
charges for inspections, labor, materials and other such expenses as
may be incurred by the municipality in carrying out the provisions of
this article. This schedule shall be established by the Manager in
accordance with the reasonably anticipated costs to be incurred by the
municipality in making such inspections, including reasonable
administrative and overhead expenses, and in accordance with the
currently prevailing costs in the area for any labor and materials which
may be provided by the municipality. The Manager shall revise said
schedule from time to time to reflect any increase or decrease in the
costs used to establish said charges. The schedule shall be open to
public inspection in the office of the Manager upon request.
F. Decision on costs. The decision of the Manager as to the cost of any
work done or repairs made by a permittee under his/her direction,
pursuant to the provisions of this article, shall be final and conclusive as
to such cost.
G. Refund of deposit. Upon notification by the permittee that all work
authorized by the permit has been completed and after restoration of
the opening, the Manager shall refund to the permittee his/her deposit,
less all costs incurred by the municipality in connection with said
permit. In no event shall the permit fee be refunded.

§ 400-20.5. Liability insurance.
Each applicant, upon the receipt of a permit, shall provide the municipality
with an acceptable certificate of insurance indicating that he or she is
insured against claims for damages for personal injury as well as against
claims for property damage which may arise from or out of the performance
of the work, whether such performance is by himself or herself, his/her
subcontractor or anyone directly or indirectly employed by him or her. Such
insurance shall cover collapse, explosive hazards and underground work
by equipment on the street and shall include protection against liability
arising from completed operations. The amount of the insurance shall be
prescribed by the Manager in accordance with the nature of the risk
involved; provided, however, that the liability insurance for bodily injury
shall be in an amount no less than $500,000 for each person and $500,000
for each accident, and for property damages, in an amount no less than
$1,000,000, with an aggregate of $500,000 for all accidents. Public utility
companies and authorities may be relieved of the obligation of submitting
such a certificate if they submit satisfactory evidence that they are insured
in accordance with the requirements of this article or have adequate
A. A performance bond is required by Indiana Borough to perform the
restoration work. Each applicant or permittee, upon receipt of a permit,
shall provide the municipality with an acceptable corporate surety bond
to guarantee faithful performance of the work authorized by a permit
granted pursuant to this article. The amount of the bond shall be 110%
of the estimated cost of restoring the street opening. The term of the
bond shall begin upon the date of posting thereof and shall terminate 18
months upon the receipt by the permittee of a certificate of final
inspection from the Manager. If the permittee anticipates requesting
more than one permit per year, as required by this article, he or she
may furnish one continuing corporate surety bond to guarantee faithful
performance in such amount as the Manager deems necessary. The
amount of such bond shall be in relation to the cost of restoring
pavement cuts to be made by the permittee throughout the year. In the
case of a public utility company, its corporate bond, in a form
satisfactory to the Solicitor, may be accepted in lieu of the corporate
surety bond required by this section.
B. Default in performance. Whenever the Manager shall find that a default
has occurred in the performance of any term or condition of the permit,
written notice thereof shall be given to the principal and to the surety
on the bond. Such notice shall state the work to be done, the estimated
cost thereof and the period of time deemed by the Manager to be
reasonably necessary for the completion of such work.
C. Completion of work. After receipt of such notice, the surety must,
within the time therein specified, either cause the required work to be
performed or, failing therein, indemnify the municipality for the cost of
doing the work as set forth in the notice.

upon conviction thereof, be sentenced to pay a fine of not more than $600;
and in default of payment, to imprisonment for a term not to exceed 90 days.
Every day that a violation of this article continues shall constitute a separate
offense.

illegal or invalid, such illegality or invalidity shall not affect or impair any
of the remaining provisions of this article, or any subsections thereunder. It
is hereby declared as the intent of the Borough that this article would not
have been enacted if any per se illegal or invalid provisions were included
herein. If any such provision would be found to exist, such invalid provision
would be stricken.

Any other ordinance provision(s) or regulation of the municipality
inconsistent with any of the provisions of this article is hereby repealed to
the extent of the inconsistency only.

[Adopted 1-18-1994 by Ord. No. 1612]
§ 400-27. Notice to reconstruct or repair.
§ 400-28. Sidewalk material and specifications.
A. Every owner of property in the Borough of Indiana shall, on 60 days'
notice from the Public Works Committee of Borough Council, construct,
reconstruct or repair the sidewalk in front of and/or alongside such
property, in the manner and to the extent stipulated in such notice. The
Public Works Committee's decision to require a new sidewalk to be
constructed shall be in accordance with an overall Borough-wide plan
for sidewalk extension prepared by the Committee, adopted by Borough
Council after a public hearing and modified from time to time by
Council action after Council receives recommendations from the Public
Works Committee.
B. The Public Works Committee's decision to require a segment of
sidewalk to be reconstructed or repaired shall be based on either a
determination by the Borough Manager that a hazard to public safety
exists that must be immediately corrected, or upon recommendations of
the Public Works Committee after inspection of sidewalks. The Public
Works Committee, the Borough Manager or the Borough Manager's
designated representative shall inspect all sidewalks in each Ward of
the Borough not less frequently than once every four years.
C. "Reconstruction" shall mean complete removal and replacement of an
entire sidewalk between property lines. "Repair" shall mean
improvement or replacement of deteriorated or hazardous panels
within a sidewalk, leaving some or most of the sidewalk intact. A
"hazard to public safety" shall mean that a vertical separation greater
than 1/2 inch exists between adjacent concrete panels or masonry
units, or cracks within panels, or that at least 50% of the surface of any
panel has spalled so as to create a rough condition, or that a panel has
shifted or tilted so as to create a sloped surface greater than one
vertical to 10 horizontal.
A. All sidewalks shall be constructed, reconstructed and repaired of
concrete only, in conformity with specifications adopted by the Borough
Council from time to time. Provided: where the existing sidewalk is of
brick, and at least 2/3 of such sidewalk between property lines is in
good repair, as determined by the Public Works Committee, such
sidewalk may be repaired with brick, but where such sidewalk is in such
a condition, in the opinion of the Public Works Committee, that more
than 1/3 should be replaced, the entire walk between property lines
shall be reconstructed of concrete in accordance with Borough
specifications.
§ 400-27 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 400-28
1:287
§ 400-29. Sidewalk widths and line and grade.
All sidewalks on Philadelphia Street, between Fifth Street and Ninth Street,
shall be paved to the full width, from building line to curb. All sidewalks
along any other portion of any street of alley shall be paved to a width of
four feet, except where the Public Works Committee shall determine that
special conditions of terrain, pedestrian or vehicular traffic, continuity of
sidewalk width between cross streets or other necessity shall require a
sidewalk paved to a width greater or lesser than four feet, in which case the
Committee shall order such walk to be paved to the width so determined.
When ordering the construction or reconstruction of any sidewalk, the
Committee shall establish the grades and lines thereof and such sidewalk
shall conform in every respect to such orders as to width, grade and line.
Owners of lots located at intersections of streets and/or alleys shall pave
sufficiently beyond the corner of the lot to join with the paved sidewalk on
the intersecting street or alley.
§ 400-30. Determination by Committee; inspection.
It shall be the duty and responsibility of the Public Works Committee
to determine, in the case of any individual property, whether or not the
abutting sidewalk shall be reconstructed or repaired, and if so, the specific
part or parts to be reconstructed or repaired. Any property owner receiving
an order to reconstruct or repair may appeal to the Committee to rescind,
modify or postpone the order, and, if dissatisfied with the Committee's
response, may appeal to Council as a whole. A Borough official may at
any time during the course of constructing, reconstructing or repairing any
sidewalk, visit the site at any reasonable time, or when so requested by
the property owner, to ascertain whether the work is being done according
to the Borough's sidewalk construction specifications. If the average daily
temperature is less than 40°, measures shall be taken to keep the
temperature of the concrete not less than 50° for a period of at least seven
days after pouring or three days if high-early-strength concrete is used.
In hot weather, concrete shall be fog-sprayed or covered with a wet light-
B. The sidewalks in the C-1 and C-2 zoned districts may be constructed of
chamfered brick pavers. The brick shall be Glen-Gery K&W red, and
shall be four inches by eight inches, 2 1/4 inches thick. The brick shall
be placed upon a 3/4 inch thick dry pack which shall be on a four-inch
concrete base. The base shall be reinforced with number 10 six-by-six
wire. The Public Works Committee may approve other pavers that shall
be equal in quality and similar in color to the specified Glen-Gery
pavers, and may also approve, prior to the start of construction,
alternate installation methods. All work is to be performed by skilled
craftsmen using a straight edge and other tools to insure a smooth and
uniform surface grade consistent with lines and grades established by
the Borough. Omni-brick and similar poured-in-place surfaces shall be
considered as concrete for purposes of this article. Color additives to
the concrete mix shall be prohibited unless specifically approved by the
Public Works Committee.

colored fabric as soon as hardening of the surface will permit. Within two
working days after the completion of the work, it shall be the duty of the
owner of the property abutting the sidewalk to notify the Borough Manager
of that fact, so that he or his representative may inspect such sidewalk to
determine whether the work was done in conformity with the requirements
of this article and the Borough's sidewalk specifications.
§ 400-31. Maintenance of surfaces between street curb and
sidewalk; alternate surfacing.
The owner of property abutting any sidewalk shall be responsible for
maintaining not only the sidewalk itself but also any surfaces lying between
the street curb or edge of the vehicular pavement and the sidewalk. Such
surfaces shall be planted and maintained in grass, or the owner may appeal
to the Public Works Committee to approve an alternate surfacing, such
as a planted ground cover, or a brick, block, concrete or similar surface,
provided such surface is maintained at the same level as the adjacent top of
curb and sidewalk surfaces.
§ 400-32. Construction, reconstruction or repair by property owner
without notice from Borough.
Any property owner, upon his own initiative and without notice from any
Borough authority, may construct, reconstruct or repair a sidewalk in front
of or alongside his property, provided that such property owner shall first
make application to the Borough Manager or his representative for a
permit, and shall conform to all requirements of this article and the
Borough's sidewalk construction specifications as to line and grade and as
to materials used. The property owner shall notify the Borough Manager as
required by § 400-30 above within two working days after completion of the
work to request an inspection.
§ 400-33. Construction of handicap ramp.
The Public Works Committee may order, as part of the construction of a
new sidewalk or reconstruction of an existing sidewalk, where the project
includes a street intersection, that the property owner build a handicap
ramp connecting the sidewalk surface and the street curb, depressed to the
level of the adjacent street surface.
§ 400-34. Violations and penalties.
Each owner who shall violate the provisions of this article shall be subject
to a monthly fine of not less than $35 nor more than $100 for the initial
month. For each month thereafter, the fine shall double; providing, however,
that the total fine shall not be more than $500 in any year. Any violator shall
be responsible for the cost of prosecution. Each thirty-day period that the
owner continues to violate the article shall be a separate offense.

Plan Applications
§ 405-9. Preliminary considerations.
§ 405-10. Minor subdivision procedure.
Developers seeking approval of a minor subdivision or lot line revision as
defined in § 405-4 may disregard the preliminary plan stages and proceed
to final plan application. Ten copies of the final plan shall be submitted.
All steps in the final review procedure, with the exception of those
guaranteeing provision of streets and public utilities, shall apply to a minor
A. Activities denied prior to final approval. No person, firm, or corporation
contemplating subdivision or development of a tract of land shall
proceed with any grading of the site until preliminary approval has
been granted or shall record or sell any lots until he/she has received
final approval of his/her plan from the Planning Commission.
B. Unsuitable conditions jeopardizing approval. The Borough may refuse
to grant approval of all or a part of certain plans that provide
inadequate access or that are unsuitable for development by reason of
flooding hazard, steep slopes, poor drainage, slide-prone soils, or
nonconformity with the Borough Comprehensive Plan.
C. Preliminary sketch plan. Any developer may present at developer's
option a preliminary sketch plan for the Planning Commission's review
at a regular meeting. The developer is urged to attend to answer
questions and receive advice. The sketch plan shall show the entire
property, slopes and grading, parking if a multifamily, commercial or
industrial project, streams and storm drainage, easements, natural
features of the property and relationship of the site to major roads and
landmarks in the vicinity. In addition, the plan shall contain the name of
the property owner, developer, preparer of plan, proposed number of
dwelling and/or commercial units, and average area and frontage of
lots. The purpose of this section is to provide guidance. No
recommendations of the Commission are binding on the developer.
D. Exchanges of property. When a property is being divided or property
lines rearranged with particular buyers and sellers, each parcel to be
transferred in title shall be identified with the seller's and buyer's name
so that the line of conveyance is clear.
E. County review. All applications for subdivision and/or land development
approval within the Borough shall be forwarded upon receipt to the
Indiana County Planning Commission for a nonbinding review and
report consistent with Section 502(b) of the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code.117 Any fees for this review shall be the

approval, denying it, or granting preliminary approval with conditions
not later than 90 days after officially reviewing the plan at a regular
meeting. The decision shall be in writing and shall be communicated to
the applicant personally or mailed to applicant's last known address not
later than 15 days following the decision. The decision shall set forth
the reasons for the disapproval, if that is the decision, specifying the
defects found, describing the requirements which were not met and
citing the provisions of the statute or ordinance relied upon. Failure of
the Commission to reach a decision or to communicate it within the
time limits shall be deemed an approval of the plan as presented.
Failure of the developer to accept any and all conditions upon approval
shall render the approval void. No amendment to this chapter after
official receipt of a subdivision plan shall detrimentally affect the plan
or its processing unless the plan is withdrawn and resubmitted, nor
shall such intervening amendment adversely affect the right of a
developer to commence and complete any approved plan or portion of a
plan within five years of the date of preliminary approval. Preliminary
plan approval shall only be an expression of tentative approval and
authorization to proceed to the final plan application. The plan shall be
stamped, dated and signed by the Commission Chairman and Secretary
upon granting of the preliminary approval.

not appear at the meeting at which developer's plan is received, the
Planning Commission may postpone review until the developer can be
present at a regularly scheduled meeting.
B. Review. The Planning Commission shall review the submitted
documents for conformance with this chapter and inclusion of any
conditions attached to preliminary approval. Distribution and
submission of materials shall follow the pattern for distribution of
copies for preliminary plan applications.
C. Approval. The Planning Commission shall render its decision within 90
days after officially receiving the plan at a regular meeting. The
decision shall be in writing and shall be communicated to the applicant
personally or mailed to applicant's last known address not later than 15
days following the decision. The decision shall set forth the reasons for
the disapproval, if that is the decision, specifying the defects found,
describing the requirements that were not met and citing the provisions
of the statute or ordinance relied upon. Failure of the Commission to
reach a decision or to communicate it within the time limits shall be
deemed an approval of the plan as presented. The final plan shall be
dated and signed by the Chairman and Secretary of the Commission if
approved, using the official stamp. The developer shall within 90 days
of final approval record the approved plan in the Indiana County office
of the Recorder of Deeds. Failure to record within the time limit shall
void the plan. At the time of submittal of the final plan, the developer
shall pay a fee in accordance with § 405-37 of this chapter.
D. Guarantee that improvements will be completed. Before approving any
final plan application, the Planning Commission shall require that the
developer deposit with the Borough Council a guarantee of completion
of all improvements agreed upon at the time of final approval in the
form of a bond or the deposit of funds or securities to be held in escrow,
to the benefit of the Borough, such guarantee equal to 110% of the
value of the improvement as estimated by a qualified engineer. The
form and type of guarantee shall be approved by the Borough. The
Borough may permit partial release of the guarantee funds as
construction proceeds, provided that sufficient funds remain to
complete all the improvements in the estimation of the Borough
Engineer. Annually, the municipality may adjust the amount of financial
security by comparing the actual cost of the improvements which have
been completed and the estimated cost for the completion of the
remaining improvements as of the expiration of the 90th day after
either the original date scheduled for completion or a rescheduled date
of completion. Subsequent to this adjustment, the municipality may
require the developer to post additional security in order to assure that
the financial security equals 110%.

facilities to be installed or actions to be undertaken by the applicant.
E. Joint traffic studies by different applicants are acceptable and are
strongly encouraged.
A. The Borough, with advice of its own professional consultants, shall
make a determination on the level of traffic study required based upon
two factors: the location of the proposed development and the projected
traffic generation of the proposed development.
(1) Location factors. The Borough has identified as stressed road in its
Comprehensive Plan and subsequent studies Philadelphia Street, S.
Sixth Street, Oakland Avenue, and Wayne Avenue.
(2) As deemed necessary by changes in information gathering and new
land developments, the Borough may remove or add new stressed
roads and intersections as necessary upon the recommendation of
the Planning Commission and resolution by the Borough Council.
B. Traffic study level requirements.
(1) Based upon the location and trip generation characteristics, the
Borough shall use the following table as a guide for the level of
traffic study required:
Trip Generation at
Peak Hours
Location Directly
Accessing a
Stressed Road or
Within 200 Feet of
a Stressed Road
Other
Locations
At least 50 trips but less
than 100 trips
Full study Abbreviated
study
More than 100 trips Full study Full study
(2) The Borough may, in its discretion, require any other subdivision or
land development application to be accompanied by an abbreviated
traffic impact study. In such circumstances, the Borough will notify
the applicant within 10 days following the Planning Commission's
first meeting with the applicant. Such notification shall specify the
reason for the requirement, citing the proposal's particular
location, existing problems, or type of use (i.e., generation of heavy
truck traffic).
C. Determination of peak-hour trips. As a general guide, the Borough shall
utilize the second edition of Transportation and Land Development, as
published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE), included
in the table below for reference. The Borough may utilize alternative
information provided by the developer for more specific land uses, if

D. Abbreviated study requirements.
(1) The following abbreviated traffic impact study shall be required as
part of the preliminary plan submission. Development of a project
in stages or on a phased basis will not avoid this requirement. The
trips expected to be produced by the ultimate buildout of the
development will be the basis for such a study. Even if a
development generates less than the required peak-hour trips, it is
not totally excluded from the adequacy requirements of these
§ 405-31 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 405-31
1:329
guidelines unless site traffic generation is anticipated to be de
minimus (less than five peak-hour trips).
(2) A written abbreviated traffic study, where appropriate, and a
traffic-calming and access management analysis shall be submitted
at the time of the preliminary plan application and shall include:
(a) Projected peak a.m., p.m., and Saturday traffic volumes of the
development;
(b) Projected ADT (average daily trips) of the development;
(c) Current ADT and peak-hour volumes of streets adjacent to any
access drives;
(d) LOS (level of service) of existing and proposed access drives;
(e) Modal split of services (categories of vehicles) entering the
site;
(f) Proposed sight distances at access drives;
(g) Existing and proposed pedestrian paths from streets and
within the site to entrances of all buildings;
(h) The study shall identify improvements and facilities to be
installed or actions to be undertaken by the applicant to ensure
the following:
[1] LOS C or higher overall for all new access drives;
[2] No reduction in the levels of service for existing access
drives, except that LOS D shall be permitted during the
a.m. and p.m. peak hour. If an applicant cannot meet this
requirement, an analysis shall be completed to show that
all reasonable options have been considered to create the
most efficient access possible; and
[3] Sight distances for all access drives intersecting with all
streets shall meet Borough and/or PennDOT requirements,
as applicable.
E. Full traffic impact study.
(1) A written full traffic study and, where appropriate, traffic-calming
and access management measures shall be submitted at the time of
preliminary plan application. The study area shall include all public
streets and intersections within a radius of 1,600 feet of an access
drive to the site, unless the Borough's consulting traffic engineer
determines that another study area shall be more appropriate. The
full traffic study shall include, at a minimum, the following:
(a) Current ADT and peak-hour volumes of all streets.
§ 405-31 INDIANA CODE § 405-31
1:330
(b) Current LOS of all intersections.
(c) Projected ADT and peak-hour volumes of all streets without the
development.
(d) Projected LOS of all intersections without the development.
(e) Site traffic generation, including projected ADT and peak-hour
volumes of the development. Development of a project in
stages, or on a piecemeal basis, must create a realistic
assumption expected to be produced by the ultimate buildout
of the development.
(f) Site traffic distribution.
(g) Site traffic assignment.
(h) Projected ADT and peak-hour volumes of all streets and
intersections within the development.
(i) Projected LOS of all intersections within the development,
including all existing and proposed access drives.
(j) An assessment of the change in roadway operating conditions
resulting from the development traffic.
(k) Modal split of vehicles entering the site.
(l) Proposed sight distances at access drives.
(m) Existing and proposed pedestrian paths from streets and
within the site to entrances of all buildings.
(2) The study shall identify improvements and facilities to be installed
or actions to be undertaken by the applicant to ensure the
following:
(a) LOS C or higher overall for all new access driveways.
(b) No reduction in the levels of service for existing access
driveways, except that LOS D shall be permitted during the
a.m. and p.m. peak hour. If an applicant cannot meet this
requirement, an analysis shall be completed to show that all
reasonable options have been considered to create the most
efficient access possible.
(c) No reduction in the levels of service of intersections within the
study area as a result of the development; however, if the
intersection already has an LOS, no reduction in the
intersection delay shall occur.
(d) Sight distances for all access drives intersecting with all rightsof-
way shall meet Borough and/or PennDOT requirements, as
applicable.
§ 405-31 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 405-31
1:331
F. Implementation. The Borough shall review the traffic impact study to
analyze its adequacy in solving any traffic problems that will occur due
to the land development or subdivision. The Borough's professional
consultants shall review the study and submit their review comments to
the Borough. These review comments shall be part of the Borough's
official review and approval process. The Borough may decide that
certain improvements on an adjacent site within the study area are
necessary for land development or subdivision plan approval and may
attach these conditions to the approval. If the municipality concludes
that additional improvements are necessary, the developer shall have
the opportunity to resubmit alternative improvement designs to obtain
plan approval.

[Adopted 10-3-1972 by Ord. No. 1064 (Ch. XXIV, Part 3, Secs. 51 to
63); amended in its entirety at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1,
General Provisions, Art. I)]
§ 414-1. Statutory authority.
This article is enacted under the authority of the Local Tax Enabling Act, 53
P.S. § 6901 et seq.
§ 414-2. Title.
This article shall be known and may be cited as the "Borough of Indiana
Earned Income and Net Profits Tax Ordinance."
§ 414-3. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
ASSOCIATION  A partnership, limited partnership or any other
unincorporated group of two or more persons.
BUSINESS  An enterprise, activity, profession or any other undertaking of
an unincorporated nature conducted for profit or ordinarily conducted for
profit whether by a person, partnership, association or any other entity.

other state, territory, foreign country or dependency.
CURRENT YEAR  The calendar year for which the tax is levied.
DOMICILE  The place where one lives and has his permanent home and
to which he has the intention of returning whenever he is absent. Actual
residence is not necessarily "domicile," for "domicile" is the fixed place of
abode which, in the intention of the taxpayer, is permanent rather than
transitory. "Domicile" is the voluntary fixed place of habitation of a person,
not for a mere special or limited purpose, but with the present intention of
making a permanent home, until some event occurs to induce him to adopt
some other permanent home. In the case of businesses or associations, the
domicile is that place considered as the center of business affairs and the
place where its functions are discharged.
EARNED INCOME  Compensation as determined under Section 303 of
the Act of March 4, 1971 (P.L. 6, No. 2), known as the "Tax Reform Code of
1971," and regulations in 61 Pa. Code Part I, Subpart B, Article V (relating
to personal income tax), not including, however, wages or compensation
paid to individuals on active military service. Employee business expenses
are allowable deductions as determined under Article III of the Tax Reform
Code of 1971. The amount of any housing allowance provided to a member
of the clergy shall not be taxable as earned income.
§ 414-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 414-3
1:339
EARNED INCOME AND NET PROFITS TAX OFFICER or OFFICER  That
person, public employee, private agency or other entity designated by the
Borough Council to collect and administer the tax on earned income and net
profits. The elected (or appointed) Real Property Tax Collector shall be and
shall serve as the Earned Income and Net Profits Tax Officer of the Borough
of Indiana.
EMPLOYER  A person, partnership, association, corporation, institution,
governmental body or unit or agency or any other entity employing one or
more persons for a salary, wage, commission or other compensation.
NET PROFITS  The net income from the operation of a business,
profession, or other activity, except corporations, determined under Section
303 of the Act of March 4, 1971 (P.L. 6, No. 2), known as the "Tax Reform
Code of 1971," and regulations in 61 Pa. Code Part I, Subpart B, Article V
(relating to personal income tax). The term does not include income which
is not paid for services provided and which is in the nature of earnings from
an investment. For taxpayers engaged in the business, profession or activity
of farming, the term shall not include:

imposed and due shall be waived in total or in part if the taxpayer
voluntarily files delinquent returns and pays the taxes in full during the
period so established. The governing body may adopt regulations to
implement the provisions of this subsection.
C. The provisions of Subsection B shall not affect or terminate any
petitions, investigations, prosecutions or other proceedings pending

not, however, relieve any other party to a transaction from liability for the
tax.
§ 414-23. Excluded transactions.
B. The payment of the tax imposed herein shall be evidenced by the
affixing of an official stamp or writing by the recorder whereon the date
of the payment of the tax, amount of the tax and the signature of the
collecting agent shall be set forth.
C. It is the intent of this article that the entire burden of the tax imposed
herein on a person or transfer shall not exceed the limitations
prescribed in the Local Tax Enabling Act, Act of December 31, 1965,
P.L. 1257, 53 P.S. § 6901 et seq., so that if any other political subdivision
shall impose or hereafter shall impose such tax on the same person or
transfer, then the tax levied by Borough of Indiana under the authority
of that Act shall, during the time such duplication of the tax exists,
except as hereinafter otherwise provided, be 1/2 of the rate and such 1/
2 rate shall become effective without any action on the part of Borough
of Indiana; provided, however, that Borough of Indiana and any other
political subdivision which imposes such tax on the same person or
transfer may agree that, instead of limiting their respective rates to 1/2
of the rate herein provided, they will impose respectively different
rates, the total of which shall not exceed the maximum rate permitted
under the Local Tax Enabling Act.
D. If for any reason the tax is not paid when due, interest at the rate in
effect at the time the tax is due shall be added and collected.
A. The tax imposed by § 414-21 shall not be imposed upon:
(1) A transfer to the commonwealth, or to any of its instrumentalities,
agencies or political subdivisions, by gift, dedication or deed in lieu
of condemnation or deed of confirmation in connection with
condemnation proceedings, or a reconveyance by the condemning
body of the property condemned to the owner of record at the time
of condemnation which reconveyance may include property line
adjustments, provided said reconveyance is made within one year
from the date of condemnation.
(2) A document which Borough of Indiana is prohibited from taxing
under the Constitution or statutes of the United States.
(3) A conveyance to a municipality, township, school district or county
pursuant to acquisition by the municipality, township, school
§ 414-21 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 414-23
1:357
district or county of a tax delinquent property at sheriff sale or tax
claim bureau sale.
(4) A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration which corrects or
confirms a transfer previously recorded, but which does not extend
or limit existing record legal title or interest.
(5) A transfer of division in kind for no or nominal actual consideration
of property passed by testate or intestate succession and held by
cotenants; however, if any of the parties take shares greater in
value than their undivided interest, tax is due on the excess.
(6) A transfer between husband and wife, between persons who were
previously husband and wife who have since been divorced,
provided the property or interest therein subject to such transfer
was acquired by the husband and wife or husband or wife prior to
the granting of the final decree in divorce, between parent and
child or the spouse of such child, between brother or sister or
spouse of a brother or sister and brother or sister or the spouse of a
brother or sister, and between a grandparent and grandchild or the
spouse of such grandchild, except that a subsequent transfer by the
grantee within one year shall be subject to tax as if the grantor
were making such transfer.
(7) A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration of property
passing by testate or intestate succession from a personal
representative of a decedent to the decedent's devisee or heir.
(8) A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration to a trustee of an
ordinary trust where the transfer of the same property would be
exempt if the transfer was made directly from the grantor to all of
the possible beneficiaries that are entitled to receive the property
or proceeds from the sale of the property under the trust, whether
or not such beneficiaries are contingent or specifically named. A
trust clause which identifies the contingent beneficiaries by
reference to the heirs of the trust settlor as determined by the laws
of the intestate succession shall not disqualify a transfer from the
exclusion provided by this subsection. No such exemption shall be
granted unless the recorder of deeds is presented with a copy of
the trust instrument that clearly identifies the grantor and all
possible beneficiaries.
(9) A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration to a trustee of a
living trust from the settlor of the living trust. No such exemption
shall be granted unless the Recorder of Deeds is presented with a
copy of the living trust instrument.
(10) A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration from a trustee of
an ordinary trust to a specifically named beneficiary that is entitled
to receive the property under the recorded trust instrument or to a
contingent beneficiary where the transfer of the same property
would be exempt if the transfer was made by the grantor of the
§ 414-23 INDIANA CODE § 414-23
1:358
property into the trust to that beneficiary. However, any transfer of
real estate from a living trust during the settlor's lifetime shall be
considered for the purposes of this article as if such transfer were
made directly from the settlor to the grantee.
(11) A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration from a trustee of
a living trust after the death of the settlor of the trust or from a
trustee of a trust created pursuant to the will of a decedent to a
beneficiary to whom the property is devised or bequeathed.
(12) A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration from the trustee
of a living trust to the settlor of the living trust if such property was
originally conveyed to the trustee by the settlor.
(13) A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration from trustee to
successor trustee.
(14) A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration between principal
and agent or straw party; or from or to an agent or straw party
where, if the agent or straw party were his principal, no tax would
be imposed under this article. Where the document by which title is
acquired by a grantee or agreement of value fails to set forth that
the property was acquired by the grantee from, or for the benefit
of, his principal, there is a rebuttable presumption that the
property is the property of the grantee in his individual capacity if
the grantee claims an exemption from taxation under this
subsection.
(15) A transfer made pursuant to the statutory merger or consolidation
of a corporation or statutory division of a nonprofit corporation,
except where the department reasonably determines that the
primary intent for such merger, consolidation or division is
avoidance of the tax imposed by this article.
(16) A transfer from a corporation or association of real estate held of
record in the name of the corporation or association where the
grantee owns stock of the corporation or an interest in the
association in the same proportion as his interest in or ownership of
the real estate being conveyed and where the stock of the
corporation or the interest in the association has been held by the
grantee for more than two years.
(17) A transfer from a nonprofit industrial development agency or
authority to a grantee of property conveyed by the grantee to that
agency or authority as security for a debt or the grantee or a
transfer to a nonprofit industrial development agency or authority.

authority to a grantee purchasing directly from it, but only if:
(a) The grantee shall directly use such real estate for the primary
purpose of manufacturing, fabricating, compounding,
§ 414-23 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 414-23
1:359
processing, publishing, research and development,
transportation, energy conversion, energy production,
pollution control, warehousing or agriculture; and
(b) The agency or authority has the full ownership interest in the
real estate transferred.
(19) A transfer by a mortgagor to the holder of a bona fide mortgage in
default in lieu of a foreclosure or a transfer pursuant to a judicial
sale in which the successful bidder is the bona fide holder of a
mortgage, unless the holder assigns the bid to another person.

persons holding title for a religious organization if such real estate
is not being or has not been used by such transfer or for
commercial purposes.
(21) A transfer to a conservancy which possesses a tax exempt status
pursuant to Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of
1954, [68A Stat. 3, 26 U.S.C. § 501(c)(3)] and which has as its
primary purpose preservation of land for historic, recreational,
scenic, agricultural or open space opportunities; or a transfer from
such a conservancy to the United States, the commonwealth or to
any of their instrumentalities, agencies or political subdivisions; or
any transfer from such a conservancy where the real estate is
encumbered by a perpetual agricultural conservation easement as
defined by the act of June 30, 1981 (P.L. 128, No. 43), known as the
"Agricultural Area Security Law," and such conservancy has owned
the real estate for at least two years immediately prior to the

interest in a real estate company, family farm corporation or family
farm partnership which owns real estate.
(25) A transaction wherein the tax due is $1 or less.
(26) Leases for the production or extraction of coal, oil, natural gas or
minerals and assignments thereof.
B. In order to exercise any exclusion provided in this section, the true, full
and complete value of the transfer shall be shown on the statement of
value. A copy of the Pennsylvania Realty Transfer Tax Statement of

or transfer of assets that are devoted to the business of agriculture, it

Indiana during the tax year. Each natural person who exercises such

The tax shall be no more than $52 on each person for each calendar year,

§ 414-47. Exemptions and refunds.

(1) Any person who has served in any war or armed conflict in which

released under honorable circumstances from active service if, as a
result of military service, the person is blind, paraplegic or a double
or quadruple amputee or has a service-connected disability
declared by the United States Veterans' Administration or its

Reserve, United States Navy Reserve, United States Marine Corps

person reasonably expects to receive earned income and net profits
from all sources within the political subdivision of less than
$12,000 in the calendar year for which the exemption certificate is
§ 414-46 INDIANA CODE § 414-47
1:370
filed. In the event the political subdivision utilizes a tax collection
officer, it shall provide a copy of the exemption certificate to that
officer. The exemption certificate shall have attached to it a copy
of all the employee's last pay stubs or W-2 forms from employment
within the political subdivision for the year prior to the fiscal year
for which the employee is requesting to be exempted from the
tax. Upon receipt of the exemption certificate and until otherwise
instructed by the political subdivision or except as required by
Subsection B(2), the employer shall not withhold the tax from the
person during the calendar year or the remainder of the calendar
year for which the exemption certificate applies. Employers shall
ensure that the exemption certificate forms are readily available to
employees at all times and shall furnish each new employee with a
form at the time of hiring. The exemption certificate form shall be
the uniform form provided by the political subdivision.
(2) With respect to a person who claimed an exemption for a given
calendar year from the tax, upon notification to an employer by the
person or by the political subdivision that the person has received
earned income and net profits from all sources within the political
subdivision equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that calendar year or
that the person is otherwise ineligible for the tax exemption for that
calendar year, or upon an employer's payment to the person of
earned income within the municipality in an amount equal to or in
excess of $12,000 in that calendar year, an employer shall withhold
the local services tax from the person under Subsection B(3).
(3) If a person who claimed an exemption for a given calendar year
from the tax becomes subject to the tax for the calendar year under
Subsection B(2), the employer shall withhold the tax for the
remainder of that calendar year. The employer shall withhold from
the person, for the first payroll period after receipt of the
notification under Subsection B(2), a lump sum equal to the amount
of tax that was not withheld from the person due to the exemption
claimed by the person under this subsection, plus the per-payroll
amount due for that first payroll period. The amount of tax withheld
per payroll period for the remaining payroll periods in that
calendar year shall be the same amount withheld for other
employees. In the event the employment of a person subject to
withholding of the tax under this subsection is subsequently
severed in that calendar year, the person shall be liable for any
outstanding balance of tax due, and the political subdivision may
pursue collection under this article.

1:371
§ 414-48. Duty of employers to collect.
for any tax paid by any person who is eligible for exemption, which
procedures shall be in accord with provisions of the general municipal
law relating to refunds of overpayments and interest on overpayments.
Refunds made within 75 days of a refund request or 75 days after the
last day the employer is required to remit the tax for the last quarter of
the calendar year, whichever is later, shall not be subject to interest. No
refunds shall be made for amounts overpaid in a calendar year that do

employers situated outside the political subdivision but who engage in
business within the political subdivision, is hereby charged with the
duty of collecting the tax from each of his employees engaged by him or
performing for him within the political subdivision and making a return
and payment thereof to the Collector. Further, each employer is hereby
authorized to deduct this tax for each employee in his or her employ,
whether said employee is paid by salary, wage or commission and
whether or not all such services are performed within the political
subdivision.
B. A person subject to the tax shall be assessed by the employer a pro rata
share of the tax for each payroll period in which the person is engaging
in an occupation. The pro rata share of the tax assessed on the person
for a payroll period shall be determined by dividing the rate of the tax
levied for the calendar year by the number of payroll periods
established by the employer for the calendar year. For purposes of
determining the pro rata share, an employer shall round down the
amount of the tax collected each payroll period to the nearest onehundredth
of a dollar. Collection of the tax shall be made on a payrollperiod
basis for each payroll period in which the person is engaging in
an occupation, except as provided in Subsection D of this section. For
purposes of this subsection, "combined rate" shall mean the aggregate
annual rate of the tax levied by the school district and the municipality.
C. No person shall be subject to the payment of the local services tax by
more than one political subdivision during each payroll period.
D. In the case of concurrent employment, an employer shall refrain from
withholding the tax if the employee provides a recent pay statement
from a principal employer that includes the name of the employer, the
length of the payroll period and the amount of the tax withheld and a
statement from the employee that the pay statement is from the
employee's principal employer and the employee will notify other
employers of a change in principal place of employment within two
weeks of its occurrence. The employee's statement shall be provided on
the form approved by DCED.
§ 414-47 INDIANA CODE § 414-48
1:372
§ 414-49. Returns.
Each employer shall prepare and file a return showing a computation of the
tax on forms to be supplied to the employer by the Collector. If an employer
fails to file the return and pay the tax, whether or not the employer makes
collection thereof from the salary, wages or commissions paid by him or her
to an employee, except as provided hereafter in this article, the employer
shall be responsible for the payment of the tax in full as though the tax had
been originally levied against the employer.
§ 414-50. Dates for determining tax liability and payment.
In each tax year, each employer shall use his or her employment records to
determine the number of employees from whom such tax shall be deducted
and paid over to the Collector on or before the 30th day following the end
of each calendar quarter of each such tax year.
§ 414-51. Self-employed individuals.
Each self-employed individual who performs services of any type or kind
or engages in any occupation or profession within a primary place of
employment within the political subdivision shall be required to comply with
this article and pay the pro rata portion of the tax due to the Collector on or
before the 30th day following the end of each quarter.
§ 414-52. Individuals engaged in more than one occupation or
employed in more than one political subdivision.
E. The tax shall be no more than $52 on each person for each calendar
year, irrespective of the number of political subdivisions within which a
person may be employed. The political subdivision shall provide a
taxpayer a receipt of payment upon request by the taxpayer.
F. No employer shall be held liable for failure to withhold the tax or for the
payment of the withheld tax money to the political subdivision if the
failure to withhold taxes arises from incorrect information submitted by
the employee as to the employee's place or plates of employment, the
employee's principal office or where the employee is principally
employed. Further, an employer shall not be liable for payment of the
local services tax in an amount exceeding the amount withheld by the
employer if the employer complies with the provisions of § 414-47B of
this article and this section and remits the amount so withheld in
accordance with this article.
G. Employers shall be required to remit the local services taxes 30 days
after the end of each quarter of a calendar year.
A. The situs of the tax shall be the place of employment on the first day the
person becomes subject to the tax during each payroll period. In the
event a person is engaged in more than one occupation, that is,
concurrent employment, or an occupation which requires the person

of business outside of the political subdivision but who perform services
of any type or kind or engage in any occupation or profession within the
political subdivision do, by virtue thereof, agree to be bound by and subject
themselves to the provisions, penalties and regulations promulgated under
this article with the same force and effect as though they were residents of
the political subdivision. Further, any individual engaged in an occupation
within the political subdivision and an employee of a nonresidential
employer may, for the purpose of this article, be considered a self-employed
person, and in the event his or her tax is not paid, the political subdivision
shall have the option of proceeding against either the employer or employee
for the collection of this tax as hereinafter provided.
§ 414-54. Administration of tax.
working in more than one political subdivision during a payroll period,
the priority of claim to collect the local services tax shall be in the
following order:
(1) First, the political subdivision in which a person maintains his or
her principal office or is principally employed;
(2) Second, the political subdivision in which the person resides and
works if the tax is levied by that political subdivision;
(3) Third, the political subdivision in which a person is employed and
which imposes the tax nearest in miles to the person's home.
B. In case of dispute, a tax receipt of the taxing authority for that calendar
year declaring that the taxpayer has made prior payment constitutes
prima facie certification of payment to all other political subdivisions.
A. The Collector shall be appointed by resolution of the political
subdivision. It shall be the duty of the Collector to accept and receive
payments of this tax and to keep a record thereof showing the amount
received by him from each employer of self-employed person, together
with the date the tax was received.
B. The Collector is hereby charged with the administration and
enforcement of this article and is hereby charged and empowered,
subject to municipal approval, to proscribe, adopt and promulgate rules
and regulations relating to any matter pertaining to the administration
and enforcement of this article, including provisions for the
examination of payroll records of any employer subject to this article,
the examination and correction of any return made in compliance with
this article and any payment alleged or found to be incorrect or as to
which overpayment is claimed or found to have occurred. Any person
aggrieved by any decision of the Collector shall have the right to appeal
consistent with the Local Taxpayers Bill of Rights under Act 50 of 1998.

this article, or whoever refuses inspection of the books, records or accounts
in his or her custody and control setting forth the number of employees
subject to this tax who are in his or her employment, or whoever fails or
refuses to file any return required by this article shall be guilty of a violation
and, upon conviction thereof, shall be sentenced to pay a fine of not more
than $600 and costs of prosecution, and, in default of payment of such
fine and costs, to imprisonment for not more than 30 days. The action to
enforce the penalty herein prescribed may be instituted against any person
in charge of the business of any employer who shall have failed or who
refuses to file a return required by this article.
§ 414-57. Construal of provisions.
C. The Collector is hereby authorized to examine the books and payroll
records of any employer in order to verify the accuracy of any return
made by an employer or, if no return was made, to ascertain the tax
due. Each employer is hereby directed and required to give the
Collector the means, facilities and opportunity for such examination.
A. In the event that any tax under this article remains due or unpaid 30
days after the due dates above set forth, the Collector may sue for the
recovery of any such tax due or unpaid under this article, together with
interest and penalty.
B. If for any reason the tax is not paid when due, interest at the rate of 6%
on the amount of such tax shall be calculated beginning with the due
date of the tax and a penalty of 5% shall be added to the flat rate of such
tax for nonpayment thereof. Where suit is brought for the recovery of
this tax or other appropriate remedy undertaken, the individual liable
therefor shall, in addition, be responsible and liable for the costs of
collection.
A. Nothing contained in this article shall be construed to empower the
political subdivision to levy and collect the tax hereby imposed on any
occupation not within the taxing power of the political subdivision
under the Constitution of the United States and the laws of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
B. If the tax hereby imposed under the provisions of this article shall be
held by any court of competent jurisdiction to be in violation of the
Constitution of the United States or of the laws of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania as to any individual, the decision of the court shall not
affect or impair the right to impose or collect said tax or the validity of
the tax so imposed on other persons or individuals as herein provided.

ordinances inconsistent herewith are hereby repealed. Nothing herein shall
be construed to repeal the imposition and collection of any occupational
privilege tax, plus applicable penalties and interest, or of an emergency and
municipal services tax, plus applicable penalties and interest, it being the
intention of this article that the Borough of Indiana shall be permitted to
collect any taxes due and owing under those prior ordinances in accordance

remove or prune, or direct to be removed or pruned, any tree or part of
a tree that poses a hazard to public safety as further described in
§ 427-4F, § 424-4G, § 427-4H, and § 427-4I.
B. Adopt policies to control tree pruning, cabling, spraying, root cutting,
and other work on trees in public areas by contractors, abutting

Commission may issue permits as described in § 427-6 of this chapter.
C. Maintain existing public trees. In carrying out maintenance work, the
Department shall adhere as closely as possible to the Borough Rules
and Regulations for Arbor Work. While maintenance of public trees is
the responsibility of the adjacent property owner, there may be
instances where tree work is contracted directly by the Borough. In
cases where such maintenance of public trees is to be carried out by a
private contractor hired by the Borough, it is the responsibility of the
Director, Borough Arborist or authorized designee to see that the rules
and regulations for Arbor Work are adhered to. It is mandatory that at
least one ISA Certified Arborist be on the job site at all times for
pruning operation only. The designation of ISA Certified Arborist is

Public Works may plant new trees or replacement trees in accordance
with the comprehensive tree and environmental plan for the Borough as
referred to in § 427-3H(2) of this chapter.
F. Notification by Commission. Whenever the Commission proposes to
plant, transplant or remove trees on any street, notice of the time and
place of the meeting at which such work is to be considered shall be
given in one newspaper of general circulation in the Borough once a
week for two weeks immediately preceding the time of the meeting. The
notice shall specify in detail the streets or portions upon which trees
are proposed to be so planted, replanted, or removed.
G. Deal with potentially hazardous trees on private property. The Code,
Planning, or Public Works Department Directors, the Borough Arborist,
or an authorized designee may order the removal, partial removal, or
treatment of any tree(s) on private property which in his/her opinion is
sufficiently diseased, damaged, or in such condition as to constitute a
potential hazard to the public, or to trees on public property. This
includes: branches, limbs, or foliage that are closer than eight feet
above a sidewalk, or closer than 16 feet above the roadway of a street
§ 427-4 INDIANA CODE § 427-4
1:384
or alley; and any branches, limbs, or foliage that obstruct or shade
the streetlights, traffic signals or signs, or view of any street or alley
intersection. When a tree or portions of a tree on private property is
infected with an infectious disease such as Dutch Elm Disease, Oak
Wilt, a severe insect infestation, or another disease that constitutes a
hazard to the public or to trees or other property, whether public or
private, the property owner shall immediately be notified of the hazard
and requested to eliminate it. Property owners shall be notified by mail
and be given 30 days from receipt of the notice to comply with the
order. The property owner may appeal the decision to Borough Council
by means of the Public Safety Committee and shall have 10 days after
receipt of the order to appeal the decision. The decision of the Council
shall be appealable as provided by law. Appeals to the Council shall
be recorded in the minutes of Borough Council, and shall include a
determination of the facts of the case. Following a determination by
the Council that a certain action shall be taken with respect to a tree,
the property owner shall have 10 days to comply. If the property owner
fails or refuses to comply, the property owner shall be subject to the
penalty specified in § 427-8 of this chapter. In addition, the Director,
Borough Arborist or an authorized designee is authorized to remove
said hazardous tree(s) or portions thereof. All costs for such work
plus 10% additional shall be assessed and, if not paid, shall be a lien
against the property in accord with § 427-8 of this chapter. [Amended

Preliminary Provisions
§ 460-1. Short title; statutory authority; scope.

§ 460-3. Community development objectives. [Amended 2-2-2016 by
Ord. No. 2016-03]
In addition to the general purposes which are the foundation of this chapter
(§ 460-2 above), the following specific community development objectives
are the basis for designing the contents of this chapter. These objectives
were identified in the 1962 to 1965 Indiana Borough Comprehensive Plan
and were reinforced in more recent planning studies such as the 2011
plan update and the 2016 Indiana Community University District Study,
with respect to land use relationships, density of population, commercial
and business requirements and an adequate and efficient arrangement of
streets and public utilities.
G. Prevent incompatible uses from intermingling with the predominant
uses in a zone district and encourage the gradual voluntary phasing out
of nonconforming uses.
H. To transition higher-intensity uses to lower-intensity uses through
setbacks, bulk regulations, screening, street wall, fencing and density
controls, and by offering permitted uses that are conducive to a
traditional neighborhood setting. [Added 2-2-2016 by Ord. No.
2016-03]
I. To effectuate the comprehensive plan and the Indiana Community
University District Study. [Added 2-2-2016 by Ord. No. 2016-03]
A. Preserve the existing character of the Borough and patterns of
residential development, including density of development, building
bulk, and open space between buildings;
B. Maintain the existing stock of well-kept housing, renovate and upgrade
deteriorated housing, and remove dilapidated or abandoned housing;
C. Encourage a variety of housing types to meet the shelter needs of all
elements of the population;
D. Coordinate with the University on its Long Range Campus Development
Plan of 2015, and support any expansion of the University into privately
held property only after careful, detailed study.
E. Support new business development by broadening the types of
enterprises that are encouraged, in line with current business needs
and directions;
F. Provide for adequate protection for housing where it abuts business
through buffering by landscaping, fences, or both placed by the
business developer;
G. Respect storm drainage and potential flooding limitations that may
affect future development;

§ 460-4. Interpretation.
§ 460-5. Conflicts with other provisions.
§ 460-6. Municipal liability and continuity.
H. Make off-street parking an integral part of any new construction project
or major renovation, and access driveways should be located to
minimize congestion and danger on adjacent streets.
A. The regulations contained in this chapter shall be held to be the
minimum required to uphold the public health, safety, morals and
general welfare.
B. The language of this chapter shall be interpreted, where doubt exists as
to the intended meaning as written and enacted, in favor of the
property owner or applicant, and against any implied extension of a
restriction.
A. Conflict. Where conflicts exist between this chapter and other
regulations of the Borough, or of a higher level of government, or with
legal restrictive covenants applied by landowners to the development of
their property, the ordinance, regulation or covenant establishing the
highest standard shall prevail. All ordinances or parts thereof in conflict
with this chapter, inconsistent with its provisions, or less restrictive are
hereby overridden to the extent necessary to give this chapter full force
and effect. This section shall not imply that the Borough has any power
to enforce restrictive covenants. However, any restrictive covenant
provisions that are less restrictive than the corresponding provisions of
this chapter shall be superseded by this chapter.
A. Municipal liability. The grant of a building permit to undertake a land
development in accordance with the terms of this chapter shall not
constitute a representation, guarantee or warranty of any kind by
Indiana Borough or by any of its officials or employees concerning the
practicality, safety, or economic success of the use, building or structure
covered by the permit, and shall create no liability upon the Borough,
its officials or employees.
B. Continuity. This chapter is intended as a continuation of Indiana
Borough Zoning Ordinance No. 1227 of 1989 and amendments thereto.
Upon adoption of this chapter, the prior zoning regulations, to the
extent they are not duplicated in this chapter, will become null and void.
The adoption of this chapter does not make legitimate development
activity illegal under provisions of the prior regulations, nor does it
annul any litigation currently being pursued or that may be pursued in
the future against such illegal activity.

Zoning District Regulations
§ 460-8. Official Zoning Map.
§ 460-9. Application of district regulations.
A. The Zoning Map, which shows graphically the edges of all the zoning
districts and identifies each by name, is an integral part of this chapter.
Copies may be bound into this Code book or may be obtained separately
from the Borough office.152 Such copies may not represent the current
status of all zoning boundaries or districts.
B. The Official Zoning Map shall be kept in the Borough office and shall be
updated by the Secretary immediately after any amendment affecting
zoning boundaries or districts has been adopted by vote of Borough
Council in accordance with the requirements of this chapter. The
Official Zoning Map shall supersede any copies of the Zoning Map when
disputes arise over boundaries or districts.
C. The Official Zoning Map shall bear the signatures of the President of
Borough Council and Secretary of the Borough, as well as the date of
adoption and ordinance number.
D. The Zoning Map shall be amended only by official action of Borough
Council at an advertised meeting, after public hearing. Any revisions to
the map not following Council action shall be a violation of this chapter
and a civil offense.
E. The Zoning Map shows district boundaries as accurately as possible
considering the Map's scale. Boundaries that appear to follow roads,
streams, railroads or property lines shall be construed to follow the
center lines of such features or be coterminous with a property line.
Where zone districts boundaries are dimensioned by reference to a
road, stream, railroad or property line, they shall be construed as
dimensioned from the feature center line or property line.
F. Where disputes arise over the exact location of a zoning boundary, the
Zoning Officer shall make the initial determination, using the rules
outlined above and a field visit to the location in question. If either or
both parties to the dispute disagree with the Zoning Officer's ruling, it
may be appealed to the Zoning Hearing Board.
A. The regulations governing development in a zone district shall apply
uniformly to every proposed development in that zone district.
B. No building, structure or land area shall, after the adoption of this
chapter, be erected, used or altered unless in conformance with the
regulations of the zone district containing the property to be developed
unless a variance has been granted by the Zoning Hearing Board
152. Editor's Note: A copy of the Zoning Map is included at the end of this chapter.

allowing specific modifications of the regulations for the proposed
development.
C. No yard or lot area shall be reduced in size or dimension so as to be less
than the minimums prescribed for the zone district where such yard or
lot is located. No yard or lot area or off-street parking space required by
one building, structure or land use shall be claimed by another building,
structure or land use.
D. Within each zone district lands, buildings, and structures shall be used
and buildings and structures shall be erected, altered or enlarged only
for any of the uses permitted by right in the particular zone district in
which such buildings, structures, and lands are located. The Zoning
Hearing Board may approve, after public hearing, any of the special
exceptions within the zone districts where they are listed, for specific
sites in accordance with the requirements of this chapter (see
§ 460-50C).
E. When a use that is not specifically listed in any zone district is proposed
for a particular location, the developer may either:
(1) Allege that the use is covered within the definition of a permitted
use or special exception already included for the zone district
where he/she hopes to build and ask the Zoning Officer for a
decision appealable to the Zoning Hearing Board; or
(2) Propose an amendment to this chapter for action by the Planning
Commission and Borough Council that would add the use in
question to those that are permitted by right or special exception in
the zone district where the development is proposed.
F. Zoning of land annexed by the Borough.
(1) Any land annexed by the Borough after the adoption of this chapter
shall be placed, from the date of annexation, in the R-1 Residential

Commission shall prepare and submit to Council a report of its
recommendations for the most appropriate zoning classification of
the annexed land.
(3) Borough Council shall submit the report to the County Planning
Commission for review and comment and shall schedule a public
hearing, following the same procedures as for any other
amendment of this chapter.
A. Districts. [Amended 9-5-2006 by Ord. No. 2006-05; 4-6-2010 by
Ord. No. 2010-02; 2-2-2016 by Ord. No. 2016-03]
§ 460-9 INDIANA CODE § 460-10
1:440
(1) Indiana Borough is hereby divided into nine zone districts as
follows:
R-1 Single-Family Residential District
R-2 Two-Family Residential District
R-3 Multifamily Residential District
U-1 University-Related Residential-Commercial District
P-1 Public District
C-1 Retail Business and Commercial District
C-2 General Business and Commercial District
M-1 Manufacturing District
MU-1 Mixed-Use District
B. The R-1 District is intended to be the most protected residential district
in the Borough, where traditional family-oriented values can flourish
and where only single-family detached dwellings are permitted for
housing. This is the largest zone district in the Borough, including the
peripheral areas around the edges and surrounding the core, removed
from traffic, business, and institutional interference. Larger lots and
well-maintained properties characterize this district.
C. The R-2 District is intended to be the location for one- and two-family
homes with supporting community facilities and services in a setting
that fosters traditional family values. This zone is convenient to
transportation routes, shopping, services and institutions and allows a
greater density of families than R-1. Dwellings are generally older and
more modest with less open space on the lot than in R-1.
D. The R-3 District is intended as a high-density residential district with all
types of housing provided for, along with a full range of community
facilities and services. While traditional family values are supported in
this district, unrelated individual and nontraditional occupancy of
dwelling units is equally encouraged. Downtown shopping and public
and religious institutions are within walking distance and major traffic
arteries abut or are within a block of the R-3 zoned areas. A mix of
housing types, greater lot coverage, and more traffic and parking
congestion mark this district.
E. The U-1 District is intended as a support zone for the University
community, by providing land principally for housing but also for retail
outlets and service businesses adjacent to the campus; and by
encouraging containment of university-generated activity to the
immediate vicinity of the campus. All types of housing are permitted
with emphasis on mixed residential/commercial development/student
housing above ground level shops. A broad array of retail, service and
institutional uses aimed at the University community are permitted.
Major streets serve this district which is characterized by student
apartments, shops, restaurants, services and parking.
§ 460-10 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 460-10
1:441
F. The P-1 Public District is intended to include publicly owned land.
Except for the contiguous property owned by Indiana University of
Pennsylvania, the areas in this zone district are scattered and represent
the current location of publicly owned land. In addition to the
University, the courthouse, Borough Building, jail, Borough
maintenance yard, three public school properties, three public parks
and recreation grounds, and the post office are located in the P-1
District.
G. The C-1 District is intended to accommodate retail sales and services in
a compact grouping promoting comparison and window shopping on
foot. Parking is provided curbside or in group parking facilities that do
not interrupt the tight grouping along the street. The area is
characterized by broad sidewalks, some vehicular and pedestrian
congestion at times, and with nearly all sales activity occurring indoors.
Properties are usually narrow along the street with considerable depth,
and little if any open space on the lot, particularly along the sides of the
buildings. Many buildings have three or more floors, with the upper
floors used for business offices, apartments or storage, or are vacant.
H. The C-2 District is intended to provide a setting for a broad range of
business uses from retail and wholesale sales, light manufacturing and
assembly, to distribution and warehousing. The district is auto oriented
and the buildings typically one story. Parking lots, truck maneuvering
space and outdoor display and storage of merchandise are accepted.
The properties are larger than in C-1 with much more open space on
each lot, often paved for parking or display. Properties are developed
individually without much relationship to neighbors. Very little
pedestrian traffic occurs between properties.
I. The M-1 District is intended to accommodate manufacturing,
fabricating, transportation and other nonretail businesses on land
adjacent to other such businesses, screened by landscaping to protect
nearby residential development, and subject to control of nuisance
infringements that might affect adjacent neighborhoods.
J. The MU-1 District is intended to promote development supporting the
university and public community; providing a mixed-use of residential
housing and neighborhood commercial and retail services. A broad
array of commercial and institutional uses are permitted. Parcels facing
residential districts will be developed as a transition property and shall
take on the characteristics of the adjacent district. Major corridors
serve this district which is characterized by student housing, shops,
restaurants and services. [Added 2-2-2016 by Ord. No. 2016-03]

A. Existing lots of record with inadequate area and/or width. The Zoning
Officer may, without referral to the Zoning Hearing Board, issue a
building permit to the owner of a lot with inadequate area and/or width
recorded prior to September 1, 1963, and located in a residential zone
district, for the erection of a single-family detached dwelling on the lot,
or for expansion of an existing building on the lot, provided: [Amended
3-2-1999 by Ord. No. 1999-02]
(1) The owner of the lot does not also own adjoining property which,
when combined with the lot, would create a conforming or less
nonconforming lot;
(2) No side yard abutting another lot shall be less than four feet in
width; no side yard abutting a street shall be less than 10 feet in
width; no rear yard shall be less than 10 feet in depth, and no front
yard shall be less than 15 feet in depth. Lot coverage shall be not
more than 40% of the lot area;
(3) A lot legally recorded prior to September 1, 1963, abutting two or
more streets and enclosing two principal buildings, at least one of
which contains dwelling units, may be subdivided so that each
building occupies its own lot with separate full width access to a
street, provided each dwelling unit will have its own off-street
parking spaces as required by this chapter and utility entrances
will be separated for each building.
B. Connection to public water and sewerage systems. Every lot containing
a building which is attached to a potable water supply shall be
connected to a public wastewater collection system.
C. Lot width and frontage.
(1) The width of a lot shall be measured along the front setback line
between side lot lines. The front setback line and front lot line
(abutting the street to which the lot has its principal access) shall
be parallel whether such lines are tangents or arcs.
(a) Within the MU-1 district, the width of a lot shall be measured
along the front setback line between side lot lines. The front
setback line and front lot line (abutting the street to which the
lot has its principal access) shall be parallel to the majority of
structures within that block whether such lines are tangents or
arcs. Final decision for the principal access shall be
determined by the Planning/Zoning Director. [Added
2-2-2016 by Ord. No. 2016-03]
§ 460-19 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 460-19

the side yard setback depth adjacent to the side street (the street
on which the lot does not front) shall be:
(a) Twice the minimum required for a side yard not abutting a
street but not less than 10 feet if the lot was recorded prior to
September 1, 1963; or
(b) Not less than the depth of the front yard for the district in
which the lot is located, unless development on adjacent lots
has established a lesser setback line.
(3) Line of sight. [Amended 6-3-2003 by Ord. No. 2003-07;
2-2-2016 by Ord. No. 2016-03]

intersections as a public safety measure to aid drivers
approaching the intersection. No obstruction shall be placed
within a sight triangle whose sides shall be lot lines which
intersect at the corner of the lot abutting the intersection in
any zoning district. At points 20 feet along each lot line
measured from the intersection of the lines, a third line
connecting such points shall be drawn to enclose the sight
triangle. Within the triangle no obstruction shall be placed that
exceeds 30 inches in height; nor shall existing obstructions
except tree trunks be increased in size or moved to further
reduce driver sight distances.
(b) A clear sight area shall be maintained at all public street
intersections as a safety measure to aid drivers approaching
the intersection. No obstruction shall be placed within the
PennDOT sight triangle which intersect at the corner of the lot
abutting the intersection. Within the triangle, no obstruction
shall be placed that exceeds 30 inches in height; nor shall

moved to further reduce driver sight distances. All line of sight
determinations shall comply with the current adopted
PennDOT Line of Site requirements table.

1:470
(1) A fence or wall may be built along a property line but all parts of
the wall or fence, including foundations, shall be on the property of
the wall or fence owner unless adjacent owners agree, in writing,
that the wall or fence may straddle the common property line. Any
hedge plantings along property lines shall be installed entirely
within the property of the owner installing the plant materials
unless adjacent owners agree, in writing, to plantings on the
common property line.
(2) Fences, walls, and perimeter hedge plantings shall be no higher
than eight feet above grade at any point within three feet of any
rear or side property line, and no more than four feet above grade
at any point within three feet of any front property line. Trees
planted along, but inside a property line, are exempt from height
restrictions. If any fence or wall has a finished or decorative side,
such side shall face the adjacent property or street if the property
is residentially zoned or the property across the street is
residentially zoned. No fence, wall, or hedge shall be so high as to
violate the provisions of § 460-19D(3) or to interfere with the vision
of drivers backing from a driveway. [Amended 5-3-2005 by Ord.
No. 2005-02; 2-2-2016 by Ord. No. 2016-03]

C. Grading.
(1) No earth moving shall be permitted in the Borough without a
permit for such work having been issued by the Zoning Office.
[Amended 2-2-2016 by Ord. No. 2016-03]
(2) Such a permit shall be issued only where such grading will be done
as part of the preparation of a property to receive new or additional
improvements for which a building permit has been issued or will
be issued concurrently with a grading permit, or where such
grading is necessary to place public facilities, such as streets or
utility lines, or to prepare lots in an approved subdivision plan for
sale for development.
(3) The application for a grading permit shall include a scaled drawing
of the property to be graded indicating the exact location and
extent of the area to be affected and the proposed maximum grades
at completion of work, together with location of surface drainage
systems and proposed treatment of graded surfaces where not
paved or occupied by structures.
(4) Graded slopes shall not exceed the following maximums:
(a) Where earth materials are excavated from areas where the
surface has not been altered for at least two years, the
maximum grade shall not exceed one-foot vertical rise to each
1 1/2 feet of horizontal run.
(b) Where earth materials are placed upon previously undisturbed
soil or grading is carried out in areas where previous earth
moving has occurred less than two years before, the maximum
grade shall not exceed one-foot vertical rise to each two feet of
horizontal run.
(c) Where soil conditions apparently will tolerate steeper grades
without sacrificing the stability of the graded slope and the
areas the slope supports, the developer shall provide a report
prepared by a registered professional engineer, bearing his
Pennsylvania seal, testifying that the soil conditions in the area
to be disturbed will tolerate grades up to a maximum slope
established by the engineer.
§ 460-23 INDIANA CODE § 460-23
1:472
(5) Areas to be built up through grading shall be keyed in to
preexisting undisturbed earth and well compacted in layers not to
exceed eight inches in thickness. The toe of a slope shall be either
graded to a natural existing drainageway or storm drain system.
Where a slope continues upward beyond the limits of grading, the
top of the graded area shall be protected from the accumulation of
stormwater by a bench sloped to a storm drain system.
(6) Slope areas not to be paved or built upon shall be planted with
erosion-resisting plant materials immediately upon completion of
grading work. Areas of the property not occupied by buildings or
paved surfaces shall be landscaped and maintained upon
completion of development.
D. Drainage.164
(1) Stormwater shall not be permitted to collect upon any portion of
any property except as part of a storm drainage retardation system,
nor flow from any property over a public street, nor over adjacent
properties without benefit of an easement for such purpose.
(2) A stormwater drainage system shall be designed and installed
when the amount of cover of the lot by buildings and/or paved
surfaces will increase as the result of new development by at least
3,500 square feet. Such increase may be accumulated over several
small increases over a period of time or one expansion. The system
shall be designed within the following parameters:
(a) The maximum water release rate after development shall be
the predevelopment two-year twenty-four-hour peak
discharge.
(b) The minimum storage capacity to accommodate
postdevelopment coverage shall be that volume required to
contain the ten-year twenty-four-hour frequency storm for
release at a rate not to exceed the predevelopment two-year
twenty-four-hour peak discharge.
(c) The maximum runoff velocity to a stream, swale or on to the
ground shall not exceed the permissible velocity as contained
in "The Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook for Indiana
County."
(d) All system designs shall use the soil cover complex method for
computing runoff contained in the Soil Conservation Service
Technical Release No. 55. "Urban Hydrology for Small
Watersheds."
(3) Any retaining walls or storm drainage structures or subsurface
drainage systems shall be designed by a registered professional

engineer and presented on drawings and in specifications prepared
by him as the basis for securing a permit to build such structures.
(4) Continuous maintenance of stormwater retention facilities,
including holding basins, inlet and outlet structures, and grass
areas surrounding the basin shall be the responsibility of the
owners of the property on which the facilities are located.
Maintenance shall include mowing of grass areas, if any, and
removal of silt and debris to assure free flow of stormwater through
the system at all times. At its option, the Borough may assume
maintenance of a stormwater facility that is abandoned or
neglected and charge the property owner for the work done.
[Added 9-8-1998 by Ord. No. 1737]
(5) Whenever a plan of lots contains a separate parcel which is
retained by the developer to provide space for facilities to retard
stormwater runoff, such parcel shall be deeded by the developer, on
or prior to the date his/her interest in the plan ceases, to the
homeowners' association to which all property owners in the plan
shall belong. The deed for each lot to be sold in the plan shall state
that the lot owner and his/her successors in interest shall be
obligated on a pro rata basis for maintaining the separate parcel
and facilities within it until relieved by action of the Borough
Council. The obligation shall include taxes assessed on the parcel,
liability insurance, and auditing expenses of the association. The
bylaws and regulations to be adopted by the association shall be
prepared by the developer and approved by the Borough Solicitor
as providing adequate protection for the Borough and the residents
of the plan. [Added 9-8-1998 by Ord. No. 1737]
A. General conditions.
(1) For purposes of this section, areas considered to be in the
"floodplain" shall be those identified as being submerged by the
one-hundred-year flood in the current Flood Insurance Study
prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
and shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), available for
inspection in the Borough office. The one-hundred-year floodplain
includes the floodway fringe and general floodplain areas.
[Amended 11-4-2014 by Ord. No. 2014-09]
(2) The "floodway" shall be considered the normal stream channel plus
the areas on either side that must be kept free of encroachment in
order that the one-hundred-year flood may be passed without
raising the water level more than one foot at any point along the
stream. The "flood fringe areas" shall be those areas on either side
of the floodway that will be submerged by the one-hundred-year
flood. The "general floodplain areas" shall be those areas that will
§ 460-23 INDIANA CODE § 460-24
1:474
likely be submerged by the one-hundred-year flood but for which
no detailed flood profiles or elevations have been developed.
(3) The Zoning Officer shall refuse to issue a building permit for any
construction or development within the one-hundred-year
floodplain unless the requirements of this section are met.
B. Any applicant proposing to develop in the floodplain shall provide a plan
of his proposal, showing existing buildings and all other improvements
on the property, property lines with bearings and distances, the run,
contours at one-foot intervals for at least 100 feet from the top of the
bank abutting his property; improvements proposed for which the
permit is being applied for, and a cross-section through the run and the
property showing existing and proposed ground elevations, building
floor elevations and the level of the one-hundred-year flood, such
mapping to be prepared and sealed by a registered engineer using
hydrologic and hydraulic engineering techniques, and tied to known
USGS benchmarks or National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929. In
addition, the engineer shall certify that the proposed construction is
designed to withstand one-hundred-year flood elevations, pressures
and uplift forces; that the proposed construction does not adversely
affect the channel capacity by creating higher levels for the onehundred-
year flood; that any proposals to alter or relocate the stream
have been reviewed and approved by the State Department of
Environmental Protection, Bureau of Dams and Waterway
Management, with notification sent to White Township, the Department
of Community and Economic Development and the Federal Insurance
Administration; and that all state and federal government permits
relative to the proposed construction have been obtained.
C. The Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) shall be interpreted as an
overlay upon the Borough Zoning Map.
(1) The following uses shall be permitted in any floodplain area,
provided the applicant can demonstrate that the proposed
construction or development will not increase the elevation of the
one-hundred-year flood at any point upstream or downstream of
this project:
(a) Public and private recreational uses not including enclosed
structures;
(b) Accessory one-family or two-family uses, including yards,
gardens and car parking on pervious surfaces or on impervious
surfaces if not in the floodway; and
(c) Accessory multifamily residential, commercial and industrial
uses such as yard areas and parking and loading areas on
impervious surfaces but not in the floodway.
(2) The following uses may be permitted in any floodplain area as
special exceptions, provided the applicant can demonstrate that
§ 460-24 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 460-24
1:475
the proposed construction or development will not increase the
elevation of the one-hundred-year flood at any location along the
stream:
(a) Any use permitted by right or as a special exception in the
underlying zoning district;
(b) Public utilities floodproofed if below the regulatory flood
elevation, and other public improvements;
(c) Temporary uses for a period not to exceed 30 days; and
(d) Storage of materials and equipment, provided that they are not
buoyant, flammable or explosive.
(3) The following uses shall be prohibited in the floodplain:
(a) Storage of any radioactive substance, or any of the following
materials in amounts exceeding 550 gallons or comparable dry
measure: acetone, ammonia, benzene, calcium carbide, carbon
disulfide, celluloid, chlorine, hydrochloric acid, hydrocyanic
acid, magnesium, nitric acid and oxides of nitrogen, petroleum
products, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, sulphur or sulphur
products and pesticides;
(b) Mobile homes; mobile home parks, or nursing homes, hospitals
or jails.
D. Existing structures in a floodplain area.
(1) The right to remain of any structure or other improvement legally
existing in any floodplain area prior to adoption of these
regulations but not in conformity with them is guaranteed.
(2) No expansion of any existing structure or any development in any
floodway area shall be permitted which will increase the elevation
of the one-hundred-year flood.
E. Variances for construction in any floodplain area and amendments to
boundaries of such areas.
(1) No variance shall be granted for any construction, development,
use or activity that would result in any increase in the one-hundredyear
flood elevation.
(2) No variance shall be granted for a prohibited use.
(3) If a variance is granted, the Zoning Hearing Board shall inform the
applicant that the variance will allow construction that could
increase the risk to life and property on his premises and that his
flood insurance premiums will be raised significantly.
(4) The boundaries of any floodplain area may be amended by the same
procedure for amending any other part of this chapter if a study
§ 460-24 INDIANA CODE § 460-24
1:476
prepared by a registered professional engineer with demonstrated
expertise in hydrology and hydraulics documents the fact that a
particular boundary should be adjusted to a specific new location
based on alterations within the one-hundred-year floodplain. Such
proposed amendment shall be approved by the FEMA before such
adoption by Council.
F. Construction standards within any floodplain area.
(1) The lowest flood elevation, including basement, of any residential
structure shall be at least 1 1/2 feet above the one-hundred-year
flood elevation.
(2) The lowest floor elevation, including basement, of any
nonresidential structure shall be at least 1 1/2 feet above the onehundred-
year flood elevation or constructed so that the space
enclosed below that elevation is completely or essentially dry in
accordance with the standards contained in the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers "Flood-proofing Regulations," published in June 1972
and as may be amended. [Amended 2-2-2016 by Ord. No.
2016-03]
(3) Graded areas receiving fill shall be no steeper than one vertical to
two horizontal, and shall extend at least 15 feet laterally from any
building wall toward a stream or drainageway. Fills shall consist of
soils or small rock materials only, shall be thoroughly compacted,
and shall be protected from erosion along banks by rip-rap,
vegetative plantings or bulkheads. Areas to receive fill shall be
stripped of topsoil prior to grading.
(4) Developed areas shall be graded so that the surface slopes away
from all building walls toward a stream or drainageway, and so that
runoff does not flow across adjacent properties.
(5) Sanitary and water systems, particularly building laterals, shall be
designed to eliminate infiltration of floodwaters and discharge from
the sanitary sewers into floodwaters.
(6) Materials that are buoyant, flammable, explosive or prohibited or
vessels containing them shall be stored at least 1 1/2 feet above the
one-hundred-year flood level.
(7) Buildings, structures and equipment shall be located to offer
minimum obstruction to stream flow and shall be securely
anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement.
(8) Interior materials used in portions of a building lower than 1 1/2
feet above the one-hundred-year flood level and not designed to be
completely dry shall be resistant to water damage. Unfinished
masonry walls and concrete floors are preferred. Any finishes or
woodwork should be marine or water-resistant quality.
§ 460-24 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 460-24
1:477
(9) All electrical, heating and other mechanical equipment shall be
located at least 1 1/2 feet above the one-hundred-year flood level
and electrical distribution panels at least three feet above.
Separate electrical circuits shall be dropped from above to serve
areas below the one-hundred-year flood level. Gas and oil supply
and water and sanitary sewerage systems within structures shall
be designed to prevent infiltration of floodwaters and to facilitate
drainage of floodwater, if infiltration does occur.
G. Definitions of terms peculiar to this section. As used in this section, the
following terms shall have the meanings indicated:
CONSTRUCTION  The building, rebuilding, renovation, repair,
extension, expansion, alteration or relocation of a building or structure,
including the placement of manufactured homes. The "start of
construction" means the first placement of permanent materials,
beyond site preparation, provided such construction starts not more
than 180 days after the issuance of a building permit.
DEVELOPMENT  Any man-made change to improved or unimproved
property, including but not limited to buildings or other structures,
the placement of mobile homes, streets; other paving, utilities, filling,
grading, excavation, dredging or drilling operations and the subdivision
of land.
FLOOD HAZARD AREA  Any area subject to the one-hundred-year
flood as delineated on the FIRM map, including both the floodway and
floodway fringe areas and areas that do not have base flood elevations
determined.
FLOODPROOFING  The incorporation of special improvements into
the design or retrofitting of a building, utility or land surface to resist
flood inundation or damage, such as those recommended improvements
contained in the Corps of Engineers publication "Flood-proofing
Regulations" (June 1972). When walls and floors below the regulatory
flood level are impermeable to passage of water or water vapor, an
interior space shall be considered "completely dry," requiring no
restrictions on interior finishes. When walls and floors are
"substantially permeable," permitting some water and vapor seepage,
an interior space shall be considered "essentially dry," requiring some
restrictions on interior finishes and contents of the space. Whether
completely or substantially dry, structures shall be constructed to resist
hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of
buoyancy.[Amended 2-2-2016 by Ord. No. 2016-03]
FLOODWAY  The area of any watercourse that includes the stream
channel, and the land on both sides that if obstructed would raise the
level of the one-hundred-year flood more than one foot.
MANUFACTURED HOME  A structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for
use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the
required utilities. For floodplain management purposes the term
§ 460-24 INDIANA CODE § 460-24
1:478
§ 460-25. Special residential uses.
"manufactured home" also includes park trailers, travel trailers and
other similar vehicles placed on a site for greater than 180 consecutive
days. For insurance purposes the term "manufactured home" does not
include park trailers, travel trailers and other similar vehicles.
MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION  A parcel of land
or contiguous parcels divided into two or more manufactured home lots
for rent or sale.
ONE-HUNDRED-YEAR FLOOD  A flood that may occur any time but
is likely to happen once every 100 years, or has a one-percent chance
of occurring in any year.
REGULATORY FLOOD ELEVATION  The one-hundred-year flood
elevation plus 1 1/2 feet.
H. The provisions of this § 460-24 do not guarantee that water levels
higher than those established as maximum will not occur, nor that
development outside areas designated as within the floodplain will not
suffer from high water. This section shall not create liability on the part
of the Borough or any of its officers or employees for any flood damages
that result from reliance on this section, or any administrative decision
lawfully made thereunder.
I. The replacement of existing work with equivalent materials for the
purpose of routine maintenance and upkeep shall be allowed in any
property within a floodplain without the need for adherence to the
requirements of this section. However, the removal or change of any
exterior wall, or structural of bearing member, or required exitway shall
adhere to the requirements of this section, as shall any alteration,
replacement or relocation of any water supply, sewage disposal, storm
drainage, gas or similar piping, or electrical wiring or other mechanical
system.

ready for occupancy upon arrival on its lot except for placement on
its foundation, attachment to utilities, and minor or incidental
unpacking and assembly operations.
(2) Mobile homes shall meet all requirements of this chapter and other
ordinances of Indiana Borough relative to single-family detached
dwellings, including but not limited to minimum lot area, depth and
frontage, setbacks from property lines, utility connections and offstreet
parking. The minimum width of a mobile home along its full
§ 460-24 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 460-25
1:479
length shall be not less than 20 feet. The wheels used in
transporting a mobile home to its site shall be removed when the
home is set upon its foundation, and the towing hitch shall be
either removed or hidden within the foundation. All mobile homes
shall meet applicable state regulations regarding construction, and
a certificate of compliance shall be shown to the Zoning Office
by the owner before the mobile home is occupied.165 [Amended
2-2-2016 by Ord. No. 2016-03]
(3) Mobile homes shall be supported upon a peripheral masonry wall
matching the exterior dimensions of the mobile home, or at least
two masonry piers located and designed to carry the full weight of
the mobile home. Walls or piers shall be built upon concrete footers
the bottom of which shall be at least three feet below finished
grade. Mobile homes shall be securely held to their foundations by
over-the-top built-in tie downs firmly imbedded in the foundation.
The space between the floor of a mobile home set on piers and the
ground below shall be enclosed by a continuous masonry wall or
metal skirting to match the exterior material of the mobile home
and such space shall be ventilated. Mobile homes shall be placed on
required foundations and skirted, if on piers, within 30 days of
arrival on the lot.
(4) No mobile home shall be occupied until it has received an

storage facilities or any of these, shall be permitted for occupancy.
No self-propelled vehicles used as living accommodations or travel
trailers designed for temporary occupancy shall be permitted for
residential purposes for a period exceeding 14 days. [Amended
2-2-2016 by Ord. No. 2016-03]
(5) Any enclosed additions added later to a mobile home or not part of
the original construction shall require a building permit and shall
match the materials and colors of the original.

occupied by unrelated individuals. The center of the circle
describing the radius shall be located at the crossing of lines

residential building is within a circle whose radius is 30% of the
tower's height above ground level.
(3) Before considering erection of a tower, the proposer shall make
every effort, and document that effort, to secure a location for his/
her equipment on an existing steeple, bell tower, light tower,
chimney, stack or other elevation location that provides acceptable
height.
(4) Before a tower, other than the first to be erected, can be approved,
the proposer shall make every effort, and document that effort, to
secure a location for his/her equipment on an existing tower.
(5) A proposed tower may be located on the same property that
contains the offices and facilities of the owner and operator of the
tower. However, if the tower is not so located, it shall be the sole
occupant, with any accessory structures, of a lot that at least meets
the minimum lot size and setback requirements of the zone district
in which it is located.
(6) The base of the tower, or the entire property on which the tower is
located, shall be surrounded by a chain link fence not less than
eight feet high. Guy anchor foundations if any shall be enclosed
behind the chain link fence on the property, or enclosed separately
by the same type and height of fence.
(7) Between the property lines surrounding the lot on which a tower is
located and the base of the tower, a dense planting of evergreen
trees not more than 15 feet on center shall be placed with a height
when planted of not less than four feet. Where buildings on the
same property are located between the property line and the tower,
such buildings may be used as part of the screen to the extent they
block the view of the tower base from adjacent properties and
streets.
(8) No tower shall be lighted, except as may be required by the Federal
Aviation Administration, and shall carry no advertising.
(9) When and if a tower is abandoned, it shall be demolished by the
then current owner within six months of the date of the
deactivation of the last piece of operating equipment on the tower.
Removal shall include all anchors, foundation and ground level
structures. Whenever the ownership of a tower changes, it shall be
the responsibility of the succeeding owner to inform the Borough
Zoning Office of the change and to submit to the Office the name,
address and phone number of the new owner, and the name of a
contact person. [Amended 2-2-2016 by Ord. No. 2016-03]

§ 460-29. Applicability; purpose.
The following sign regulations shall be observed in all districts. It is not
the purpose of this section to abridge commercial or noncommercial free

and manner of sign placement within the Borough is conducted with regard
to the safety of motorists and pedestrians (especially in avoiding
distractions or confusion in high-traffic areas), access to light and air by
neighboring properties, and avoidance of negative impact upon neighboring
properties, including unnecessary glare.

position, shape, or color, it may interfere with or obstruct the view of or
be confused with any authorized traffic sign, signal or device. Sign
structures erected directly upon the ground within 15 feet of any
vehicular driveway or street intersection shall meet all PennDOT
standards. [Amended 2-2-2016 by Ord. No. 2016-03]
F. No signs shall be permitted which are posted, stapled, or otherwise
attached to public utility poles or trees.

§ 460-32.4 INDIANA CODE § 460-32.4
1:502
G. Permanent window signs. Permanent window signs are permitted in the
C-1, C-2, and U-1 Districts by right without a permit provided no more
than 50% of each window surface and 25% of all building windows
include such a signs. Such permanent window signs do not count
towards the allowed number of signs per district.
H. Projection of permanent signs into rights-of-way.
(1) Within the C-1 District, a sign attached to a building, otherwise
lawful under § 460-32.4C, may project into the public right-of-way
up to six feet, provided:
(a) No structural support or portion of the sign is within eight feet
of grade as measured vertically from the right-of-way line for a
pedestrian right-of-way and 14 feet of grade for a vehicular
right-of-way.
(b) Under no circumstances shall any portion of such projecting
signs be placed nearer than two feet to a vehicular cart way,
loading zone, or on-street parking lane.
(c) No such projecting sign may be attached to a portion of a
building fronting on Philadelphia Street.
(2) Awning and canopy signs may project into rights-of-way in areas
served by sidewalks, but shall be subject to the following
regulations
(a) No portion of an awning or canopy shall be less than eight feet
above the level of the public sidewalk.
(b) No awning or canopy shall be permitted within four feet of the
curb.
(c) Awnings and canopies shall be constructed of canvas, vinyl, or
similar flexible, cloth-like material. Backlit signs or signs on
metal awnings or canopies are prohibited within the rights-ofway.
(d) Awnings and canopies shall be securely attached to the
building. All frames and supports shall be made of metal or
other rigid material.
(e) The name of the business or logo may be printed on the portion
of the awning or canopy above the valance and shall be limited
to one awning or canopy only, except in the case of a corner lot
where one awning or canopy with printing above each valance
shall be permitted on each street frontage; such name or logo
printed above the valance shall be limited as follows:
[1] Lettering shall be limited to 25% of the awning or canopy,
as measured from the point of attachment to the building
to the bottom of the fully extended awning or canopy
§ 460-32.4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 460-32.4
1:503
excluding the valance. Letters shall be limited to 50% of
the width of the awning or canopy.
[2] A logo shall be limited to 50% of the height of the awning
or canopy, as measured from the point of the attachment to
the building to the bottom of the fully extended awning or
canopy.
I. Electronic signs. The inherent characteristic of electronic signs is their
flexibility. The frequently changing messages coupled with their
characteristic brightness can create an undue distraction to motorists.
Signs with video, LED displays, or similar electronic changeable copy
messages are permitted as a special exception only in the C-2 and M-1
Zoning Districts.
(1) The sub-type of electronic signs shall be identified in accordance
with definitions provided for in this article. The developer shall
submit a programming plan that shows any proposed use of
animations, length of exposure for any message, and transition
time or proposed effects between individual messages. This shall
include estimated motorist reaction time to proposed messages and
symbols, based upon the United States Sign Council's On-Premise
Signs Guideline Standards, 2003 or most recent edition. For
planning purposes, the developer should assume all driving
environments in the Borough are "complex" as defined in the
guideline standards, except for multilane streets (such as
Philadelphia Street), which should be considered as such. The
Borough Council may establish limits upon use of any special
effects, transitions, or length of message exposure as a reasonable
additional condition and safeguard to the special exception.
(2) Electronic sign content. Electronic signs may contain permanent
content about any business located on the premises upon which the
sign is placed. They may also contain temporary messages with
content about such businesses, or temporary messages announcing
a campaign, drive, or event of a civic, philanthropic, educational or
religious organization, provided that such message is changed
upon the cessation of such a campaign, drive, or event. Electronic
signs may also contain messages permitted for temporary signs as
authorized under § 460-30C and D of this chapter. Electronic signs
may function as billboards only in the M-1 Zoning District.
(3) Electronic signs may be freestanding, facade, or wall signs; such a
sign shall meet all size, area, and setback limitations for the district
for which it is proposed. The size of an electronic sign shall be
calculated based upon the surface dimensions that have the ability
to display a symbol or message.
(4) Multi-vision signs are only permitted in the M-1 District.
§ 460-32.4 INDIANA CODE § 460-32.4
1:504
(5) Additional setback from residential districts. All portions of the sign
structure must be a minimum distance of 100 feet from an abutting
R-1, R-2, or R-3 Residential District boundary.
(6) Setback from other electronic changeable copy, electronic graphic
display or video display signs. Electronic signs must be separated
from other electronic signs by at least 35 feet. No more than one
electronic sign is permitted per each property, regardless of how
many tenants occupy that lot.
(7) Orientation. When located within 150 feet of a residentially used lot
in an R-1, R-2 or R-3 Residential Zone, all parts of the electronic
changeable copy sign must be oriented so that no portion of the
sign face is visible from an existing or permitted principal structure
on that lot.
(8) Audio or pyrotechnics. Audio speakers or any form of pyrotechnics
are prohibited in association with an electronic sign.
(9) The Borough may limit the hours of illumination or operation of
electronic signs within 200 feet of any occupied dwelling in an R-1,
R-2, or R-3 Residential District if a dwelling within the Residential
District is within view of the proposed sign.
(10) The developer shall show compliance with all applicable
regulations of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation for
any proposed sign abutting a state highway.
(11) All multi-vision signs shall have a transition time between sign
faces of no more than two seconds.
(12) The developer shall show the ability to meet illumination standards
under § 460-32.4D of this article. The developer shall present
material detailing any differences in proposed LED light as
compared to standard light measurement.
J. Billboards. Billboards as defined by this article are a special exception
in the M-1 Zoning District. Such signs shall not exceed any dimensional
requirement for the M-1 District as stated in § 460-32.4C. In addition,
the proposed billboard must meet all lighting and setback requirements
for electronic signs under § 460-32.4I.

other use, off-street parking in accordance with the requirements of this
article at the time the use is erected, enlarged or increased in capacity.
When several businesses or other uses share the same property, a common

nonconforming operation shall establish the date of discontinuance. A
good faith-active effort backed by written documentation on the part of

indicate an intent not to abandon. However, no active attempt to sell, or
lack of documentation, shall indicate an attempt to abandon.
C. The property owner may petition the Zoning Hearing Board for an
extension of up to nine additional months if he/she can prove illness or
financial crisis have created a hardship.

certificate shall be obtained from the Zoning Officer. [Amended
5-3-2005 by Ord. No. 2005-02]
D. When a nonconforming use of a building or structure and outside area
of the same property exist in combination, the removal of the building
or structure shall terminate the nonconforming use of the premises
unless the owner files notice with the Zoning Officer that he/she intends
to replace the building or structure within one year of the date of
removal. The same shall apply to the removal of the nonconforming use
from the building or structure.

not, the Zoning Officer shall refer the owner to the Planning
Commission for a decision on the proposed changed use.

approval from the Zoning Office before commencing operation, to
assure that the use will be operated in the same manner as formerly. If
not, the Zoning Office shall refer the owner to the Zoning Hearing
Board for a decision on the proposed changed use. [Amended
2-2-2016 by Ord. No. 2016-03]

is permitted in the zone district where the property is located, he/she
may commence and complete construction within six months of getting
the permit, and may apply for permit renewals, even though this
chapter may be amended after the permit is issued that makes the use

ARTICLE VIII
Zoning Hearing Board
§ 460-49. Operation of Board.
A. Membership of the Zoning Hearing Board.
(1) Number; appointment; terms.
(a) The membership of the Board shall be five persons, all
residents of Indiana Borough, who shall be appointed by
resolution of Borough Council and may succeed themselves.
(b) Council may reduce the number of members to three, at its
option, by advertising as for a public hearing its intent to
reduce the membership at a specific regular meeting and then
by resolution, approved by a majority of the full Council, taking
such action. Existing terms shall be allowed to expire and
future terms of the three-member Board shall be for three
years with one appointment to fill an expired term each year.
(2) Members of the Board shall hold no other office in Indiana
Borough, either elective or appointed.
(3) Members of the Board shall be appointed for five-year staggered
terms, with not more than one appointment each year not later
than the March regular meeting of Council to refill a completed
term.
(4) Any member may be reappointed to another five-year term when a
preceding term is completed.
(5) Appointments to fill vacancies shall be made by Council for the
unexpired portion of a term only. The Zoning Hearing Board shall
promptly notify Council when a vacancy occurs.
B. Alternate members.
(1) Council may appoint by resolution one, two or three persons who
are residents of Indiana Borough as alternate members of the
Zoning Hearing Board for three-year terms. Such person or
persons may, at the direction of the Hearing Board Chairman,
replace a regular member who is unable to participate at the
beginning of a proceeding before the Board, and shall during the
proceeding function with the full authority of a regular Board
member. Alternate members shall serve on a case-by-case basis in
rotation beginning with the first alternate appointed.
(2) Such alternates shall hold no other office in Indiana Borough,
either elective or appointed. Any alternate may participate in any
proceeding or discussion of the Board but shall not be entitled to
vote unless designated as a voting replacement member.
§ 460-49 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 460-49
1:523
C. Removal of members.
(1) Any Board member may be removed for malfeasance, misfeasance
or nonfeasance in office or for other just cause by a majority vote of
the Borough Council, taken after the Board member has received at
least 15 days notice such vote will be taken.
(2) "Malfeasance" implies a deliberate illegal act; "misfeasance" means
acting mistakenly when there is a clearly correct way to act; and
"nonfeasance" means failure to act when an act is required.
Generally a pattern of misfeasance or nonfeasance could result in
Borough Council action, but one alleged act of malfeasance would
be sufficient for Council investigation.
(3) The Board member thus accused may request, by written
communication to the Borough Secretary no later than 15 days
prior to the meeting of the Council at which the vote for removal is
to be taken, hearing before Council after which Council, at its
discretion, may take a vote for removal of the Board member.
D. Organization of the Board.
(1) The Board shall elect officers from among its membership, to
include a Chairman and Vice Chairman.
(2) The Secretary shall call for a hearing upon receiving notice that a
request for a hearing has been made.
(3) The Board shall reorganize at its first meeting in each calendar
year.
(4) Board members may succeed themselves in their positions.
(5) The Chairman shall chair all meetings of the Board.
(6) The Vice Chairman shall act in the absence of the Chairman.
(7) A quorum shall be not less than a majority of all members of the
Board.
(8) The Board may make, alter, or rescind rules and forms for its
procedure consistent with this and other ordinances of Indiana
Borough and the law of the commonwealth.
(9) In conducting its business, the Board shall utilize Roberts Rules of
Order when procedural conflicts arise that are not addressed by
this article.
E. Secretary of the Board.
(1) Borough Council shall annually, not later than the March regular
meeting, appoint or reappoint the Secretary of the Zoning Hearing
Board, who shall not be a member of the Board.
§ 460-49 INDIANA CODE § 460-49
1:524
(2) The Secretary shall be responsible for scheduling public hearings,
placing of newspaper and letter notices and posting properties
affected by variance or special exception requests. In addition, the
Secretary shall arrange for a stenographer to record hearing
testimony verbatim, and shall distribute copies of the hearing
record requested by the parties.
(3) The Secretary shall keep minutes of the Board's proceedings,
noting the vote of each member on every motion, and shall
distribute the Board's decisions.
(4) A written record, noting the location and exact nature of each
variance and special exception, shall be kept by the Secretary and
be a public record.
(5) The Secretary shall keep full public records of the Board's business
and shall submit reports to Borough Council on the Board's actions
within 30 days after each action is taken.
F. Conflicts of interest.
(1) A member who has a conflict of interest with a case to be heard
shall excuse himself/herself from the hearing, in which case an
alternate, if such exists, may be appointed by the Chairman to hear
the case in place of the excused member.
(2) When the Board is unable to produce a quorum (three members) to
conduct a hearing because of conflict of interest, illness or
previously planned absence from the municipality, and sufficient
alternate members are not available, for the same reasons, to
complete the quorum, the Chairman may appoint one of the
available members or designate himself as a Hearing Officer to act
on behalf of the Board.
(3) The Hearing Officer shall conduct the hearing, and the parties to
the hearing, including the Borough, may prior to release of the
findings or decision, mutually agree to waive further action by the
Board as a whole and accept the findings or decision of the Hearing
Officer as final.
G. Expenditures for services.
(1) Within the limits of its annual budget, the Board may employ
secretarial, legal, technical, or other consulting services to assist it
in carrying out its duties.
(2) In setting fees for public hearings, Council may not include the
costs of legal services for the Board or expenses for technical
consultants or expert witnesses.
(3) The attorney retained by Borough Council shall not also provide
legal services for the Zoning Hearing Board.
§ 460-49 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 460-50
1:525
§ 460-50. Functions of Board.
A. General rules.
(1) Before acting on any request for a decision, the Zoning Hearing
Board shall consider the recommendations of the Planning
Commission which shall review each request and indicate to the
Board, as expressed in its meeting minutes, a favorable,
unfavorable or conditional reaction to the request, as well as a
record of its discussion on the matter.
(2) If the Board approves an action that will authorize the issuance of a
building permit, such a permit shall be in the possession of the
applicant within six months of the date of the Board's decision
unless the Board's decision grants a specific longer delay.
(3) If the Board denies an action, the applicant or his agent may not
resubmit the same or substantially the same request for action for
at least one year after the date of denial unless the Board
determines conditions affecting the application, such as changes in
the State Planning Code, warrant a rehearing.
B. Appeals from decisions of the Zoning Officer.
(1) The Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged by the
appellant that the Zoning Office has failed to follow prescribed
procedures or has misrepresented or misapplied any provision of
any ordinance governing land development adopted by Indiana
Borough. [Amended 2-2-2016 by Ord. No. 2016-03]
(2) Appeals may include, but are not limited to, the granting or denial
of a permit or failure to act on the application therefor; the
issuance or failure to issue any cease and desist order; or failure to
administer or improper administration of the flood hazard area
regulations.
C. Variances.
(1) The Board shall hear requests for variances where it is alleged that
the provisions of this chapter inflict unnecessary hardship upon the
applicant.
(2) Variance from the terms of this chapter shall not be granted by the
Board unless a written application for a variance is submitted in
advance of the hearing to the Secretary of the Board demonstrating
all of the following findings where relevant:
(a) That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including but not limited to irregularity, narrowness or
shallowness of lot size or shape or exceptional topographical or
other physical conditions peculiar to the particular property
and that the unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions
and not the circumstances or conditions generally created by
§ 460-50 INDIANA CODE § 460-50
1:526
the provisions of this chapter in the neighborhood in which the
property is located;
(b) That, because of such physical circumstances or conditions,
there is no possibility that the property can be developed in
strict conformity with the provisions of this chapter and that
the authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to enable
the reasonable use of the property;
(c) That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
appellant; and
(d) That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood in which the property is located
nor substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or
development of adjacent property nor be detrimental to the
public welfare.
(3) In addition to the written statement described above, the applicant
shall submit a sketch plan prepared by a registered surveyor
showing the location of all boundary lines on the property proposed
for the variance, the position of building walls, and the required
and proposed dimensions between boundary line and wall that are
the subject of the variance.
(4) If authorized, the variance shall represent the least deviation from
the regulations that will afford relief and will represent the least
modification possible of the regulation in question.
(5) In granting a variance the Board may attach appropriate conditions
necessary to protect the intent of this chapter, the Comprehensive
Plan of Indiana Borough and the public health and safety.
D. Special exceptions.
(1) Special exceptions are listed for each zone district in Article III of
this chapter. Only those uses expressly listed as special exceptions
in a particular zone district may be considered for property within
that zone district.
(2) A landowner proposing a special exception to a particular property
shall submit a written statement and a site plan in support of the
project to the Zoning Hearing Board with copies of each provided
to the Board. [Amended 5-3-2005 by Ord. No. 2005-02]

considering the site, that the following concerns will be addressed:
(a) The applicant is the owner of record of the property to receive
the proposed use;

detailed description of all aspects of the use;
§ 460-50 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 460-50

[Amended 2-2-2016 by Ord. No. 2016-03]
(g) The use will not create excessive traffic congestion or
dangerous conditions on streets abutting the property, unless
such congestion or dangerous conditions will be mitigated by
off-site improvements provided by the developer;
(h) Areas of the property to be disturbed but not to be covered by
buildings, driveways or parking will be landscaped and
maintained;
(i) Adequate off-street parking will be provided on the same
property as the use, in accordance with Article VI; and
(j) Access points to the property will be located as remote as
possible from street intersections, and adequate sight
distances will be available at access points for entering and
departing vehicles as well as for through traffic on abutting
roads.
(4) The accurately drawn and scaled illustrative site plan shall show
the arrangement of the proposed use on the site, including:
(a) Property lines around the periphery of the site;
(b) Uses on adjacent properties and across streets abutting the
applicant's property;
(c) Abutting streets, including paved and right-of-way widths and
intersections;

(5) The Planning Commission shall review the written statement and
plan, and shall make recommendations to the Zoning Hearing
Board. The Commission's meeting minutes shall indicate that the
Commission views the proposal favorably, with reservations, or
without comments, and may include conditions recommended to be
attached to the Board's approval.
(6) The Zoning Hearing Board shall review the applicants presentation
and shall approve, deny, or approve with conditions, the proposed
special exception. Conditions shall be noted on the building permit
issued to erect the special exception. If the applicant does not
accept any or all of the conditions, the application shall be
considered denied. The conditions shall be designed to protect the
intent of this chapter and the public health and safety. [Amended
5-3-2005 by Ord. No. 2005-02]
(7) Expansion of special exceptions.
(a) When approving a special exception application, the Board
shall be specific about exactly what is approved. Approval may

agreed to by the Board, but only for specific expansions on land
already owned by the applicant or under option to be
purchased by him/her.
(b) Any expansion proposed after the initial specific approval shall
require reapplication to the Board for approval.
(c) Any property in a use which is listed as a special exception in
Article III of this chapter for the zone district where the

subsequent amendment affecting the property, may continue to
operate as usual, but if the owner proposes to expand the use,
he/she shall apply to the Board for special exception approval.
E. Challenges to the validity of this chapter.
(1) The Board shall hear substantive challenges to the validity of this
chapter, except those brought as curative amendments, which shall
be considered by Borough Council; and challenges raising
procedural questions or alleged defects in the process of
enactment or adoption of an ordinance or an amendment, provided
§ 460-50 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 460-50
1:529
such challenge is brought to the Board within 30 days after the
effective date of the ordinance or amendment.
(2) A substantive challenge may be brought by a landowner who
contends that any part of a land development ordinance prohibits
or restricts the proposed use or development of his land, or by
persons aggrieved by a use or development permitted on lands of
another party by any part of such an ordinance.
(3) The appellant shall file a written request with the Secretary of the
Board for a hearing on his challenge. Such a request shall include
the reasons for the challenge, the use or development proposed in
lieu of that permitted by the challenged section of the ordinance,
and other relevant materials in support of the challenge.
(4) In making its decision on a substantive challenge, the Board shall
consider, in addition to the filed statement, evidence of the impact
of the proposed use or development on municipal services and
facilities; the extent to which the use or development provides lowand/
or moderate-income housing units if it is a residential plan; the
suitability of the site for the proposed intensity of the use; and the
effect of the development or use upon soils, slopes, woodlands,
drainage, floodplains, aquifers, and natural features.
(5) If the Board finds the challenge has merit, the Board's decision
shall include recommended amendments to the challenged
ordinance which will cure the defects found.
(6) The public notice on a hearing for a challenge shall state that the
validity of the ordinance is challenged and shall specify the specific
part of the particular ordinance whose validity is in question. The
notice shall also indicate where and when plans, documents and/or
proposed amendments may be examined prior to the hearing.
(7) The challenge shall be deemed to have been denied if the Board
fails to commence the hearing within 60 days of receiving the
request, or the Board fails to act on the request within 45 days after
the end of the hearing.
F. Determinations upon nonconforming uses.
(1) The Board shall hear appeals when an applicant proposes to
change an existing legitimate nonconforming use to a second
nonconforming use.

the proposed nonconforming use is more compatible with the uses
permitted in the zone district than the preceding nonconforming
use and will not downgrade the neighborhood of which it is a part.

In this case, suspension will occur only by a restraining order granted
by the Board or Indiana County Court. When an application for
development has been duly approved, and proceedings intended to
reverse or limit the approval are filed with the Board by persons other

1:541
§ 460-60. Conditional uses. [Added 5-3-2005 by Ord. No. 2005-04]
A. Filing of conditional use. For any use permitted by conditional use, a
conditional use must be obtained from the Borough Council. In addition
to the information required on the zoning permit application, the
conditional use application must show:
(1) Ground floor plans and elevations of proposed structures;
(2) Names and addresses of adjoining property owners, including
properties directly across a public right-of-way;
(3) A scaled drawing (site plan) of the site with sufficient detail and
accuracy to demonstrate compliance with all applicable provisions
of this chapter; and
(4) A written description of the proposed use in sufficient detail to
demonstrate compliance with all applicable provisions of this
chapter.
B. General criteria. Each applicant must demonstrate compliance with the
following:
(1) The proposed use shall be consistent with the purpose and intent of
this chapter;
(2) The proposed use shall not detract from the use and enjoyment of
adjoining or nearby properties;
(3) The proposed use will not effect a change in the character of the
subject property's neighborhood;
(4) Adequate public facilities are available to serve the proposed use
(e.g., schools, fire, police and ambulance protection, sewer, water,
and other utilities, vehicular access, etc.);
(5) The proposed use must comply with all applicable regulations of
this chapter; and
(6) The proposed use will not substantially impair the integrity of the
Borough's Comprehensive Plan.
C. Conditions. Borough Council, in approving conditional use applications,
may attach conditions considered necessary to protect the public
welfare and the purposes listed above, including conditions which are
more restrictive than those established for other uses in the same zone.
These conditions shall be enforceable by the Zoning Office, and failure
to comply with such conditions shall constitute a violation of this
chapter and be subject to the penalties described in this chapter.
[Amended 2-2-2016 by Ord. No. 2016-03]
D. Site plan approval. Any site plan presented in support of the conditional
use pursuant to Subsection A shall become an official part of the record
for said conditional use. Approval of any conditional use will also bind
§ 460-60 INDIANA CODE § 460-60
1:542
the use in accordance with the submitted site plan; therefore, should
a change in the site plan be required as part of the approval of the
use, the applicant shall revise the site plan prior to the issuance of
a building permit. Any subsequent change to the use on the subject
property not reflected on the originally approved site plan shall require
the obtainment of another conditional use approval.
E. Hearing procedures.
(1) Before voting on the approval of a conditional use, Borough Council
shall hold a public hearing thereon pursuant to public notice.
Borough Council shall submit each such application to the Borough
Planning Commission at least 30 days prior to the hearing on such
application, to provide the Borough Planning Commission an
opportunity to submit recommendations. If after any public hearing
held upon an application, the proposed application is revised,
Borough Council shall hold another public hearing, pursuant to
public notice, before proceeding to vote on the application.
(2) Public notice, as defined herein, and written notice shall be given to
the applicant, the Zoning Officer, such other persons as the
Borough Council shall designate by ordinance, and to any person
who has made timely request for the same. Written notices shall be
given at such time and in such manner as shall be prescribed by
ordinance or, in the absence of an ordinance provision, by rules of
Borough Council. In addition to the written notice provide herein,
public notice shall also include the posting of a sign at conspicuous
locations along the perimeter of the subject property deemed
sufficient by the Borough to notify potentially interested citizens.
This sign(s) shall be posted at least one week prior to the hearing
and will include the nature, date, time, and location of the hearing.
(3) Borough Council may prescribe reasonable fees with respect to
hearings. Fees for said hearings may include compensation for the
Secretary, notice, and advertising costs, and necessary
administrative overhead connected with the hearing. The costs,
however, shall not include legal expenses, expenses for
engineering, architectural, or other technical consultants, or
expert witness costs.
(4) The parties to the hearing shall be the Borough, any person
affected by the application who has made timely appearance of
record before the Borough Council, and any other person, including
civic or community organizations permitted to appear by the
Borough Council. The Borough Council shall have power to require
that all persons who wish to be considered parties enter
appearances, in writing, on forms provided by the Borough Council
for that purpose.
(5) The President of Borough Council shall have power to administer
oaths and issue subpoenas to compel the attendance of witnesses
§ 460-60 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 460-60
1:543
and the production of relevant documents and papers, including
witnesses and documents requested by the parties.
(6) The parties shall have the right to be represented by counsel, and
shall be afforded the opportunity to respond and present evidence
and argument, and cross-examine adverse witnesses on all relevant
issues.
(7) Formal rules of evidence shall not apply, but irrelevant, immaterial,
or unduly repetitious evidence may be excluded.
(8) Borough Council may keep a stenographic record of the
proceedings. The appearance fee for a stenographer shall be
shared equally by the applicant and Borough Council. The cost of
the original transcript shall be paid by Borough Council, if the
transcript is ordered by Borough Council; or shall be paid by the
person appealing the decision of Borough Council, if such appeal is
made, and, in either event, the cost of additional copies shall be
paid by the person requesting such copy or copies. In other cases,
the party requesting the original transcript shall bear the cost
thereof.
(9) Borough Council shall not communicate, directly or indirectly, with
any party or his representative in connection with any issue
involved, except upon notice and opportunity for all parties to
participate, shall not take notice of any communication, reports,
staff memoranda, or other materials, except advice from their
solicitor, unless the parties are afforded an opportunity to contest
the material so noticed and shall not inspect the site or its
surroundings after the commencement of hearing with any party or
his representative, unless all parties are given an opportunity to be
present.
F. Time limitation.
(1) If a conditional use is granted, the necessary permit shall be
secured, and the authorized action begun within two years after
the date when the conditional use is finally granted, and the
building or alteration, as the case may be, shall be completed
within three years of that date. For good cause, Borough Council
may at any time, upon application in writing, extend either of these
deadlines.
(2) Should the appellant or applicant fail to obtain the necessary
permits within the two-year period, or having obtained the permit,
should he fail to commence work thereunder within such two-year
period, it shall be conclusively presumed that the appellant or
applicant has waived, withdrawn, or abandoned his application,
and all approvals and permits granted to him shall be deemed
automatically rescinded by Borough Council.
§ 460-60 INDIANA CODE § 460-60
1:544
(3) Should the appellant commence construction or alteration within
the two-year period, but should he fail to complete such
construction or alteration within the three-year period, Borough
Council may, upon 10 days' notice, in writing, rescind or revoke the
granted conditional use, if Borough Council finds that no good
cause appears for the failure to complete within such three-year
period, and if Borough Council further finds that conditions have
altered or changed in the interval since the granting of the
conditional use that revocation or rescission of the action is
justified.
(4) As an alternative to the preceding, an applicant can request, as
part of the original application before Borough Council, the
granting of a timetable associated with the request which would
supersede the deadlines imposed in Subsection E. In so doing, the
applicant must demonstrate that the times requested are logically
related to normal and expected progress of the project. In
approving a timetable under this section, Borough Council must
establish a definite time frame for issuance of a zoning permit and
completion of construction of the project.

raise the total number of unrelated individuals in the dwelling unit above
three in the R-1 and R-2 Zones, or above five in all other cases.
VARIANCE  A grant by the Zoning Hearing Board permitting an owner
to use a lot not wholly in accordance with the provisions of this chapter
because the Board finds, after receiving recommendations from the
Planning Commission, that strict conformance would be an unusual
hardship not created by the owner, but depriving him of reasonable use
of the lot. Such a grant specifies a minimum deviation or deviations from

located in the Borough Office, shows the current zoning district boundaries
and supersedes all other Zoning Maps.180

Council to enforce the regulations of this chapter in accordance with its
