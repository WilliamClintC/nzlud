PREFACE
The Bolivar Municipal Code contains the codification and revision of the
ordinances of the City of Bolivar, Tennessee. By referring to the historical
citation appearing at the end of each section, the user can determine the origin
of each particular section. The absence of a historical citation means that the
section was added by the codifier. The word "modified" in the historical citation
indicates significant modification of the original ordinance.
The code is arranged into titles, chapters, and sections. Related matter
is kept together, so far as possible, within the same title. Each section number
is complete within itself, containing the title number, the chapter number, and
the section of the chapter of which it is a part. Specifically, the first digit,
followed by a hyphen, identifies the title number. The second digit identifies the
chapter number, and the last two digits identify the section number. For
example, title 2, chapter 1, section 6, is designated as § 2-106.
By utilizing the table of contents, code index and the analysis preceding
each title and chapter of the code, together with the cross references and
explanations included as footnotes, the user should locate all the provisions in
the code relating to any question that might arise. However, the user should
note that most of the administrative ordinances (e.g. Annual Budget, Zoning
Map Amendments, Tax Assessments, etc...) do not appear in the code. Likewise,
ordinances that have been passed since the last update of the code do not appear
here. Therefore, the user should refer to the city's ordinance book or the city
administrator for a comprehensive and up to date review of the city's
ordinances.
Following this preface is an outline of the ordinance adoption procedures,
if any, prescribed by the city's charter.
The code has been arranged and prepared in loose-leaf form to facilitate
keeping it up to date. MTAS will provide updating service under the following
conditions:
(1) That all ordinances relating to subjects treated in the code or which
should be added to the code are adopted as amending, adding, or deleting
specific chapters or sections of the code (see section 7 of the adopting ordinance).
(2) That one copy of every ordinance adopted by the city is kept in a
separate ordinance book and forwarded to MTAS annually.
(3) That the city agrees to pay the annual update fee as provided in the
MTAS codification service charges policy in effect at the time of the update.
When the foregoing conditions are met MTAS will reproduce replacement
pages for the code to reflect the amendments and additions made by such
iii
ordinances. This service will be performed at least annually and more often if
justified by the volume of amendments. Replacement pages will be supplied
with detailed instructions for utilizing them so as again to make the code
complete and up to date.
The able assistance of the codes team: Kelley Myers, Linda Winstead,
Nancy Gibson and Sandy Selvage is gratefully acknowledged.

ORDINANCE ADOPTION PROCEDURES PRESCRIBED BY THE
CITY CHARTER
Section 2.10. City Legislation. Be it further enacted, That any action of
the council having a regulatory or penal effect, relating to revenue or the
expenditure of money, or required to be done by ordinance under this Act, shall
be done only by ordinance. Other actions may be accomplished by resolutions
or motions. Each motion, resolution and ordinance shall be in written form
before being introduced. The affirmative vote of the majority present of the
council shall be required to pass any motion, resolution or ordinance including
two readings in the case of an ordinance. Each ordinance, before being adopted,
shall be read at two meetings not less than one week apart, and shall take effect
ten days after its adoption, except that, where an emergency exists and the
public safety and welfare require it, an ordinance containing a full statement of
the facts and reasons for the emergency may be made effective upon its adoption
if approved by at least five members of the council on two readings on successive
days. No ordinance relating to a franchise, exclusive contract or other special
privilege shall be passed as an emergency ordinance. Amendments of
ordinances and resolutions or parts thereof shall be accomplished only by setting
forth the complete section, sections, subsections or subsections in their amended
form. All ordinances shall be signed by the Mayor before they shall become
effective. The Mayor shall affix his approval or disapproval within ten (10) days
after final adoption by the Council. If the Mayor withholds his signature for ten
(10) days, the ordinance shall become effective for failure to veto. The Mayor
shall state his reasons for vetoing an ordinance in writing and shall transmit his
reasons and the ordinance back to the Council before the next regular meeting
for its action. At the first regular meeting after receiving the veto message, the
Council may pass the ordinance over the veto by the affirmative vote of twothirds
(2/3) of the entire Council. A code may be adopted by an ordinance which
contains only a reference to its title, date and issuing organization and the city
administrator shall file a copy of the code in his office. The city shall furnish a
copy of any such code to any person for a reasonable fee. After adoption of a
code of ordinances, as provided in Section 2.10 of this Article, the city
administrator shall number ordinances consecutively in the order of their final
adoption. The original copies of all ordinances, resolutions and motions shall be
filed and preserved by the city administrator. [As amended by Priv. Acts 1985,
ch. 12; Priv. Acts 1995, ch. 68, § 7; and Priv. Acts 1996, ch. 186, § 8]

official or employee or a designated family member is negotiating possible
employment with a person or organization that is the subject of the vote or that
is to be regulated or supervised.

interest under state law, the provisions of the state law take precedence over the
provisions of this chapter. (1998 Code, § 1-602)
1-603. Disclosure of personal interest by official with vote. An
official with the responsibility to vote on a measure shall disclose during the
1-8
meeting at which the vote takes place, before the vote and so it appears in the

official may recuse himself1 from voting on the measure. (1998 Code, § 1-603)
1-604. Disclosure of personal interest in non-voting matters. An
official or employee who must exercise discretion relative to any matter, other

discretion shall disclose, before the exercise of the discretion when possible, the
interest on a form provided by and filed with the administrator. In addition, the

(1) For the performance of an act, or refraining from performance of
an act, that he would be expected to perform, or refrain from performing, in the

his action, or reward him for past action, in executing municipal business. (1998
Code, § 1-605)
1-606. Use of information. (1) An official or employee may not disclose
any information obtained in his official capacity or position of employment that
is made confidential under state or federal law except as authorized by law.

obtained in his official capacity or position of employment with the intent to
result in financial gain for himself or any other person or entity. (1998 Code,

employee may not use or authorize the use of municipal time, facilities,
equipment, or supplies for private gain or advantage to himself.

by the charter, general law, or ordinance or policy of the municipality. (1998
Code, § 1-608)
1-609. Outside employment. An official or employee may not accept or
continue any outside employment if the work unreasonable inhibits the
performance of any affirmative duty of the municipal position or conflicts with
any provision of the municipality's charter or any ordinance or policy. (1998
Code, § 1-609)
1-610. Ethics complaint. (1) The city attorney is designated as the
ethics officer of the municipality. Upon the written request of an official or
employee potentially affected by a provision of this chapter, the city attorney
may render an oral or written advisory ethics opinion based upon this chapter
and other applicable law.
(2) (a) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the city
attorney shall investigate any credible complaint against an appointed
official or employee charging any violation of this chapter, or may
undertake an investigation on his own initiative when he acquires
information indicating a possible violation and make recommendations
for action to end or seek retribution for any activity that, in the attorney's
judgment, constitutes a violation of this code of ethics.
(b) The city attorney may request the governing body hire
another attorney, individual, or entity to act as ethics officer when he has
or will have a conflict of interests in a particular matter.
(c) When a complaint of a violation of any provision of this
chapter is lodged against a member of the municipality's governing body,
the governing body shall either determine that the complaint has merit,
determine that the complaint does not have merit, or determine that the
complaint has sufficient merit to warrant further investigation. If the
governing body determines that a complaint warrants further
investigation, it shall authorize an investigation by the city attorney or
another individual or entity chosen by the governing body.
(3) The interpretation that a reasonable person in the circumstances
would apply shall be used in interpreting and enforcing this code of ethics.
(4) When a violation of this code of ethics also constitutes a violation
of a personnel policy, rule, or regulation or a civil service policy, rule, or
1-10
regulation, the violation shall be dealt with as a violation of the personnel or
civil service provisions rather that a violation of this code of ethics. (1998 Code,
§ 1-610)
1-611. Violations. An elected official or appointed member of a separate
municipal board, commission, committee, authority, corporation, or other
instrumentality who violates any provision of this chapter is subject to
punishment as provided by the municipality's charter or other applicable law
and in addition is subject to censure by the governing body. An appointed official
or employee who violates any provision of this chapter is subject to disciplinary
action. (1998 Code, § 1-611)

4-201. Equal opportunity. Equal employment opportunity is the city's
overall personnel practice and procedure. The City of Bolivar depends heavily
on the full and effective utilization of qualified persons in all job classifications
without regard to an individual's race, color, religion, sex, natural origin, age,
or handicap. The city has an enduring obligation to employ and develop the best
people that can be found, basing the judgment on their job related qualifications.
(1998 Code, § 4-201)
4-202. At-will employment. It is the policy of the City of Bolivar that
all employment shall be "at will," except those employees that are exempted by
charter or code, and shall be terminable "at will" by the employer or employee
at any time with or without cause. All new employees may be asked to sign a
disclaimer statement confirming that employment is "at-will." (1998 Code,
§ 4-202)
4-203. Conduct of employees. City employees are prohibited from
engaging in any conduct which could reflect unfavorably upon the City of
Bolivar. Employees must avoid any action which might result in or create a bad
impression or may subject the city to any form of public criticism or
embarrassment. (1998 Code, § 4-203)
4-204. Operation of city vehicles. City of Bolivar employees who drive
city vehicles will at all times operate them in a safe manner, adhering to all city,
state, and federal traffic laws. No employee will operate a city vehicle unless he
possesses a valid Tennessee driver's license. City vehicles are not to be used for
personal purposes at any time without prior approval of the mayor. The
employee is solely responsible and will be held accountable as to the use and
operation of the vehicle assigned and shall never operate a city vehicle while
under the influence of alcohol or drugs. (1998 Code, § 4-204)
4-205. Pay. Pay days will occur on the fifteenth and thirtieth of each
month. Each pay check will be payment for the work period just completed. You
will receive your pay check from your supervisor. Attached to each pay check is
an itemized statement of gross pay, various deductions, net pay, and many other
items of importance.
The deductions from your pay check will be of two (2) types.
(1) Regular deductions that are mandatory:
(a) The amount of federal income tax withheld from your gross
earnings depends on your salary and how many dependents you claim
each year;
(b) FICA, which is Social Security Tax, is deducted from your
gross salary at a fixed rate. (For every dollar deducted for your Social
Security Account, the city matches it with another dollar or more.)
(2) Voluntary deductions requiring your authorization:
4-5
(a) One-half (1/2) of your family coverage for health, accident,
life, and dental insurance premiums;
(b) Special life and accident insurance policy;
(c) Uniform expense. (1998 Code, § 4-205)
4-206. Overtime pay. An exemption from overtime pay requirements
is provided for an employee classified in an executive, administrative, or
professional capacity. Seasonal employees such as recreation workers and
volunteers such as volunteer firemen are also exempted from FLSA overtime
regulations.
All other employees shall be paid or given comp time at time and one-half
for all hours worked over the allowable hours during their designated work
period. The work period for firemen is a twenty eight (28) day period with two
hundred twelve (212) hours being allowed before overtime is mandatory. All
other employees are on a seven (7) day work period. The policemen are allowed
to work forty-three (43) hours per week before overtime pay is required and
employees in all other departments are paid overtime after working forty (40)
hours per week.
For any employee to be paid or receive comp time at time and one-half
regular pay they must have worked on the job over their required number of
hours for their work period. This provision requires that an employee cannot use
annual leave, sick leave, holiday time or any other type of leave toward work
time when determining overtime at time and one-half. When any leave time is
used in conjunction with work time which results in overtime hours the
employee will be paid at their regular rate of pay for these hours. (1998 Code,
§ 4-206)
4-207. Pay increases. Salary has been determined within the city
classification compensation plan. Each position in the city has a job description
with a salary range established indicating minimum to maximum salary rates.
Each position range is divided into pay steps. Eligibility for merit increases
occurs each year until you reach the top of your salary scale. After an employee
has reached the top of his salary scale he will receive one third of one percent
(1/3 of 1%) percent for each year of service up to six percent (6%). If you are
promoted to a higher paying classification, you may be eligible for a pay increase
at that time. (1998 Code, § 4-207)
4-208. Hours of work. The regular work day for most employees shall
be eight (8) hours and a work week shall be five (5) days or forty (40) hours.
Your hours of work and work days may not be the same as other city employees.
Many departments require irregular work schedules because of the nature of
their work. Some public safety personnel will be scheduled on a twenty-four (24)
hour shift, and will be guided by special regulations concerning this type of
scheduling. Some public service employees cannot be relieved of their duties
4-6
during their meal period and are considered to be at work even if they are able
to eat a meal during their work shift.
All city employees are expected to report to work punctually and with
regular attendance. Employees delayed or prevented from coming to work are
expected to notify their supervisor or department head before their scheduled
starting time. Excessive absenteeism and tardiness will lead to corrective action.
Discipline of absenteeism and tardiness shall be the responsibility of the
department head. An employee who is absent without notifying his supervisor
on three (3) separate occasions or absent three (3) consecutive work days will be
terminated. (1998 Code, § 4-208)
4-209. Absence due to inclement weather. Ordinarily, inclement
weather does not warrant the closing of city offices. Loss of work time for this
reason is charged against the employee's annual leave, comp time or holiday
accumulation. If the employee has no annual leave, comp time or holiday time,
then the time absent is charged as leave without pay. In the event the mayor or
his designee determines that conditions warrant the closing of some city offices
the employees affected receive regular compensation and leave time is not
affected. (1998 Code, § 4-209)
4-210. Elections. Any person entitled to vote in an election in this state
may be absent for this purpose if on duty while election polls are open.
Employees will only be absent the necessary time to vote and not to exceed two
(2) hours. The employer may specify the time the employee may be absent and
the employee will receive regular compensation with leave time not affected.
(1998 Code, § 4-210)
4-211. Annual leave. All permanent employees will accrue annual leave
upon the completion of each calendar month of service. Annual leave may not
be taken until earned. It is earned as soon as the employee completes the major
fraction of the month. Employees will accrue annual leave at increasing rates
with respect to their years of full-time service as follows:
YEARS OF SERVICE ANNUAL DAYS PER MONTH MAXIMUM ACCRUAL
1 to 10 Years 1 (8 hours) 24
10 to 20 Years l½ (12 hours) 30
Over 20 Years 2 (16 hours) 36
At the end of any month an employee who has accumulated the maximum
number of allowable annual leave days must transfer any additional days to his
sick leave account. The employee may request leave less than one (1) day when
the need arises for you to attend to personal matters. This time off will be
charged against your accrued annual leave.
4-7
Upon separation an employee is paid for any unused annual leave
accumulation unless terminated from the city for gross misconduct. Cases of
gross misconduct will be determined by the mayor. Additional leave is not
accrued when an employee is on terminal leave.
Only scheduled work days shall be charged in calculating the amount of
annual leave used. The employee may request to use their annual leave at any
time; however, their requests for annual leave should be made to their
supervisor several work days in advance of the time they desire. It is possible
that your department's work load may be too heavy for the time they request,
resulting in a change of their leave. (1998 Code, § 4-211)
4-212. Annual leave--accumulation. (1) Earned annual leave, not used
during the year in which it is earned, may be accumulated subject to the
following limitations:
(a) Accumulated annual leave shall not exceed:
(i) Fifteen (15) days with one (1) to ten (10) years of
service;
(ii) Eighteen (18) days with ten (10) to twenty (20) years
of service; and
(iii) Twenty-one (21) days with over twenty (20) years of
service.
(b) Annual leave accrued in excess of the above schedule must
be used within the calendar year or it shall be forfeited.
(2) As used in this section, "working day" shall consist of eight (8)
hours. (1998 Code, § 4-212)
4-213. Annual leave--administrator to keep records, prescribe
forms. The city administrator shall keep a record, currently up-to-date at all
times, of credits earned and annual leave taken by city officers and employees,
and for this purpose he/she may prescribe, with the approval of the mayor, forms
and procedures for obtaining such information currently. (1998 Code, § 4-213,
modified)
4-214. Sick leave. All permanent employees will accrue sick leave at a
rate of one (1) day (eight (8) hours) per month. The employee will be paid on a
regular pay basis when they are absent from work due to illness or injury while
on sick leave. Sick leave may not be taken before it is earned.
Sick leave may be used only:
(1) When the employee is sick or disabled.
(2) When the employee has an appointment with a doctor or dentist.
(3) When the employee is restricted to their home because of exposure
to a contagious disease.
4-8
(4) When there is sickness due to pregnancy. Sick leave may be used
during a maternity absence until thirty (30) work days after delivery. Use of
sick leave is subject to ordinary rules.
(5) When there is illness or a death in your immediate family. (This
includes the employee's spouse, children, and parents).
(6) When there is illness or death of other family members. (This
includes the employee's grandparents, grandchildren, their brothers and sisters,
their father and mother-in-law, their brothers and sisters-in-law). Sick leave is
limited to three (3) days when used in this manner.
Any employee may be required to present evidence in the form of personal
affidavits, physician's certificates, and/or other testimonials at the request of an
appointing authority to support the reason for any absence during the time
which sick leave was taken.
Only scheduled work days are charged in calculating the amount of sick
leave used. Official holidays within a sick leave period are charged as holidays.
Sick leave may not be used as terminal leave.
Upon retirement any member of the retirement system who has unused
accumulated sick leave shall be credited with such sick leave as creditable
service. (1998 Code, § 4-214)
4-215. Holidays. The following days have been designated by the city as
legal holidays :
New Year's Day January 1
Martin Luther King, Jr. Day 3rd Monday in January
President's Day 3rd Monday in February
Good Friday Friday before Easter
Memorial Day Last Monday in May
Independence Day July 4
Labor Day 1st Monday in September
Veteran's Day November 11
Thanksgiving Day and day after 4th Thursday in November
Christmas Days (3) December 25 + 2 days to be
determined by the city
administrator
When a holiday falls on Saturday, the Friday preceding the holiday is
substituted and when it falls on Sunday, the Monday following the holiday is
substituted.
Due to a variety of city services some work schedules make it necessary
for employees to work on holidays. If an employee is required to work on a
holiday, he will receive comp time on a hour-for-hour basis up to eight (8) hours
at a later date. All holiday time earned must be taken off by the end of the
calendar year. (1998 Code, § 4-215, modified)
4-9
4-216. Compensatory time. An employee may be given comp time in
lieu of monetary compensation for working overtime hours. All comp time must
be given at time and one-half for all hours worked overtime. If any type of leave
time is used which results in overtime hours the employee will only receive comp
time equal to overtime hours. The use of comp time is subject to the same
approval as annual leave.
All compensatory time must be taken before the end of each month. No
comp time is allowed to be accrued over into the next month. (1998 Code,
§ 4-216)
4-217. Military leave. The city will grant special military leave to all
full time employees who are members of the Tennessee National Guard or
members of the components of the armed forces of the United States for annual
field training for a period not to exceed two weeks in any one calendar year. You
will receive full pay and no deduction of accrued annual leave will be made
during this period of military service. (1998 Code, § 4-217)
4-218. Civil leave. The city will grant civil leave to employees who are
selected for jury duty or directed to serve as a government witness. When on
civil leave employees will retain their regular pay and any compensation
received by the employee for jury duty or government witness fees must be given
to the city. Civil leave will only be granted for time actually served. If not chosen
for jury duty on a particular day or dismissed early, employee is to report for
work for the remainder of the work day. An employee may use annual leave or
compensatory time in lieu of civil leave and retain any fees he is paid. If an
employee is subpoenaed in private litigation to testify not in an official capacity,
some type of leave other than civil leave must be taken. Any time spent on civil
leave does not count toward hours worked in computation of overtime pay. (1998
Code, § 4-218)
4-219. Insurance. The City of Bolivar provides employees and their
families with an excellent plan of group insurance. The plans include life
insurance, accident insurance, dental insurance, medical and major medical
benefits. Employees are enrolled immediately upon employment and usually,
the first day of the month following a thirty (30) day waiting period, is the
effective date of coverage. (1998 Code, § 4-219)
4-220. Health insurance. At the present time the city provides for
health insurance which offers employees and their families programs with
modern hospital, surgical, maternity, dental and major medical benefits.
Coverage under the medical and major medical programs will pay eighty percent
(80%) of expenses in excess of the deductible amount. The major medical portion
covers almost all types of medical expenses with a maximum of two hundred
fifty thousand dollars ($250,000.00). Major medical provides benefits for medical
4-10
expenses in excess of those covered under other provisions of the plan, and it
provides for many items of medical expenses not covered under other provisions
of the plan, including expenses not related to hospitalization. (1998 Code,
§ 4-220)
4-221 Expense. The City of Bolivar pays the entire amount of the cost
of the overall group insurance plan offered to you as an employee and pays one
half (1/2) of the cost of the protection of the employees' family. (1998 Code,
§ 4-221)
4-222. Health and safety. The City of Bolivar is concerned for their
employee's health and safety in the performance of their jobs. It is required that
employees observe all safety rules and habits each department endorses. These
are designed for the benefit and protection of the employees. If an employee has
an accident while on the job, there are two (2) immediate responsibilities:
(1) Seek immediate first aid or emergency care.
(2) See that your supervisor is notified of your accident and your
condition.
All injuries incurred on the job must be reported to the supervisor and
proper forms completed immediately. (1998 Code, § 4-222)
4-223. Workers' compensation. The City of Bolivar provides a workers'
compensation plan for all employees. For any time loss due to an injury received
by an employee while engaged in the city's scheduled work, and injury is
compensable under the worker's compensation act. The City of Bolivar from the
first date of absence until attainment of worker's compensation eligibility, shall
pay employees at their regular rate of pay. Absences during which workers'
compensation payments are made, employees shall be paid the difference
between the amount of worker's compensation being paid and their regular
salary. At no time will the employees income exceed one hundred percent (100%)
of regular salary. This policy will be in effect for a period of one (1) year after
which the employee will be dropped from the payroll and will only receive pay
from workers' compensation.
The following policies will be in effect:
(1) The City of Bolivar may require the employee to furnish a
physician's certificate as evidence of the disability from a physician designated
by management.
(2) No deduction from employee's accrued sick leave time will be
required for absences due to work related illness or injury on the job.
(3) If employee fails to report work related accidents or illness to their
supervisor within two (2) hours of occurrence, the city will not be responsible for
financial obligations. (1998 Code, § 4-223)
4-11
4-224. Uniform allowance. Members of the police department are given
one hundred dollar ($100.00) allowance each six (6) months to defray the cost of
their uniforms. The fire department employees are furnished uniforms upon the
approval of the fire chief. Street, sanitation, utility workers and other employees
may elect to wear uniforms and the city will pay one half (½) of the cleaning and
rental. (1998 Code, § 4-224)
4-225. Educational assistance. The city shall reimburse regular,
full-time employees for tuition and academic fees incurred by them when they
successfully complete courses designed to improve their performance in their
current positions, or to prepare them for additional responsibility. To qualify for
reimbursement participants must submit proof of payment and attendance.
Prior to beginning course work each participant must receive the department
head's recommendation as well as approval from the mayor. (1998 Code,
§ 4-225)
4-226. Retirement. Retirement from the City of Bolivar service offers
excellent retirement benefits. A regular employee automatically becomes a
member of the Tennessee Consolidated Retirement System after a six (6) month
waiting period. Temporary and part-time employees of the city are ineligible for
membership. The City of Bolivar has elected to pay the entire amount of
retirement contributions to the State of Tennessee. This is approximately 10%
of the employee's salary. Upon termination of employment only people employed
before July, 1984 will receive any refunds. All employees joining the retirement
system prior to July 1, 1979, attain vested rights after four (4) years of service.
Employees joining on or after July 1, 1979 attain vested rights after ten (10)
years of membership service. Prior to becoming vested, employees are not
eligible for any retirement benefits. If employees are eligible to receive them,
social security benefits are in addition to those funds received from state
retirement. (1998 Code, § 4-226)
4-227. Retirement credit for military service. The Tennessee
Consolidated Retirement System provides credit for an employee's period of
military service up to four (4) years "during an armed conflict," if the employee
joins, or returns to, city service. The employee is eligible only if they join, or
return to, city service within two (2) years of their military separation or within
seven years if they attend school after their separation for the purpose of
improving job efficiency. (1998 Code, § 4-227)
4-228. Retirement cost-of-living increases. When an employee
retires, they can expect to have their retirement income adjusted each year if
the cost-of-living rises. When the Consumer Price Index indicates a decline in
the cost-of-living, their income will remain unadjusted. (1998 Code, § 4-228)
4-12
4-229. Retirement options. An employee's retirement system offers
them more than a regular retirement income; it provides options to an employee
or their designated beneficiary. The retirement handbook explains these options
for the benefit of the employee and their family. (1998 Code, § 4-229)
4-230. Bond of city employees; exceptions. The city administrator
shall secure and maintain a five thousand dollar ($5,000.00) blanket coverage
fidelity or faithful performance bond covering all city employees except himself,
the mayor, employees of the electric department and city council members. Said
bond shall be paid for by the city and shall be with a surety company authorized
to do business in the State of Tennessee.1 (1998 Code, § 4-230, modified)
4-231. Tenure of appointed personnel. The tenure of all public
appointive officers and employees shall be subject to their good behavior,
satisfactory performance of work, necessity for the performance of their work,
and the availability of public funds with which to pay them. (1998 Code, § 4-231)
4-232. Compensation. All public officers and employees of the city shall
be paid in accordance with such schedules as shall from time to time be ordained
or otherwise established by the city council.2 (1998 Code, § 4-232)

4-317. Amendments.
4-301. Purpose. It is the responsibility of the City of Bolivar to provide
employees a place of employment which is free from recognized hazards that
may cause death or serious physical harm. In providing services to the citizens
of the City of Bolivar, employees may come in contact with life threatening
infectious diseases which can be transmitted through job related activities. It is
important that both citizens and employees are protected from the transmission
of diseases just as it is equally important that neither is discriminated against
because of basic misconceptions about various diseases and illnesses.
The purpose of this policy is to establish a comprehensive set of rules and
regulations governing the prevention of discrimination and potential
occupational exposure to Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), the Human
Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), and Tuberculosis (TB). (1998 Code, § 4-301)
4-302. Coverage. Occupational exposures may occur in many ways,
including needle sticks, cut injuries or blood spills. Several classes of employees
are assumed to be at high risk for blood borne infections due to their routinely
increased exposure to body fluids from potentially infected individuals. Those
high risk occupations include:
(1) Police personnel;
(2) Firefighters, including volunteer firemen;
(3) Sanitation and landfill workers; and
4-14
(4) Any other employee deemed to be at high risk per this policy and
an exposure determination. (1998 Code, § 4-302)
4-303. Administration. This infection control policy shall be
administered by the mayor or his/her designated representative who shall have
the following duties and responsibilities:
(1) Exercise leadership in implementation and maintenance of an
effective infection control policy subject to the provisions of this chapter, other
ordinances, the city charter, and federal and state law relating to OSHA
regulations;
(2) Make an exposure determination for all employee positions to
determine a possible exposure to blood or body fluids;
(3) Maintain records of all employees and incidents subject to the
provisions of the chapter;
(4) Conduct periodic inspections to determine compliance with the
infection control policy by municipal employees;
(5) Coordinate and document all relevant training activities in support
of the infection control policy;
(6) Prepare and recommend to the mayor and councilmen any
amendments or changes to the infection control policy;
(7) Identify any and all housekeeping operations involving substantial
risk of direct exposure to body fluids and shall address the proper precautions
to be taken while cleaning rooms and blood spills; and
(8) Perform such other duties and exercise such other authority as may
be prescribed by the board of mayor and councilmen. (1998 Code, § 4-303)
4-304. Definitions. (1) "Body fluids." Fluids that have been recognized
by the Centers for Disease Control as directly linked to the transmission of HIV
and/or HBV and/or to which universal precautions apply: blood, semen, blood
products, vaginal secretions, cerebrospinal fluid, synovial fluid, pericardial fluid,
amniotic fluid, and concentrated HIV or HBV viruses.
(2) "Exposure." The contact with blood or other body fluids to which
universal precautions apply through contact with open wounds, non-intact skin,
or mucous membranes during the performance of an individual's normal job
duties.
(3) "Hepatitis B Virus (HBV)." A serious blood-borne virus with
potential for life-threatening complications. Possible complications include:
massive hepatic necrosis, cirrhosis of the liver, chronic active hepatitis, and
hepatocellular carcinoma.
(4) "Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)." The virus that causes
Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). HIV is transmitted through
sexual contact and exposure to infected blood or blood components and
perinatally from mother to neonate.
4-15
(5) "Tuberculosis (TB)." An acute or chronic communicable disease that
usually affects the respiratory system, but may involve any system in the body.
(6) "Universal precautions." Refers to a system of infectious disease
control which assumes that every direct contact with body fluid is infectious and
requires every employee exposed to direct contact with body fluids to be
protected as though such body fluid were HBV or HIV infected. (1998 Code,
§ 4-304)
4-305. Policy statement. All blood and body fluids are potentially
infectious for several blood-borne pathogens and some body fluids can transmit
infections. For this reason, the Centers for Disease Control developed the
strategy that everyone should always take particular care when there is a
potential exposure. These precautions have been termed "universal
precautions."
Universal precautions stress that all persons should be assumed to be
infectious for HIV and/or other blood borne pathogens. Universal precautions
apply to blood, tissues, and other body fluids which contain visible blood.
Universal precautions also apply to semen, (although occupational risk or
exposure is quite limited), vaginal secretions, and to cerebrospinal, synovial,
pleural, peritoneal, pericardial and amniotic fluids. Universal precautions do not
apply to feces, nasal secretions, human breast milk, sputum, saliva, sweat,
tears, urine, and vomitus unless these substances contain visible blood. (1998
Code, § 4-305)
4-306. General guidelines. General guidelines which shall be used by
everyone include:
(1) Think when responding to emergency calls and exercise common
sense when there is potential exposure to blood or body fluids which require
universal precautions.
(2) Keep all open cuts and abrasions covered with adhesive bandages
which repel liquids.
(3) Soap and water kill many bacteria and viruses on contact. If hands
are contaminated with blood or body fluids to which universal precautions
apply, then wash immediately and thoroughly. Hands shall also be washed after
gloves are removed even if the gloves appear to be intact. When soap and water
or handwashing facilities are not available, then use a waterless antiseptic hand
cleaner according to the manufacturers recommendation for the product.
(4) All workers shall take precautions to prevent injuries caused by
needles, scalpel blades, and other sharp instruments. To prevent needle stick
injuries, needles shall not be recapped, purposely bent or broken by hand,
removed from disposable syringes, or otherwise manipulated by hand. After they
are used, disposable syringes and needles, scalpel blades and other sharp items
shall be placed in puncture resistant containers for disposal. The puncture
resistant container shall be located as close as practical to the use area.
4-16
(5) The city will provide gloves of appropriate material, quality and
size for each affected employee. The gloves are to be worn when there is contact
(or when there is a potential contact) with blood or body fluids to which
universal precautions apply:
(a) While handling an individual where exposure is possible;
(b) While cleaning or handling contaminated items or
equipment;
(c) While cleaning up an area that has been contaminated with
one of the above;
Gloves shall not be used if they are peeling, cracked, or discolored, or if
they have punctures, tears, or other evidence of deterioration. Employee shall
not wash or disinfect surgical or examination gloves for reuse.
(6) Resuscitation equipment shall be used when necessary. (No
transmission of HBV or HIV infection during mouth-to-mouth resuscitation has
been documented.) However, because of the risk of salivary transmission of
other infectious diseases and the theoretical risk of HIV or HBV transmission
during artificial resuscitation, bags shall be used. Pocket mouth-to-mouth
resuscitation masks designed to isolate emergency response personnel from
contact with a victims' blood and blood contaminated saliva, respiratory
secretion, and vomitus, are available to all personnel who provide or potentially
provide emergency treatment.
(7) Masks or protective eyewear or face shields shall be worn during
procedures that are likely to generate droplets of blood or other body fluids to
prevent exposure to mucous membranes of the mouth, nose, and eyes. They are
not required for routine care.
(8) Areas and equipment contaminated with blood shall be cleaned as
soon as possible. A household (chlorine) bleach solution (1 part chlorine to 10
parts water) shall be applied to the contaminated surface as a disinfectant
leaving it on for a least thirty (30) seconds. A solution must be changed and
re-mixed every twenty-four (24) hours to be effective.
(9) Contaminated clothing (or other articles) shall be handled carefully
and washed as soon as possible. Laundry and dish washing cycles at one
hundred degrees (120E) are adequate for decontamination.
(10) Place all disposable equipment (gloves, masks, gowns, etc.) in a
clearly marked plastic bag. Place the bag in a second clearly marked bag (double
bag). Seal and dispose of by placing in a designated "hazardous" dumpster.
NOTE: Sharp object must be placed in an impervious container and then taken
to a hospital for disposal.
(11) Tags shall be used as a means of preventing accidental injury or
illness to employees who are exposed to hazardous or potentially hazardous
conditions, equipment or operations which are out of the ordinary, unexpected
or not readily apparent. Tags shall be used until such time as the identified
hazard is eliminated or the hazardous operation is completed.
All required tags shall meet the following criteria:
4-17
(a) Tags shall contain a signal word and a major message. The
signal word shall be "BIOHAZARD," or the biological hazard symbol. The
major message shall indicate the specific hazardous condition or the
instruction to be communicated to employees.
(b) The signal word shall be readable at a minimum distance of
five feet (5') or such greater distance as warranted by the hazard.
(c) All employees shall be informed of the meaning of the
various tags used throughout the workplace and what special precautions
are necessary.
(12) Linen soiled with body fluids shall be handled as little as possible
and with minimum agitation to prevent contamination of the person handling
the linen. All soiled linen shall be bagged at the location where it was used. It
shall not be sorted or rinsed in the area. Soiled linen shall be placed and
transported in bags that prevent leakage.
The employee responsible for transporting soiled linen should always
wear protective gloves to prevent possible contamination. After removing the
gloves, hands or other skin surfaces shall be washed thoroughly and
immediately after contact with body fluids.
(13) Whenever possible, disposable equipment shall be used to minimize
and contain clean-up. (1998 Code, § 4-306)
4-307. Hepatitis B vaccinations. The City of Bolivar shall offer the
appropriate Hepatitis B vaccination to employees at risk of exposure free of
charge and in amounts at times prescribed by standard medical practices. The
vaccinations shall be voluntarily administered. High risk employees who wish
to take the HBV vaccination should notify their department head who shall
make the appropriate arrangements through the safety director. (1998 Code,
§ 4-307)
4-308. Reporting potential exposure. City employees shall observe
the following procedures for reporting a job exposure incident that may put them
at risk for HIV or HBV infections (i.e., needle sticks, blood contact on broken
skin, body fluid contact with eyes or mouth, etc.):
(1) Notify the safety director of the contact incident and details
thereof.
(2) Complete the appropriate accident reports and any other specific
form required.
(3) Arrangements will be made for the person to be seen by a physician
as with any job-related injury.
Once an exposure has occurred, a blood sample should be drawn after
consent is obtained from the individual from whom exposure occurred and tested
for Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and/or antibody to human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV antibody). Testing of the source individual should
be done at a location where appropriate pretest counseling is available. Post-test
4-18
counseling and referral for treatment should also be provided. (1998 Code,
§ 4-308)
4-309. Hepatitis B virus post-exposure management. For an
exposure to a source individual found to be positive for HBsAg, the worker who
has not previously been given the hepatitis B vaccine should receive the vaccine
series. A single dose of hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) is also
recommended, if it can be given within seven (7) days of exposure.
For exposure from an HBsAg-positive source to workers who have
previously received the vaccine, the exposed worker should be tested for
antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs), and given one (1) dose of
vaccine and one dose of HBIG if the antibody level in the worker's blood sample
is inadequate (ie., 10 SRU by RIA, negative by EIA).
If the source individual is negative for HBsAg and the worker has not
been vaccinated, this opportunity should be taken to provide the hepatitis B
vaccine series. HBIG administration should be considered on an individual basis
when the source individual is known or suspected to be at high risk of HBV
infection. Management and treatment, if any, of previously vaccinated workers
who receive an exposure from a source who refuses testing or is not identifiable
should be individualized. (1998 Code, § 4-309)
4-310. Human immunodeficiency virus post-exposure
management. For any exposure to a source individual who has AIDS, who is
found to be positive for HIV infection, or who refuses testing, the worker should
be counseled regarding the risk of infection and evaluated clinically and
serologically for evidence of HIV infection as soon as possible after the exposure.
The worker should be advised to report and seek medical evaluation for any
acute febrile illness that occurs within twelve (12) weeks after the exposure.
Such an illness, particularly one characterized by fever, rash, or
lymphadenopathy, may be indicative of recent HIV infection.
Following the initial test at the time of exposure, seronegative workers
should be retested six (6) weeks, twelve (12) weeks, and six (6) months after
exposure to determine whether transmission has occurred. During this follow-up
period (especially the first six to twelve (6 - 12) weeks after exposure) exposed
workers should follow the U.S. Public Health Service recommendation for
preventing transmission of HIV. These include refraining from blood donations
and using appropriate protection during sexual intercourse. During all phases
of follow-up, it is vital that worker confidentiality be protected.
If the source individual was tested and found to be seronegative, baseline
testing of the exposed worker with follow-up testing twelve (12) weeks later may
be performed if desired by the worker or recommended by the health care
provider. If the source individual cannot be identified, decisions regarding
appropriate follow-up should be individualized. Serologic testing should be made
4-19
available by the city to all workers who may be concerned they have been
infected with HIV through an occupational exposure. (1998 Code, § 4-310)
4-311. Disability benefits. Entitlement to disability benefits and any
other benefits available for employees who suffer from on-the-job injuries will
be determined by the Tennessee Workers' Compensations Bureau in accordance
with the provisions of Tennessee Code Annotated § 50-6-303. (1998 Code,
§ 4-311)
4-312. Training regular employees. On an annual basis all employees
shall receive training and education on precautionary measures, epidemiology,
modes of transmission and prevention of HIV/HBV infection and procedures to
be used if they are exposed to needle sticks or body fluids. They shall also be
counseled regarding possible risks to the fetus from HIV/HBV and other
associated infectious agents. (1998 Code, § 4-312)
4-313. Training high risk employees. In addition to the above, high
risk employees shall also receive training regarding the location and proper use
of personal protective equipment. They shall be trained concerning proper work
practices and understand the concept of "universal precautions" as it applies to
their work situation. They shall also be trained about the meaning of color
coding and other methods used to designate contaminated material. Where tags
are used, training shall cover precautions to be used in handling contaminated
as per this policy. (1998 Code, § 4-313)
4-314. Training new employees. During the new employee's
orientation to his/her job, all new employees will be trained on the effects of
infectious disease prior to putting them to work. (1998 Code, § 4-314)
3-315. Records and reports. (1) Reports. Occupational injury and
illness records shall be maintained by the safety director. Statistics shall be
maintained on the OSHA-200 report. Only those work-related injuries that
involve loss of consciousness, transfer to another job, restriction of work or
motion, or medical treatment are required to be put on the OSHA-200 report.
(2) Needle sticks. Needle sticks, like any other puncture wound, are
considered injuries for recordkeeping purposes due to the instantaneous nature
of the event. Therefore, any needle stick requiring medical treatment (ie. gamma
globulin, hepatitis B immune globulin, hepatitis B vaccine, etc...) shall be
recorded.
(3) Prescription medication. Likewise, the use of prescription
medication (beyond a single dose for minor injury or discomfort) is considered
medical treatment. Since these types of treatment are considered necessary, and
must be administered by physician or licensed medical personnel, such injuries
cannot be considered minor and must be reported.
4-20
(4) Employee interviews. Should the city be inspected by the U.S.
Department of Labor Office of Health Compliance, the compliance safety and
health officer may wish to interview employees. Employees are expected to
cooperate fully with the compliance officers. (1998 Code, § 4-315)
4-316. Legal rights of victims of communicable diseases. Victims
of communicable diseases have the legal right to expect, and municipal
employees, including police and emergency service officers are duty bound to
provide, the same level of service and enforcement as any other individual would
receive.
(1) Officers assume that a certain degree of risk exists in law
enforcement and emergency service work and accept those risks with their
individual appointments. This holds true with any potential risks of contacting
a communicable disease as surely as it does with the risks of confronting an
armed criminal.
(2) Any officer who refuses to take proper action in regard to victims
of a communicable disease, when appropriate protective equipment is available,
shall be subject to disciplinary measures along with civil and/or criminal
prosecution.
(3) Whenever an officer mentions in a report that an individual has or
may have a communicable disease, he shall write "contains confidential medical
information" across the top margin of the first page of the report.
(4) The officer's supervisor shall ensure that the above statement is on
all reports requiring that statement at the time that is reviewed and initiated
by the supervisor.
(5) The supervisor disseminating newspaper releases shall make
certain the confidential information is not given out to the news media.
(6) All requests (including subpoenas) for copies of reports marked
"contains confidential medical information" shall be referred to the city attorney
when the incident involves an indictable or juvenile offense.
(7) Prior approval shall be obtained from the city attorney before
advising a victim of sexual assault that the suspect has, or is suspected of
having a communicable disease.
(8) All circumstance, not covered in this policy, that may arise
concerning releasing confidential information regarding a victim, or suspected
victim, of a communicable disease shall be referred directly to the appropriate
department head or city attorney.
(9) Victims of a communicable disease and their families have a right
to conduct their lives without fear of discrimination. An employee shall not
make public, directly or indirectly, the identity of a victim or suspected victim
of a communicable disease.
(10) Whenever an employee finds it necessary to notify another
employee, police officer, firefighter, emergency service officer, or health care
provider that a victim has or is suspected of having a communicable disease,
4-21
that information shall be conveyed in a dignified, discrete and confidential
manner. The person to whom the information is being conveyed should be
reminded that the information is confidential and that it should not be treated
as public information.
(11) Any employee who disseminates confidential information in regard
to a victim, or suspected victim of a communicable disease in violation of this
policy shall be subject to serious disciplinary action and/or civil and/or criminal
prosecution. (1998 Code, § 4-316)
4-317. Amendments. amendments or revisions of these rules may be
recommended for adoption by any elected official or by department heads. Such
amendments or revisions of these rules shall be by chapter and shall become
effective after public hearing and approval by the governing body. (1998 Code,

determined that removal, relocation, change or alteration is reasonably
necessary for the construction, operation, repair, maintenance or installation of

cost of relocation or removal from private third parties who initiate the request
for relocation or removal.

the rights-of-way for the safe and reliable operation, use and maintenance of its

benefitting from the temporary rearrangement. Provider may require
prepayment or prior posting of a bond from the party requesting the temporary
move. (1998 Code, § 9-716, modified)
9-617. Insurance requirements. (1) A provider shall obtain and
maintain insurance in the amounts prescribed by the chief administrative officer
with an insurance company licensed to do business in the State of Tennessee
acceptable to the chief administrative officer throughout the term of a municipal
permit granted under this chapter. A provider shall furnish the city with proof
of insurance at the time of issuance of a municipal permit. The city reserves the
right to review the insurance requirements while a municipal permit is in effect,
and to reasonably adjust insurance coverage and limits when the chief
administrative officer determines that changes in statutory law, court decisions,
or the claims history of the industry or the provider require adjustment of the
coverage. For purposes of this section, the city will accept certificates of selfinsurance
issued by the State of Tennessee providing the same coverage.
(2) The chief administrative officer may, on request and at no cost to
the city, receive copies of certificates of insurance evidencing the coverage
required by this section. The chief administrative officer may request the
deletion, revision or modification of particular policy terms, conditions,
limitations or exclusions, unless the policy provisions are established by a law
or regulating binding the city, the provider, or the underwriter. If the chief
9-24
administrative officer requests a deletion, revision or modification, a provider
shall exercise reasonable efforts to pay for and to accomplish the change.
An insurance certificate shall contain the following required provisions:
(a) Name the city and its officers, employees, board members
and elected representatives as additional insureds for all applicable
coverage;
(b) Provide for thirty (30) days notice to the city for cancellation,
non-renewal, or material change;
(c) Provide that notice of claims shall be provided to the chief
administrative officer by certified mail; and
(d) Provide that the terms of the municipal permit which impose
obligations on the provider concerning liability, duty, and standard of
care, including the indemnity section, are included in the policy and that
the risks are insured within the policy terms and conditions.
(3) A provider shall file and maintain proof of insurance with the chief
administrative officer during the term of a municipal permit. An insurance
certificate obtained in compliance with this section is subject to city approval.
The city may require the certificate to be changed to reflect changing liability
limits. A provider shall immediately advise the city of actual or potential
litigation that may develop that would affect insurance coverage related to a
municipal permit.
(4) An insurer has no right of recovery against the city. The required
insurance policies shall protect the provider and the city. The insurance shall
be primary coverage for losses covered by the policies.
(5) The policy clause "other insurance" shall not apply to the city
where the city is an insured under the policy.
(6) The provider shall pay premiums and assessments. A company
which issues an insurance policy has no recourse against the city for payment
of a premium or assessment. Insurance policies obtained by a provider must
provide that the issuing company waives all right of recovery by way of
subrogation against the city in connection with damage covered by the policy.
(1998 Code, § 9-717)
9-618. Indemnity. (1) During the term of a municipal permit, a provider
is liable for the acts or omissions of an entity used by the provider, including an

and installation of the provider's facilities. The acts or omissions of the entity
shall be considered the acts or omissions of the provider.
(2) Each provider granted a municipal permit under this chapter shall
provide to the chief administrative officer, in writing, a statement that the
provider agrees to defend, indemnify and hold the city harmless against all
damages, cost, loss or expense arising out of, incident to, concerning or resulting
from the negligence or willful misconduct of the provider, its agents, employees,
or subcontractors, in the performance of activities under the municipal permit;
9-25
(a) For the repair, replacement, or restoration of city property,
equipment materials, structures and facilities which are damaged,
destroyed or found to be defective; and
(b) Against any and all claims, demands, suits, causes of action,
and judgments for:
(i) Damage to or loss of the property of any person
including, but not limited to the provider, its agents, officers,
employees and subcontractors, the city's agents, officers and
employees, and third parties; and
(ii) Death, bodily injury, illness, disease, worker's
compensation, loss of services, or loss of income or wages to any
person including but not limited to the agents, officers and
employees of the provider, the provider's subcontractors, the city,
and third parties, no matter how, or to whom, the loss may occur.
(3) The chief administrative officer shall give prompt written notice to
a provider of any claim for which the city seeks indemnification. The provider
shall have the right to investigate, defend and compromise these claims subject
to the city's prior approval. (1998 Code, § 9-718)
9-619. Privacy of customer information. A provider shall comply with
state and federal law regarding privacy of customer information. (1998 Code,
§ 9-719)
9-620. Annexation; deannexation. Within thirty (30) days following
the date of passage of any action affecting any deannexation or annexation, the
chief administrative officer shall notify providers of this action by furnishing to
the providers maps of the affected area(s), showing the new boundaries of the
city. (1998 Code, § 9-720)
9-621. Unauthorized use of public rights-of-way. (1) A person
commits an offense if a person uses the public rights-of-way to provide a

city.

unauthorized placement of facilities constituents a separate offense. Each day
a violation of this chapter occurs shall constitute a distinct and separate offense.

9-702. Purpose and findings. (1) Purpose. It is the purpose of this
chapter to regulate sexually oriented businesses in order to promote the health,
safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of the City of Bolivar, and to
establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious location
and concentration of sexually oriented businesses within the City of Bolivar. The
provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a
limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials,
including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect
of this chapter to restrict or deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of
sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the
intent nor effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of
obscene material.
(2) Findings. Based on evidence, concerning the adverse secondary
effects of adult uses on the community presented in hearings and in reports
made available to the City of Bolivar City Council, and on findings incorporated
in the cases of City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc. 475 U.S. 41(1986),
Young v. American Mini Theaters, 426 U.S. 50 (1976), and Barnes v. Glen
Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991), and on studies in other communities
including, but not limited to, Phoenix, Arizona; Tucson, Arizona; Indianapolis,
Indiana; Minneapolis, Minnesota; St. Paul, Minnesota; Houston, Texas;
Indianapolis, Indiana; Amarillo, Texas; Garden Grove, California; Newport
News, Virginia; Los Angeles, California; Whittier, California; Austin, Texas;
Seattle, Washington; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma II;
Cleveland Ohio, and Beaumont, Texas; and also on findings from the report of
the Attorney General's Working Group on the Regulation of Sexually Oriented
Businesses, (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota), the board finds:
(a) Sexually oriented business lend themselves to ancillary
unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the
operators of the establishments. Further, there is presently no
mechanism to make the owners of these establishments responsible for
the activities that occur on their premises.
(b) Certain employees of sexually oriented businesses defined
in this chapter as adult theaters and cabarets engage in higher incidence
of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other
establishments.
9-33
(c) Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex
occur at sexually oriented business, especially those which provide
private or semi-private booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live
sex shows.
(d) Offering and providing such space encourages such
activities, which creates unhealthy conditions.
(e) Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades, and
other sexually oriented businesses for the purposes of engaging in sex
within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses.
(f) At least fifty (50) communicable diseases may be spread by
activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses, including, but not
limited to, syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodefiency virus infection
(HIV-AIDS), genital herpes, Hepatitis B, and Non A, Non B amebiasis,
salmonella infections shigella infections.
(g) Since 1981 and to the present, there has been an increasing
cumulative number of reported cases of AIDS caused by the Human
Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) in the United States: six hundred (600) in
1982, two thousand two hundred (2,200) in 1983, four thousand six
hundred (4,600) in 1984, eight thousand five hundred fifty five (8,555) in
1985 and two hundred fifty three thousand four hundred forty eight
(253,448) through December 31, 1992.
(h) As of July 31, 1998, there were seven thousand six hundred
eighty nine (7,689) reported cases of AIDS and three thousand nine
hundred four (3,904) deaths resulting from AIDS in the State of
Tennessee. There were two thousand five hundred twenty two (2,522)
reported cases of AIDS in neighboring Shelby County Tennessee as of
July 31, 1998.
(i) Since 1981 and to the present, there have been an increasing
cumulative number of persons testing positive for the HIV antibody test
in the State of Tennessee with nine thousand three hundred sixty three
(9,363) reported cases of HIV. There were three thousand six hundred
fifty one (3,651) reported cases of HIV in neighboring Shelby County,
Tennessee as of July 31, 1998.
(j) The number of cases of early (less than one (1) year) syphilis
in the United States reported annually has risen, with thirty three
thousand six hundred thirteen (33,613) cases reported in 1982 and forty
five thousand two hundred (45,200) through November of 1990. There
were nine hundred thirty four (934) reported cases of early syphilis in
Shelby County, Tennessee in 1997. The number of cases of gonorrhea in
the United States reported annually remains at a high level, with over
one-half million cases being reported in 1990. There were four thousand
eight hundred seventy six (4,876) reported cases of gonorrhea in
neighboring Shelby County, Tennessee in 1997.
9-34
(k) The Surgeon General of the United States in his report of
October 22, 1986, has advised the American public that AIDS and HIV
infection may be transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug
abuse, exposure to infected blood and blood components, and from an
infected mother to her newborn.
(l) According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV
infection, as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted
by sexual acts.
(m) Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are
unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy,
and in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the
failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to self-regulate
those activities and maintain those facilities.
(n) Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen
is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view
"adult" oriented films.
(o) The findings noted in subsections (a) through (n) raise
substantial governmental concerns.
(p) Sexually oriented business have operational characteristics
which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those
substantial governmental concerns.
(q) A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate
mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the
owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses. Further,
such a licensing procedure will place a hereto fore nonexistent incentive
on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a
manner consistent with the health, safety and welfare of its patrons and
employees, as well as the citizens of the City of Bolivar. It is appropriate
to require reasonable assurance that the licensee is the actual operator
of the sexually oriented business, fully in possession and control of the
premises and activities occurring therein.
(r) Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient
lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial
governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual
activity occurring in adult theaters.
(s) Requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep
information regarding current employees and certain past employees will
help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by
facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by
preventing minors from working in such establishments.
(t) The disclosure of certain information by those persons
ultimately responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of
the sexually oriented business, where such information is substantially
9-35
related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such
uses, will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.
(u) It is desirable in the prevention of the spread of
communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information
regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this
chapter is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such
activity.
(v) The fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been
convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption
that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this
chapter.
(w) The barring of such individuals from the management of
adult uses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents
conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases.
(x) The general welfare, health, morals and safety of the citizens
of the City of Bolivar will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter.

notice in plain language to remedy the condition within ten (10) days (or twenty
(20) days if the owner of record is a carrier engaged in the transportation of
property or is a utility transmitting communications, electricity, gas, liquids,
steam, sewage, or other materials), excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal
holidays. The notice shall be sent by registered or certified United States Mail,
addressed to the last known address of the owner of record. The notice shall
state that the owner of the property is entitled to a hearing, and shall, at the
minimum, contain the following additional information:
(a) A brief statement that the owner is in violation of § 13-103
of the Bolivar Municipal Code, which has been enacted under the

(c) A cost estimate for remedying the noted condition, which
shall be in conformity with the standards of cost in the city; and

section shall immediately cause the condition to be remedied or removed at a
cost in conformity with reasonable standards, and the costs thereof shall be
assessed against the owner of the property. The city may collect the costs
assessed against the owner through an action for debt filed in any court of
competent jurisdiction. The city may bring one (1) action for debt against more
than one (1) or all of the owners of properties against whom such costs have

13-3
the costs shall be a lien on the property in favor of the municipality, second only
to liens of the state, county, and municipality for taxes, any lien of the
municipality for special assessments, and any valid lien, right, or interest in
such property duly recorded or duly perfected by filing, prior to the filing of such
notice. These costs shall be placed on the tax rolls of the municipality as a lien

the same manner as property taxes are collected. If the owner fails to pay the
costs, they may be collected at the same time and in the same manner as

designated by the board of commissioners to enforce the provisions of this
section shall immediately cause the condition to be remedied or removed at a
cost in accordance with reasonable standards in the community, with these costs
to be assessed against the owner of the property. The provisions of subsection
(4) shall apply to the collection of costs against the owner of an owner-occupied
residential property except that the municipality must wait until cumulative
charges for remediation equal or exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00) before
filing the notice with the register of deeds and the charges becoming a lien on
the property. After this threshold has been met and the lien attaches, charges
for costs for which the lien attached are collectible as provided in subsection (4)
for these charges.
(6) Appeal. The owner of record who is aggrieved by the determination
and order of the public officer may appeal the determination and order to the
board of commissioners. The appeal shall be filed with the city administrator
within ten (10) days following the receipt of the notice issued pursuant to
subsection (3) above. The failure to appeal within this time shall, without
exception, constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing.
(7) Judicial review. Any person aggrieved by an order or act of the
board of commissioners under subsection (4) above may seek judicial review of
the order or act. The time period established in subsection (3) above shall be
stayed during the pendency of judicial review.
(8) Supplemental nature of this section. The provisions of this section
are in addition and supplemental to, and not in substitution for, any other
provision in the municipal charter, this municipal code of ordinances or other
applicable law which permits the city to proceed against an owner, tenant or
occupant of property who has created, maintained, or permitted to be

for special assessments, and any valid lien, right or interest in such property
duly recorded or duly perfected by filing, prior to the filing of such notice. These
costs shall be collected by the municipality tax collector or Hardeman County
trustee at the same time and in the same manner as property taxes are
collected. If the owner fails to pay the costs, they may be collected at the same
time and in the same manner as delinquent property taxes are collected and
shall be subject to the same penalty and interest as delinquent property taxes.
In addition, the municipality may collect the costs assessed against the owner
through an action for debt filed in any court of competent jurisdiction. The
13-9
municipality may bring one (1) action for debt against more than one (1) or all
of the owners of properties against whom the costs have been assessed, and the
fact that multiple owners have been joined in one (1) action shall not be
considered by the court as a misjoinder of parties. If the structure is removed or
demolished by the city administrator, the city administrator shall sell the
materials of such structure and shall credit the proceeds of such sale against the
cost of removal or demolition, and any balance remaining shall be deposited in
the chancery court by the city administrator, shall be secured in such manner
as may be directed by such court, and shall be disbursed by such court to the
person found to be entitled thereto by final order or decree of such court.
Nothing in this section shall be construed to impair or limit in any way the
power of the municipality to define and declare nuisances and to cause their
removal or abatement, by summary proceedings or otherwise. (1998 Code,
§ 13-209, modified)
13-210. Enjoining enforcement of order. (1) Any person affected by
an order issued by the city administrator may file a bill in the chancery court for
an injunction restraining the city administrator from carrying out the provisions
of the order, and the court may, upon the filing of the bill, issue a temporary
injunction restraining the city administrator pending the final disposition of the
cause; provided, that within sixty (60) days after the posting and service of the
order of the city administrator, such person shall file the bill in the court.
Hearings shall be had by the court on such bills within twenty (20) days, or as
soon thereafter as possible, and shall be given preference over other matters on
the court's calendar.
(2) The court shall hear and determine the issues raised and shall
enter such final order or decree as law and justice may require. In all such
proceedings, the findings of the city administrator as to facts, if supported by
evidence, shall be conclusive. Costs shall be in the discretion of the court. The
remedies herein provided shall be exclusive remedies, and no person affected by
an order of the city administrator shall be entitled to recover any damages for
action taken pursuant to any order of the city administrator, or because of
noncompliance by such person with any order of the city administrator. (1998

14-603. General provisions.
14-604. Administration.
14-605. Provisions for flood hazard reduction.
14-606. Variance procedures.
14-607. Legal status provisions.
14-601. Statutory authorization, findings of fact, purpose and
objective. (1) Statutory authorization. The Legislature of the State of
Tennessee has in Tennessee Code Annotated, §§ 13-7-201 through 13-7-210,
delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations
designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizenry. Therefore, the Bolivar, Tennessee Mayor and Aldermen, does ordain
as follows:
(2) Findings of fact. (a) The Bolivar Mayor and its Legislative Body
wishes to maintain eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program
and in order to do so must meet the requirements of 60.3 of the Federal
Insurance Administration Regulations found at 44 CFR ch. 1 (10-1-04
edition).
(b) Areas of Bolivar are subject to periodic inundation which
could result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general
welfare.
(c) These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains, causing increases in flood heights and
velocities; by uses in flood hazard areas which are vulnerable to floods; or
construction which is inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise
unprotected from flood damages.
(3) Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote
the public health, safety and general welfare, and to minimize public and
private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas. This ordinance is
designed to:
(a) Restrict or prohibit uses which are vulnerable to water or
erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion, flood
heights, or velocities;
14-17
(b) Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including community
facilities, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
(c) Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream
channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the
accommodation floodwaters;
(d) Control filling, grading, dredging and other development
which may increase flood damage or erosion; and
(e) Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards
to other lands.
(4) Objectives. The objectives of this ordinance are:
(a) To protect human life, health and property;
(b) To minimize expenditure of public funds for costly flood
control projects;
(c) To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated
with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general
public;
(d) To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
(e) To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as
water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and
bridges located in floodable areas;
(f) To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the
sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to
minimize blight in flood areas;
(g) To ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that
property is in a floodable area; and
(h) To maintain eligibility for participation in the National
Flood Insurance Program. (Ord. #07-007, Nov. 2015)

building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid
storage tank, or other man-made facilities or infrastructures.
(60) "Substantial damage" means damage of any origin sustained by a
structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged
condition would equal or exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the
structure before the damage occurred.
(61) "Substantial improvement" means any repairs, reconstructions,
rehabilitations, additions, alterations or other improvements to a structure,
taking place during a five (5) year period, in which the cumulative cost equals
or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the
"start of construction" of the improvement. The market value of the structure
should be:
(a) The appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the
initial repair or improvement; or
(b) In the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the
damage occurring. This term includes structures which have incurred
"substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed.
For the purpose of this definition, "substantial improvement" is
considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other
structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects
the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include
either:
(a) Any project for improvement of a structure to correct
existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code
specifications which have been preidentified by the local code
enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe
living conditions and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair
project; or
(b) Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure."
14-25
(62) "Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or
subdivisions" is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement
of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the
value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or
improvement commenced.
(63) "Variance" is a grant of relief from the requirements of this
ordinance which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this
ordinance where specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship.
(64) "Violation" means the failure of a structure or other development
to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations.
A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other
certification, or other evidence of compliance required in this ordinance is
presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.
(65) "Water surface elevation" means the height, in relation to the
National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, (or other datum, where
specified), of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of
riverine areas. (Ord. #07-007, Nov. 2015)
14-603. General provisions. (1) Application. This ordinance shall apply
to all areas within the incorporated area of Bolivar, Tennessee.
(2) Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard. The areas
of special flood hazard identified on the Bolivar, Tennessee, Federal Emergency
Management Agency, Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and Flood Insurance Rate
Map (FIRM), Community Panel Numbers 47069C0145C, 47069C163C,
47069C164C, 47069C0235C, and 47069C0251C, dated September 28, 2007,

extended, converted or structurally altered without full compliance with the
terms of this ordinance and other applicable regulations.
(5) Abrogation and greater restrictions. This ordinance is not intended
to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this ordinance conflicts or overlaps with another
regulatory instrument, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall
prevail.
(6) Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this
ordinance, all provisions shall be:
(a) Considered as minimum requirements;
(b) Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
(c) Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted
under Tennessee statutes.
14-26
(7) Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection
required by this ordinance is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and
is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will
occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural
causes. This ordinance does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood
hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood
damages. This ordinance shall not create liability on the part of the City of
Bolivar, Tennessee or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages
that result from reliance on this ordinance or any administrative decision
lawfully made hereunder.
(8) Penalties for violation. Violation of the provisions of this ordinance
or failure to comply with any of its requirements, including violation of
conditions and safeguards established in connection with grants of variance
shall constitute a misdemeanor punishable as other misdemeanors as provided
by law. Each day such violation continues shall be considered a separate offense.
Nothing herein contained shall prevent the City of Bolivar, Tennessee from
taking such other lawful actions to prevent or remedy any violation. (Ord.
#07-007, Nov. 2015)
14-604. Administration. (1) Designation of ordinance administrator.
The building inspector is hereby appointed as the administrator to implement
the provisions of this ordinance.
(2) Permit procedures. Application for a development permit shall be
made to the administrator on forms furnished by the community prior to any
development activities. The development permit may include, but is not limited
to the following: plans in duplicate drawn to scale and showing the nature,
location, dimensions, and elevations of the area in question; existing or proposed
structures, earthen fill placement, storage of materials or equipment, and
drainage facilities. Specifically, the following information is required:
(a) Application stage. (i) Elevation in relation to mean sea level
of the proposed lowest floor, including basement, of all buildings
where BFEs are available, or to the highest adjacent grade when
applicable under this ordinance.
(ii) Elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any
non-residential building will be flood-proofed where BFEs are
available, or to the highest adjacent grade when applicable under
this ordinance.
(iii) Design certificate from a registered professional
engineer or architect that the proposed nonresidential
flood-proofed building will meet the flood-proofing criteria in
§ 14-604(2).
(iv) Description of the extent to which any watercourse
will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development.
14-27
(b) Construction stage. Within unnumbered A zones, where
flood elevation data are not available, the administrator shall record the
elevation of the lowest floor on the development permit. The elevation of
the lowest floor shall be determined as the measurement of the lowest
floor of the building relative to the highest adjacent grade.
For all new construction and substantial improvements, the permit
holder shall provide to the administrator an as-built certification of the
regulatory floor elevation or floodproofing level upon the completion of the
lowest floor or floodproofing. Within unnumbered A zones, where flood
elevation data is not available, the elevation of the lowest floor shall be
determined as the measurement of the lowest floor of the building
relative to the highest adjacent grade.
Any lowest floor certification made relative to mean sea level shall
be prepared by or under the direct supervision of, a registered land
surveyor and certified by same. When floodproofing is utilized for a
nonresidential building said certification shall be prepared by or under
the direct supervision of, a professional engineer or architect and certified
by same.
Any work undertaken prior to submission of the certification shall
be at the permit holder's risk. The administrator shall review the
above-referenced certification data. Deficiencies detected by such review
shall be corrected by the permit holder immediately and prior to further
work being allowed to proceed. Failure to submit the certification or
failure to make said corrections required hereby, shall be cause to issue
a stop-work order for the project.
(3) Duties and responsibilities of the administrator. Duties of the
administrator shall include, but not be limited to:
(a) Review of all development permits to assure that the permit
requirements of this ordinance have been satisfied, and that proposed
building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding.
(b) Advice to permittee that additional federal or state permits
may be required, and if specific federal or state permit requirements are
known, require that copies of such permits be provided and maintained
on file with the development permit. This shall include section 404 of the
Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, 33 U.S.C.
1334.
(c) Notification to adjacent communities and the Tennessee
Department of Economic and Community Development, Local Planning
Assistance Office, prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse,
and submission of evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency.
(d) For any altered or relocated watercourse, submit
engineering data/analysis within six (6) months to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency to ensure accuracy of community flood
14-28
maps through the letter of map revision process. Assure that the flood
carrying capacity within an altered or relocated portion of any
watercourse is maintained.
(e) Record the elevation, in relation to mean sea level or the
highest adjacent grade, where applicable of the lowest floor including
basement of all new or substantially improved buildings, in accordance
with § 14-604(2).
(f) Record the actual elevation; in relation to mean sea level or
the highest adjacent grade, where applicable to which the new or
substantially improved buildings have been flood-proofed, in accordance
with § 14-604(2).
(g) When floodproofing is utilized for a structure, the
administrator shall obtain certification of design criteria from a
registered professional engineer or architect, in accordance with
§ 14-604(2).
(h) Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of
boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard (for example, where there
appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field
conditions) the administrator shall make the necessary interpretation.
Any person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in this
ordinance.
(i) When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not
been provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency then the
administrator shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood
elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other
sources, including data developed as a result of these regulations, as
criteria for requiring that new substantial improvements, or other
development in Zone A on the community FIRM meet the requirements
of this ordinance.
Within unnumbered A zones, where base flood elevations have not
been established and where alternative data is not available, the
administrator shall require the lowest floor of a building to be elevated
or floodproofed to a level of at least three feet (3') above the highest
adjacent grade (lowest floor and highest adjacent grade being defined in
§ 14-602 of this ordinance). All applicable data including elevations or
floodproofing certifications shall be recorded as set forth in § 14-604(2).
(j) All records pertaining to the provisions of this ordinance
shall be maintained in the office of the administrator and shall be open
for public inspection. Permits issued under the provisions of this
ordinance shall be maintained in a separate file or marked for expedited
retrieval within combined files. (Ord. #07-007, Nov. 2015)
14-29
14-605. Provisions for flood hazard reduction. (1) General
standards. In all flood prone areas the following provisions are required:
(a) New construction and substantial improvements to existing
buildings shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral
movement of the structure;
(b) Manufactured homes shall be elevated and anchored to
prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring
may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to
ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with
applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces;
(c) New construction and substantial improvements to existing
buildings shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment
resistant to flood damage;
(d) New construction or substantial improvements to existing
buildings shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize
flood damage;
(e) All electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air
conditioning equipment, and other service facilities shall be designed
and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating
within the components during conditions of flooding;
(f) New and replacement water supply systems shall be
designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the
system;
(g) New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be
designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the
systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters;
(h) On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and
constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them
during flooding;
(i) Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvements to a
building that is in compliance with the provisions of this ordinance, shall
meet the requirements of "new construction" as contained in this
ordinance; and
(j) Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvements to a
building that is not in compliance with the provision of this ordinance,
shall be undertaken only if said nonconformity is not further extended or
replaced.
(2) Specific standards. These provisions shall apply to all areas of
special flood hazard as provided herein:
(a) Residential construction. Where base flood elevation data is
available, new construction or substantial improvement of any residential
building (or manufactured home) shall have the lowest floor, including
basement, elevated no lower than one foot (1') above the base flood
elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a
14-30
structure, openings sufficient to facilitate equalization of flood hydrostatic
forces on both sides of exterior walls and to ensure unimpeded movement
of floodwater shall be provided in accordance with the standards of this
section.
Within unnumbered A zones, where base flood elevations have not
been established and where alternative data is not available, the
administrator shall require the lowest floor of a building to be elevated
or floodproofed to a level of at least three feet (3') above the highest
adjacent grade (lowest floor and highest adjacent grade being defined in
§ 14-602 of this ordinance). All applicable data including elevations or
floodproofing certifications shall be recorded as set forth in § 14-604(2).
(b) Non-residential construction. New construction or
substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial, or
non-residential building, when BFE data is available, shall have the
lowest floor, including basement, elevated or floodproofed no lower than
one foot (1') above the level of the base flood elevation.
Within unnumbered A zones, where base flood elevations have not
been established and where alternative data is not available, the
administrator shall require the lowest floor of a building to be elevated
or floodproofed to a level of at least three feet (3') above the highest
adjacent grade (lowest floor and highest adjacent grade being defined in
§ 14-602 of this ordinance). All applicable data including elevations or
floodproofing certifications shall be recorded as set forth in § 14-604(2).
Buildings located in all A zones may be floodproofed, in lieu of
being elevated, provided that all areas of the building below the required
elevation are watertight, with walls substantially impermeable to the
passage of water, and are built with structural components having the
capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects
of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify
that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with
accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall
provide such certification to the administrator as set forth in § 14-604(2).
(c) Elevated building. All new construction or substantial
improvements to existing buildings that include any fully enclosed areas
formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the base flood
elevation, or required height above the highest adjacent grade, shall be
designed to preclude finished living space and designed to allow for the
entry and exit of flood waters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood
forces on exterior walls.
(i) Designs for complying with this requirement must
either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet
the following minimum criteria:
14-31
(A) Provide a minimum of two (2) openings having
a total net area of not less than one (1) square inch for every
square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding;
(B) The bottom of all openings shall be no higher
than one foot (1') above the finish grade; and
(C) Openings may be equipped with screens,
louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they
permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions.
(ii) Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum
necessary to allow for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited
storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the
premises (standard exterior door) or entry to the elevated living
area (stairway or elevator); and
(iii) The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be
partitioned or finished into separate rooms in such a way as to
impede the movement of floodwaters and all such petitions shall
comply with the provisions of § 14-605(2) of this ordinance.
(d) Standards for manufactured homes and recreational
vehicles. (i) All manufactured homes placed, or substantially
improved, on:
(A) Individual lots or parcels;
(B) In expansions to existing manufactured home
parks or subdivisions; or
(C) In new or substantially improved
manufactured home parks or subdivisions, must meet all
the requirements of new construction, including elevations
and anchoring.
(ii) All manufactured homes placed or substantially
improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision
must be elevated so that either:
(A) When base flood elevations are available the
lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated on a
permanent foundation no lower than one foot (1') above the
level of the base flood elevation; or
(B) Absent base flood elevations the manufactured
home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers
(or other foundation elements) at least three feet (3') in
height above the highest adjacent grade.
(iii) Any manufactured home, which has incurred
"substantial damage" as the result of a flood or that has
substantially improved, must meet the standards of § 14-605(2)(d)
of this ordinance.
14-32
(iv) All manufactured homes must be securely anchored
to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation,
collapse and lateral movement.
(v) All recreational vehicles placed on identified flood
hazard sites must either:
(A) Be on the site for fewer than one hundred
eighty (180) consecutive days;
(B) Be fully licensed and ready for highway use. A
recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed,
on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by
quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has
no permanently attached structures or additions.
(C) The recreational vehicle must meet all the
requirements for new construction, including the anchoring
and elevation requirements of this section above if on the
site for longer than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive
days.
(e) Standards for subdivisions. Subdivisions and other proposed
new developments, including manufactured home parks, shall be
reviewed to determine whether such proposals will be reasonably safe
from flooding. If a subdivision proposal or other proposed new
development is in a floodprone area, any such proposals shall be reviewed
to ensure that:
(i) All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the
need to minimize flood damage.
(ii) All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities
and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems
located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage.
(iii) All subdivision proposals shall have adequate
drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards.
(iv) Base flood elevation data shall be provided for
subdivision proposals and other proposed developments (including
manufactured home parks and subdivisions) that are greater than
fifty (50) lots and/or five (5) acres in area.
(3) Standards for areas of special flood hazard with established base
flood elevations and with floodways designated. Located within the areas of
special flood hazard established in § 14-603(2) are areas designated as
floodways. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity
of floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain
free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without
increased flood heights and velocities. Therefore, the following provisions shall
apply:
(a) Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill
material, new construction, substantial improvements or other
14-33
developments within the regulatory floodway. Development may be
permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and
hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering
practices that the cumulative effect of the proposed encroachments or
new development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated
development, shall not result in any increase the water surface elevation
of the base flood level, velocities or floodway widths during the occurrence
of a base flood discharge at any point within the community. A registered
professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and
certification thereof.
(b) New construction or substantial improvements of buildings
shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of
§ 14-605.
(4) Standards for areas of special flood hazard Zones AE with
established base flood elevations but without floodways designated. Located
within the areas of special flood hazard established in § 14-603(2), where
streams exist with base flood data provided but where no floodways have been
designated, (Zones AE) the following provisions apply:
(a) No encroachments, including fill material, new structures
or substantial improvements shall be located within areas of special flood
hazard, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is
provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed
development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated
development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base
flood more than one foot (1') at any point within the community. The
engineering certification should be supported by technical data that
conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles.
(b) New construction or substantial improvements of buildings
shall be elevated or flood-proofed to elevations established in accordance
with § 14-605(2).
(5) Standards for streams without established base flood elevations or
floodways (A Zones). Located within the areas of special flood hazard established
in § 14-603, where streams exist, but no base flood data has been provided (A
Zones), or where a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions
shall apply:
(a) When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not
been provided in accordance with § 14-603, then the administrator shall
obtain, review and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood
elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state or other
source, in order to administer the provisions of § 14-605. Only if data is
not available from these sources, then the following provisions (b) and (c)
shall apply:
(b) No encroachments, including structures or fill material,
shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or twenty
14-34
feet (20'), whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream
bank, unless certification by registered professional engineer is provided
demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development,
when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will
not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one
foot (1') at any point within the community. The engineering certification
should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard
hydraulic engineering principles.
(c) In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation
data, new construction or substantial improvements of existing shall have
the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated
no less than three feet (3') above the highest adjacent grade at the
building site. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements
of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with the standards of
§ 14-605(2), and "elevated buildings."
(6) Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO and AH Zones).
Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in § 14-603(2), are
areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have special flood
hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet (1'  3') where a
clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate; therefore, the following provisions apply:
(a) All new construction and substantial improvements of
residential and non-residential buildings shall have the lowest floor,
including basement, elevated to at least one foot (1') above the flood depth
number specified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), in feet, above
the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the
lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated, at least three feet (3')
above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the
unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance
with standards of § 14-605(2), and "elevated buildings."
(b) All new construction and substantial improvements of
nonresidential buildings may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The
structure together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities must be
floodproofed and designed watertight to be completely floodproofed to at
least one foot (1') above the specified FIRM flood level, with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy. If no depth number is
specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be floodproofed to at
least three feet (3') above the highest adjacent grade. A registered
professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and
methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of
practice for meeting the provisions of this ordinance and shall provide
14-35
such certification to the administrator as set forth above and as required
in § 14-604(2).
(c) Adequate drainage paths shall be provided around slopes to
guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.
(d) The administrator shall certify the elevation or the highest
adjacent grade, where applicable, and the record shall become a
permanent part of the permit file.
(7) Standards for areas protected by flood protection system (A-99
Zones). Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in § 14-603
are areas of the 100-year floodplain protected by a flood protection system but
where base flood elevations and flood hazard factors have not been determined.
Within these areas (A-99 Zones) all provisions of §§ 14-604 and 14-604(1) shall
apply.
(8) Standards for unmapped streams. Located within Bolivar,
Tennessee are unmapped streams where areas of special flood hazard are
neither indicated nor identified. Adjacent to such streams the following
provisions shall apply:
(a) In areas adjacent to such unmapped streams, no
encroachments including fill material or structures shall be located
within an area of at least equal to twice the width of the stream,
measured from the top of each stream bank, unless certification by a
registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the
cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all
other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water
surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot (1') at any point
within the locality.
(b) When new elevation data is available, new construction or
substantial improvements of buildings shall be elevated or floodproofed
to elevations established in accordance with § 14-604. (Ord. #07-007, Nov.
2015)
14-606. Variance procedures. The provisions of this section shall apply
exclusively to areas of special flood hazard within Bolivar, Tennessee.
(1) Board of zoning appeals. (a) The Bolivar Board of Zoning Appeals
shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the
requirements of this ordinance.
(b) Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of
historic structures (see definition) upon a determination that the
proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's
continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the
minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
(c) In passing upon such applications, the board of zoning
appeals shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all
standards specified in other sections of this ordinance, and:
14-36
(i) The danger that materials may be swept onto other
property to the injury of others;
(ii) The danger to life and property due to flooding or
erosion;
(iii) The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its
contents to flood damage;
(iv) The importance of the services provided by the
proposed facility to the community;
(v) The necessity of the facility to a waterfront location,
in the case of a functionally dependent facility;
(vi) The availability of alternative locations, not subject
to flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use;
(vii) The relationship of the proposed use to the
comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that
area;
(viii) The safety of access to the property in times of flood
for ordinary and emergency vehicles;
(ix) The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise
and sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave
action, if applicable, expected at the site; and
(x) The costs of providing governmental services during
and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of
public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and
water systems, and streets and bridges.
(d) Upon consideration of the factors listed above, and the
purposes of this ordinance, the board of floodplain review may attach
such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to
effectuate the purposes of this ordinance.
(e) Variances shall not be issued within any designated
floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge
would result.
(2) Conditions for variances. (a) Variances shall be issued upon a
determination that the variance is the minimum relief necessary,
considering the flood hazard; and in the instance of a historical building,
a determination that the variance is the minimum relief necessary so as
not to destroy the historic character and design of the building.
(b) Variances shall only be issued upon: a showing of good and
sufficient cause, a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship; or a determination that the granting of a
variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to
public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud
on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or
ordinances.
14-37
(c) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the issuance of a variance to construct a structure
below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood
insurance, and that such construction below the base flood level increases
risks to life and property.

16-303. Construction specifications. The council will require all new
streets, prior to being accepted by the city, to meet the following construction
specifications:
(1) Minimum right-of way widths. (a) Minor residential streets,

streets, sixty feet (60').
(2) Minimum pavement widths. (a) Minor residential streets, marginal
access streets and dead end streets, twenty-eight feet (28') (face of curb
to face of curb).
(b) Collector streets and commercial-industrial subdivision
streets, thirty-six feet (36') (face of curb to face of curb).
(3) Roadway improvements. (a) Base: A compacted base course six
inches (6") deep and three feet (3') wider than the width of the pavement
on each side of the street shall be installed on all streets, including
cul-de-sac, temporary turnarounds and access streets to adjoining
properties, according to the method specified in Section 303, Standard
Specifications for Roads and Bridge Construction, Tennessee Department
of Highways and Public Works - January 1, 1968, and latest revisions

After completion of the basic course, the city's public works
department shall be contacted to inspect the smoothness and depth of the
base course before the prime coat may be applied.
(b) Prime coat: After a thoroughly compacted base has been
established, a prime coat shall be applied as specified in section 402,
Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction, Tennessee
Department of Highways and Public Works - January 1, 1968, the latest
revision thereto.
(c) Curbs and gutters: All streets shall provide curbs and
gutters as indicated below:
(i) Concrete curbs and integral gutters shall not be less
than eighteen inches (18") wide at the base, twelve inches (12")
high, six inches (6") across the top of the curb, six inches (6") on the
face of the curb, and a seven inch (7") thick gutter. Backfill shall
be towards the curb and higher than the curb to ensure drainage
of surface water into the drainage system. Where access streets to
adjoining properties are provided, curbs and gutters shall be
extended to the property line.
(ii) One-half inch to three-fourths inch (1/2" to 3/4")
expansion and contraction joints for curbs and gutters shall be
placed at intervals not exceeding forty feet (40').
(4) Storm drainage. (a) An adequate drainage system, including
necessary open ditches, pipes, culverts, intersectional drains, drop inlets,
bridges, etc., shall be provided for the proper drainage of surface water.
Cross drains shall be provided to accommodate all natural water flow,
and shall be sufficient length to permit full width roadway and the
required slopes. The size openings to be provided shall be determined by
Talbot's formula, but in no case shall the pipe be less than fifteen inches
(15"). Cross drains shall be built on straight line and grade, and shall be
laid on a firm base but not on rock. Pipes shall be laid with the spigot end
pointing in the direction of the flow and with the ends fitted and matched
to provide tight joints and a smooth uniform invert. They shall be placed
at a sufficient depth below the roadbed to avoid dangerous pressure of
impact, and in no case shall the top of the pipe be less than one foot (1')
below the roadbed.
(b) If necessary to determine proper drainage facilities, the
planning commission or city engineer may require the developer to
outline the entire drainage area of the proposed construction along with
a map showing the various streets and parcels and indicating the general
flow of the surface water, either by contours or by means of arrows
running with the flow. Any existing storm drainage with the size, grade
and elevations of the pipes and elevations of the inlets, as nearly as can
16-10
be shown. Also, area tributaries to the various proposed inlets shall be
outlined and the number of acres contained in each indicated by figures
adjacent to the inlet to which they are applicable.
(c) Since curbs and gutters are required, all streets shall
provide catch basins at all low points, and at intermediate locations as
necessary to prevent overloading of the street gutters, but at least every
six hundred feet (600'). Catch basins shall be the curb and gutter inlet
type and shall empty into collection mains of adequate size with outfalls
leading to existing storm sewers or approved waterways. When
easements are required for drainage facilities outside the road
right-of-way, the easements shall be at least fifteen feet (15') in width and
shall be indicated on the final plat. (1998 Code, § 16-303)

its mains to the property line at the expense of the applicant for service. The
location of such lines will be determined by the city.
Before a new water or sewer service line will be laid by the city, the
applicant shall pay a nonrefundable connection charge of fifty dollars ($50.00).
When service line is completed, the city shall be responsible for the
maintenance and upkeep of such service line from the main to and including the
meter and meter box, and such portion of the service line shall belong to the city.
The city will install the sewer service line from the public sewer to the
property line. The property owner or tenant shall maintain and keep in repair
the sewer service line from the building to the public sewer in the street.
(Ord. #13-002, May 2013)
18-26
18-406. Water and sewer main extensions.1 Persons desiring water
and/or sewer main extensions must pay all of the cost of making such
extensions.
All such extensions shall be installed either by city forces or by other
forces working directly under the supervision of the city in accordance with
plans and specifications prepared by an engineer registered with the State of
Tennessee.
Upon completion of such extensions and their approval by the city, such
water and/or sewer mains shall become the property of the city. The persons
paying the cost of constructing such mains shall execute any written
instruments requested by the city to provide evidence of the city's title to such
mains. In consideration of such mains being transferred to it, the city shall
incorporate said mains as an integral part of the municipal water and sewer
systems and shall furnish water and sewer service therefrom in accordance with
these rules and regulations, subject always to such limitations as may exist
because of the size and elevation of the mains. Said mains shall be maintained
by the developer of construction for one (1) year.
The applicant for the building sewer permit for a connection into public
sewer shall notify the Bolivar Utility Office when the sewer is ready for
inspection. The connections shall be inspected by the superintendent or his
representative. (Ord. #13-002, May 2013)
18-407. Water and sewer main extension variances. Whenever the
Bolivar Utility Board is of the opinion that it is to be in the best interest of the
city and its inhabitants to construct a water and/or sewer main extension
without requiring strict compliance with the preceding section, such extension
may be constructed upon such terms and conditions as shall be approved by the
Bolivar Utility Board.
The authority to make water and/or sewer main extensions under the
preceding section is permissive only and nothing contained therein shall be
construed as requiring the city to make such extensions or to furnish service to
any person or persons. (Ord. #13-002, May 2013)
18-408. Meters. All meters shall be installed, tested, repaired, and
removed only by the city.
No one shall do anything which will in any way interfere with or prevent
the operation of a meter. No one shall tamper with or work on a water meter
without the written permission of the city. No one shall install any pipe or other

passage of such water being registered fully by the meter. (Ord. #13-002, May
2013)
18-409. Safety. All excavations for building sewer installation shall be
adequately guarded with barricades and lights so as to protect the public from
hazard. Streets, sidewalks, parkways, and other public property disturbed in the
course of the work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory to the city.
(Ord. #13-002, May 2013)
18-410. Customer billing and payment policy. Water and sewer bills
shall be rendered monthly and shall designate a standard net payment period
for all members of not less than fifteen (15) days after the date of the bill.

There is established for all members a late payment charge not to exceed ten
percent (10%) for any portion of the bill paid after the net payment period.
Payment must be received in the Bolivar Utility Department no later
than 4:30 P.M. on the due date. If the due date falls on Saturday, Sunday, or a
holiday, net payment will be accepted if paid on the next business day no later
than 4:30 P.M.
Service termination for any reason shall be reconnected only after the
payment of all charges due or satisfactory arrangements for payment have been
made or the correction of the problems that resulted in the termination of
service in a manner satisfactory to the water and sewer department, plus the
payment of a reconnection charge of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) if the
reconnection is made during regular business hours.
If a meter fails to register properly, or if a meter is removed to be tested
or repaired, or if water is received other than through a meter, the city reserves
the right to render an estimated bill based on the best information available.
(Ord. #13-002, May 2013)
18-411. Termination or refusal of service. Basis of termination or
refusal. The city shall have the right to discontinue water and sewer service or

(Ord. #13-002, May 2013)
18-412. Access to customers' premises. The city's identified
representatives and employees shall be granted access to all customers'
premises at all reasonable times for the purpose of reading meters, for testing,
inspecting, repairing, removing, and replacing all equipment belonging to the
city, and for inspecting customer's plumbing and premises generally in order to
secure compliance with these rules and regulations. (Ord. #13-002, May 2013)
18-28
18-413. Inspections. The city shall have the right, but shall not be
obligated to inspect any installation or plumbing systems before water and/or
sewer service is furnished or any later time. The city reserves the right to refuse
service or to discontinue service to any premises not in compliance with this
chapter, the rules and regulations of the Bolivar Utility Department, or other
requirements of the city. An inspection fee of fifteen dollars ($15.00) shall be
assessed for each inspection.
Any failure to inspect or reject a customer's installation or plumbing
systems shall not render the city liable nor responsible for any loss or damage
that might have been avoided has such inspection or rejection been made.
(Ord. #13-002, May 2013, as amended by Ord. #14-007, Sept. 2014)
18-414. Customer's responsibility for system's property. Except as
herein elsewhere expressly provided, all meters, service connections, and other
equipment furnished by or for the city shall be and remain the property of the
city. Each customer shall provide space for and exercise proper care to protect
the property of the city on his/her premises. In the event of loss or damage to
such property arising from the neglect of a customer to care for it properly, the
cost of necessary repairs or replacements shall be paid by customer.
(Ord. #13-002, May 2013)
18-415. Customer's responsibility for violations. Where the city
furnished water and/or sewer service to a customer, such customer shall be
responsible for all violations of these rules and regulations which occur on the
premises so served. Personal participation by the customer in any such
violations shall not be necessary to impose such personal responsibility on him.
(Ord. #13-002, May 2013)
18-416. Supply and resale of water. All water shall be supplied within
the city exclusively by the city, and no customer shall, directly or indirectly, sell,
sublet, assign, or otherwise dispose of the water or any part thereof except with
written permission from the city. (Ord. #13-002, May 2013)
18-417. Unauthorized use of or interference with water supply.

spigots, or fire plugs without permission or authority from the city.
(Ord. #13-002, May 2013)
18-418. Limited use of unmetered private fire line. Where a private
fire line is not metered, no water shall be used from such line or from any fire
hydrant thereon except to fight fire or except when being inspected in the
presence of an authorized agent of the city.
All private fire hydrants shall be sealed by the city, and shall be inspected
at regular intervals to see that they are in proper condition and that no water
18-29
is being used therefrom in violation of these rules and regulations. When the
seal is broken on account of fire, or for any other reason, the customer taking
such service shall immediately give the city a written notice of such occurrence.
(Ord. #13-002, May 2013)
18-419. Damages to property due to water pressure. The city shall
not be liable to any customer for damages caused to his plumbing or property by
high pressure, low pressure, or fluctuations in pressure in the city's water
mains. (Ord. #13-002, May 2013)
18-420. Liability for cutoff failures. The city's liability shall be limited
to the forfeiture of the right to charge a customer for water that is not used but
is received from a service line under any of the following circumstances:
(1) After receipt of at least ten (10) days' written notice to cut off water
service, the city had failed to cut off such service.
(2) The city has attempted to cut off a service but such service has not
been completely cut off.
(3) The city has completely cut off a service but subsequently the cutoff
develops a leak or is turned on again so that water enters the customer's pipes
from the city's main.
Except to the extent stated above, the city shall not be liable for any loss
or damage resulting from cutoff failures. If a customer wishes to avoid possible
damage for cutoff failures, the customer shall rely exclusively on privately
owned cutoffs and not on the city's cutoff. Also, the customer (and not the city)
shall be responsible for seeing that his plumbing is properly drained and is kept
properly drained, after his water service has been cut off. (Ord. #13-002, May
2013)
18-421. Restricted use of water. In times of emergencies or in times
of water shortage the city reserves the right to restrict the purposes for which
water may be used by a customer and the amount of water which a customer
may use. (Ord. #13-002, May 2013)
18-422. Interruption of service. The city will endeavor to furnish
continuous water and sewer service, but does not guarantee to the customer any
fixed pressure or continuous service. The city shall not be liable for any damages
for any interruption of service whatsoever.
In connection with the operation, maintenance, repair, and extension of
the municipal water and sewer systems, the water supply may be shut off
without notice when necessary or desirable, and each customer must be
prepared for such emergencies. The city shall not be liable for any damages from
such interruption of service or for damages from the resumption of service
without notice after any such interruption. (Ord. #13-002, May 2013)
18-30
18-423. Schedule of rates.1 All water and sewer service shall be
furnished under such rate schedules as the city may from time to time adopt by
appropriate ordinance or resolution. (Ord. #13-002, May 2013)

18-511. Monitoring, inspection, and entry.
18-512. Emergency suspension of services.
18-513. Enforcement.
18-501. Installation requirements. All existing, proposed or newly
remodeled food service facilities inside the Bolivar Utility Department
wastewater service area which are likely to discharge grease to Bolivar Utility
Department's sanitary sewer system will be required to install an approved,
properly operated and maintained grease interceptor. All users found to be
operating without a grease interceptor as specified in this policy will be given
one hundred eighty (180) days to install an approved grease interceptor at the
user's expense. This one hundred eighty (180) day period shall include the
following:
(1) A maximum of ninety (90) days to submit plans and obtain Bolivar
Utility Department's approval on those plans.
(2) After plans approval, the remaining time will be applied to the
installation of the interceptor.
(3) All interceptors must be inspected and approved by Bolivar Utility
Department's manager before being placed into service. (Ord. #11-008, Oct.
2011)
18-502. Prohibited discharge. Janitor sinks or fixtures, which have
potential to discharge black water to the grease interceptor, will not discharge
through the grease interceptor unless specifically approved by the Bolivar
Utility Department's manager. (Ord. #11-008, Oct. 2011)
18-503. Existing food service facilities. Existing food service facilities
may connect any fixture to a grease interceptor, except fixtures which may
discharge black water to the grease interceptor. Garbage grinder and dishwater
18-32
connections are not recommended. Food particles from garbage grinders take up
storage capacity in the grease interceptor and may require that the interceptor
be pumped more frequently. Dishwashers discharge hot water and soap into the
interceptor, which can melt grease stored inside the interceptor into the
customer's service line and the public sewer system where grease hardens and
causes line clogs. Any grease blockages or overflows will result in enforcement
actions by Bolivar Utility Department's manager. (Ord. #11-008, Oct. 2011)
18-504. Proposed and remodeled food service facilities. Proposed
and remodeled food service facilities may not connect janitor sinks, garbage
grinders, dishwashers and black water fixtures to a grease interceptor. In order
to discharge black water into the grease interceptor, approval must be granted
by Bolivar Utility Department. (Ord. #11-008, Oct. 2011)
18-505. General criteria--location. Each grease interceptor will be
installed and connected so that it may be easily accessible for inspection,
cleaning, and removal of the intercepted grease at any time. A grease
interceptor may not be installed in part of the building unless approved by
Bolivar Utility Department. Location of the grease interceptor will meet the
approval of Bolivar Utility Department. The best location is in an area outside
of an outside wall, but upstream from the black water drain line. (Ord. #11-008,
Oct. 2011)
18-506. General criteria--design. Grease interceptors will be
constructed in accordance with Bolivar Utility Department standards and will
have a minimum of two (2) compartments with fittings designed for grease
retention. Other grease removal devices or technologies not meeting the grease
interceptor definition in § 18-501 will be subject to the written approval of the
utility manager. Such approval will be based on demonstrated removal
efficiencies of the proposed technology. Under sink traps and in floor units must
be approved by Bolivar Utility Department. Access to grease interceptors will
be provided by two (2) manholes terminating one inch (1") above a finished
grade wtih cast iron frame and cover. Covers will be gas tight in construction.
In areas where additional weight loads may exist, the grease interceptor will be
designed to have adequate load bearing capacity (example: vehicular traffic in
parking or driving areas). Wastewater discharging to the grease interceptor will
enter only through the inlet pipe of the interceptor. Each grease interceptor will
have only one (1) inlet and one (1) outlet pipe.
All grease interceptors will have a capacity of not less than one thousand
(1,000) gallons nor exceed a capacity of three thousand (3,000) gallons, then
multiple units in series will be installed. Grease interceptor designs represent
minimum standards for normal usage. Installations with heavier usage require
more stringent measures for which the user is responsible and will pay the costs
18-33
to provide additional measures if required by Bolivar Utility Department.
(Ord. #11-008, Oct. 2011)
18-507. Grease interceptor sizing. The size of a grease interceptor will
be determined by the following formula:
Restaurants:
(S) x (GS) X (HR/12) x (LF) = Interceptor Capacity (in gallons)
GS = Number of seats in dining area
GS = Gallons of wastewater per seat (use 20 gallons for ordinary restaurants,
use 10 gallons of single service restaurants)
HR = Number of hours restaurant is open
LF = Loading factor (use 1.25 for interstate highway, 1.00 other freeways, 1.00
recreational area, 0.80 main highway and 0.50 other highways)
Other Establishments with Commercial Kitchens:
(M) x (GM) x (LF) = Interceptor Capacity (in gallons)
M = Meals prepared per day
GM = Gallons of wastewater per meal (use five gallons)
LF = Loading factor (use 1.00 with dishwashing machine and 0.50 without
dishwashing machine) (Ord. #11-008, Oct. 2011)
18-508. Grease interceptor maintenance. (1) Pumping. All grease
interceptors will be maintained at the user's expense. Maintenance will include
the complete removal of all contents, including floating materials, wastewater,
and bottom sludge and solids. Decanting or discharging of removed waste back
into the interceptor from which the waste was removed or any other grease
interceptor, for the purpose of reducing the volume to be disposed, is prohibited.
The pumping frequency will be determined by Bolivar Utility Department and
the user.
(2) Repairs. Necessary repairs to the user's interceptor can be made
by an outside source at the user's expense. If an outside source is used, all
repairs must be inspected by Bolivar Utility Department before the interceptor
is placed back into service.
(3) Pumping frequency and disposal. Grease interceptors must be
pumped out completely at the determined schedule to prevent carry over of
grease into the sanitary sewer collection system. All waste removed from each
grease interceptor must be disposed at the proper location. In no way will the
pumpage be returned to any private or public portion of the sanitary sewer
collection system.
(4) Additives. Any additive(s) placed into the grease interceptor or
building discharge line system on a constant, regular, or scheduled basis will be
18-34
reported to the manager. Such additives will include, but not be limited to
enzymes, commercially available bacteria, or other additives designed to absorb,
purge, consume, treat, or otherwise eliminate fats, oils, and grease. The use of
additives will in no way be considered as a substitution to the maintenance
procedures required herein.
(5) Chemical treatment. Chemical treatment such as drain cleaners,
acid and other chemicals designed to dissolve or remove grease will not be
allowed to enter the grease interceptor. (Ord. #11-008, Oct. 2011)
18-509. Permit requirements. Permit. It will be unlawful for any
facility producing grease to discharge waste into the sanitary sewer collection
system without authorization from Bolivar Utility Department. Bolivar Utility
Department may require an application for approval of grease interceptors. This
will be handled through Bolivar Utility Department. If, after examining the
information contained in the grease interceptor permit application, it is
determined that the proposed discharge does not conflict with the provisions of
this chapter a permit may be issued allowing the discharge of such wastes into
the sanitary sewer collection system. The terms and conditions of the permit
may be subject to modification by Bolivar Utility Department as limitations or
requirements as identified in this chapter are modified or other just cause
exists. The user will be informed of any proposed changes at least thirty (30)
days prior to the effective date of the change(s). Any changes or new conditions
in the permit will include a reasonable time schedule for compliance. As a
condition precedent to the granting of a permit, the permittee under this section
will agree to hold harmless Bolivar Utility Department and Bolivar Utility
Department employees from any liabilities arising from the permit holder's
operations under this permit. (Ord. #11-008, Oct. 2011)
18-510. Administrative requirements. Manifest. All pumpage from
grease interceptors will be tracked by a manifest, which confirms pumping,
hauling, and disposal of waste. The customer will be given a copy of the original
manifest by the hauler. (Ord. #11-008, Oct. 2011)
18-511. Monitoring, inspection, and entry. (1) Monitoring. When
required for the purpose of this chapter, the user shall provide, operate and
maintain, at the user's expense, safe and accessible monitoring facilities (such
as a suitable manhole) at all times to allow observation, inspection, sampling,
and flow measurement of the building sewer or internal drainage systems.
There shall be ample room in or near such monitoring facility to allow accurate
sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. Samples outside of normal
testing will be at the user's expense. When the physical location and hydraulic
conditions are suitable, a manhole or similar facility existing on the sanitary
sewer collection system may be utilized as the user's manhole when agreed to
by both the user and the manager.
18-35
(2) Inspection and entry. Authorized personnel of Bolivar Utility
Department, bearing proper credentials and identification, shall have the right
to enter upon all properties subject to this chapter, at any time and without
prior notification, for the purpose of inspection, observation, measurement,
sampling, testing or record review, in accordance with this chapter.
(Ord. #11-008, Oct. 2011)
18-512. Emergency suspension of services. Bolivar Utility
Department may suspend water or sewer service when such suspension is
necessary, in the opinion of the manager, in order to stop an actual or
threatened discharge which:
(1) Presents or may present an imminent or substantial endangerment
to the health or welfare of persons or the environment;
(2) Causes stoppages or excessive maintenance to be performed to
prevent stoppages in the sanitary sewer collection system;
(3) Causes interferences to the Publicly Owned Treatment Works
(POTW); or
(4) Causes Bolivar Utility Department to violate any condition of its
National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit.
Water or sewer service may be suspended when a user required to operate
a grease interceptor is found to be in noncompliance with the regulations stated
in this chapter. Any person notified of a suspension of the water or sewer service
shall immediately stop or eliminate the discharge. In the event of a failure of
the person to comply voluntarily with the suspension order, Bolivar Utility
Department shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate
termination of water or sewer service, to prevent or minimize damage to the
POTW system or sewer connection or endangered to any individuals. Bolivar
Utility Department shall reinstate the water or sewer service when such
conditions causing the suspension have passed or been eliminated. A detailed
written statement submitted by the user describing the cause(s) of the harmful
discharge and the measure(s) taken to prevent any future occurrence shall be
submitted to Bolivar Utility Department within fifteen (15) days of the date of
occurrence. (Ord. #11-008, Oct. 2011)
18-513. Enforcement. The manager shall have the administrative
authority to enforce this chapter. Whenever Bolivar Utility Department finds
that any user has violated or is violating this chapter, or any prohibition,
limitation, or requirements contained herein, the manager will implement
Bolivar Utility Departments Enforcement Response Plan. Enforcement
response necessary to initiate corrective action may include but not be limited
to the following:
(1) Notice of violation. Bolivar Utility Department may serve upon any
user a written notice stating the nature of violation. Within fifteen (15) days of
the date of notice, a plan for the satisfactory correction thereof shall be
18-36
submitted to the manager by the user. Each days violation of this chapter shall
be considered a separate offense, with a fifty dollar ($50.00) fine.
(2) Authorization. The manager is authorized to promulgate such rules
as shall be reasonable and necessary to carry out the provisions of this chapter
according to its terms and intent. (Ord. #11-008, Oct. 2011)

occupancy permit, the Historic Zoning Commission shall give prime consideration
to: (1) historical and/or architectural value of the present structure; (2) the
relationship of the exterior architectural features of such structure to the rest of
the structure and to the surrounding area; (3) the general compatibility of
exterior design, arrangement, texture, and materials proposed to be used; and

Section A. Statutory Authorization
The Legislature of the State of Tennessee has in Sections 13-7-201 through 13-7-210;
Tennessee Code Annotated delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to
adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of
its citizenry. Therefore, the Bolivar, Tennessee Mayor and Aldermen, does ordain as
follows.
Section B Findings of Fact
1. The Bolivar Mayor and its Legislative Body wishes to maintain eligibility in the
National Flood Insurance Program and in order to do so must meet the
requirements of 60.3 of the Federal Insurance Administration Regulations found
at 44 CFR Ch. 1 (10-1-04 Edition).
2. Areas of Bolivar are subject to periodic inundation which could result in loss of
life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection
and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the
public health, safety and general welfare.
3. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in
floodplains, causing increases in flood heights and velocities; by uses in flood
hazard areas which are vulnerable to floods; or construction which is
inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood
damages.
Section C Statement of Purpose
It is the purpose of this Ordinance to promote the public health, safety and general
welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific
areas. This Ordinance is designed to:
1. Restrict or prohibit uses which are vulnerable to water or erosion hazards, or
which result in damaging increases in erosion, flood heights, or velocities;
2. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including community facilities, be
protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
3. Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural
protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation floodwaters;
4. Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase
flood damage or erosion, and;
5. Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally
divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.
Bolivar, Tennessee | 92
Section D. Objectives
The objectives of this Ordinance are:
1. To protect human life, health and property;
2. To minimize expenditure of public funds for costly flood control projects;
3. To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and
generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
4. To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
5. To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains,
electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodable
areas;
6. To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize blight in
flood areas;
7. To ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a floodable
area; and
8. To maintain eligibility for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program.

the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2)
in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term
includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair
work performed.
Bolivar, Tennessee| 99
For the purpose of this definition, Substantial Improvement is considered to occur when the
first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does
not, however, include either: (1) Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing

without the elevation certificate, other certification, or other evidence of compliance required
in this Ordinance is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is
provided.
"Water Surface Elevation" means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical
Datum (NGVD) of 1929, (or other datum, where specified) of floods of various magnitudes and
frequencies in the floodplains of riverine areas.

Section B. Specific Standards
These provisions shall apply to ALL Areas of Special Flood Hazard as provided herein:
1. Residential Construction. Where base flood elevation data is available, new
construction or substantial improvement of any residential building (or
manufactured home) shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated
no lower than one (1) foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid
foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to
facilitate equalization of flood hydrostatic forces on both sides of exterior walls
and to ensure unimpeded movement of floodwater shall be provided in
accordance with the standards of Article V. Section B.
Within unnumbered A zones, where base flood elevations have not been
established and where alternative data is not available, the Administrator shall
require the lowest floor of a building to be elevated or floodproofed to a level of
at least three (3) feet above the highest adjacent grade (lowest floor and highest
adjacent grade being defined in Article II of this Ordinance). All applicable data
including elevations or flood proofing certifications shall be recorded as set forth
in Article IV. Section B.
2. Non-Residential Construction. New construction or substantial improvement of
any commercial, industrial, or non-residential building, when BFE data is
available, shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated or
floodproofed no lower than one (1) foot above the level of the base flood
elevation.
Within unnumbered A zones, where base flood elevations have not been
established and where alternative data is not available, the Administrator shall
require the lowest floor of a building to be elevated or floodproofed to a level of
at least three (3) feet above the highest adjacent grade (lowest floor and highest
Bolivar, Tennessee| 105
adjacent grade being defined in Article II of this Ordinance). All applicable data
including elevations or flood proofing certifications shall be recorded as set forth
in Article IV. Section B.
Buildings located in all A-zones may be flood-proofed, in lieu of being elevated,
provided that all areas of the building below the required elevation are
watertight, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and
are built with structural components having the capability of resisting
hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy. A registered
professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of
construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting
the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the Administrator as
set forth in Article IV. Section B.
3 Elevated Building All new construction or substantial improvements to existing
buildings that include ANY fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other
exterior walls below the base flood elevation, or required height above the
highest adjacent grade, shall be designed to preclude finished living space and
designed to allow for the entry and exit of flood waters to automatically equalize
hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls.
a. Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a
professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum
criteria.
1) Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not
less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area
subject to flooding;
2) The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above
the finish grade; and
3) Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other
coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of
floodwaters in both directions.
b. Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for
parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance
equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door)
or entry to the elevated living area (stairway or elevator); and
c. The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or
finished into separate rooms in such a way as to impede the movement
of floodwaters and all such petitions shall comply with the provisions of
Article V. Section B. of this Ordinance.
4. Standards for Manufactured Homes and Recreational Vehicles
a. All manufactured homes placed, or substantially improved, on: (1)
individual lots or parcels, (2) in expansions to existing manufactured
Bolivar, Tennessee | 106
home parks or subdivisions, or (3) in new or substantially improved
manufactured home parks or subdivisions, must meet all the
requirements of new construction, including elevations and anchoring.
b. All manufactured homes placed or substantially improved in an existing
manufactured home park or subdivision must be elevated so that either:
1) When base flood elevations are available the lowest floor of the
manufactured home is elevated on a permanent foundation no
lower than one (1) foot above the level of the base flood
elevation; or,
2) Absent base flood elevations the manufactured home chassis is
elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation
elements) at least three (3) feet in height above the highest
adjacent grade.
c. Any manufactured home, which has incurred substantial damage as the
result of a flood or that has substantially improved, must meet the
standards of Article V. Section B. 4 of this Ordinance.
d. All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral
movement.
e. All recreational vehicles placed on identified flood hazard sites must
either:
1) Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days;
2) Be fully licensed and ready for highway use. (A recreational
vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or
jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type
utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached
structures or additions.
3) The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for new
construction, including the anchoring and elevation requirements
of this section above if on the site for longer than 180 consecutive
days.
5. Standards for Subdivisions
Subdivisions and other proposed new developments, including manufactured
home parks, shall be reviewed to determine whether such proposals will be
reasonably safe from flooding. If a subdivision proposal or other proposed new
development is in a flood-prone area, any such proposals shall be reviewed to
ensure that:
a. All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize
flood damage.
Bolivar, Tennessee| 107
b. All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as
sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to
minimize or eliminate flood damage.
c. All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to
reduce exposure to flood hazards.
d. Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision proposals and
other proposed developments (including manufactured home parks and
subdivisions) that are greater than fifty lots and/or five acres in area.
Section C Standards for Areas of Special Flood Hazard with Established Base Flood
Elevations and With Floodways Designated
Located within the Areas of Special Flood Hazard established in Article III. Section
B, are areas designated as floodways. A floodway may be an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In
addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the
discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights and velocities.
Therefore, the following provisions shall apply:
1. Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill material, new
construction, substantial improvements or other developments within
the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however,
provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses
performed in accordance with standard engineering practices that the
cumulative effect of the proposed encroachments or new development,
when combined with all other existing and anticipated development,
shall not result in ANY increase the water surface elevation of the base
flood level, velocities or floodway widths during the occurrence of a base
flood discharge at any point within the community. A registered
professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and
certification thereof.
2. New construction or substantial improvements of buildings shall comply
with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Article V.
Section D Standards for Areas of Special Flood Hazard Zones AE with Established
Base Flood Elevations but Without Floodways Designated
Located within the Areas of Special Flood Hazard established in Article III Section
B, where streams exist with base flood data provided but where no floodways
have been designated, (Zones AE) the following provisions apply:
1. No encroachments, including fill material, new structures or substantial
improvements shall be located within areas of special flood hazard,
unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided
demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development,
when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will
Bolivar, Tennessee | 108
not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one
(1) foot at any point within the community. The engineering certification
should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard
hydraulic engineering principles.
2. New construction or substantial improvements of buildings shall be
elevated or flood-proofed to elevations established in accordance with
Article V. Section B.
Section E Standards for Streams without Established Base Flood Elevations or
Floodways (A Zones)
Located within the Areas of Special Flood Hazard established in Article III, where
streams exist, but no base flood data has been provided (A Zones), OR where a
Floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions shall apply:
1. When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided
in accordance with Article III, then the Administrator shall obtain, review
and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and
floodway data available from a Federal, State or other source, in order to
administer the provisions of Article V. ONLY if data is not available from
these sources, then the following provisions (2 & 3) shall apply:
2. No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located
within an area equal to the width of the stream or twenty feet, whichever
is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification
by registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the
cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all
other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water
surface elevation of the base flood more than one (1) foot at any point
within the community. The engineering certification should be supported
by technical data that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering
principles.
3. In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new
construction or substantial improvements of existing shall have the
lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated
no less than three (3) feet above the highest adjacent grade at the
building site. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements
of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with the standards of
Article V, Section B, and Elevated Buildings".
Section F Standards For Areas of Shallow Flooding (AO and AH Zones)
Located within the Areas of Special Flood Hazard established in Article III, Section
B, are areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have special flood
hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet (l'-3') where a
Bolivar, Tennessee| 109
clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate; therefore, the following provisions apply:
1. All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and
non-residential buildings shall have the lowest floor, including basement,
elevated to at least one (1) foot above the flood depth number specified
on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), in feet, above the highest
adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor,
including basement, shall be elevated, at least three (3) feet above the
highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded
movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with
standards of Article V, Section B, and Elevated Buildings".
2. All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential
buildings may be flood-proofed in lieu of elevation. The structure
together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities must be flood
proofed and designed watertight to be completely flood-proofed to at
least one (1) foot above the specified FIRM flood level, with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy. If no depth number is
specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be flood proofed to
at least three (3) feet above the highest adjacent grade. A registered
professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and
methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of
practice for meeting the provisions of this ordinance and shall provide
such certification to the Administrator as set forth above and as required
in Article IV, Section B.
3. Adequate drainage paths shall be provided around slopes to guide
floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.
4. The Administrator shall certify the elevation or the highest adjacent
grade, where applicable, and the record shall become a permanent part
of the permit file.
Section G Standards For Areas Protected by Flood Protection System (A-99 Zones)
Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in Article III are
areas of the 100-year floodplain protected by a flood protection system but
where base flood elevations and flood hazard factors have not been determined.
Within these areas (A-99 Zones) all provisions of Article IV. And Article V. Section
A. shall apply.
Section H Standards for Unmapped Streams
Bolivar, Tennessee | 110
Located within Bolivar, Tennessee are unmapped streams where areas of special
flood hazard are neither indicated nor identified. Adjacent to such streams the
following provisions shall apply:
1. In areas adjacent to such unmapped streams, no encroachments
including fill material or structures shall be located within an area of at
least equal to twice the width of the stream, measured from the top of
each stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional
engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the
proposed development, when combined with all other existing and
anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of
the base flood more than one (1) foot at any point within the locality.
2. When new elevation data is available, new construction or substantial
improvements of buildings shall be elevated or flood proofed to
elevations established in accordance with Article IV.
ARTICLE VI VARIANCE PROCEDURES
The provisions of this section shall apply exclusively to areas of Special Flood
Hazard within Bolivar, Tennessee.
Section A Board of Zoning Appeals
1. The Bolivar Board of Zoning Appeals shall hear and decide appeals and
requests for variances from the requirements of this Ordinance.
2. Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures (see definition) upon a determination that the proposed repair
or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation
as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the
historic character and design of the structure.
3. In passing upon such applications, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall
consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards
specified in other sections of this Ordinance, and:
a. The danger that materials may be swept onto other property to
the injury of others;
b. The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion;
c. The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage;
d. The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community;
e. The necessity of the facility to a waterfront location, in the case of
a functionally dependent facility;
Bolivar, Tennessee| 111
f. The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or
erosion damage, for the proposed use;
g. The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area;
h. The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
i. The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site, and;
j. The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public
utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water
systems, and streets and bridges.
4. Upon consideration of the factors listed above, and the purposes of this
Ordinance, the Board of Floodplain Review may attach such conditions to
the granting of variances as it deems necessary to effectuate the
purposes of this Ordinance.
5. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
Section B Conditions for Variances
1. Variances shall be issued upon a determination that the variance is the
minimum relief necessary, considering the flood hazard; and in the
instance of a historical building, a determination that the variance is the
minimum relief necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and
design of the building.
2. Variances shall only be issued upon: a showing of good and sufficient
cause, a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship; or a determination that the granting of a variance
will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public
safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or
victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or
Ordinances.
3. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice
that the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base
flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance, and
that such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life
and property.
Bolivar, Tennessee | 112
4. The Administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and
report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency
upon request.

CHAPTER 17
EXCEPTIONS AND MODIFICATIONS
10-1701 Lot of Record Where the owner of a lot consisting of one or more adjacent lots
of official record at the time of the adoption of this ordinance, does not own
sufficient land to enable him to conform to the yard or other requirements of
this ordinance, an application may be submitted to the Board of Zoning Appeals
for a variance from the terms of this ordinance in accordance with Section 10-
1604. Such lot may be used as a building site, provided, however, that the yard
and other requirements of the district are complied with as closely as is possible
in the opinion of the Board of Zoning Appeals.
10-1702 Front Yards The front yard requirements of this ordinance for dwellings shall not
apply to any lot where the average depth of existing front yards on developed
lots, located within the one hundred (100) feet on each side of such lot and
within the same block and zoning district and fronting on the same street as such
lot, is less than the minimum required front yard depth in such cases shall be the
average of the existing front yard depths on the developed lots, but in no case
less than ten (10) feet.
10-1703 Group Housing Project In the case of a group housing project of two or more
buildings to be constructed on a plot of ground of at least two acres not
subdivided or where the existing or contemplated street and lot layouts make it
impracticable to apply the requirements of this ordinance to the individual
building units in such housing projects, the application of the terms of this
ordinance may be varied by the Board of Zoning Appeal in a manner which will
be in harmony with the character of the neighborhood and intensity of land use
no higher and a standard of open space no lower than that permitted by this
ordinance in the district in which the proposed project is to be located.
However, in no case shall the Board of Zoning Appeals authorize a use prohibited
in the district in which the project is to be located, or a smaller lot area per
family than the minimum required in such districts.
10-1704 Specifically Designed Residential Developments It is the intent of this ordinance
to permit variations in the design of residential development that would
conform to the spirit, but not to the exact letter of the yard and space
requirements of this ordinance, including, but not limited to such variations as
building alignments that include setbacks of less than those required when
compensated for by other setbacks of more than those required and the pooling
of required yard spaces to provide large undivided open areas. Such variances
may be granted by the Board of zoning Appeals after consultation with the
Planning Commission. Any such variances shall be granted only if proper
protection can be afforded and the standards of open space are at least as high
as those required by this Ordinance for the district in which is located the
property for which the variance is requested.
Bolivar, Tennessee | 118
Any such variation by the Board of Zoning Appeals shall be made subject to the
recording of a plat of the proposed project, approved by the Planning Commission on
which are indicated the locations of all proposed streets, drives, walks, parking areas
and buildings.

CHAPTER 21
AIRPORT HEIGHT REGULATIONS AND AIRPORT CLEAR ZONE (AHR) DISTRICT
10-2102 Purpose The purpose of this district is to establish regulations which will reduce
or eliminate hazards to air navigation to minimize or prevent the loss of life,
property damage, health and safety hazards, and government expenditures
which result from air traffic accidents.
10-2102 Application of Regulations.
(a) This district shall overlay land included within the airport hazard zones as
shown on the zoning map. The regulations contained in this Section shall
apply to such land in addition to the regulations contained in the
underlying zoning district of such land. Where there is a conflict between
the provisions of this Section and those of the underlying zoning district,
the zone contained the more restrictive height regulations shall apply.
(b) The provisions of this Section shall apply to any new use and any
substantial improvement to an existing structure, when such uses and
structures are located in the airport hazard zones established by this
section.
(c) If a structure or tree is located in more than one of the zones established
by this Section, the zone containing the more restrictive regulations shall
apply to such structure or tree.
10-2103 Airspace Obstruction Zoning. In order to carry out the purposes of this Section,
the following airspace zones are established, and schematically presented on the
Airspace Obstruction Zoning Map. Except as otherwise provided in this
Ordinance and except as necessary and incidental to airport operations, no
structures or objects of nature growth shall be constructed, altered, maintained,
or allowed to grow in any land area created in this Section so as to project above
any of the imaginary airspace surfaces described in this Section. In those cases
where an area is covered by more than height limitation, the more restrictive
limitation applies:
(a) Primary Surface Area. The imaginary surface longitudinally centered on a
runway extending two hundred (200) feet beyond each end. The
elevation of any point on the primary surface is the same as the elevation
of the highest point on the runway centerline. The primary surface land
area is that land which is directly below the primary surface.
The width of the primary surface, symmetrical about runway centerline,
is:
(1) 500 feet from Runway 18
(2) 500 feet from Runway 36
Bolivar, Tennessee | 126
(b) Horizontal Zone: All the airspace which lies directly under an imaginary
horizontal surface 150 feet above the established airport elevation, or a
height 650 feet above mean sea level, the perimeter of which is
constructed by swinging arcs of specified radii from the center line of
each end of the primary surface of each runway and connecting the
adjacent arcs by lines tangent to those arcs. The radius of each arc is:
1. 5,000 feet from Runway 18.
2. 5,000 feet from Runway 36.
The horizontal zone land area is the land which lies directly below the
horizontal surface.
(c) Conical Zone: All the airspace which lies directly under an imaginary
surface extending upward and outward from the periphery of the
horizontal surface at a slope of 20:1 for a horizontal distance of 4,000
feet as measured radially outward from the periphery of the horizontal
surface.
The conical zone land area is that land which lies directly beneath the
conical surface.
(d) Approach/Departure Zone: All the airspace which lies directly under an
imaginary approach/departure surface longitudinally centered on the
extended centerline at each end of the runway. The inner edge of the
approach surface is at the same width an elevation as, and coincides with
the end of the primary surface.
The approach/departure surface expands uniformly (flares outwardly)
with a width of:
1. 2,000 feet of a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet from primary
surface edge of Runway 18.
2. 2,000 feet if a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet from primary
surface edge of Runway 36.
The approach/departure surface inclines upward at a slope of:
1. 20:1 for Runway 18.
2. 20:1 for Runway 36.
The approach/departure zone land area is that land which lies directly
beneath the approach/departure surface.
(e) Transitional Zone: All the airspace which lies directly under an
imaginary surface extending upward and outward perpendicular to the
runway centerline (and the extended runway centerline) at a slope of 7:1
from the sides of the primary surface and from the side of the
Bolivar, Tennessee| 127
approach/departure surface until they intersect the horizontal surface of
the conical surface.
The transitional zone land area is that land which lies directly beneath the
transitional surface.
10-2104 Land Use Safety Zoning
(a) Safety Zone Boundaries In order to carry out the purpose of this
Ordinance as set forth above and also, in order to restrict those uses may
be hazardous to the operational safety of aircraft operating to and from
the Bolivar-Hardeman County Airport, thereby creating sufficient open
space so as to protect life and property in case of an accident, there are
hereby created and established the following land use safety zones:
1. Safety Zone A - All land in that portion of the approach zones of a
runway, as defined in Subsection 2103 hereof, which extends outward
from the end of primary surface a distance equal to:
a. 1,000 feet for Runway 18.
b. 1,000 feet for Runway 36, etc.
2. Safety Zone B - All land in that portion of the approach zones of a
runway, as defined in Subsection 2103 hereof, which extends outward
from Safety Zone A a distance equal to:
a. 3000 feet for Runway 18.
b. 3000 feet for Runway 36, etc.
3. Safety Zone C - All that land which is enclosed within the
perimeter of the horizontal zone as defined in Subsection 2103
hereof, and which is not included in Zone A or Zone B.
10-2105 Marking and Lighting The owner of any structure or tree which exceeds the
height limits established by this Section shall permit the installation, operation
and maintenance thereon of such markers and lights as shall be deemed
necessary by the presence of such airport hazards. Such markers and lights shall
be installed, operated and maintained at the expense of the owner.

SUGGESTED STEPS FOR A DEVELOPER OF A SUBDIVISION
? Confer with the planning commission and its staff representative to
become thoroughly familiar with the subdivision requirements, the
major street plan and other public improvements which might affect
the areas to be subdivided.
? Have preliminary sketch plat prepared by a reputable engineer or
surveyor.
? Discuss preliminary plat with staff representative. This preapplication
review by a trained land planner may save the subdivider
time and costly revisions as well as possible savings through better
design.
? Submit required copies of the sketch plat to the planning commission
for preliminary approval in advance of its regular monthly meeting.
? WHEN PRELIMINARY APPROVAL HAS BEEN GRANTED:
o See city engineer or designated approving agent(s) for street and
utility specifications; contact city or county health officials for
septic tanks specifications if public sewers are not available.
o Develop subdivision according to preliminary plat and required
modifications, if any. Install improvements.
o Obtain certificates from street and health officials certifying that
improvements have been made or that a performance bond has
been posted.
o Prepare final plat.
o Submit final plat to the planning commission for approval. When
approved, the planning commission secretary will sign the
certificate of approval for recording.
? The subdivider now records the plat with the county register's office.
He is now ready to set his lots.

SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS OF THE
BOLIVAR, TENNESSEE REGIONAL PLANNING COMMISSION
(Hereafter referred to as the Planning Commission)
ARTICLE I
PURPOSE, AUTHORITY, DEFINITIONS AND JURISDICTION
A. Purpose
Land subdivision is the first step in the process of community development.
Once land has been cut up into streets, lots and blocks and publicly recorded,
the correction of defects is costly and difficult. Subdivision of land sooner or
later becomes a public responsibility, in that roads and streets must be
maintained and various public services customary to urban areas must be
provided. The welfare of the entire community is thereby affected in many
important respects. It is therefore to the interest of the public, the developer
and the future owners that subdivisions be conceived, designed and developed
in accordance with sound rules and property minimum standards.
The following subdivision regulations guiding the planning commission are
designed to provide for the harmonious development of the planning region; to
secure a coordinated layout and adequate provision for traffic and also to secure
adequate provision for light, air, recreation, transportation, water, drainage,
sewer and other sanitary facilities.
B. Authority
These subdivision regulations are adopted under authority granted by Sections
13-4-301 through 13-4-309 and Sections 13-3-401 through 13-3-411, Tennessee
Code Annotated. The planning commission has fulfilled the requirements set
forth in these statutes as prerequisite to the adoption of such regulations. A
certified copy of the Bolivar, Tennessee Major Street and Road Plan was filed in
the Office of the Registrar of Hardeman County, Tennessee on May 1, 1957 and
July 30, 1979.
C. Jurisdiction
These regulations shall govern all subdivision of land within the corporate limits
of Bolivar, Tennessee as now hereafter established and within the Bolivar,
Tennessee Planning Region as established by resolution of the Tennessee State
Planning Commission and as identified in the Appendices of the regulations.

ARTICLE II
PROCEDURE FOR PLAT APPROVAL
The procedure for review and approval of a subdivision plat consists of two separate
steps. The initial step is the preparation and submission of a preliminary plat of the
proposed subdivision to the planning commission. The second step is the preparation
and submission to the planning commission of a final plat together with required
certificates. The final plat becomes the instrument to be recorded in the office of the
county registrar when duly signed by the secretary of the planning commission.
A. General
1. Any owner of land lying within the area of jurisdiction of the planning
commission wishing to divide such land into two or more lots, sites, or
divisions, for the purpose, either immediate or future, of sale of building
development, or wishing to resubdivide for this purpose, shall submit a
plan of such proposed subdivision to the planning commission for
approval and shall obtain such approval prior to the filing of his
subdivision plat for record. Any such plat of subdivision shall conform to
the minimum standards of design for the subdivision of land as set forth
in Article III of these regulations and shall be presented in the manner
specified in the following section of this Article. No plat of a subdivision
of land within these areas of jurisdiction shall be filed by the county
registrar without the approval of the planning commission.
2. The subdivider should consult early and informally with the planning
commission and its technical staff for advice and assistance before the
preparation of the preliminary plat and its formal application for
approval. This will enable him to become thoroughly familiar with these
regulations, the Major Street and Road Plan and other official plans or
public improvements which might affect the area. Such informal review
should prevent unnecessary and costly revisions.
3. A subdivider may omit the submission of a preliminary plat, submitting
only a final plat if the following conditions are met:
a. All public improvements as set forth in Article IV are already
installed. Any construction, installations or improvements of any public
improvements shall require the submission of a preliminary plat as
prescribed by Section B of Article II.
B. Preliminary Sketch Plat
1. At least FOURTEEN (14) days prior to the meeting at which it is to be
considered, the subdivider shall submit to the secretary of the planning
commission four (4) copies of a preliminary sketch plat of the proposed
subdivision in order to allow the planning commission technical staff and
utilities heads time to review and prepare recommendations to the
City of Bolivar  Subdivision Regulations | II-2
planning commission. The subdivision plan shall be drawn to a scale of
not less than one inch equals one hundred (100) feet. The submission of
the preliminary sketch plat to the secretary of the planning commission
shall not constitute submission of the preliminary sketch plat for
consideration by the planning commission.
2. The sketch plat which shall meet the minimum standards of design as set
forth in Article III and the general requirements for the construction of
public improvements as set forth in Article IV shall give the following
information insofar as possible.
b. Date, approximate north point, and graphic scale.
c. The location of existing and platted property lines, streets,
buildings, water courses, railroads, sewers, bridges, culverts, drain
pipes, water mains, and any public utility easements, the present
zoning classification, if any, both on the land to be subdivided and
on the adjoining land; and the names of adjoining property
owners or subdivisions.
d. A construction plan which shall include, if needed: (1) a complete
drainage plan showing all improvements including all proposed
streets, easements, storm sewers, swales, ditches, reserved areas
and lot drainage; (2) a plan and profile of all streets showing
typical cross sections of proposed roadways, swales and ditches
as well as both existing and proposed finished grades of paved
rights-of-way and special ditches, and details of all structures
which are part of the physical improvements in the subdivision.
All proposed drainage structures including manholes, catch
basins, junction boxes, pipe storm drains, ditches, and other
drainage facilities including headwalls shall be shown on the plan
and profile.
e. The distance and bearing of one of the corners of the boundary of
the subdivision to the nearest intersection of existing streets or
roads and to an original corner of the original survey of which it is
a part--or a key map showing relation of subdivision to wellknown
streets, railroads, and water courses in all directions to a
distance of at least one-half mile. Suggested scale: one inch
equals 2,000 feet.
f. Plans of proposed utility layouts (sanitary and storm sewers,
water, and electricity) showing feasible connections to the
existing or any proposed utility systems. When such connections
are not practicable, any proposed individual water supply and/or
sewage disposal system must be approved by the county health
department.
City of Bolivar  Subdivision Regulations | II-3
g. The names, locations, widths, and other dimensions of proposed
streets, alleys, easements, parks, and other open spaces,
reservations, lot lines, building lines and utilities.

when specifically not required by the planning commission.
i. The acreage of the land to be subdivided.
j. Actual closure computations for the boundary traverses. Such
boundary traverses shall close to an accuracy of at least one (l)
part in five thousand (5,000).
3. Within sixty (60) days after submission of the preliminary sketch plat, the
planning commission will review it and indicate its approval, disapproval,
or approval subject to modifications as a basis for the preparation of the
final plat. If a plat is disapproved, reasons for such disapproval will be
stated in writing. If approved subject to modifications, the nature of the
required modifications will be indicated.
4. The approval of the preliminary plat by the planning commission will not
constitute acceptance of the final plat and will not be indicated on the
preliminary sketch plat.
5. Failure of the planning commission to act on the preliminary sketch plat
within sixty (60) days after being presented at a planning commission
meeting in accordance with subsections B.1 and B.2 of this Article will be
deemed approval of this plat, and a certificate to that effect shall be
issued by the commission on demand, provided, however, that the
applicant may waive this requirement and consent to the extension of
such period.
6. One copy of the sketch plat will be returned to the subdivider with any
notations at the time of approval or disapproval and the specific changes,
if any, required.
7. The approval of the preliminary sketch plat shall lapse unless a final plat
based thereon is submitted within one year from the date of such
approval unless an extension of time is applied for and granted by the
planning commission.
8. If the subdivision is going to be developed and submitted as final plats in
portions of the preliminary plat, the portions must be designated and
titled in alphabetical characters.
9. No subdivision shall use the name of an existing subdivision except as
noted in Article II, subsection B.8.
City of Bolivar  Subdivision Regulations | II-4
C. Final Plat
1. The final plat shall conform substantially to the preliminary sketch plat as
approved, and, if desired by the subdivider, it may constitute only that
portion of the approved preliminary sketch plat which he proposes to
record and develop at the time, provided, however, that such portion
conforms to all requirements of these regulations. If a proposed
subdivision fronts upon an existing public road, the planning commission
may waive the requirements for preliminary approval, and permit the
developer to submit only a final plat.
2. In order to allow the planning commission technical staff time to review
and prepare recommendations to the planning commission, the final plat
shall be submitted to the secretary of the planning commission, or staff
designated by the secretary of the planning commission, at least fourteen
(14) days prior to the meeting at which it is to be considered. The
subdivider shall submit six (6) copies (black and white prints or blue line
prints), together with other plans that may be required by the planning
commission. The submission of the final plat to the secretary of the
planning commission shall not constitute submission of the preliminary
final plat for consideration by the planning commission.
3. The final plat shall be presented to the planning commission at its next
meeting by the secretary or acting secretary of the planning commission
for consideration for approval or disapproval.
4. The plat shall be drawn to a scale of one inch equals one hundred (100)
feet on sheets eighteen (18) by twenty-four (24) inches or of an approved
size to correspond to local plat book dimensions. When more than one
sheet is required, an index sheet of the same size shall be filed showing
the entire subdivision with the sheets lettered in alphabetical order as a
key.
5. When the final plat has been approved by the planning commission one
copy will be returned to the subdivider, with the approval of the planning
commission certified thereon, for filing with the County Registrar as the
official plat of record.
6. The planning commission shall approve or disapprove the final plat within
sixty (60) days after its submission. Failure of the planning commission to
act on this final plat within these sixty (60) days shall be deemed approval
of it. If the plat is disapproved the grounds for disapproval shall be stated
upon the records of the planning commission.
7. Approval of the final plat by the planning commission shall not constitute
the acceptance by the public of the dedication of any streets or other
public way or ground.

The location and width of all streets and roads shall conform to the
official Major Thoroughfare Plan which includes the Major Street Plan
within the municipality and the Major Road Plan within the remainder of
the planning region.
2. Relation to Adjoining Street System
The proposed street system shall extend existing streets or projects at
the same or greater width, but in no case less than the required
minimum width.
3. Access Streets to Subdivision Boundaries
Sufficient access streets to adjoining properties shall be provided in
subdivisions to permit harmonious development of the area.
4. Street Widths
The minimum width of right-of-way, measured from lot line to lot line,
shall be as shown on the Major Thoroughfare Plan and shall be not less
than as follows:
a. Arterial Streets and Highways80-150 feet or as may be required.
Arterial streets and highways are those to be used primarily for
fast or heavy traffic and will be located on the Major
Thoroughfare Plan.
b. Collector Streets...................................................................60 feet
Collector streets are those which carry traffic from minor streets
to the major system or arterial streets and highways and include
the principal entrance streets of a residential development and
streets for major circulation within such a development.
c. Minor Residential Streets......................................................50 feet
Minor residential streets are those which are used primarily for
access to the abutting residential properties and designed to
discourage use by through traffic.
d. Dead-end Streets (cul-de-sac) ............................................50 feet
Cul-de-sacs are permanent dead-end streets or courts not to
exceed six hundred (600) feet or fifteen (15) dwelling units,
designed so that they cannot be extended in the future.
City of Bolivar  Subdivision Regulations | III-2
In cases where topography or other physical conditions make a
street of the required minimum width impracticable, the planning
commission may modify the above requirements.
e. Alleys....................................................................................20 feet
Alleys are minor public ways used primarily for service access to
the back or side of properties otherwise abutting on a street.
5. Additional Width on Existing Streets
Subdivisions that adjoin existing streets shall dedicate additional right-ofway
to meet the above minimum street width requirements.
a. The entire right-of-way shall be provided where any part of the
subdivision is on both sides of the existing street.
b. When the subdivision is located on only one side of an existing
street, one-half of the required right-of-way, measured from the
center line of the existing roadway, shall be provided. In no case
shall the resulting right-of-way width be less than fifty (50) feet.
6. Restriction of Access
Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed major
street, the planning commission may require marginal access streets,
reverse frontage with screen planting contained in a non-access
reservation along the rear property line, or such other treatment was
may be necessary for adequate protection of residential properties to
afford separation of through and local traffic.
7. Street Grades
Grades on major streets shall not exceed seven (7) percent. Grades on
other streets may exceed seven (7) percent but shall not exceed fifteen
(15) percent.
8. Horizontal Curves
Where a deflection angle of ten (10) degrees or more in the alignment of
a street occurs, a curve of reasonably long radius shall be introduced. On
streets sixty (60) feet or more in width, the center line radius of curvature
shall not be less than three hundred (300) feet; on other streets, not less
than one hundred (100) feet.
9. Vertical Curves
All changes in grade shall be connected by vertical curves of minimum
length in feet equal to fifteen (15) times the algebraic difference in rates
of grade for major streets and one-half this minimum length for other
streets. Profiles of all streets showing natural and finished grades drawn
to a scale of not less than one inch equals one hundred (100) feet
City of Bolivar  Subdivision Regulations | III-3
horizontal, and one inch equals ten (10) feet vertical, may be required by
the planning commission.
10. Intersections
Street intersections shall be as nearly as right angles as is possible, and no
intersection shall be at an angle of less than sixty (60) degrees.
To permit the construction of a curb having a desirable radius, property
line radii at all street intersections shall not be less than twenty (20) feet.
Where the angle of the street intersection is less than ninety (90)
degrees, the planning commission may require a greater radius.
11. Tangents
A tangent of at least one hundred (100) feet long shall be introduced
between reverse curves on arterial and collector streets.
12. Street Jogs
Street jogs with center line offsets of less than one hundred twenty-five
(125) feet shall not be allowed.
13. Dead-end Streets
a. Minor terminal streets or courts designed to have one end
permanently closed shall be no more than six hundred (600) feet
long unless necessitated by topography. They shall be provided at
the closed end with a turn-around having an outside roadway
diameter of at least eight (80) feet and a street right-of-way
diameter of at least one hundred (100) feet or the planning
commission may approve an alternate design such as the T or Y
back around.
b. Where, the opinion of the planning commission, it is desirable to
provide for street access to adjoining property, proposed streets
shall be extended to the boundary of such property. Such deadend
streets shall be provided with a temporary turn-around
having a roadway diameter of at least eight (80) feet
14. Private Streets and Reserve Strips
There shall be no private streets platted in any subdivision. Every
subdivided property shall be served from a publicly dedicated street.
There shall be no reserve strips controlling access to streets, except
where the control of such strips is definitely placed with the community
under conditions approved by the planning commission.
l5. Drainage
All streets and roads must be so designed as to provide for the discharge
of surface water from the right-of-way of all streets and roads by grading
City of Bolivar  Subdivision Regulations | III-4
and drainage as shall be approved by the planning commission. Where it
is the opinion of the planning commission that water cannot be
adequately discharged by surface drainage, the planning commission may
require the installation of a storm sewer system.
16. Street Name
Proposed streets, which are obviously in alignment with others already
existing and named, shall bear the names of existing streets. In no case
shall the name for proposed streets duplicate existing street names,
irrespective of the use of suffix street, avenue, boulevard, driveway,
place or court. Through its index list of street names on file the planning
commission can assist the subdivider in avoiding duplication.
17. Alleys
Alleys shall be provided to the rear of all lots used for business purposes,
and shall not be provided in residential blocks except where the
subdivider produces evidence satisfactory to the planning commission of
the need for alleys.
B. Blocks
1. Length
Blocks shall not be less than four hundred (400) nor more than twelve
hundred (1,200) feet in length, except as the planning commission
considers necessary to secure efficient use of land or desired features of
street pattern. In blocks over eight hundred (800) feet in length the
planning commission may require one or more public cross walks of not
less than ten (10) feet in width to extend entirely across the block and at
locations deemed necessary.
2. Width
Blocks shall be wide enough to allow two tires of lots of minimum depth,
except where fronting on major streets or prevented by topographical
conditions or size of the property, in which case the planning commission
will approve a single tier of lots of minimum depth.
C. Lots
1. Arrangement
Insofar as practical, side lot lines shall be at right angles to straight street
lines or radial to curved street lines. Each lot must front for a minimum
of fifty (50) feet upon a public street or road which is not less than fifty
(50) feet in width.
City of Bolivar  Subdivision Regulations | III-5
2. Minimum Sizes
Residential lots shall meet the lot width and lot area requirements of the
Zoning Ordinance. In the absence of a Zoning Ordinance, residential lots
shall not be less than seventh-five (75) feet wide at the setback (building)
line nor less than ten thousand (10,000) square feet in area. Other lot
size requirements follow:
a. Lots not served by public water and sanitary sewer systems shall
be at least twenty thousand (20,000) square feet in area or of a
size specified by the county health authority to adequately
accommodate both a fresh-water well and septic tank on the
same lot. The minimum distance between the septic tank and
fresh-water well shall be one hundred (100) feet. The health
officer shall also prescribe minimum lot sizes to conform to health
standards, which may be greater than the standards contained
herein.
b. Size of properties reserved or laid out for commercial or industrial
properties shall be adequate to provide for the off-street service
and parking facilities required by the type of use and
development contemplated. Platting of individual lots should be
avoided in favor of an overall design of the land to be used for
such purposes.
3. Building Setback Lines and Yard Requirements
a. A building line (setback line) meeting the front yard setback
requirements of the Zoning Ordinance shall be established on all
lots. In the absence of a Zoning Ordinance, the front yard setback
shall be a minimum of thirty (30) feet from the street right-of-way
lines. Other minimum setback lines shall be as follows:
From the side property line ................................................... 15 feet
From the rear property line ................................................... 30 feet
From side property line abutting a minor street (corner lot) ........... 30 feet
b. In the case of electric transmission lines where easement widths
are not definitely established there shall be a minimum building
setback line from the center of the transmission line as follows:
Voltage of line Minimum building setback
46KV 37 1/2 feet
69KV 50 feet
161KV and over 75 feet
City of Bolivar  Subdivision Regulations | III-6
4. Corner Lots
Corner lots shall be sufficiently wider and larger to permit the additional
side yard requirements of the zoning ordinance or building setback lines
as outlined above.
5. Double and reverse Frontage Lots
Double frontage lots should be avoided, except where essential to
provide separate residential development from traffic arteries or to
overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation. Reverse
frontage lots shall have a depth of not less than one hundred and fifty
(150) feet. A planted evergreen screen easement at least ten (10) feet
wide, across which there shall be no right of access, shall be provided
along the line of lots abutting a traffic artery or other incompatible land
use.
6. Flood-Free Building Lots
Each lot in a subdivision shall contain a flood-free building site which shall
be outside of the limits of any existing easement and/or the building
setback lines as required by these regulations.
In areas subject to flood where no fill is proposed, no building line shall
be located any closer to a watercourse, drainage way, stream or channel
than the edge of the area subject to flood. In areas where fill is used to
raise the elevation of the building site, the fill shall extend streamward
twenty-five (25) feet beyond the limits of any structure erected thereon,
but no fill shall be placed in the floodway.
D. Public Use and Service Areas
Due consideration shall be given to the allocation of areas suitably located and of
adequate size for playgrounds and parks for local or neighborhood use as well as
public service areas.
1. Public Open Spaces
Where a school, neighborhood park or recreation area or public access to
water frontage, shown on an official map or in a plan made and adopted
by the planning commission, is located in part in the applicant's
subdivision, the planning commission may require the dedication or
reservation or such open space within the subdivision up to a total of ten
(10) percent of the gross area or water frontage of the plat, for park,
school or recreation purposes.
2. Easements for Utilities and Drainage
a. Drainage and utility easements shall be provided on each side and
rear lot line where deemed necessary by the planning
commission. The easements shall be designed to adequately
City of Bolivar  Subdivision Regulations | III-7
provide utilities and drainage for all lots in the proposed
subdivision. Where drainage is proposed to cross any lot at any
point other than the side or corner of the lot, the plat shall
indicate the size of the pipe necessary to carry the proposed
runoff. Each cul-de-sac shall have provisions for a fifteen (15) foot
utility easement extending there from to prevent dead-end water
mains. Easements of the same or a greater width may be
required along the lines of or across lots where necessary for the
extension of existing or planned utilities.
b. Storm Sewers
Where in the opinion of the planning commission the flow of
water cannot be accommodated with surface drainage, storm
sewers may be required. The planning commission shall
determine, on the basis of the watershed and the probable
runoff, the size of the storm sewers. In ascertaining the size of
the storm sewers, the planning commission may call upon its
technical staff or any public or private agency to assist it in its
determinations. The developer shall conform to standard design
details furnished by the city engineer's office in the construction
and installation of catch basins, culverts, and all other
components of the drainage system.
3. Water Supply and Sewerage Connections
Where a public water supply or public sewerage system is within 1,500
(fifteen hundred) feet of the proposed subdivision, the subdivider shall
indicate connection with such water and sewerage system and a water
and sewerage connection for each lot with such lateral and to such size
and length as shall be approved by the Planning Commission. Where a
public water supply or sewerage system is not within 1,500 (fifteen
hundred) feet, an alternate method of water supply or sewerage disposal
may be indicated and shall be approved by the county health officer.
4. Community Assets
In all subdivisions due regard shall be shown for all natural features such
as large trees, water courses, historical sites, and similar community
assets which, if preserved, will add attractiveness and value to the
property.
E. Suitability of the Land
The planning commission shall not approve the subdivision of land if, from
adequate investigations conducted by all public agencies concerned, it has been
determined that in the best interest of the public the site is not suitable for
City of Bolivar  Subdivision Regulations | III-8
platting and development purposes of the kind proposed. This includes land
which is:
1. Physically unsuitable because of flooding, bad drainage, steep slopes,
rock formations, unsuitable soil, and other features, which may endanger
health, life, or property, aggravate erosion, increase the flood hazard, or
necessitate expenditure of public funds for supply and maintenance of
services and/or which other public agencies have investigated and found
to be not in the best interest of the public.
2. Unsuitably located by reason of being scattered or premature subdivision
of land which would involve danger or injury to the health, safety,
property, or economic utilization because of lack of or adverse effect on
water supply, schools, proper drainage, good transportation, or other
public services or facilities that would necessitate an excessive
expenditure of public funds for supply or maintenance of such services or
elimination of danger.
3. Subject to flooding because of its proximity to the stream or because of
low elevation. In applying this provision, land below the elevation of the
Intermediate Regional Flood will be considered subject to floor (see Flood
Plain Information, Hatchie river, Pleasant Run Creek and Spring Creek,
Bolivar, Tennessee). The elevation(s) will be determined from the Corps
of Engineers charts, "High Water Profiles, Hatchie River, Pleasant Run
Creek and Spring Creek (see Flood Plain Information, Hatchie river,
Pleasant Run Creek and Spring Creek, Bolivar, Tennessee.
If a subdivision is proposed within one hundred (100) feet of a stream for
which detailed flood data has not been published, the planning
commission shall require detailed flood information for the particular
area before deciding whether or not such subdivision development can
occur.
F. Large Tracts or Parcels
When land is subdivided into large parcels than ordinary building lots, such
parcels shall be arranged so as to allow for the opening of future streets and
logical further resubdivision.
G. Variances
Variances may be granted under the following conditions:
1. Where the subdivider can show that strict adherence to these regulations
would cause unnecessary hardship, or
2. Where the planning commission decides that there are topographical or
other conditions peculiar to the site, and a departure from these
regulations will not destroy their intent. Any variance thus authorized
City of Bolivar  Subdivision Regulations | III-9
and the reasons therefore shall be stated in writing in the minutes of the
planning commission.
H. Zoning or Other Regulations
No final plat of land within the force and effect of an existing zoning ordinance
will be approved unless it conforms to such ordinance.
Whenever there is a discrepancy between minimum standards of dimensions
noted herein and those contained in zoning regulations; building code, or other
official regulations, the highest standard shall apply.

ARTICLE IV
DEVELOPMENT PREREQUISITE TO FINAL APPROVAL
A perfectly prepared and recorded subdivision or plat means little to a prospective lot
buyer until he can see actual physical transformation of raw acreage into lots suitable
for building purposes and human habitation. Improvements by the subdivider spare the
community from a potential tax liability. The following tangible improvements are
required before final plat approval in order to assure the physical reality of a subdivision
which approval and recordation will establish legally.
A. Required Improvements
Every subdivision developer shall be required to grade and improve streets and
alleys, and to install curbs, monuments, sewers, storm water inlets and water
mains, in accordance with specifications established by the Bolivar Regional
Planning Commission. Where specifications adopted by local authorities conflict
with standards set forth in these subdivision regulations, the higher set of
standards, as determined by the planning commission, shall govern.
l. Monuments
a. Concrete monuments four (4) inches in diameter or square, three
(3) feet long, with a flat top, shall be set at all street corners, at all
points where the street lines intersect the exterior boundaries of
the subdivision, and at angle points and points of curve in each
street. The top of the monuments shall have an indented cross to
identify properly the location and shall be set flush with the
finished grade.
b. All other corners and points shall be marked with iron pipe or
solid steel road not less than one-half (1/2) inch in diameter and
twenty-four (24) inches long and driven so as to be flush with the
finished grade.
2. Grading
All streets, roads and alleys shall be graded or filled horizontally to the
full width of their rights-of-way by the subdivider or developer. Due to
special topographical conditions, deviation from the above will be
allowed only with special approval of the planning commission.
a. Preparation. Before grading is started the entire right of-way area
shall be cleared of all trees, stumps, roots, brush and other
objectionable materials
b. Cut. All tree stumps, boulders and other obstructions shall be
removed to a depth of two (2) feet below the subgrade. Rock,
when encountered, shall be scarified to a depth of twelve (12)
inches below subgrade.
City of Bolivar  Subdivision Regulations | IV - 2
c. Fill. All suitable material from roadway cuts may be used in the
construction of fills, approaches, or at other places as needed.
Excess materials including organic materials, soft clays, etc., shall
be removed from the development site. The fill shall be spread in
layers not to exceed six (6) inches loose and compacted by a
sheep's foot roller. Unless another method of preparation of the
subgrade is approved by planning commission, the subgrade shall
be constructed as specified in Section 203, Standard Specifications
for Road and Bridge Construction, Tennessee Department of
Highways and Public Works - January 1, 1968, and latest revision
thereto. The filling of utility trenches and other places not
accessible to a roller shall be mechanically tamped, and where
water is used to assist compaction the water content shall not
exceed the optimum of moisture.
3. Storm Drainage
a. An adequate drainage system, including necessary open ditches,
pipes, culverts, intersectional drains, drop inlets, bridges,
headwalls, etc., shall be provided for the proper drainage of all
surface water.
If necessary to determine proper drainage facilities, the planning
commission or city engineer may require the developer to outline
the entire drainage area of the proposed construction along with
a map showing the various streets and parcels and indicating the
general flow of the surface water, either by contours or by means
of arrows running with the flow. Any existing storm drainage with
the size, grade and elevations of the pipes and elevations of the
inlets, as nearly as can be shown. Also, area tributary to the
various proposed inlets shall be outlined by figures adjacent to
the inlet to which they are applicable.
b. In subdivisions where curbs and gutters are required, the
developer shall provide catch basins at all low points, and at
intermediate locations as necessary to prevent the overloading of
the street gutters, but at least every 600 feet. Catch basins shall
be the curb and gutter inlet type and shall empty into collection
mains of adequate size with out-falls leading to existing storm
sewers or approved waterways. When easements are required
for drainage facilities outside road right-of-way, the easements
shall be at least 15 feet in width and shall be indicated on the final
plat.
c. In subdivisions where curbs and gutter are not required, the
developer shall provide open drainage ditches on each side of the
road-bed. The open drainage ditches shall have a minimum depth
City of Bolivar  Subdivision Regulations | IV - 3
of 18 inches below the road-bed with sides sloped to a 3 to 1
minimum ratio. All intersections of streets shall have a minimum
of 15 inches metal, concrete or aluminum drain pipe or culvert
with concrete head walls at least 6 inches above the roadbed.
Drainage pipes and culverts over 15 inches shall be determined as
specified below.
d. In all subdivisions, the developer will be required to provide cross
drains to accommodate all natural water flow, and shall be of
sufficient length to permit full width of roadway and the required
slopes. Cross drains shall be built on straight line and grade, and
shall be laid on a firm base but not on rock. Pipes shall be laid
with the spigot end pointing in the direction of the flow and with
the ends fitted and matched to provide tight joints and a smooth
uniform invert. They shall be placed at a sufficient depth below
the roadbed to avoid dangerous pressure of impact, and in no
case shall the top of the pipe be less than one (1) foot below the
roadbed. The size of the waterway opening required per drainage
structures shall be determined by use of the Talbot formula but in
no case shall a pipe less than 15 inches in diameter be used. The
following drainage table is based on Talbot's formula for
determining pipe size for the area to be drained:
Diameter Acres Acres
of Pipe (Rolling County) (Level County)
15" 0-6 0-11
18" 9 18
24" 20 39
30" 36 71

54" 175 345
60" 230 455
66" 295 585
72" 375 735
Multiple pipe installation may be used provided the smaller pipes
are equivalent in water carry capacity to the larger pipe. The
following table shows the number of smaller diameter pipes equal
in water carrying capacity to that of one pipe of larger size.

4. Roadway Improvements
a. Base: A compacted base course six (6) inches deep and three (3)
feet wider than the width of the pavement on each side of the
street shall be installed on all streets, including cul-de-sacs,
temporary turnarounds and access streets to adjoining properties,
according to the method specified in Section 303, Standard
Specifications for Roads and Bridge Construction, Tennessee
Department of Highways and Public Works - January 1, 1968, and
latest revisions thereto. Wetting of the stone before compaction
may be done at a point of origin or on the job site at the option of
the contractor. In all cases the center line of a roadway shall
coincide with the center line of the right-of-way dedicated for
such road or street.
b. Curbing: Within the City of Bolivar the subdivider shall provide
concrete curbs and integral gutters on both sides of all new
streets as indicated on the subdivision plat. Where access streets
to adjoining properties are provided curbs and gutters shall be
extended to the property line. In all cases the curbs and integral
gutters shall be not less than twenty-four (24) inches wide at the
base, twelve (12) inches high, six (6) inches across the top of the
curb, six (6) inches on the face of the curb, and a seven (7) inch
thick gutter. Backfill shall be towards the curb and be higher than
the curb to insure drainage of surface water into the drainage
system.
City of Bolivar  Subdivision Regulations | IV - 5
One-half (1/2) inch to three-fourth (3/4) inch expansion and
contraction joints for the curbs and gutters shall be placed at
intervals not exceeding forty (40) feet.
d. Wearing Surface: Within the City of Bolivar the wearing surface
shall consist of a surface course constructed with asphalt
concrete, prepared with mineral aggregate, laid not as specified
under Section 411, Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge
Construction, Tennesseee Department of Highways and Public
Works  January 1, 1968 and latest revision thereto. It shall be
constructed in one layer not less two (2) inches thick to conform
to the lines, grades and cross sections indicated on a plan
approved by the inspecting engineer.
e. Wearing Surface: Within the Bolivar Planning region but lying
outside the corporate limits the wearing surface shall consist of a
bituminous mat composed of between 50 and 60 pounds per
square yard of mineral aggregate bonded with bituminous
material as specified under Section 404, Standard Specifications
for Road and Bridge Construction, Tennessee Department of
Highways and Public works -- January 1, 1968 and latest revision
thereto. Any equivalent or higher standard of surface treatment
approved by the County Road Commissioner may also be
accepted by the planning commission.
5. Minimum Pavement Widths and Street Cross Sections
a. Streets constructed within the City of Bolivar shall have minimum
pavement widths, measured from face of curb to face of curb, as
follows:
(1) Arterial Streets - .............................. Not paved by developer

into and out of necessary off-street parking areas without
interference to traffic.
Other details, such as maximum slopes and required cross
sections shall conform to the accompanying diagram entitled,
Bolivar Planning Region, Cross Section Diagrams.
6. Installation of Utilities
After grading is completed and approved and before any base is applied,
all of the underground work - water mains, gas mains, etc., and all service
connections shall be installed completely and approved throughout the
length of the road and across the flat section. All driveways for houses to
be built by the developer shall be cut and drained.
7. Water Supply
Water mains properly connected with the community water supply
system or with an alternate supply approved by the county health officer
shall be constructed in such a manner as to adequately several lots
shown on the subdivision plat for both domestic use and fire protection.
The size of water mains, the location and type of valves and hydrants, the
amount of soil cover, the pipes and other features of the installation shall
be approved by the planning commission upon the recommendation of
the superintendent of the utility department or other applicable
inspection agencies, and shall conform with accepted standards of good
practice for municipal water systems.
8. Sanitary Sewers
a. Where lots cannot be economically connected with a sewerage
system, they must contain adequate area for the installation of
approved septic tank and disposal fields and must be approved in
writing by the county health officer.
City of Bolivar  Subdivision Regulations | IV - 7
b. All lots connected to the city sewerage system shall meet all
requirements of the Bolivar Utility Department.
c. All lots connected to a sewer system shall be approved by the
utility operating the system. They shall meet all requirements of
the State Health Department and shall be approved by the
Hardeman County Health Department.
d. Subdividers shall supply all data required for the installation
and/or operation of the sewerage system to the Bolivar Utility
Department, Hardeman County Health Department and the
Tennessee State Department of Health.
9. Erosion Control
The planning commission shall require seeding or other conservation
measures of all areas subject to erosion.
10. Street Name Signs
Appropriate street signs add sales value to land subdivisions and enable
visitors, delivery concerns and potential lot buyers to find their way
around. Street name signs shall be placed at all intersections by the
subdivider, and shall be a type approved by the city or county authorities.
11. Handicap Ramps
In both residential and commercial subdivisions where sidewalks, curbs
and gutters are required, the subdivider shall install handicap ramps at all
crosswalks so as to make the transition from street to sidewalk easily
negotiable for physically handicapped persons in wheelchairs and for
other persons who may have difficulty in making the required step up or
down from curb level to street level.
All such ramps shall be constructed or installed in accordance with the
design specifications on the accompanying diagram entitled Handicap
Ramps Design Specifications Diagram.
B. Guarantee in Lieu of Completed Improvements
No final subdivision plat shall be approved by the planning commission or
accepted for record by the County Registrar of Deeds until one of the following
conditions has been met:
l. All required improvements have been constructed in a satisfactory
manner and approved the City of Bolivar, Tennessee.
2. The planning commission has accepted a security or performance bond in
an amount equal to the estimated cost of installation of the required
improvements, whereby improvements may be made and utilities
installed without cost to the city or county in the event of default of the
City of Bolivar  Subdivision Regulations | IV - 8
subdivider. The conditions of such security or performance bond shall
provide for the installation of the improvements covered by such bond
within a period of not to exceed two (2) years; provided, however that
such period may be extended by the planning commission with the
consent of the parties thereto if the planning commission finds that the
public interest will not be adversely affected by such extension. If the
planning commission shall decide at any time during the performance
bond that the extend of the building development that has taken place in
the subdivision is not sufficient to warrant all the improvements covered
by such performance bond, that required improvements have been
installed as provided in this Section in sufficient amount to warrant
reduction in the face amount of said bond, or that the character and the
extent of such development require additional improvements for any or
all such improvements, the face value of such performance bond shall
thereupon be reduced or increased by an appropriate amount so that the
new face amount will cover the cost in full of the amended list of
improvements.
Performance bonds which are submitted in lieu of the installation of
required improvements shall be in case or made by a surety company
authorized to do business in the State of Tennessee. In the case of a
surety company, the performance bond shall be prepared according to
the form as shown in Appendix A, said Appendix A is made a part of these
subdivision regulations.
