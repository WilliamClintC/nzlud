§ 85-1. Legislative findings and purpose.
The Board of Supervisors of West Lampeter Township finds that the
commercial exploitation of explicit sexual conduct through the public
exhibition of obscene publications and devices, and the use of so-called
massage establishments, adult model studios, bath houses, body painting
studios, outcall service activities or sexual encounter centers for the
purpose of lewdness, assignation or prostitution constitutes a debasement
and distortion of a sensitive key relationship of human existence, central of
family life, community welfare and the development of human personality,
is indecent and offensive to the senses and to public morals and interferes
with the comfortable enjoyment of life and property, in that such interferes
with the interest of the public in the quality of life and total community
environment, the tone of commerce in West Lampeter Township, property
values, and the public safety. It further finds that continued operation of
such activities is detrimental to the health, safety, convenience, good morals
and general welfare of West Lampeter Township, and of the residences,
citizens, inhabitants and businesses thereof. Accordingly, the Board of
Supervisors hereby declares such activities to be illegal as hereinafter set
forth, and further, that such activities are, and are hereby declared to be
and constitute, a public nuisance, and herein establishes penalties for such
activities.

quarantine the animal and to have it examined by a veterinarian, the
Animal Control Officer shall take the action necessary to comply with
Subsection A(2) and (3) hereof and the owner or custodian of the animal
shall be liable to the Township for all costs thereof which may be
collected as an additional penalty for violation of this section.

A. Each person owning a building served by an on-lot sewage disposal
system, shall have such system inspected by West Lampeter Township
or other authorized agent as sanctioned by the Township once every
three years or as required by the Township. Thereafter such system
shall have the tank pumped at a frequency established by the
Pennsylvania Septage Management Association schedule or whenever
an inspection reveals that the septic tank is filled with solids or scum in
excess of 1/3 of the liquid depth of the tank. Certification from the
pumper/hauler shall be submitted to the Township within the
prescribed six-month and three-year pumping period. That certification
shall include a statement that the physical condition of the tank,
including baffles, was inspected, and the tank and baffles are in
satisfactory condition.
B. The required pumping frequency may be increased at the discretion of
an authorized agent if the septic tank is undersized, if solids buildup in
the tank is above average, if the hydraulic load on the system increases
significantly above average, if a garbage grinder is used in the building,
if the system malfunctions or for other good cause shown. If any person
can prove that such person's septic tank has been pumped within three
years of the six-month anniversary of the effective date of this article,
then that person's initial required pumping may be delayed to conform
to the general three-year frequency requirement except where an
inspection reveals a need for more frequent pumping frequencies.
C. Any person owning a property served by a septic tank shall submit, with
each required pumping service, a written statement, from the pumper/
hauler or from any other qualified individual acceptable to the
Township, that the baffles in the septic tank have been inspected and
found to be in good working order. Any person whose septic tank baffles

submitted to the Township within six months of the effective date of this
article. Thereafter, service receipts shall be submitted to the Township
at the intervals specified by the manufacturer's recommendations. In no
case may the service or pumping intervals for the treatment tanks
exceed those required for septic tanks.
E. Additional maintenance activity may be required as needed including,
but not limited to, cleaning and unclogging of piping, servicing and the
repair of mechanical equipment, leveling of distribution boxes, tanks
and lines, removal of obstructing roots or trees, and the diversion of

into the waters of the commonwealth unless a permit for such
discharge has been obtained from DEP.
B. A written notice of violation shall be issued to any person who is the
owner of any property which is found to be served by a malfunctioning
on-lot sewage disposal system, or which is discharging sewage without
a permit.
C. Remediation of a permitted repair or replacement shall commence
within 30 days of notification by the Township that a malfunction has
been identified, unless seasonal or unique conditions mandate a longer
period, in which case the Township may grant an extension of time.
D. An SEO or other authorized agent shall have the authority to require
the repair of any system found to be unsatisfactory by the following
methods: cleaning, repair or replacement of components of the existing
system, adding capacity or otherwise altering or replacing the system's
treatment tank, expanding the existing disposal areas, replacing the
existing disposal area, replacing a gravity distribution system with a
pressurized system, replacing the system with a holding tank or any
other alternative appropriate for the specific site.

that malfunction. The Township may require whatever action is
necessary to lessen or mitigate the malfunction to the extent necessary.

ARTICLE I
General Provisions
§ 230-1. Short title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "West Lampeter
Stormwater Management Ordinance."
§ 230-2. Statement of findings.
The Board of Supervisors finds that:
§ 230-3. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to promote health, safety, and welfare by
minimizing the harms and maximizing the benefits described in § 230-2 of
this chapter through provisions designed to:
A. Inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting
from development throughout a watershed increases flood flows and
velocities, contributes to erosion and sedimentation, overtaxes the
carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers, greatly
increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater,
undermines floodplain management and flood control efforts in
downstream communities, reduces groundwater recharge, threatens
public health and safety, and increases nonpoint source pollution of
water resources.
B. A comprehensive program of SWM, including reasonable regulation of
development and activities causing accelerated runoff, is fundamental
to the public health, safety, welfare, and the protection of the people of
the Township and all the people of the commonwealth, their resources,
and the environment.
C. Stormwater is an important water resource, which provides
groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams,
which also protects and maintains surface water quality.
D. Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to
implement a program of stormwater controls. These municipalities are
required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their
Municipal Separate Storm Sewer Systems (MS4) under the National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES).
E. Riparian forest buffers enhance water quality by filtering pollutants in
runoff, providing light control and temperature moderation, processing
pollutants, increasing infiltration and providing channel and shoreline
stability thus decreasing erosion (DEP Riparian Forest Buffer Guidance,
November 27, 2010).
A. Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including
regulations at 25 Pa. Code Chapter 93 to protect, maintain, reclaim, and
§ 230-1 PROPERTY MAINTENANCE § 230-3
197:129
§ 230-4. Statutory Authority.
restore the existing and designated uses of the waters of this
commonwealth.
B. Preserve the natural drainage systems as much as practicable.
C. Manage stormwater runoff close to the source.
D. Provide procedures and performance standards for stormwater
planning and management.
E. Maintain groundwater recharge to prevent degradation of surface and
groundwater quality and to otherwise protect water resources.
F. Prevent scour and erosion of stream banks and streambeds.
G. Provide proper operation and maintenance of all stormwater
management best management practices (SWM BMPs) that are
implemented within the Township.
H. Provide standards to meet NPDES permit requirements.
I. Promote stormwater runoff prevention through the use of nonstructural
best management practices (BMPs).
J. Provide a regulatory environment that supports the proportion, density
and intensity of development called for in the comprehensive plan;
allow for creative methods of improving water quality and managing
stormwater runoff; and promote a regional approach to water resource
management.
K. Help preserve and protect exceptional natural resources, and conserve
and restore natural resource systems.
L. Promote stormwater management practices that emphasize infiltration,
evaporation, and transpiration.
A. Primary authority. The Board of Supervisors of West Lampeter
Township is empowered to regulate these activities by the authority of
the Act of October 4, 1978, P.L. 864 (Act 167), 32 P.S. § 680.1 et seq., as
amended, the "Storm Water Management Act," and Act 394 of 1937, as
amended, 35 P.S. § 691.1 et seq., the Pennsylvania Clean Streams Law.
The Board of Supervisors of West Lampeter Township also is
empowered to regulate land use activities that affect stormwater
impacts by the authority of the Second Class Township Code, Act of May

which occurred under any prior stormwater regulation or ordinance. In
the event any violation has occurred under any prior stormwater
regulation or ordinance of West Lampeter Township, prosecution may
be initiated against the alleged offender pursuant to the provisions of
said prior stormwater regulation or ordinance, and the provisions and
penalties provided in said prior stormwater regulation or ordinance
shall remain effective as to said violation.
B. Any plan (hereinafter defined) pending at the time of the effective date
of this chapter shall be allowed to proceed with revisions, finalization
and implementation in accordance with any chapter in effect prior
hereto.

A. The design storm method is applicable to major land disturbance
activity. This method requires detailed modeling based on site
conditions.
(1) Do not increase the post development total runoff volume for all
storms equal to or less than the two-year twenty-four-hour storm
event.
(2) For modeling purposes:
(a) Existing (predevelopment) nonforested pervious areas must be
considered meadow in good condition.
(b) When the existing project site contains impervious area, 20%
of existing impervious area to be disturbed shall be considered
meadow in good condition in the model for existing conditions.
(c) The maximum loading ratio for volume control facilities in
Karst areas shall be 3:1 impervious drainage area to
infiltration area and 5:1 total drainage area to infiltration area.
The maximum loading ratio for volume control facilities in non-
Karst areas shall be 5:1 impervious drainage area to
infiltration area and 8:1 total drainage area to infiltration area.
A higher ratio may be approved by the Township if justification
is provided. Hydraulic depth may be used as an alternative to
an area based loading ratio if the design hydraulic depth is
shown to be less than the depth that could result from the
maximum area loading ratio.
B. Volume control for small projects.
(1) At least the first one inch of runoff from new impervious surfaces or
an equivalent volume shall be permanently removed from the
runoff flow; i.e., it shall not be released into the surface waters of
this commonwealth. Removal options include reuse, evaporation,
transpiration and infiltration.
(2) Wherever possible, infiltration facilities should be designed to
accommodate infiltration of the entire permanently removed
runoff; however, in all cases at least the first 1/2 inch of the
permanently removed runoff should be infiltrated.
C. A detailed geologic evaluation of the development site shall be
performed in areas of carbonate geology to determine the design
parameters of recharge facilities. A report shall be prepared in
accordance with § 230-45A.
D. Storage facilities, including normally dry, open top facilities, shall
completely drain the volume control storage over a period of time not
less than 24 hours and not more than 72 hours from the end of the
design storm. Any designed infiltration at such facilities is exempt from
the minimum twenty-four-hour standard, i.e., may infiltrate in a shorter

Rate control for large storms, up to the one-hundred-year event, is essential
to protect against immediate downstream erosion and flooding.
period of time, provided that none of this water will be discharged into
waters of this commonwealth.
E. Any portion of the volume control storage that meets all of the following
criteria may also be used as rate control storage:
(1) Volume control storage that depends on infiltration is designed
according to the infiltration standards in § 230-31.
(2) The volume control storage which will be used for rate control is
that storage which is available within 24 hours from the end of the
design storm based on the stabilized infiltration rate and/or the
evapo-transpiration rate.
F. Volume control storage facilities designed to infiltrate shall avoid the
least permeable hydrologic soil group(s) at the development site to the
greatest extent practicable.
A. Match predevelopment hydrograph. Applicants shall provide
infiltration facilities or utilize other techniques which will allow the
post-development one-hundred-year hydrograph to match the
predevelopment one-hundred-year hydrograph, along all parts of the
hydrograph, for the development site. To match the predevelopment
hydrograph, the post development peak rate must be less than or equal
to the predevelopment peak rate, and the post development runoff
volume must be less than or equal to the predevelopment volume for
the same storm event. A shift in hydrograph peak time of up to five
minutes and a rate variation of up to 5% at a given time may be
allowable to account for the timing affect of BMPs used to manage the
peak rate and runoff volume. "Volume control" volumes as given in
§ 230-32 above may be used as part of this option.
B. Where the predevelopment hydrograph cannot be matched, one of the
following shall apply:
(1) For areas not covered by a release rate map from an approved Act
167 Plan:
Post development discharge rates shall not exceed the
predevelopment discharge rates for the two-, ten-, twenty-five-,
fifty-, and one-hundred-year twenty-four-hour storm events*. If it
is shown that the peak rates of discharge indicated by the post
development analysis are less than or equal to the peak rates of
discharge indicated by the predevelopment analysis for two-, ten-,
twenty-five-, fifty-, and one-hundred-year twenty-four-hour storms*,
then the requirements of this section have been met. Otherwise,

Method storm. See Table III-1 in § 230-35.
(2) For areas covered by a release rate map from an approved Act 167
Plan:
For the two-, ten-, twenty-five-, fifty-, and one-hundred-year storm
events*, the post development peak discharge rates will follow the
applicable approved release rate maps.
A twenty-four-hour SCS type II storm or an IDF Curve Rational
Method storm. See Table III-1 in § 230-35.
C. Normally dry, open top, storage facilities shall completely drain the rate
control storage over a period of time less than or equal to 24 hours from
the peak one-hundred-year water surface design elevation.
D. A variety of BMPs should be employed and tailored to suit the
development site. The following is a partial listing of BMPs which can
be utilized in SWM systems for rate control where appropriate:
(1) Decreased impervious surface coverage.
(2) Routed flow over grass.
(3) Grassed channels and vegetated strips.

§ 230-35. Calculation methodology.
B. Stormwater runoff from a development site to an adjacent property
shall flow directly into a natural drainageway, watercourse, or into an
existing storm sewer system, or onto adjacent properties in a manner
similar to the runoff characteristics of the predevelopment flow. The
applicant must provide proof to the Township Engineer that he or his
agent has informed the immediate downstream property owner of the
effects of the stormwater discharge from the proposed development.
C. Stormwater flows onto adjacent property shall not be created,
increased, decreased, relocated, or otherwise altered without written
notification of the adjacent property owner(s) by the developer. Such
stormwater flows shall be subject to the requirements of this chapter,
including the establishment of a drainage easement. Copies of all such
notifications shall be included in SWM site plan submissions.
D. Existing on-site natural and man-made SWM facilities shall be used to
the maximum extent practicable.
E. Stormwater runoff shall not be transferred from one sub-watershed to
another unless they are sub-watersheds of a common watershed that

effect of the transfer does not alter the peak discharge onto adjacent
lands.
F. Minimum floor elevations for all structures that would be affected by a
basin, other temporary impoundments, or open conveyance systems
where ponding may occur shall be two feet above the one-hundred-year
water surface elevation. If basement or underground facilities are
proposed, detailed calculations addressing the effects of stormwater
ponding on the structure and waterproofing and/or floodproofing
design information shall be submitted for approval.
G. All stormwater conveyance facilities (excluding detention, retention,
and wetland basin outfall structures) shall be designed to convey a
twenty-five-year storm event*. All stormwater conveyance facilities
(excluding detention, retention, and wetland basin outfall structures)
conveying water originating from offsite shall be designed to convey a
fifty-year storm event*. Safe conveyance of the one-hundred-year runoff
event* to appropriate peak rate control BMPs must be demonstrated in
the design.
*A twenty-four-hour SCS Type II storm or an IDF Curve Rational
Method storm.
H. Erosion protection shall be provided along all open channels, and at all
points of discharge. Flow velocities from any storm sewer may not
result in erosion of the receiving channel.
I. Roof drains shall not be connected to streets, sanitary or storm sewers
or roadside ditches.

A. Any stormwater runoff calculations involving drainage areas greater
than 200 acres and time of concentration (Tc) greater than 60 minutes,
including on- and off-site areas, shall use generally accepted calculation
techniques based on the NRCS soil-cover complex method.
B. Stormwater runoff from all development sites shall be calculated using
either the modified rational method, a soil-cover-complex methodology,
or other method acceptable to the Township. Table III-1 summarizes
acceptable computation methods. It is assumed that all methods will be
selected by the design professional based on the individual limitations
and suitability of each method for a particular development site.

hour based on the information for the five-through sixty-minute
duration storm events.
E. Hydrographs may be obtained from NRCS methods such as TR-55,
TR20, or from use of the "modified" or "unit hydrograph" rational
methods. If "modified" or "unit hydrograph" rational methods are used,
the ascending leg of the hydrograph shall have a length equal to three
times the time of concentration (3xTc) and the descending leg shall
have a length equal to seven times the time of concentration (7xTc) to
approximate an SCS Type II hydrograph.
F. Runoff calculations shall include a hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
indicating volume and velocities of flow and the grades, sizes, and
capacities of water-carrying structures, sediment basins, retention and
detention structures and sufficient design information to construct such
facilities. Runoff calculations shall also indicate both predevelopment
and post-development rates for peak discharge of stormwater runoff
from all discharge points.
G. For the purpose of calculating predevelopment peak discharges, all
runoff coefficients, both on-site and off-site, shall be based on actual
land use assuming summer or good land conditions. Post-development
runoff coefficients for on-site discharges used to design conveyance
facilities shall be based on actual land use assuming winter or poor land
conditions.
H. Criteria and assumptions to be used in the determination of stormwater
runoff and design of management facilities are as follows:
(1) Runoff coefficients shall be based on the information contained in
Appendix B-1 and B-253 if the actual land use is listed in those
appendices. If the actual land use is not listed in these appendices,
runoff coefficients shall be chosen from other published
documentation, and a copy of said documentation shall be
submitted with the SWM site plan.
(2) A sample worksheet for calculating Tc is provided in Appendix B-4.
Times of concentration (Tc) shall be based on the following design
parameters:
(a) Sheet flow: The maximum length for each reach of sheet or
overland flow before shallow concentrated or open channel
flow develops is 150 feet. Flow lengths greater than 100 feet
shall be justified based on the actual conditions at each
development site. Sheet flow may be determined using the
nomograph in Appendix B-3,54 or the Manning's kinematic
solution shown in the sheet flow section of Worksheet No. 1 in
Appendix B-4.55

197:156
§ 230-36. Riparian corridors.
(b) Shallow concentrated flow: Travel time for shallow
concentrated flow shall be determined using Figure 3-1 from
TR-55, Urban Hydrology for small watersheds, as shown in
Appendix B-5.56
(c) Open channel flows: At points where sheet and shallow
concentrated flows concentrate in field depressions, swales,
gutters, curbs, or pipe collection systems, the travel times to
downstream end of the development site between these design
points shall be based upon Manning's Equation and/or
acceptable engineering design standards as determined by the
Township Engineer.
(3) The developer may use stormwater credits for nonstructural BMPs
in accordance with the BMP Manual. The allowable reduction will
be determined by the Township.
(4) Peak rate control is not required for off-site runoff. Off-site runoff
may be by-passed around the site provided all other discharge
requirements are met. If offsite runoff is routed through rate
control facilities, runoff coefficients for off-site discharges used to
design those rate control facilities shall be based on actual land use
assuming winter or poor land conditions.
I. Times of concentration shall be calculated based on the methodology
recommended in the respective model used. Times of concentration for
channel and pipe flow shall be computed using Manning's Equation.
Supporting documentation and calculations must be submitted for
review and approval.
J. The sizing of stormwater management facilities for residential
subdivisions shall be based on the maximum impervious coverage
permitted by Chapter 285, Zoning, for those lots that are 15,000 square
feet or less in size. Within residential subdivisions where lots are
greater than 15,000 square feet in size the design for the stormwater
management facilities must specifically identify the square footage of
impervious coverage assumed for each lot and a note must be provided
on the plan to be recorded that indicates the amount used for the
design of the SWM facilities within the subdivision.
A. In order to protect and improve water quality, a riparian corridor
easement shall be created and recorded as part of any subdivision or
land development that encompasses a riparian corridor.
B. Except as otherwise required by Chapter 102, the width of the riparian
corridor easement shall be established as the greatest of the following:

(1) Existing native vegetation shall be protected and maintained within
the riparian corridor easement.
(2) Whenever practicable invasive vegetation shall be actively
removed and the riparian corridor easement shall be planted with
native trees, shrubs and other vegetation to create a diverse native
plant community appropriate to the intended ecological context of
the site.
D. The riparian corridor easement shall be enforceable by the Township
and shall be recorded in the Lancaster County Recorder of Deeds
Office, so that it shall run with the land and shall limit the use of the
property located therein. The easement shall allow for the continued
private ownership and shall count toward the minimum lot area as
required by Chapter 285, Zoning, unless otherwise specified in Chapter
285.
E. Any permitted use within the riparian corridor easement shall be
conducted in a manner that will maintain the extent of the existing onehundred-
year floodplain, improve or maintain the stream stability, and
preserve and protect the ecological function of the floodplain.
F. The following conditions shall apply when public and/or private
recreation trails are permitted within riparian corridors:
(1) Trails shall be for nonmotorized use only.
(2) Trails shall be designed to have the least impact on native plant
species and other sensitive environmental features.
G. Septic drainfields and sewage disposal systems shall not be permitted
within the Riparian Corridor Easement and shall comply with setback
requirements established under 25 Pa. Code Chapter 73.

a 4% to 6% air entrapment ingredient and a maximum slump of three
inches, constructed level on stone backfill with a minimum thickness of
four inches. The use of calcium chloride is prohibited from the concrete
used for repair or construction, where slip forms are used a maximum
slump of 1 1/2 inches shall be permitted. No concrete shall be placed
when the air temperature is below 40° Fahrenheit. Curing compound
may be applied to retain moisture to allow for the complete hydration of
the concrete. No material such as asphalt, macadam or blacktop shall
be substituted for these specifications.
B. Forms. Forms shall be wood or metal, straight, free from warp, and of
sufficient strength to resist the pressure of the concrete without
springing. If of wood, they shall be two-inch planks, surfaced on the
inside and the top. Forms shall be of a depth equal to the depth of the
concrete. A front and back form shall be used for curbs except where a
good concrete sidewalk, which is not to be removed, abuts the new
curb. Forms shall be accurately set to line and grade in such a manner
as to prevent settlement or displacement.
C. Finishing. All forms shall be removed within 24 hours after the concrete
has been placed and minor defects shall be filled with mortar composed
of one part portland cement and two parts of fine aggregate. The top
§ 235-17 WEST LAMPETER CODE § 235-18
235:208
and face of the curb from the top of 10 inches below or to the top of
the street surface, when in place, shall be finished while the concrete is
still green by rubbing the surface with a carborundum stone, soft brick,
or wood blocks and water until a smooth, even surface is produced.
All joints in the curb shall be promptly opened from top to bottom and
edges adjacent to the joints shall be sharp and clean cut. Sidewalks
shall be finished after pouring before the concrete sets.
D. Curing. Concrete curbs and sidewalks shall be protected from
rainstorms with paper, burlap, canvas, or similar materials. Curing
compound may be applied to retain moisture in concrete to allow
complete hydration of the cement. Plastic, burlap, straw or other types
of moisture barrier shall be used to maintain concrete wet during the
drying process for at least seven days after pouring if curing compound
is not used. No concrete shall be placed when the temperature is below
40° Fahrenheit. To help prevent spalling and deterioration of concrete
surface from winter damage, a concrete hardener may be applied 28
days after concrete is poured.
E. Backfilling and trench restoration. After the concrete has cured
sufficiently, spaces adjacent to the curb and sidewalk shall be refilled
with acceptable material in layers of not more than four inches in depth.
Each layer shall be thoroughly compacted to the required elevation on

Department of Transportation approved 2A modified stone placed and
compacted in six-inch layers to within four inches of the existing road
surface. In the event that this excavated area extends more than two
feet from the face of the curb, the contractor shall temporarily fill the
area with cold patch asphalt until such time as permanent trench
restoration is completed. All roadway restoration shall conform to
Township standards.
F. Expansion joints. Where a sidewalk abuts the curb, a building, wall or
other permanent structure, a premolded expansion joint 1/4 inch in
thickness shall be placed between the curb and sidewalk for the full
length of such permanent structure. The slabs shall be constructed in
twenty-foot maximum lengths with premolded expansion material
having a minimum thickness of 1/4 inch separating slabs transversely.
G. Scoring. For sidewalks, scoring shall be done transversely at evenly
spaced intervals of not more than five feet. The depth shall be 1/5 the
thickness of concrete and in no case less than one-half-inch deep. For
curbs, scoring shall be done at no greater than fifteen-foot intervals.
The scoring shall be done transversely and, extend continuously down
the face of the curb 10 inches. The score shall be 1 1/2 inches deep.
Expansion joints may be substituted for scoring.
H. Concrete color. Coloring of concrete for curbs and/or sidewalks shall be
of an earth tone and shall be thoroughly and uniformly mixed
throughout the concrete. Colored concrete shall not be mixed or
splattered onto noncolored areas. If colored concrete becomes mixed or

entrapment, four inch slump with no additives. Beauty strips using
stamped patterned concrete shall be a minimum of 16 inches in width
or a maximum of 24 inches in width for sidewalks of eight feet or
greater. All stamped decorative patterned concrete shall be of a texture
that will not cause a tripping or slipping hazard in dry or wet
conditions. Coloring shall conform to Subsection H of this section.
J. Inspections. After all forms and stone have been set and prior to
pouring of any concrete, the property owner or his contractor shall
contact the Township office for an inspection, The property owner shall
provide the Township with a minimum 24 hours' prior notice to the onsite
expected concrete delivery time. The property owner and his
contractor shall complete all corrective actions outlined by the
inspector and shall notify the Township that the site is ready for a
reinspection as above, which reinspection shall be completed prior to
the pouring of concrete. Concrete pour tickets verifying the concrete
mixture shall be made available to the inspector upon request. A final
inspection shall be completed after concrete and/or roadway asphalt

(c) Hydrogeology. Those applications proposing the use of on-lot
wells and/or on-lot sewage disposal systems in areas underlain
by the Conestoga and/or the Vintage geologic formations shall
require the preparation of a preliminary hydrogeologic study.
Such preliminary hydrogeologic study shall be conducted by a
qualified hydrogeologist and consist of the following minimum
considerations:
[1] A map showing the topographic location of the site,
proposed on-site sewage disposal systems and wells.
Narrative descriptions of the types of these systems shall
also be furnished.

lineaments, faults, outcrops of bedrock, soil mottling,
surface drainage into the ground, ghost lakes, etc.
[3] A map and narrative description of the area that will be
impacted from the proposed use of on-lot sewage disposal
systems. Such analysis will consider and identify the
systems and their dispersion plumes and mixing zones to
be calculated from the surface topography and known
§ 240-15 WEST LAMPETER CODE § 240-15
240:254
geologic conditions. The analysis will then describe
anticipated water quality/quantity impacts to areas
located downgradient and/or along any geologic strike or
fault. These anticipated impacts should also consider
existing and potential land uses located within the affected
area.
[4] Should it be determined that the proposed use(s) would
result in a degradation of groundwater quality, or
eliminate the potential groundwater use at nearby
properties, the study should present measures that can be
employed to mitigate these adverse impacts.
(d) Soils. Those applications involving lands with soils
characterized by "severe" limitations for building site
development in Table 11 of the Soil Survey of Lancaster
County, Pennsylvania (1985), and/or those plans involving the
use of on-lot sewage disposal systems on lands with soils
characterized by "severe" limitations for such facilities in Table
12 of the Soil Survey of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania (1988),
shall require the preparation of a statement by a qualified
planner, soil scientist, engineer and/or architect which
includes the following minimum considerations:
[1] A planimetric map of the site that depicts those soils
contained on the site. Soils with severe development
constraints shall be highlighted. The map shall also depict
all existing and proposed improvements on the site;
[2] A description of the site planning methods used to protect
soils with severe development constraints from deleterious
impacts associated with the proposed use; and
[3] A description of the construction techniques used to
assure that the site's soils can safely accommodate the
proposed use.
(e) Historic preservation. Those applications involving properties
listed with the Pennsylvania Historic Site Survey shall require
the preparation of a statement by a commonwealth-registered
architect or landscape architect which includes the following
minimum considerations:

sites that highlights existing historic sites and depicts the
proposed use;
[2] A description of the site's historic features and their
historic significance at the local, state and national level;
[3] A letter from the Historic Preservation Trust of Lancaster
County commenting on the proposed development's
§ 240-15 SUBDIVISION AND LAND DEVELOPMENT § 240-15
240:255
impact on the historic sites contained on or around the
site. This letter should also contain any additional design
and/or use recommendations that would further protect
historic resources.
[4] Architectural renderings of the proposed structures and
descriptions of any architectural treatments that are
intended to complement any important architectural
features of historic resources. Such descriptions shall be
analyzed with the following criteria:
[a] Proportion of buildings front facades. The relationship
between the width of the front of the building and the
height of the front of the building.
[b] Proportion of openings within the building. The
relationship of width to height of windows and doors.
[c] Rhythms of solids to voids in the front facade. Since
rhythm is a repeated and recurrent alteration of
strong and weak architectural elements, a rhythm of
masses to openings in a building should be
maintained.
[d] Rhythm of spacing of buildings on streets. In moving
past a series of buildings, a rhythm of recurrent or
repeated building masses to spaces between them
should be experienced.
[e] Rhythm of entrance and/or porch projections. Moving
past a series of structures, one experiences a rhythm
of entrances or projections at an intimate scale.
[f] Relationship of materials. Within an area, the
predominant materials may be brick, stone, stucco,
wood siding or other material.
[g] Relationship of textures. The predominant textures of
an area may be smooth, such as stucco or rough as
brick with tooled joints or horizontal wood siding, or
other textures.
[h] Walls of continuity. Physical ingredients such as brick
walls, wrought iron fences, evergreen landscape
masses, building facades, or combinations of these
form continuous, cohesive walls of enclosures along
the street.
[i] Relationship of landscaping. There may be a
predominance of a quality and quantity of landscaping
although emphasis herein shall be with the amounts
and continuity of landscaping.
§ 240-15 WEST LAMPETER CODE § 240-15
240:256
[j] Paving materials. There may be a predominance in the
use of brick pavers, cobblestones, granite blocks or
others.
[k] Directional expression of front elevation. Structural
shape, planning of openings and architectural detail
may provide a predominantly vertical, horizontal or
non-directional character to the buildings facade.
[l] Scale. Scale is created by the size of units of
construction and architectural detail that relate to the
size of man. It can also be determined by building
mass and how it relates to open space. The major
elements of scale may be brick or stone units, window
or door openings, porches and balconies, etc.
[m] Relationship of color. Insofar as the mass and detail
such as trim are concerned, a predominant color that
may be of a natural material or a patina colored by
time. Blending colors of trim is also a factor.
[n] Relationship of architectural details. Architectural
details and their relationship to the structure in
question and adjacent ones, including but not limited
to, cornices, lintels, arches, quoins, balustrades and
ironwork, chimneys, etc.
[o] Relationship of roof shapes. Buildings should have
compatible roof shapes such as gable, mansard, hip,
flat, gambrel and/or other kinds of roof shapes.
[5] A description of any nonstructural site improvements
(buffering, landscaping and screening) that will be used to
protect the integrity of the historic resources.
(f) Archaeological resources. All applications involving lands
identified by the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum
Commission (PHMC) as containing a potential or known site of
archaeological significance shall require the preparation of a
statement by a professional archaeologist which includes the
following minimum considerations:
[1] A detailed account of a Phase I survey of archaeological
resources conducted on the site, and its findings. Such
survey shall be conducted only after notification of the
Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission (PHMC)

ARTICLE V
Improvement Guarantees
§ 240-17. General requirements.
§ 240-18. Financial security.
The administration of the financial security shall comply with the provisions
of this article, the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, Act 247, as
amended,93 and other applicable laws of the commonwealth.
A. No project shall be considered in compliance with this chapter until the
streets, all street signs, sidewalks, curbs, landscaping, storm drainage
for dedication or which affect adjacent properties or streets, sanitary
sewer facilities for dedication, water supply facilities, fire hydrants, lot
line markers, survey monuments and other such public improvements
have been installed in accordance with this chapter and other
applicable Township ordinances.
B. No final plan shall be signed by the Board of Supervisors for recording
in the office of the Lancaster County Recorder of Deeds unless:
(1) A financial security in accordance with § 240-18 is accepted by the
Board of Supervisors; and/or
(2) The improvements required by this chapter have been installed.
A. Submission of financial security. Final plan applications that include
public improvements that have not been installed shall include a
financial security.
(1) Type of financial security. Although the Board of Supervisors may
accept an alternative type of financial security, commonly used
forms are irrevocable letters of credit and escrow accounts. Such
financial security shall be posted by a chartered lending institution
or bonding company authorized to do business in the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and is subject to review by the
Township Solicitor for adequacy.
(2) Amount of financial security.
(a) The amount of financial security shall be equal to 110% of the
cost of completion estimated as of 90 days following the date
scheduled for completion by the developer. Annually the
Township may adjust the amount of the financial security by
comparing the actual cost of the improvements which have
been completed and estimated cost for the completion of the
remaining improvements as of the expiration of the 90th day
after either the original date schedule for completion or a
rescheduled date of completion. Subsequent to said
93.Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10101 et seq.
§ 240-17 SUBDIVISION AND LAND DEVELOPMENT § 240-18
240:265
adjustment, the municipality may require the developer to post
additional security in order to assure that the financial security
equals said 110%. Any additional security shall be posted by
the developer in accordance with this chapter.
(b) The amount of financial security required shall be based upon
an estimate of the cost of completion of the required
improvements, submitted by an applicant or developer and
prepared by a professional engineer licensed as such in this
commonwealth and certified by such engineer to be a fair and
reasonable estimate of such cost. The municipality, upon the
recommendation of the municipal engineer, may refuse to
accept such estimate for good cause shown. If the applicant or
developer and the municipality are unable to agree upon an
estimate, then the estimate shall be recalculated and
recertified by another professional engineer licensed as such
in this commonwealth and chosen mutually by the municipality
and the applicant or developer. The estimate certified by the
third engineer shall be presumed fair and reasonable, and shall
be the final estimate. In the event that a third engineer is so
chosen, fees for the services of said engineer shall be paid
equally by the municipality and the applicant or developer.
(c) If the party posting the financial security requires more than
one year from the date of posting of the financial security to
complete the required improvements, the amount of financial
security may be increased by an additional 10% for each oneyear
period beyond the first anniversary date from posting of
financial security or to an amount not exceeding 110% of the
cost of completing the required improvements as reestablished
on or about the expiration of the preceding one-year period by
using the above procedure.
B. Release of financial security.
(1) When the developer has completed all of the necessary and
appropriate improvements, the developer shall notify the Board of
Supervisors in writing, by certified or registered mail, of the
completion of the aforesaid improvements and shall send a copy
thereof to the Township Engineer. The Board of Supervisors shall,
within 10 days after receipt of such notice, direct and authorize
Township Engineer to inspect all of the aforesaid improvements.
The Township Engineer shall, thereupon, file a report, in writing,
with the Board of Supervisors, and shall promptly mail a copy of the
same to the developer by certified or registered mail. The report
shall be made and mailed within 30 days after receipt by the
Township Engineers of the aforesaid authorization from the Board
of Supervisors; said report shall be detailed and shall indicate
approval or rejection of said improvements, either in whole or in
part, and if said improvements, or any portion thereof, shall not be
approved or shall be rejected by the Township Engineers, said
§ 240-18 WEST LAMPETER CODE § 240-18
240:266
§ 240-19. Dedication of improvements.
All improvements shall be deemed to be private improvements and only for
the benefit of the specific project until such time as the same have been
offered for dedication and formally accepted by the Board of Supervisors.
No responsibility of any kind with respect to improvements shown on the
final plan shall be transferred until the improvements have been formally
accepted. All requests for dedication shall follow the current procedures of
the Township of West Lampeter.
report shall contain a statement of reasons for such nonapproval or
rejection.
(2) The Board of Supervisors shall notify the developer, within 15 days
of receipt of the Engineer's report, in writing by certified or
registered mail of the action of the Board of Supervisors with
relation thereto.
(3) If the Board of Supervisors or the Township Engineer fails to
comply with the time limitation provisions contained herein, all
improvements will be deemed to have been approved and the
developer shall be released from all liability, pursuant to its
performance guaranty bond or other security agreement.
(4) If any portion of the said improvements shall not be approved or
shall be rejected by the Board of Supervisors the developer shall
proceed to complete the same and, upon completion, the same
procedure of notification, as outlined herein, shall be followed.
(5) Nothing herein, however, shall be construed in limitation of the
developer's right to contest or question by legal proceedings or
otherwise, any determination of the Board of Supervisors or the
Township Engineer.
(6) If any portion of said improvements are not approved or are
rejected by the Board of Supervisors, the applicant shall proceed to
complete the same and, upon completion, the same procedure of
notification outlined herein shall be followed.
C. Other remedies. If proceeds of the financial security are insufficient to
pay the cost of installing or making repairs or corrections to all the
improvements covered by said security, the Board of Supervisors may,
at its option, install all or part of such improvements and may institute
appropriate legal or equitable action to recover the funds necessary to
complete the remainder of the improvements. All of the proceeds,
whether resulting from the security or from any legal or equitable
action brought against the applicant, or both, shall be used solely for
the installation of the improvements covered by such security, and not
for any other municipal purpose.
§ 240-18 SUBDIVISION AND LAND DEVELOPMENT § 240-20
240:267
§ 240-20. Maintenance guarantee.
The Board of Supervisors may, at its discretion, require the applicant to
submit a maintenance guarantee or other approved guarantee as specified
herein, guaranteeing the structural integrity as well as function of any
improvement shown on the final plan for a term not to exceed 18 months
from the date of acceptance of dedication by the Board of Supervisors. Said
guarantee shall not exceed 15% of the actual cost of installation of said
improvements and be of the same type of financial security as required in
this article.
§ 240-21. Inspection of improvements during construction.
§ 240-22. As-built plans.
Upon completion of all required improvements and prior to final inspections
of improvements, the applicant shall submit a plan labeled "as-built plan,"
showing the location, dimension and elevation of all improvements. In
addition, the plan shall indicate that the resultant grading, drainage
structures and/or drainage systems and erosion and sediment control
practices, including vegetative measures, are in substantial conformance
with the previously approved drawings and specifications. The plan shall
note all deviation from the previously approved drawings. Two copies of
the plan (one paper transparency and one plastic transparency) shall be
submitted to the Township, which shall distribute the paper transparency to
the Township Engineer and retain the plastic transparency for the Township
files.
A. Prior to the initiation of construction, the developer shall notify the
Township so that an inspection schedule can be coordinated with the
construction schedule. Additionally, the Township and the Township
Engineer shall be notified four working days in advance of any intended
date of construction. The provisions stated herein shall be construed as
mandating periodic inspections and the undertaking of periodic
inspections shall not be construed as an acceptance of the work during
construction or as a final inspection of the construction.
B. The Township, at the expense of the developer, reserves the right to
require tests of the improvement to determine whether the
improvement complies in all respects with the requirements of the
Township.

ARTICLE VI
Design Standards
§ 240-23. Minimum standards; compliance with other provisions.
[Amended 10-14-2002 by Ord. No. 170]
A. The standards and requirements contained in this article shall apply as
minimum design standards for subdivisions and/or land developments
within the Township. In addition, subdivisions and/or land
developments shall be designed to comply with the requirements of
Chapter 285, Zoning, Chapter 230, Stormwater Management, the
regulations of the public water supplier and public sewer supplier, and
the regulations of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation and
the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, as
applicable.
B. All proposed subdivisions and/or land developments shall be designed,
laid out, arranged, constructed, and coordinated with all presently
existing facilities and improvements which serve the tract proposed to
be developed, including but not limited to the a) transportation
network, b) sewer collection, conveyance, and treatment facilities, c)
water supply and distribution facilities, and d) stormwater management
facilities, as necessary to accommodate prospective traffic, provide
adequate sewer and water service, promote proper stormwater
management, facilitate fire protection, prevent flooding, and conform to
the Comprehensive Plan, including any Urban Growth Boundary, the
Official Map, and any regulations or plans adopted in furtherance
thereof. All proposed subdivisions and/or land developments shall also
be designed, laid out, arranged, constructed, and coordinated to insure
that abutting properties will continue to have safe and convenient
access in accordance with the standards of this chapter or, if such
properties do not presently have such access, to have access at least
equal to the level existing prior to the proposed subdivision and/or land
development. The applicant shall submit studies and reports with the
preliminary plan and the final plan which shall clearly identify any
assumed, proposed, and required improvements to existing facilities. If
an applicant submits a study, report or plan which contains
improvements assumed to be installed by others and compliance with
the design standards in this chapter is based upon the completion of
such assumed improvements, the design standards of this chapter shall
not be considered as met unless the applicant presents evidence that a
governmental entity has budgeted funds and/or has entered into
contracts for the assumed improvements or unless a plan for another
development which proposes the installation of such improvements has
been approved and recorded.
(1) Whenever Chapter 285, Zoning, provides that the use proposed by
the applicant for subdivision and/or land development approval
shall constitute a use by special exception or a conditional use, the
applicant shall obtain such special exception or conditional use
§ 240-23 SUBDIVISION AND LAND DEVELOPMENT § 240-23
240:269
§ 240-24. Streets, access drives and driveways.
approval from the Zoning Hearing Board or the Board of
Supervisors, as applicable, prior to the submission of the
preliminary plan. The preliminary plan shall be designed and
developed in accordance with any conditions which have been
imposed upon the grant of such special exception or conditional
use by the Zoning Hearing Board or the Board of Supervisors, as
applicable.
(2) Whenever the applicant proposes to develop a subdivision and/or
land development in a manner that would require a variance or
variances from any requirements of Chapter 285, Zoning, the
applicant shall obtain such variance or variances from the Zoning
Hearing Board prior to the submission of the preliminary plan. The
preliminary plan shall be designed and developed in accordance
with any conditions which have been imposed upon the grant of
such variance or variances by the Zoning Hearing Board.
(3) Whenever all or a portion of the land contained within an
application for subdivision or land development approval
constitutes all or a portion of land included in a prior subdivision or
land development plan approved by the Township or the Lancaster
County Planning Commission and recorded in the office of the
Recorder of Deeds in and for Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, the
plan shall comply with all conditions, restrictions, and notes
imposed on the prior approval and/or included upon the recorded
subdivision or land development plan. The applicant shall identify
all prior recorded subdivision and/or land development plans of
which all or a portion of the land contained in the plan was a part
and all conditions, restrictions, and notes which affect the current
application. Failure to identify all applicable conditions,
restrictions, and notes of record on prior plans constitutes a
violation of this chapter. The applicant shall submit with the
application for preliminary plan approval (or final plan approval if a
preliminary plan is not required) a statement identifying the prior
plans reviewed; the conditions, restrictions, and notes which would
impact development in accordance with the plan for which
approval has been requested; and an explanation of the manner in
which the proposed plan has been designed to comply with such
conditions, restrictions, and notes. This information shall be signed
by the applicant or the applicant's engineer, landscape architect or
other consultant.
A. Conformance with adopted plans. The proposed street pattern shall be
properly related to existing streets, Official Maps, and such Township,
county, and state highway plans as have been duly adopted.
B. Private streets. Private streets are prohibited unless they meet the
design standards of these regulations. Applications which propose a
private street shall be accompanied by a right-of-way agreement which
§ 240-23 WEST LAMPETER CODE § 240-24
240:270
shall be submitted for review by the Township and recorded with the
Lancaster County Recorder of Deeds on the same date as the recording
of the final plan. This agreement shall establish the conditions under
which the street will be constructed and maintained, as well as
conditions controlling an offer of dedication.
C. Improvements to existing streets.
(1) Subdivision and land development along existing roads, which do
not meet the standards of this chapter, shall include the
improvement of 1/2 of such road to required standards.
Improvement construction guarantee in the forms permitted by
this chapter shall assure that such improvements will be made
within such period of time as the Township shall determine, such
determination to be based on the likely timing of the improvement
of the other portion of said roadway.
(2) In lieu of the improvement construction guarantee for the specific
road on which the subdivision lies, the subdivider may contribute a
general site improvement fee to be used by the Township whenever
said road is upgraded. The amount of "fee in lieu of" on a per-frontfootage
basis will be determined annually by the Township
Engineer.
D. Arterial street design. The design standards for arterial streets shall be
as specified by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation and
based upon the projected average daily traffic and speed limit.
E. Arrangement.
(1) Streets shall be designed with consideration to both existing and
planned streets.
(2) All streets shall be arranged to conform as closely as possible to the
original topography.
(3) New streets shall be connected with streets of similar function, to
form continuations thereof.
(4) Local streets shall be laid out to discourage use by through traffic.
Streets shall be laid out to provide convenient and safe access to

public interest.
B. All waivers of the minimum standards shall be processed in accordance

entity, or the officers of such corporation or other entity, violating this
chapter to have believed that there was no such violation. If the District

an approval to any owner, current owner, vendee or lessee for the
development of any real property, the Township may require
compliance with the conditions that would have been applicable to the
property at the time the applicant acquired an interest in such real
property.
A. Whenever there is a difference between the minimum applicable
standard specified herein and those included in other applicable

equity, including criminal proceedings, pertaining to any act done

Earned Income Tax
[Adopted 9-12-2011 by Ord. No. 227103]
§ 246-14. Short title.
This article shall be known and may be cited as the West Lampeter
Township Earned Income Tax Ordinance.
§ 246-15. Definitions.
All terms defined in the Local Tax Enabling Act shall have the meanings set
forth therein. The following terms shall have the meanings set forth herein:
COLLECTOR  The person or entity appointed as tax officer pursuant to
the Local Tax Enabling Act to collect the tax.
EFFECTIVE DATE  January 1, 2012.
GOVERNING BODY  The Board of Supervisors of the Township of West
Lampeter.
LOCAL TAX ENABLING ACT  The Local Tax Enabling Act, as set forth
in 53 P.S. § 6901 et seq. while such numbering and provisions remain in
effect under Act 32 of 2008, and as set forth in 53 P.S. § 6924.101 et seq.
when such numbering and provisions become effective under Act 32, and as
amended in the future.
TAX  The tax imposed by this enactment.
TAX RETURN  A form prescribed by the collector for reporting the amount
of Tax or other amount owed or required to be withheld, remitted, or
reported under this enactment or the Local Tax Enabling Act.

§ 246-16. Imposition of tax; rate.
A. General purpose resident tax. The taxing authority hereby imposes a
tax for general revenue purposes at the rate of 0.5% on earned income
and net profits of individual residents of the taxing authority.
103. Editors Note: This ordinance also repealed former Art. II, Earned Income Tax, adopted
12-13-1999 by Ord. No. 151
§ 246-14 SUBDIVISION AND LAND DEVELOPMENT § 246-16
240:313
§ 246-17. Exemption.
This governing body finds that minors of various age groups have
traditionally, and with judicial sanction, been considered as comprising
separate classes for many legislative purposes; and minors under the age
of 16 are generally unemancipated and subject to compulsory school
attendance and child labor laws, and therefore have limited earned income
and net profits and control of money such that enforcement of reporting
and collection of tax hereunder against them would yield inconsequential
amounts and be unduly difficult, expensive, and not in the public interest.
For these reasons, individuals under the age of 16 years are exempt from
liability for the tax.
§ 246-18. Individual tax returns and payments.
Every individual receiving earned income or earning net profits in any tax
year shall file tax returns and pay tax in accordance with the Local Tax
Enabling Act.
§ 246-19. Employer withholding, remittance, and tax returns.
Every employer shall register, withhold, and remit the tax, and file tax
returns in accordance with the Local Tax Enabling Act.
§ 246-20. Collection of tax.
The tax will be collected from individuals and employers by the collector.
B. Ongoing tax. The tax shall continue at the above rates during the
current tax year and each tax year thereafter, without annual
reenactment, until this enactment is repealed or the rate is changed.
C. Local Tax Enabling Act applicable. The tax is imposed under authority
of the Local Tax Enabling Act, and all provisions thereof that relate to a
tax on earned income or net profits are incorporated into this
enactment. Any future amendments to the Local Tax Enabling Act that
are required to be applied to a tax on earned income or net profits will
automatically become part of this enactment upon the effective date of
such amendment, without the need for formal amendment of this
enactment, to the maximum extent allowed by 1 Pa.C.S. § 1937.
D. Applicable laws, regulations, policies, and procedures. The tax shall be
collected and administered in accordance with all applicable laws and
regulations; and with regulations, policies and procedures adopted by
the TCC or by the collector. This includes any regulations, policies, and
procedures adopted in the future to the maximum extent allowed by 1
Pa.C.S. § 1937.
§ 246-16 WEST LAMPETER CODE § 246-21
240:314
§ 246-21. Interest, penalties, costs, and fines.
Individuals and employers are subject to interest, penalties, costs, and fines
in accordance with the Local Tax Enabling Act, including costs imposed by
the collector in accordance with the Local Tax Enabling Act.
§ 246-22. Construal of provisions.
The primary purpose of this enactment is to conform the earned income
and net profits tax currently imposed to the Local Tax Enabling Act, as
amended and restated by Act 32 of 2008, and to do so within the time frame
required by Act 32. Any prior enactment imposing a tax on earned income
or net profits of individuals is amended and restated in its entirety to read
as stated in this enactment. Any other prior enactment or part of any prior
enactment conflicting with the provisions of this enactment is rescinded
insofar as the conflict exists. To the extent the same as any enactment in
force immediately prior to adoption of this enactment, the provisions of
this enactment are intended as a continuation of such prior enactment and
not as a new enactment. If this enactment is declared invalid, any prior
enactment levying a similar tax shall remain in full force and effect and shall
not be affected by adoption of this enactment. If any part of this enactment
is declared invalid, the similar part of any prior enactment levying a similar
tax shall remain in effect and shall not be affected by adoption of this
enactment. The provisions of this enactment shall not affect any act done
or liability incurred, nor shall such provisions affect any suit or prosecution
pending or to be initiated to enforce any right or penalty or to punish
offense under the authority of any enactment in force prior to adoption
of this enactment. Subject to the foregoing provisions of this section, this
enactment shall amend and restate on the effective date any enactment
levying a tax on earned income or net profits in force immediately prior to
the effective date.
§ 246-23. Effective date.
This enactment shall take effect and be in force on January 1, 2012.

§ 246-30. Collection by employer; return and payment.
imposed, and proceeds of the tax shall be used in accordance with all
applicable requirements of the LTEA.
A. An individual whose total earned income and net profits from all
sources within the Township in any tax year is less than $12,000 is
exempt from the tax for the tax year.
B. Individuals may also be exempt for other reasons, including disability
resulting from serving in the armed forces, active duty as a member of a
reserve component of the armed forces, and other reasons as set forth
in the regulations or the LTEA.
C. An individual may obtain exemption prospectively by filing a local
services tax exemption certificate on a form provided by the collector in
accordance with the regulations. The exemption certificate shall be
filed with the collector, and if the individual is an employee also with the
individual's employer.
D. If an individual pays the tax and at the end of any tax year has total
income during the tax year that is less than the income exemption
amount, or otherwise qualifies for an exemption, the Township will on
request after the end of tax year refund to the taxpayer the tax paid for
the tax year.
A. Every employer not registered under the provisions of an enactment of
the Township imposing a tax on earned income and net profits shall,
within 30 days after the effective date of this article, or within 30 days

employer's name, address and any other information required by the
collector on an employer registration form prescribed by the collector.
B. Every employer is required to deduct the tax as set forth in the
regulations from any compensation payable to any employee on whom
the tax is imposed, unless the employee has filed a local services tax
exemption certificate in accordance with the regulations. As set forth in
the regulations, the full amount of the tax shall be deducted in lump
sum if the combined municipal and school district tax rate is $10 or
less. As set forth in the regulations, the tax shall be deducted pro rata

D. As to each taxpayer employed at any time after the effective date and on
or before March 31, every employer shall deduct the tax from
compensation payable to the taxpayer as set forth in the regulations,
and shall file a tax return and pay to the collector on or before April 30
the amount of tax deducted on or before March 31. As to each taxpayer
for whom the full amount of the tax has not previously been deducted or
paid directly by the taxpayer to the collector, who is employed at any
time in any of the three-month periods ending June 30, September 30,
and December 31, every employer shall deduct the tax from
compensation payable to the taxpayer as set forth in the regulations,
and shall file a tax return and pay to the collector on or before the
following July 31, October 31, and January 31, the amount of tax
deducted on or before June 30, September 30, and December 31,
respectively. Every employer shall follow this same procedure in every
tax year.
E. If a taxpayer is employed by more than one employer within the
Township, the taxpayer's principal employer shall deduct the tax and
deliver to the employee evidence of the deduction on a form provided by
the collector.

employee who presents evidence on a form provided by the collector of
prior deduction by an employer within the Township, or who provides
evidence on a form provided by the collector of prior payment of the
tax directly to the collector or of prior payment during the same tax
year of $52 as a tax imposed under the enabling act on an individual
based on engaging in an occupation in Pennsylvania.
F. Any employer who discontinues business or ceases operation shall,
within 15 days after discontinuing business or ceasing operations, file a
tax return and pay to the collector the full amount of the tax deducted
from employees prior to ceasing operations.
G. Tax amounts deducted from wages by an employer shall at all times be
the property of the Township, and shall constitute a trust fund held by
the employer until remitted to the collector; and deduction of tax from
wages shall, as between the employee and the Township, constitute
payment of the tax by the employee, regardless of any insolvency or
failure to remit by the employer.
H. Any employer who fails to deduct the tax or who fails to pay the tax to
the collector shall be liable for the tax and applicable penalties in full as
though the tax had originally been imposed against such employer. If
the employer is a partnership, the partners thereof, and if the employer

occupation within the Township at any time after the effective date of this
article and on or before March 31, shall file a tax return and pay the
full amount of the tax to the collector on or before April 30. Every such

in his custody and control setting forth the number of employees subject
to this tax who are in his employment, or whoever fails or refuses to file
any return required by this article commits a violation of this article. If
the Board of Supervisors or the collector determines that a person has
committed or permitted the commission of a violation of this article, the

or a court shall be in addition to any other fine which may be imposed
under any other provisions of the Code of Ordinances of the Township or
under any statute. In default of payment of any fine, such person shall be
liable to imprisonment for not more than 30 days. The action to enforce the

A. In the event that any tax under this article remains due or unpaid, a
penalty of 5% of the amount unpaid for each month or a fraction of a
month during which the amount remains unpaid shall be imposed.

taxes.

owed, the person or entity liable therefor shall, in addition to the
amount owed, pay to the Township, collector, or any other person or
entity appointed to collect the tax the costs of collection, including
reasonable attorney's fees.

article.
§ 246-36. Applicability; validity.
A. Nothing contained in this article shall be construed to empower the

the United States and the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
B. If the tax hereby imposed under the provisions of this article shall be
held to be in violation of the Constitution of the United States or of the

decision shall not affect or impair the right to impose or collect said tax,
or the validity of the tax so imposed, on other persons or individuals as
herein provided.
C. It is the intent of this article that the entire burden of the tax imposed
on an occupation by the Township and the School District shall not
exceed the limitations prescribed in Sections 2 and 8 of the LTEA, 53
P.S. §§ 6902, 6908, and therefore the School District shall be entitled to

This article is enacted under authority of Section 6109(a)(22) of the Vehicle
Code and gives authority to the Township to remove and impound vehicles
that are parked overtime on any street in the Township, or in metered and
unmetered parking lots in the Township, in violation of any provision of this
chapter.
§ 262-27. Authority to remove and impound.
The Township shall have authority to remove and impound or to order
the removal and impounding of any vehicle parked overtime or otherwise
illegally, provided that the circumstances of its parking were within the
conditions stated in § 262-26 of this article and provided that no such
vehicle shall be removed or impounded except in strict adherence to the
provisions of this article.
§ 262-28. Designation of approved storage garages; bonding;
towing and storage.
Removal and impounding of vehicles under this article shall be done only
by approved storage garages that shall be designated from time to time
by the Board of Supervisors. Every such garage shall submit evidence
to the Board of Supervisors that it is bonded or has acquired liability
insurance in an amount satisfactory to the Board of Supervisors as sufficient
to indemnify owners of impounded vehicles against loss or damage to
those vehicles while in the custody of the garagekeeper for the purpose of
towing or storage. The approved storage garage shall submit to the Board
of Supervisors its schedule of charges for towing and storage of vehicles
under this article, and when the schedule is approved by the Board of
Supervisors, those charges shall be adhered to by the approved storage
garage. No different schedule of charges shall be adopted without approval
of the Board of Supervisors, and no different charges shall be demanded of
or collected from any person whose vehicle is removed or impounded under
this article by any approved storage garage. The Board of Supervisors shall
delete from its list of approved storage garages any garage that makes any
unapproved charge in connection with any vehicle removed or impounded
under this article.
§ 262-29. Notification of removal and impounding.
Within 12 hours from the time of removal of any vehicle under authority
granted by this article, notice of the fact that the vehicle was removed shall
be sent by the Township to the owner of record of the vehicle. The notice
shall designate the place from which the vehicle was removed, the reason
for its removal and impounding and the garage in which it was impounded.
§ 262-26 SUBDIVISION AND LAND DEVELOPMENT § 262-30
240:349
§ 262-30. Effect of payment of towing and storage charges.
The payment of any towing and storage charges authorized by this article
shall, unless payment is made under protest, be final and conclusive and
shall constitute a waiver of any right to recover the money so paid. If
payment of any towing or storage charges is made under protest, the
offender shall be entitled to a hearing before a District Justice. Payment
of towing and storage charges shall not relieve the owner or driver of any
vehicle from liability for any fine or penalty for the violation of the provision
of this chapter for which the vehicle was removed or impounded.
§ 262-31. Records of vehicles removed and impounded.
The Township shall cause a record to be kept of all vehicles impounded
under this article and shall be able at all reasonable times to furnish the
owners or the agents of the owners of those vehicles with information as to
the place of storage of the vehicle.
§ 262-32. Restrictions upon removal of vehicles.
No vehicle shall be removed under the authority of this article if, at the
time of the intended removal, the owner or the person for the time being in
charge of the vehicle is present and expresses a willingness and intention
to remove the vehicle immediately.

violation of a provision of this Zoning Ordinance has occurred, the
Zoning Officer or his/her designee shall initiate enforcement

of a violation by the District Justice. If the defendant neither pays
nor timely appeals the judgment, the Township may enforce the
judgment pursuant to the applicable rules of civil procedure. Each
day that a violation continues shall constitute a separate violation,
unless a District Justice determining that there has been a violation
further determines that there was a good faith basis for the person

this chapter or of any of the regulations made pursuant thereto or
any of the permits or certificates of use and occupancy issued
under this chapter or any conditions imposed upon the grant of a
special exception or variance by the Zoning Hearing Board or upon
the grant of a conditional use, then, in addition to any other
remedies provided by law, any appropriate action or proceeding

findings must be made where relevant:
[1] There are unique physical circumstances or conditions
(including irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of lot
size or shape, or exceptional topographical or other
physical conditions peculiar to the particular property)
and that the unnecessary hardship is due to such
conditions and not the circumstances or conditions
generally created by the provisions of this chapter in the
neighborhood or district in which the property is located;
[2] Because of such physical circumstances or conditions,
there is no possibility that the property can be developed
in strict conformity with the provisions of the Zoning
Ordinance and a variance is, therefore, necessary to
enable the reasonable use of the property;
[3] Such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
appellant;
§ 285-11 WEST LAMPETER CODE § 285-11
278:374
[4] The variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the
property is located, nor substantially or permanently
impair the appropriate use or development of adjacent
property, nor be detrimental to the public welfare; and
[5] The variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance that will afford relief and will represent the
least modification possible of the regulation in issue.]
(c) In granting any variance, the Board may attach such
reasonable conditions and safeguards as it may deem
necessary to implement the purposes of this chapter.
(4) Special exception.
(a) The Board shall hear and decide requests for all special
exceptions filed with the Township staff in writing. The Board

Hearing Board may attach such reasonable conditions and
safeguards, in addition to those expressed in the chapter, as it
may deem necessary to implement the purposes and intent of

special exception or conditional use approval) is officially
authorized, then any applicable zoning and building permits shall

ARTICLE III
Districts
§ 285-21. Designation of districts and purposes.
A. For the purpose of this chapter, West Lampeter Township is hereby
divided into the following zoning districts, with the following
abbreviations:
A Agricultural
OSR Residential - Open Space
RR Residential - Rural
R-1 Residential - Low Density
R-2 Residential - Medium Density
R-3 Residential - Medium High Density
RV Residential - Village
MS Main Street
MSL Main Street Limited
CN Commercial - Neighborhood
CH Commercial - Highway
OTR Office/Technology/Residential
I/M Industrial/Mixed Use
B. For the purposes of this chapter, the zoning districts named in
Subsection A shall be of the number, size, shape and location shown on
the Official Zoning Map.
C. Overlay districts. The Floodplain Area, as defined by Article V, shall
serve as an overlay district to the applicable underlying districts.
D. Purposes of each district. In addition to serving the overall purposes
and objectives of this chapter and the Comprehensive Plan, each zoning
district is intended to serve the following purposes:
(1) A Agricultural. To promote the continuation and preservation of
agricultural activities in those areas most suitable for such
activities. This zone also intends to protect and stabilize the
Township's viable agricultural economy by eliminating uses that
are incompatible with farming but permitting limited agricultural
support businesses. Consequently, residential uses are limited and
any future inhabitants in this zone must be willing to accept the
impacts associated with normal farming practices, and related
businesses. Additionally, large-scale and obtrusive uses are
permitted by conditional use, to separate them from the Township's
population concentrations. Finally, it is the intent of this zone to
limit the total number of subdivisions and the maximum lot sizes of
§ 285-21 WEAPONS § 285-21
278:415
nonagricultural uses so as to avoid the creation of farmettes which
reduce the productivity of the Township's agricultural economy.
(2) OSR Open Space Residential District. To provide for development
with a low average intensity in areas that include significant
important natural features, such as wetlands, creeks, flood-prone
lands and steeply sloped areas. To protect the water quality and
habitats along creeks and around lakes and promote groundwater
recharge. To provide incentives and a certain amount of flexibility
in lot layout through conservation-oriented development so that
development can be clustered on the most suitable portions of a
tract of land while avoiding overly intense development.
(3) RR Rural Residential District. To provide for rural types of
development at a lower overall density in a manner that protects
creeks and other natural features. To avoid conflicts with nearby
agricultural areas and recognize sewage limitations.
(4) R-1 Low Density Residential District. To provide for low density
residential neighborhoods that are primarily composed of singlefamily
detached dwellings. To protect these areas from
incompatible uses. To provide incentives and a certain amount of
flexibility in lot layout through the neighborhood design option so
that development can be clustered on the most suitable portions of
a tract of land while still avoiding overly intense development.
(5) R-2 Medium Density Residential District. To provide for medium
density residential neighborhoods with a mix of housing types at a
medium density. To protect these areas from incompatible uses. To
meet requirements of state law to provide opportunities for various
housing types.
(6) R-3 Medium High Density Residential District. To provide
opportunities for a mix of housing types at a medium high density.
(7) RV Residential-Village District. To provide for a mix of housing
types in a manner that promotes a pedestrian- and bicycle-friendly
environment. To promote use of the neighborhood design option.
(8) MS Main Street District. To provide business opportunities while
seeking to develop a central community focus for the Township. To
promote a pedestrian-friendly and bicycle-friendly environment. To
promote an appropriate mix of retail, service, office, public,
institutional and residential uses. To avoid heavy commercial uses
that are most likely to conflict with the historic and scenic
character and most likely to cause conflicts with homes. To
primarily provide for smaller-scale uses that will not be obtrusive in
the landscape and that will not overload the road system. To
carefully locate commercial areas and commercial driveways to
minimize traffic safety and congestion problems along roads.
§ 285-21 WEST LAMPETER CODE § 285-21
278:416
(9) MSL Main Street Limited District. To provide for the preservation
of existing architecturally significant structures within an area
impacted by adjoining roads and businesses. Limited business
opportunities in this District provide for smaller-scale uses that will
not be obtrusive to the neighborhood and existing streetscape, will
promote a mix of compatible uses, and will promote adaptive reuse
of existing structures. Bonus incentives are provided to encourage
adaptive reuse of converted structures, rather than the
construction of new commercial buildings. [Amended 9-9-2013
by Ord. No. 232]
(10)CN Neighborhood Commercial District. To provide for lighter types
of commercial uses that will be compatible with nearby homes.
(11)CH Highway Commercial District. To provide for a variety of
commercial uses along major highways where a variety of
commercial uses are already present. To provide for a wider range
of commercial uses than the CN and MS Districts, including uses
that are more auto-related (such as gas stations). To carefully
locate commercial areas and commercial driveways to minimize
traffic safety and congestion problems along roads.
(12) I/M Industrial/Mixed Use District. To provide for industrial and
certain types of commercial development in a manner that is
compatible with any nearby homes and the surrounding
environment. To carefully control the types of industrial operations
to avoid nuisances and environmental hazards. To encourage
coordinated development, particularly in regard to traffic access.
To recognize that the road system of the Township is only suitable
for types of industries that do not generate large numbers of heavy
truck traffic. To recognize that West Lampeter is not suitable for
large areas of industrial development because of the proximity of
all areas of the Township to homes and creeks. To offer alternatives
for other types of development, such as residential development,
provided that it occurs in a unified manner.
(13)OTR Office/Technology/Residential District. To provide sufficient
space, in appropriate locations, to meet needs for offices and
complementary types of business development. This district is
intended to control the types and intensities of uses to avoid
nuisances and hazards. This district is also intended to provide for
development that will generate additional tax revenue and wider
employment opportunities. This district promotes an attractive,
well landscaped, campus type of business park development that
will aid in attracting new businesses. This district is also intended
to encourage development that uses deed restrictions imposed by
the subdivider as well as interior road systems. This district
promotes landscaped front yards and substantial buffers adjacent
to residential development to attract higher paying jobs to the
Township. To also allow a portion of a tract of land to be used for

§ 285-25. Setbacks across municipal boundaries.
§ 285-26. Table of allowed uses in each zoning district.
A. District boundary lines are intended to follow or be parallel to the
center line of street rights-of-way, streams and railroads, and lot lines
as they existed on a recorded deed or plan of record in the County
Recorder of Deeds' office at the time of the adoption of this chapter,
unless such district boundary lines are fixed by dimensions as shown on
the Official Zoning Map.
B. Where a district boundary is not fixed by dimensions and where it
approximately follows lot lines, such boundary shall be construed to
follow such lot lines unless specifically shown otherwise.
C. The location of a district boundary on unsubdivided land or where a
district boundary divides a lot shall be determined by the use of the
scale appearing on the Zoning Map unless indicated otherwise by
dimensions.
D. Where a municipal boundary divides a lot, the minimum lot area shall
be regulated by the municipality in which the principal use(s) are
located, unless otherwise provided by applicable case law. The land
area within each municipality shall be regulated by the use regulations
and other applicable regulations of each municipality.
A. Intent. To continue the objective of compatible land uses across
municipal boundaries.
B. This chapter requires additional setbacks and the provision of buffer
yards when certain uses would abut an existing dwelling or a
residential zoning district. These same additional setback and buffer
yard provisions shall be provided by uses proposed within West
Lampeter Township regardless of whether such abutting existing
dwelling or principally residential zoning district is located in an
abutting municipality and/or in West Lampeter Township.
A. For the purposes of this § 285-26, the following abbreviations shall have
the following meanings in the Table of Allowed Uses, which follows:
P = Permitted by right use (zoning decision by Zoning
Officer)
SE = Special exception use (zoning decision by Zoning
Hearing Board)
C = Conditional use (zoning decision by Board of
Supervisors)

N = Not permitted
(§ 285-42) = See additional requirements in § 285-42
(§ 285-43) = See additional requirements in § 285-43
B. Unless otherwise provided by state or federal law or specifically stated
in this chapter (including § 285-5B), any land or structure shall only be
used or occupied for a use specifically listed in this chapter as
permitted in the zoning district where the land or structure is located.
Such uses shall only be permitted if the use complies with all other
requirements of this chapter.
(1) See § 285-5B, which generally provides a process for approval of a
use that is not listed, based upon similarity to permitted uses and
other criteria. Except as provided in such § 285-5B, any other
principal use that is not specifically listed as P, C or SE in the
applicable district in this table114 is prohibited in that district.
(2) For temporary uses, see § 285-3.

= Except 40 feet side and 50 feet rear for a principal business use from a directly
abutting principal residential lot in a residential district. A side or rear yard shall
be increased to 100 feet for any new or expanded portion of an industrial building
or tractor-trailer truck loading dock from the lot line of a primarily residential use
in a residential district.
§ 285-27 WEST LAMPETER CODE § 285-27
278:454
NOTES FOR THE ABOVE TABLE:
(Note
B)
= Except if two or more side-by-side off-street parking spaces are located in the front
yard of a townhouse or if garage door(s) for two or more vehicles face onto the
street in the front of the townhouse, then the minimum building width per dwelling
along such street shall be a minimum of 24 feet. A maximum of 50% of the land
area between the front of each townhouse and the right-of-way line shall be used
for vehicle parking and driveways.
(Note
C)
= These provisions are intended to allow flexibility in the placement of individual
dwelling units, regardless of whether the homes are condominium or fee-simple,
and regardless of whether public streets, private streets or parking courts are used.
- The minimum average lot area per dwelling unit establishes the maximum
number of units permitted on a tract of land.
- The minimum average lot area per dwelling unit shall be calculated after
deleting existing street right-of-way of existing streets and alleys, but shall
include: right-of-way of proposed streets and alleys and areas of parking courts,
common open space and stormwater detention basins.
- A golf course (not including areas covered by buildings and paving) may count
towards the common open space, provided that it includes more than 50 acres
of lot area and is preserved by a permanent conservation easement at the time
of development approval.
- See also the applicable standards in § 285-42, which may require common open
space.
(Note
D)
= Setbacks shall be measured from the future/ultimate right-of-way. An unenclosed
front porch or deck may intrude up to 10 feet into the minimum front yard. This
porch or deck may be covered by a roof. Where at least two adjacent buildings
within 100 feet of a property are set back a lesser distance than required, the
average of the lesser distances becomes the required minimum front yard setback
for the property.[Amended 12-10-2007 by Ord. No. 202]
(Note
E)
= See natural feature regulations, including § § 285-28 and 285-30.
(Note
F)
= Additional lot coverage is permitted if pervious materials are utilized; however,
in no case shall a lot exceed twenty-percent lot coverage beyond that which is
specified for impervious coverage (pervious and impervious combined). [Added
12-10-2007 by Ord. No. 202]
(Note
G)
= The rear yard setback in MS and MSL Districts may be reduced to 25 feet for uses
allowed by conditional use if the Board of Supervisors determines in a conditional
use proceeding based upon substantial evidence presented by the applicant that
such reduction is necessary for the reasonable development and use of the lot and
if the lot abuts another commercial use or uses and not a residential use. If the
setback reduction is approved, the setback area between the proposed building and
the lot line must be planted with a vegetative buffer shield satisfactory to the Board
of Supervisors. [Added 12-8-2008 by Ord. No. 210; amended 9-9-2013 by Ord.
No. 232]
§ 285-27 WEAPONS § 285-27

NOTES FOR THE ABOVE TABLE:
(Note
H)
= On lots abutting streets on more than one side, the front setback requirements
shall apply to each of the abutting streets. A principal structure need not be set
back more than the average of the setback of the principal structures on contiguous
abutting lots existing as of the date of the enactment of this chapter. If a vacant lot
exists on one or both sides of the lot, the front yard setback shall not be less than
40 feet.[Added 9-9-2013 by Ord. No. 232]
(Note
I)
= Any new nonresidential principal structure adjacent to an existing residential lot
shall provide a landscape buffer in accordance with § 285-65D(1)-(7) within the
required setback.[Added 9-9-2013 by Ord. No. 232]
(Note
J)
= See § 285-39 for additional requirements in the MSL District.[Added 9-9-2013 by
Ord. No. 232]
B. Height. Except as provided in § 285-64, or as specified otherwise in this
chapter for a particular use, the following maximum structure height
shall apply in all zoning districts:
(1) Any structure that is accessory to a dwelling on a lot of less than
five acres shall have a maximum height of two stories (with the
second story limited to nonhabitable storage areas) or 25 feet,
whichever is more restrictive, and except where a habitable second
story is allowed in a neighborhood design development;
(2) In the OTR District, § 285-38 shall apply; and
(3) The maximum height for any other structure shall be 2.5 stories or
40 feet, whichever is more restrictive.
C. Accessory structures and uses.
(1) Accessory structures and uses shall meet the minimum yard
setbacks provided for in § 285-27A, unless otherwise provided for
in this chapter, including this Subsection C.
(2) The minimum side and rear yard setback apply for a permitted
detached structure that is accessory to a dwelling shall be 10 feet
in the OSR, RR and R-1 Districts and five feet in other districts,
except in the following cases:
(a) The minimum rear setback shall be reduced to three feet for a
residential accessory storage shed having a total floor area of
less than 150 square feet.
(b) A side yard setback is not required for a structure that is
accessory to a dwelling from a lot line along which two
dwellings are attached (such as a lot line shared by twin
dwellings). However, such structure shall still meet the
minimum side yard on a lot line where the dwellings are not
attached.
§ 285-27 WEST LAMPETER CODE § 285-27
278:456
§ 285-28. Wetlands and lakes.
(c) A residential porch or deck that is unenclosed may extend a
maximum of 15 feet into the required rear setback. Such porch
or deck may or may not be covered by a roof or awning. Space
under an unenclosed porch may be used for household storage.
See also Note D of the Table for Dimensional Requirements at
the end of this chapter concerning front yard setbacks.
(d) See § 285-43 for swimming pools.
(e) If any accessory building or pool is constructed adjacent to a
street (such as a rear yard on a lot that is adjacent to a street
along the front lot line and another street along the rear lot
line), then the building or pool shall be separated from such
street by a buffer yard meeting § 285-65.
(3) No accessory structure and no swimming pool shall be allowed
within the front yard except as meeting the following criteria:
[Amended 12-10-2007 by Ord. No. 202]
(a) Minimum lot size of two acres.
(b) Minimum front yard setback for principal buildings: 100 feet.

Zone. In addition, no shrub nor tree shall be planted within 10 and 20
feet, respectively, of any parcel within the Agricultural Zone.
A. Lot area. Wetlands (as officially defined under federal and/or state
regulations), ponds and lakes shall not be counted toward the minimum
lot area of any lot or tract of land. This Subsection A shall only apply to
a lot within a subdivision or land development submitted for approval
after the adoption of this chapter.
B. Wetland studies. It shall be the responsibility of each applicant to
determine whether land areas proposed for alteration meet the federal
or state definition of a wetland prior to submittal of development plans
to the Township. If the Zoning Officer has reason to believe that
wetlands may be present on a site proposed for development or
subdivision, the Zoning Officer may require that the applicant provide a
suitable wetland delineation study prepared by a qualified professional.
C. Wetland setbacks. A minimum setback of 20 feet shall be required
between any new principal building for which a building permit is
issued after the effective date of this chapter and any wetland.
§ 285-27 WEAPONS § 285-29
278:457
§ 285-29. Sewage and water services.
A. Central water service. A use shall not be considered to be served by
Township-approved central water service unless:
(1) All applicable requirements of state regulations and the
Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance115 are met;
(2) The applicant proves to the satisfaction of the Township that there
will be an appropriate system in place to guarantee and properly
fund the long-term operation and maintenance of the system by a
qualified professional operator; and
(3) The applicant proves to the satisfaction of the Township, based
upon review of the Township Engineer, that the system will include
adequate supply, transmission capacity and pressure to serve the
development.
B. Central sewage service. A use shall not be considered to be served by
Township-approved central sewage service unless:
(1) All applicable requirements of state regulations and the
Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance are met;
(2) The applicant proves to the satisfaction of the Township that there
will be an appropriate system in place to guarantee and properly
fund the long-term operation and maintenance of the system by a
qualified professional operator; and
(3) The applicant proves to the satisfaction of the Township, based
upon review of the Township Engineer, that the system will include
adequate treatment capacity and conveyance capacity to serve the
development.
C. On-lot septic systems.
(1) Purpose. To ensure that a suitable location is available for a new
septic system if the original septic system should malfunction.
(2) This Subsection C shall only apply to a lot that is officially
submitted for subdivision or land development approval after the
adoption of this zoning chapter.
(3) Each lot shall include both a primary and a reserve septic system
location. Both locations shall be determined by the Township
Sewage Enforcement Officer to meet Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection regulations for a septic system location
prior to approval of the final subdivision or land development plan.
(4) The requirement for a reserve septic system location shall not
apply to the following:
115. Editor's Note: See Ch. 240, Subdivision and Land Development.
§ 285-29 WEST LAMPETER CODE § 285-29
278:458
(a) A lot of over 10 acres;
(b) The simple merger of two or more existing lots or an
adjustment to lot lines of an existing lot;
(c) A vacant lot that includes a permanent deed restriction or
conservation easement prohibiting any construction of
buildings on the lot; or
(d) Lots within a subdivision or land development that will abut a
complete capped sewage system constructed by the developer,
the design of which has been approved by the Township.
(5) The reserve septic system location shall be kept clear of buildings
and parking and shall be shown on any subsequent applications for
new or expanded buildings or parking. The Township may require
that the location be recorded on the deed.
D. Well and septic system locations. Every plan for a subdivision or land
development and every application for a building permit for a new
principal building that will be served by a well and/or septic system
shall designate the proposed well and primary and alternate septic
system locations.
(1) Such plan shall show that the proposed locations will meet the
minimum isolation distances established by PA DEP regulations
between a well and septic systems on the subject lot and all
adjacent lots.
(2) A plan may show the outer extent of potential well locations instead
of one exact location, provided all of the potential area would still
meet the isolation distance.
(3) If the well or septic system location is proposed to be changed from
the location shown on the submitted plan, then a site plan showing
the revised location shall be submitted for approval by the Zoning
Officer and Sewage Enforcement Officer prior to issuance of the
building permit.
(4) It is requested that well sites be placed in the front yard, thereby
allowing septic systems to be placed in the rear yard. The intent is
to minimize the visibility of any septic mound systems. In addition,
if wells are located in consistent locations within a subdivision, it
will make it easier for adjacent property owners to meet minimum
separation distances between septic systems and wells.
E. Expansion of septic use. If the Zoning Officer has reason to believe that
a proposed increase in the number of dwelling units or expansion or
change of a nonresidential use would result in increased flow to a septic
system, then the application shall be referred to the Sewage
Enforcement Officer. The Sewage Enforcement Officer shall require
§ 285-29 WEAPONS § 285-29
278:459
§ 285-30. Steep slopes.
modification, expansion or replacement of the septic system if
necessary to handle the proposed flow.
A. Purposes. The following provisions are primarily intended to avoid
erosion, sedimentation, stormwater management and winter driving
hazards, particularly considering the Township's climate, in addition to
serving the overall purposes of this chapter.
B. Regrading. Non-man-made slopes of over 15% shall not be regraded
after the adoption of this chapter in such a manner that circumvents the
requirements of this chapter. This section shall not regulate slopes that
were clearly man made prior to the adoption of this chapter.
C. Slopes over 25%. A new principal building shall not be located on a
slope greater than 25%.
D. Single-family dwellings and steep slopes. The following provisions shall
only apply to any lot that is submitted for preliminary subdivision
approval after the effective date of this section or which is submitted for
final subdivision approval if a preliminary plan submittal was not
required, if the lot contains areas with slopes of 15% or greater:
(1) Any lot proposed to be used for a single-family detached dwelling
shall include a proposed building area with a minimum of 4,000
square feet of land area. Such building area shall not include land
area restricted by the minimum yard areas. Such building area
shall contain the proposed location of the dwelling. The dwelling
shall be built within the proposed building area shown on the plan,
except as may be approved under Subsection F.
(a) If such building area for each lot includes an average slope of
greater than 15%, then the minimum lot area shall be two
acres, unless a larger lot area is required by another section of
this chapter.
(b) Through designations on the Township-approved site plan, an
applicant may limit the area upon which new principal
buildings are permitted. By committing to not place a principal
building on slopes over 15%, the applicant can avoid the larger
lot size requirement of this subsection.
(2) Access. Each lot shall be accessible from an existing or proposed
street by means of a driveway with a maximum grade of 15%.
E. Steep slopes and other uses. A lot shall only be used for a building for
principal uses other than single-family detached dwellings if the
proposed building area includes an average slope of less than 15%.
(1) For such uses, the building area shall include locations of all
proposed buildings and parking areas and outdoor storage areas
§ 285-29 WEST LAMPETER CODE § 285-30
278:460
§ 285-31. Open space development option.
and an area 20 feet around buildings, parking and storage areas.
Such building area shall also contain the proposed locations of any
primary and alternate on-lot septic systems.
(2) Access. Each principal building and each parking area shall have
vehicle access from an existing or proposed street by means of a
driveway with a maximum grade of 10%.
F. Changes to building area. The building area may show the outer extent
of areas being considered for a proposed building without showing an
exact location, provided all of those potential areas still meet the
requirements of this section. An applicant may change the proposed
building area after subdivision approval is granted, provided that the
applicant proves that the new building area will still comply with this
section. However, the building area shall not be so large as to attempt
to circumvent the average slope provisions of this section that apply to
a building site.
G. Site plan and tree protection. If an applicant proposes to alter or build
upon slopes of 15% or greater, then a site plan shall be submitted to the
Zoning Officer. A separate site plan is not required if the same
information was included in an approved subdivision or land
development plan.
(1) Site plan. The site plan shall show:
(a) The proposed lot lines;
(b) The existing and proposed contours; and
(c) Existing and proposed building locations and the outer
perimeter of the proposed building area as described above.
(2) Mature trees. Where building or alteration is proposed on slopes of
over 15%, the applicant shall prove to the satisfaction of the Zoning
Officer that the removal of healthy trees with a trunk width of over
six inches (measured at a height 4.5 feet above the ground level)
and other attractive natural vegetation will be minimized. The
Zoning Officer may ask for reviews by the Township Engineer or
Planning Commission. The site plan shall show wooded areas to be
removed or preserved and methods to be used to make sure trees
are protected by temporary fences or other measures during the
construction process.
A. Purposes. To allow reasonable amounts of flexibility in site planning of
residential development to: a) protect environmentally sensitive areas
and avoid severe soil erosion and sedimentation; b) avoid severely
increased stormwater flows and speeds; c) preserve areas of prime
farmland; d) provide additional recreation land; e) steer development to
those areas that are more physically suited for it; f) avoid construction
§ 285-30 WEAPONS § 285-31
278:461
of steep roads that are difficult, time-consuming, and expensive to
maintain and plow snow upon; g) avoid increased use of steep roads
and driveways that are dangerous to drive upon in snow and ice; h)
conserve forested areas that are an important part of the ecological
cycle, providing for groundwater recharge, air pollution reduction and
wildlife habitats; i) reduce construction costs and municipal
maintenance costs; j) provide for transitional forms of development
between residential and agricultural or industrial areas or highways,
with open space serving as a buffer; and k) allow each property owner
a reasonable use of his/her land related directly to the features and
location and accessibility of the land. This option will encourage the
preservation of significant areas of preserved open space.
B. Applicability. This § 285-31 allows an applicant the option to reduce the
minimum lot areas on tracts of land if the applicant proves compliance
with all of the requirements of this § 285-31 to the satisfaction of the
Township.
(1) An open space development is a residential development that
meets the requirements of this § 285-31 and is granted conditional
use approval by the Board of Supervisors as an open space
development. An open space development shall only be allowed in
zoning districts where the use is listed as allowed in § 285-26.
(2) Uses. An open space development shall only include the following
uses: single-family detached dwellings; nature preserves;
Township-owned recreation; recreation uses that the Township
approves to be within the preserved open space; crop farming; a
golf course; utilities necessary to serve the development; and
customary permitted accessory uses. A mobile home/manufactured
home park shall not qualify as an open space development.
(3) A tract may be eligible for approval for an open space development
if it includes a minimum of 10 acres of lot area in common
ownership. Such land area shall be contiguous, except that
portions of the tract may be separated only by existing or proposed
streets or creeks.
(a) The amount of preserved open space shall be based upon the
total lot area of all lots within the development, prior to
subdivision, and prior to deletion of rights-of-way of future
streets and before deleting the area of any environmental
features. Land area of future rights-of-way of existing streets
may be deleted from the total lot area before calculating the
required amount of preserved open space.
[1] Areas that were preserved by a conservation or
agricultural preservation easement or deed restriction
prior to the submittal of the subdivision shall not be
counted towards the area of the tract in calculating
preserved open space or allowed density.
§ 285-31 WEST LAMPETER CODE § 285-31
278:462
(b) Areas used for a principal nonresidential use (other than uses
approved by the Township to be part of the preserved open
space, such as an agricultural barn or golf course) shall not be
included within the land area used to calculate residential
density.
(c) Conservation easements or deed restrictions shall be
established on lots as necessary to make sure that the
maximum density requirement is met over time. Such
conservation easements shall prevent the resubdivision of lots
in a manner that would violate this § 285-31.
(4) An open space development shall be designed as a unified,
coordinated residential development, and shall be approved with a
single development plan proposed by a single development entity.
After final subdivision approval and within an approved
development agreement(s) and phasing plan, portions of the
development may be transferred to different entities, provided that
there is compliance with the approved development plan and this
§ 285-31.
(5) Procedures.
(a) Applicants are strongly encouraged to first submit a layout
plan with the conditional use application before completing
detailed fully-engineered preliminary subdivision plans. This
two-step process will allow the Township and applicant to
mutually agree upon the preserved open space and
development layout before large sums of money are spent by
the applicant on detailed engineering. This two-step process
can reduce the costs of re-engineering to the applicant.
Detailed stormwater, grading, utility, profile and erosion
control plans shall not be required at the conditional use stage
if such matters will be submitted later for the subdivision or
land development approval.
(b) The applicant and Township officials are strongly encouraged
to walk the tract at a time after a detailed existing features
map has been provided to the Township but before the site
layout has been finalized.
(c) An existing features map shall be required to be submitted as
part of the conditional use application for an open space
development. This existing features map shall accurately show
the locations of the following, at a minimum: wetlands; onehundred-
year floodplains; areas of woodland; existing
topography; existing buildings with a description of any
buildings over 70 years old; highlighting of fifteen-to-twentyfive-
percent slopes and twenty-five-percent-and-greater slopes;
and any major scenic views from within the tract or from
outside of the tract.
§ 285-31 WEAPONS § 285-31
278:463
C. Density, open space and lot standards. The maximum number of
dwelling units on the tract shall be determined based upon an existing
features map and a yield plan.
(1) An existing features map shall be required to be submitted as part
of the application for an open space development. This existing
features map shall accurately show the locations of the following,
at a minimum: wetlands; one-hundred-year floodplains; areas of
woodland; existing topography; existing buildings with a
description of any buildings over 70 years old; highlighting of
fifteen-to-twenty-five-percent slopes and twenty-five-percent-andgreater
slopes; and any major scenic views from within the tract or
from outside of the tract.
(2) A yield plan shall be submitted to the Township by the applicant
[except as provided in Subsection C(4) below]. The yield plan shall
accurately show the maximum number of dwelling units that would
be possible under current Township ordinances if the open space
development provisions would not be used and instead the
provisions for conventional development in the applicable zoning
district would be used. The yield plan shall be completed to an
accurate scale, including accurately showing the existing features
map information described above. The yield plan shall show
potential lots, streets and retention/detention pond locations.
However, the yield plan shall not serve as, and is not required to
contain, the engineering detail requirements of a preliminary
subdivision plan.
(3) Such yield plan shall be reviewed by the Zoning Officer, with advice
by the Township Engineer, to determine whether it represents a
reasonably accurate estimate of the number of dwelling units
possible on the site, both physically and legally. If such estimates
are determined to not be accurate, the applicant shall be required
by the Zoning Officer to revise such yield plan until it is accurate.
(a) The maximum number of dwelling units allowed on the tract
through open space development shall be 25% greater than the
number of dwelling units that is determined by the Township to
be possible under the Township-accepted yield plan.
(b) The allowed number of dwelling units may be rounded to the
nearest whole number.
(4) For a tract of over 50 acres in the OSR District, a yield plan is not
required, and instead the maximum density for an open space
development shall be equal to an average of one dwelling unit for
every 2.0 acres of total lot area.
(5) All provisions of the zoning district shall apply, except for
provisions that are specifically modified by this § 285-31. The
following dimensional requirements shall apply, provided that the
total maximum density for the tract is not exceeded.
§ 285-31 WEST LAMPETER CODE § 285-31
278:464
(a) OSR District. Two options are available:
[1] The minimum lot area shall be one acre (43,560 square
feet) if both public water and public sewage services are
not provided. The same yard and other dimensional
requirements shall apply as are provided for conventional
development in the RR District. A minimum of 60% of the
total lot area of the tract (prior to subdivision) shall be
preserved as preserved open space.
[2] If a lot is served by both public water and public sewage
services, then the minimum lot area shall be 12,000 square
feet. The same yard and other dimensional requirements
shall apply as are provided for conventional development
in the R-2 District, except the minimum lot width shall be
80 feet. A minimum of 85% of the total lot area of the tract
(prior to subdivision) shall be preserved as preserved open
space.
(b) RR District. Two options are available:
[1] The minimum lot area shall be one acre (43,560 square
feet) if both public water and public sewage services are
not provided. The same yard and other dimensional
requirements shall apply as are provided for conventional
development in the RR District. A minimum of 40% of the
total lot area of the tract (prior to subdivision) shall be
preserved as preserved open space.
[2] If a lot is served by both public water and public sewage
services, then the minimum lot area shall be 12,000 square
feet. The same yard and other dimensional requirements
shall apply as are provided for conventional development
in the R-2 District, except that the minimum lot width shall
be 80 feet. A minimum of 65% of the total lot area of the
tract (prior to subdivision) shall be preserved as preserved
open space.
(6) Utilities. Any lot of less than one acre shall be served by Townshipapproved
central sanitary sewerage service and central water
service.
(7) Subdivision of part of a tract. This subsection addresses a situation
in which only part of a lot is proposed to be subdivided, and the
applicant at the present time does not intend to subdivide for the
maximum number of dwellings allowed by this section. In such
case, the applicant shall establish a permanent conservation
easement covering preserved open space to comply with this
section. Because only part of the tract is being subdivided, it may
not be necessary to meet the preserved open space requirement
based upon the area of the entire tract.
§ 285-31 WEAPONS § 285-31
278:465
(a) The land under the conservation easement shall be a regular
rectangle in shape and shall be located where it could adjoin
land that would be added as preserved open space in the future
if the total allowed number of dwellings would be developed.
(b) The following hypothetical example assumes a tract includes
50 acres, and the yield plan determines that the applicant for
an open space development is allowed a total of 30 new
dwellings. In this example, the applicant only wishes to
subdivide lots for 10 new dwellings at the present time, which
is 1/3 of the total number of allowed dwellings. At the present
time, only 1/3 of the open space would need to be preserved,
compared to if all of the allowed housing units would be
developed. However, the preserved open space would need to
be placed on the tract at a location where it could be joined by
the remaining acres of land under a conservation easement if
the applicant in the future decided to subdivide lots for the
remaining 20 dwelling units that are allowed.
(8) A minimum of 50% of the required preserved open space shall be in
one contiguous lot, except that the preserved open space may be
separated by creeks, lakes and a maximum of one street.
(a) As part of the conditional use approval, the Board of
Supervisors may approve the following, if the applicant proves
to the satisfaction of the Board of Supervisors that such
configuration would serve the purposes of this section and be
in the best interests of the Township considering the unique
circumstances of the tract:
[1] A reduction of the percentage of the preserved open space
that is in one lot; or
[2] The crossing of the preserved open space by two or more
streets.
(b) An accessway limited to emergency vehicles may also cross the
preserved open space.
(9) The Board of Supervisors may require that the majority of the
required preserved open space be placed:
(a) Adjacent to an existing or planned public or homeowner
association-owned recreation area;
(b) Adjacent to existing farmland;
(c) At the edge of a neighboring undeveloped lot, where the
preserved open space could be connected in the future to open
space on that neighboring lot; or
(d) Adjacent to an arterial street or expressway where the open
space will serve to buffer homes from the traffic.
§ 285-31 WEST LAMPETER CODE § 285-31
278:466
D. Conditions for approval. An open space development shall only be
approved if the applicant proves to the satisfaction of the Board of
Supervisors, based upon review by the Planning Commission, that the
following additional conditions will be met:
(1) That the open space development would clearly serve a valid public
purpose that would result in a development that would be superior
to what would result if the land would be developed as a
conventional development. Such valid public purposes include but
are not limited to the following:
(a) The permanent preservation of dense forests, steep slopes,
wetlands, creek valleys, highly scenic areas or other sensitive
natural features.
(b) The permanent preservation of a substantial area of land in
agricultural uses, in a tract of proper size and configuration
that allows for efficient agricultural use and that properly
considers the issue of compatibility between the agricultural
uses and homes. In such case, new dwellings shall be clustered
adjacent to existing dwellings and residential zoning districts.
(c) The dedication of recreation land at a site deemed appropriate
by the Board of Supervisors and that involves land that is
clearly suitable for active and/or passive recreation.
(d) The provision of preserved open space in a location that will
allow homes to be buffered from highly noxious nuisancegenerating
uses, such as a heavily traveled street, or industrial
uses. In such case, intensive landscaping and/or planting for
eventual reforestation should be provided.
(2) The applicant shall prove that the proposed open space
development has been designed in full consideration of important
natural features, including mature woodlands, creek valleys, steep
slopes and wetlands.
(a) At a minimum, the applicant shall prove that areas along
perennial creeks shall be preserved in their natural state,
except for landscaping, erosion control improvements, public
recreation improvements and needed utility, street and
driveway crossings. Low-maintenance landscaping is
encouraged along creeks and other areas where maintenance
would otherwise be difficult.
(b) The natural features of the site shall be a major factor in
determining the siting of dwelling units and streets.
(3) The Township may require the use of conservation easements
within an open space development to limit the disturbance of
natural slopes over 15%, wetlands, mature forests, creek valleys
and other important natural features.
§ 285-31 WEAPONS § 285-31
278:467
E. Preserved open space.
(1) Preserved open space. The minimum amount of preserved open
space shall be provided, which shall meet the requirements of this
chapter and the definition in § 285-20 of "open space, preserved."
(a) The preserved open space requirements of this § 285-31 shall
be in addition to the recreation land or fee-in-lieu of land
requirements of the Township Subdivision and Land
Development Ordinance (SALDO), unless the applicant proves
to the satisfaction of the Board of Supervisors, at the time of
conditional use approval, that the proposed preserved open
space would include suitably improved land that will meet the
intent of the recreation land requirements of the SALDO.
(2) Open space standards. Required preserved open spaces shall meet
all of the following requirements:
(a) Preserved open space shall be permanently deed-restricted or
protected by an appropriate conservation easement to prevent
the construction of buildings or the use for any nonagricultural
commercial purposes or the use of the land for clear-cut
forestry. Land approved as required preserved open space
shall only be used for noncommercial active or passive
recreation, a noncommercial community center for meetings
and recreation, a Christmas tree farm, a golf course, a nature
preserve, a horse farm, a wholesale plant nursery, crop farming
and/or another Township-approved agricultural use.
(b) Improvements to open spaces. Where preserved open space is
proposed to be used for recreation and/or dedicated to the
Township, the application shall include a detailed and legally
binding (if approved) description of what improvements the
applicant will make to any land to make it suitable for its
intended purpose.
[1] Examples of such improvements include preservation and
planting of trees, development of trails, stabilization of
creek banks, removal of undesirable vegetation, and
grading of land for recreation (such as a free play field for
youth).
[2] Type of maintenance. The subdivision plan shall state the
intended type of maintenance of the open space, such as
lawn areas that are regularly mowed or natural areas for
passive recreation that are intended for minimal
maintenance.
(c) All proposed preserved open space shall be cleared of
construction debris, materials from illegal dumping and any
rocks that were not naturally on the land, unless those rocks
are incorporated into landscaping improvements.
§ 285-31 WEST LAMPETER CODE § 285-31
278:468
(d) The applicant shall prove that all required preserved open
space would be suitable for its intended and Townshipapproved
purposes. The Township may require the provision of
a trail easement and/or the construction of a recreation trail
through preserved open space. If a developer will install a trail,
it shall be completed prior to the final sale of any adjacent
residential lots.
(e) Lots and preserved open spaces shall be located to promote
pedestrian and visual access to preserved open spaces
whenever possible.
(f) Sufficient access points from each preserved open space shall
be provided to streets for pedestrian access and maintenance
access. The Board of Supervisors may require that
maintenance and/or pedestrian access points be paved and be
up to eight feet in width, meeting Township standards for a
bike path. Maintenance access points shall be of a slope that is
suitable for access by vehicles and equipment.
(3) Open space ownership. The method(s) to be used to own, preserve
and maintain any preserved open space shall be acceptable to the
Township. The Township shall only approve an open space
development if the applicant proves there will be an acceptable
method to ensure permanent ownership, preservation and
maintenance of land that will not be included in individual home
lots.
(a) The method of ownership and use of any required preserved
open space shall be determined prior to preliminary
subdivision or land development approval. The Township
should be given right of first refusal at the time of such review
to accept proposed open space as public open space. The
Township shall only accept ownership of open space if the
Board of Supervisors has agreed in writing in advance to
accept such ownership. If the preserved open space will not be
owned by the Township, then the preserved open space shall
be permanently preserved by one or a combination of the
following methods that are found to be acceptable to the Board
of Supervisors:
[1] Dedication to the county as public open space, if the
County Commissioners agree in writing to such
dedication.
[2] Dedication to the school district if such Board of Education
agrees in writing to accept such dedication and to use and
maintain the land for school recreation, public recreation,
environmental education and/or related open space.
[3] Dedication to a homeowners' association as preserved
open space, with the homeowners legally bound to pay
§ 285-31 WEAPONS § 285-31
278:469
fees for the maintenance and other expenses of owning
such land, and with such homeowners' association being
incorporated with covenants and bylaws providing for the
filing of assessments and/or municipal liens for the
nonpayment of maintenance costs for preserved open
space that is not publicly owned.
[a] Such responsibilities shall be specified as part of each
deed prior to sale of each lot or dwelling unit. The
Township may delay a dedication of maintenance
responsibilities by a developer to a homeowners'
association until such association is incorporated and
able to maintain such land.
[4] Dedication of the land to an established nature
conservation organization acceptable to the Board of
Supervisors for maintenance as a nature preserve or
passive recreation area.
[5] Dedication of a permanent conservation easement that
results in the land being used for a Township-approved
agricultural use, such as crop farming, a tree farm or a
horse farm, and which may include one of the allowed
dwelling units on the lot.
[6] Dedication to the State Game Commission, State Fish and
Boat Commission or similar public agency, if such agency
agrees in writing in advance to accept the dedication and
to maintain the land for public recreation.
[7] Operation as a bona fide golf course, with a minimum lot
area of 50 acres. Areas including buildings or vehicle
parking shall not count towards the minimum preserved
open space.
(b) Legal documents providing for ownership and/or maintenance
of required preserved open space shall be reviewed by the
Township Solicitor and be subject to approval by the Board of
Supervisors prior to recording of the final plan.
(c) A legally binding system shall be established to oversee and
maintain land that will not be publicly owned. The applicant
shall prove compliance with state law governing homeowners'
associations. Proper notations shall be required on the
recorded plan. For example, if the preserved open space is
intended to be owned by a homeowners' association as
recreation land, a statement should be included that the
designated open space "shall not be further subdivided and
shall not be used for the construction of any nonrecreation
buildings."
§ 285-31 WEST LAMPETER CODE § 285-31
278:470
§ 285-32. Setback from water bodies.
§ 285-33. Optional transfer of development rights (TDR).
F. Steep slopes. Within an open space development, no principal building
shall be placed on slopes of over 25%.
G. Phasing. The development shall include a phasing system that shall be
approved by the Board of Supervisors. Such phases shall ensure that
the requirements of this article would be met after the completion of
any one phase, and that the development could properly function
without the construction of additional phases.
H. Landscaping plan. An application for an open space development
involving over 30 acres shall include a landscape planting and
preservation plan prepared by a registered landscape architect.
(1) Such plan shall show the locations, general species and initial sizes
of landscaping to be planted within the preserved open space and
throughout the tract.
(2) Such plan shall also show that existing substantial healthy trees
will be preserved to the maximum extent reasonable. The methods
to ensure preservation during construction shall be described.
(3) Landscaping shall also be used as appropriate to filter views of
denser housing from any adjacent housing that is less dense.
A. No buildings, vehicle parking, driveways or business outdoor storage
shall be located within 75 feet from any of the following: 1) the average
water level of the Conestoga River; 2) the center of the bed of any other
perennial creek; or 3) the average water level of a pond or lake.
B. This additional setback shall not apply to boat ramps or boat or canoe
storage.
A. Purposes. In addition to serving the overall purposes of this chapter,
this section is intended to:
(1) Encourage the permanent preservation of important farmland and
environmentally sensitive areas;
(2) Direct growth to locations where public water and sewerage
services are available; and
(3) Provide a voluntary method for landowners to be compensated by
the free market to preserve their land.
B. Definitions.
(1) Sending property: A lot(s) or portion of a lot that is restricted by a
conservation easement or farmland preservation easement as a
§ 285-31 WEAPONS § 285-33
278:471
condition of approval of a higher density on the receiving property
than would otherwise be permitted.
(2) Receiving property: A lot(s) that is approved to permit a higher
density than would otherwise be permitted as a condition of the
restriction of development on the sending property.
C. Granting of transferable development rights in the sending area.
(1) A sending property shall be within the A, OSR or RR District. A
sending property shall have a minimum area of 10 acres.
(2) Transferable development rights are not granted to:
(a) Tracts of land or portions thereof owned by or subject to
easements (including, but not limited to, easements of roads,
railroads, electrical transmission lines and water, gas or
petroleum pipelines) in favor of governmental agencies,
utilities and nonprofit corporations; and/or
(b) Land restricted from development by covenant, easement or
deed restriction, unless and until such time as said covenant,
restriction or easement is dissolved or rescinded. In the event
said covenant, restriction or easement is dissolved or
rescinded, such land shall be eligible for issuance of
transferable development rights.
D. Progress of conveyance of a transferable development right from the
sending area. Transferable development rights shall be sold and/or
donated to any party, subject to the following:
(1) Application materials. Application shall be made on a form
developed for and by the Township, which shall be signed by the
transferor and the transferee. Along with said application form, the
following shall be submitted:
(a) A metes and bounds description of the property of the owner of
the land from which the rights will be transferred and a plot
plan or survey thereof, subject to easements in favor of
governmental agencies, utilities, and nonprofit corporations,
land restricted against development by covenant, easement or
deed restrictions, and any area devoted to non-farm use.
(b) A yield plan prepared in accordance with Subsection E below.
(c) If the proposed conveyance entails less than an entire parcel,
the portion of the parcel from which the development rights
are transferred shall be clearly identified on a plan of the
entire parcel, drawn to scale, the accuracy of which shall be
satisfactory to the Township. Such plan shall also include a
notation of: 1) the number of development rights applicable to
the entire parcel; 2) the number of development rights
applicable to the identified portion of the parcel from which the
§ 285-33 WEST LAMPETER CODE § 285-33
278:472
development rights are to be transferred; and 3) the number
of development rights which remain available to the remaining
portion of the parcel.
(d) A title search of the tract from which the transferable
development rights will be conveyed sufficient to determine all
owners of the tract and all lienholders.
(e) A copy of the proposed deed of transferable development
rights and a copy of the proposed conservation easement, as
regulated by § 285-33 of this chapter
(2) Review and determination. Upon complete submission as required
above, the Zoning Officer shall determine the number of
transferable development rights which shall be permitted to be
conveyed from the sending property. The Zoning Officer shall also
determine, with the advice of the Township Solicitor and/or the
Township Engineer, the sufficiency of: a) the plan indicating the
portion of the parcel restricted from future development if the
development rights from less than the entire parcel shall be
conveyed; b) the conservation easement; and c) the deed of
transferable development rights. The Zoning Officer shall inform
the transferor and the transferee of the development rights of his/
her determination in writing. Any appeals from the determination
of the Zoning Officer shall be made in accordance with the
provisions of § 285-11D of this chapter.
(3) Donation of intermediaries. The right to develop a sending property
may be purchased by or donated to the Township, the county or an
established incorporated nonprofit organization whose mission
includes preservation of agricultural land or natural features. A
permanent conservation easement shall be established on the
sending property at the time of such purchase or donation. In such
case, the right to develop such dwelling units may be held for a
maximum of 10 years before being used on a receiving
property(ies).
(4) Upon receipt of written approval by the Zoning Officer, as provided
in § 285-33D(2), the transferor and transferee may present the
Township with the deed of transferable development rights for
endorsement as required by the Municipalities Planning Code
§ 619.1(c). No deed of transferable development rights shall be so
endorsed until the Township is presented with evidence that the
conservation easement has been approved by the Township and has
been recorded with the Lancaster County Recorder of Deeds. In
lieu of presentation of proof of recording the conservation
easement, the fully executed conservation easement may be
presented to the Township when the deed of transferable
development rights is presented for endorsement and the
Township, at the applicant's expense, shall record both documents.
§ 285-33 WEAPONS § 285-33
278:473
E. Determination of number of transferable development rights
attributable to sending property.
(1) Yield plans shall be presented by the applicant. One yield plan shall
be presented for the receiving property and one for the sending
property. Such yield plans shall be a level of detail typically found in
a sketch plan, including showing potential lots and roads, steep
slopes, one-hundred-year floodplains and suspected wetlands. Such
yield plans shall estimate the number of new dwelling units that
could be lawfully constructed on each property under Township
regulations without any transfer of development rights. Detailed
septic percolation tests are not required for such sketches, but new
septic systems shall not be assumed to be possible in areas with
severe soil and slope limitations.
(2) Such yield plans shall be reviewed by the Zoning Officer, with
advice by the Township Engineer, to determine whether each
represents a reasonably accurate estimate of the number of
dwelling units possible on each site, both physically and legally. If
such estimates are determined to be accurate, the applicant shall
be required by the Zoning Officer to revise such yield plan until it is
accurate.
(3) Based upon the yield plans, permission to develop the allowed
number of dwelling units may be transferred from the sending
property to the receiving property.
F. Use of property after conveyance of TDRs is approved. The owner
conveying transferable development rights from the sending area shall,
by conservation easement, perpetually restrict the use of the parcel or
portion thereof from which transferable development rights are
conveyed. Such conservation easement shall be in a form approved by
the Township Solicitor and shall restrict future use of the site to
principal agricultural or conservation use and any accessory
agricultural uses, as determined by this chapter.
(1) All conservation easements shall designate the Township as a thirdparty
beneficiary of the restrictions imposed upon the transferor
and his/her land. Such restrictions shall be enforceable by the
Township as such third-party beneficiary.
(2) Land from which transferable development rights have been
conveyed shall continue to be owned, subject to said restrictions by
the landowner, his/her heirs, executors, administrators, successors
and/or assigns.
(3) If the development rights are conveyed from less than the entire
parcel, the plan prepared in accordance with Subsection D(1)(c)
above shall be attached to and recorded with the conservation
easement. All owners of the tract from which transferable
development rights are conveyed shall execute the conservation
easement. All lienholders of the tract from which transferable
§ 285-33 WEST LAMPETER CODE § 285-33
278:474
development rights are conveyed shall execute a joinder and/or
consent to the conservation easement. [Amended 12-10-2007 by
Ord. No. 202]
G. Process by which TDRs are applied to a receiving property. A receiving
property shall be within a neighborhood design option development
(NDO) in a district that allows NDO development. Transferable
development rights may only be used to increase the permitted density
of a NDO development. When transferable development rights have
been acquired by the transferee for the purposes of assignment to a
receiving property, the following shall apply. [Amended 12-10-2007
by Ord. No. 202]
(1) Effect of use of TDRs on receiving property. For each transferable
development right that is approved for conveyance, the transferee
is entitled an increase in permitted density as follows:
(a) For each dwelling unit that would have otherwise been allowed
on the sending property, one additional dwelling unit may be
approved on the receiving property. However, as an incentive
to promote agricultural preservation, for each dwelling unit
that would have been allowed in the A District, three dwelling
units shall be allowed on the receiving property.
(b) If, for example, the yield plan determines that 10 new dwelling
units would be allowed under the current zoning on the
sending property, and the sending property will be preserved
by a conservation easement, then the right to develop 30
additional dwelling units shall be transferred to the receiving
property. [Amended 12-10-2007 by Ord. No. 202]
(c) The receiving property shall be permitted to include the
increased total number of dwelling units above the number
that would otherwise be permitted, as approved by the
Township based upon the yield plan. However, in no case shall
the maximum density with incentives be exceeded, as provided
for a NDO development in § 285-34.
(d) The development of the receiving property shall still comply
with all other requirements of this chapter, except for the
maximum density, which shall be regulated by this section and
the NDO provisions.
(e) Utilities. To receive a transfer of development rights, any lot
that includes less than one acre per dwelling unit on the
receiving property shall be served by Township-approved
central sanitary sewerage service and central water service.
(f) The transfer of development rights shall not be combined with
reduced lot sizes and other incentives concerning open space
development.
§ 285-33 WEAPONS § 285-33
278:475
(2) Application materials. The transferee shall submit:
(a) A preliminary subdivision or land development plan, prepared
in accordance with the latest version of the Township
Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance. The
preliminary plan must indicate: 1) that transferable
development rights are to be used; 2) the base permitted
density allowed for the site; 3) the proposed density of the site;
and 4) the number of transferable development rights to be
applied to the site.
(b) An agreement of conveyance for the development rights
between: 1) the owner of the tract to which development rights
have been granted, or the owner of development rights which
have been previously severed from the tract in the sending
areas, as evidenced by a recorded deed of transferable
development rights; and 2) the owner of the tract proposed to
be developed with the transferred development rights. The
agreement may be contingent upon approval of a final
subdivision or land development plan of the tract to which the
transferable development rights are to be conveyed.
(c) If the use of transferable development rights which were
previously severed from a tract in the sending area is
proposed, a title search of such previously severed
transferable development rights.
(d) As part of a TDR, the development of the receiving property
shall comply with all Township requirements, except for
provisions specifically modified by this section.
(3) Review, approval and recording of TDRs applied to a receiving
property. No final plan for any subdivision or land development
which utilizes transferable development rights shall be executed on
behalf of the Township until the Township has been presented with
a copy of the recorded deed of transferable development rights and
the recorded conservation easements with the customary
recording information of the Office of the Recorder of Deeds in and
for Lancaster County clearly endorsed thereon. In lieu of
presentation of proof of recording the executed deed of
transferable development rights and the fully executed
conservation easement may be presented to the Township with the
deed of transferable development rights for endorsement, and the
Township, at the applicants expense, shall record both documents
and then shall execute and, if applicant so desires, at applicants
expense, shall record the final plan.
H. Public acquisition of TDRs. The Township may purchase development
rights and may accept ownership of transferable development rights
through transfer by gift. All such TDRs may be resold or retired by the
§ 285-33 WEST LAMPETER CODE § 285-33
278:476
§ 285-34. Neighborhood design option (NDO).
Township. Any such purchase or gift shall be accompanied by a
Township-approved conservation easement.
I. Reservation of Township rights. The Township reserves the right to
amend this chapter in the future, and the Township expressly reserves
the right to change the manner in which the number of development
rights shall be apportioned to a tract in the sending area, the manner in
which development rights may be attached to land within the receiving
area, the locations of the sending area and the receiving areas and the
procedure by which development rights can be conveyed.
(1) The Township further expressly reserves the right to terminate its
TDR program at any time. No landowner or owner of development
rights shall have any claim against the Township for damages
resulting from a change in this chapter relating to the regulations
governing the apportionment transfer and use of development
rights or the abolition of the TDR program.
(2) If the TDR program is abolished by the Township, no developer may
attach development rights to any tract in the receiving area after
the effective date of the ordinance abolishing the TDR program
unless an application in conformity with the provisions of this
section was filed prior to the effective date of such ordinance.
A. Purposes. To encourage innovation and to promote flexibility, economy
and ingenuity in development consistent with the provisions of Articles
VI and VII-A of the State Municipalities Planning Code and the
community development objectives of this chapter and the
Comprehensive Plan. The purposes of Articles VI and VII-A of the State
Municipalities Planning Code are hereby incorporated by reference.
The provisions of this § 285-34 represent an optional form of
development and shall only be allowed if a development will achieve the
following purposes and objectives:
(1) Directing growth to areas of the Township which are the most
appropriate for development.
(2) Reducing infrastructure costs by minimizing the amount of
infrastructure necessary to adequately support new development.
(3) Providing a more efficient, varied and, most importantly, innovative
development pattern.
(4) Establishing a pedestrian-oriented community that accommodates
and encourages pedestrian and other multi-modal travel
alternatives by including sidewalks, greenways, bike paths, and/or
trails. The inclusion of a limited amount of community services and
civic uses may also be incorporated to facilitate pedestrian access
and limit motor vehicle trips.
§ 285-33 WEAPONS § 285-34
278:477
(5) Making public transit a viable alternative by encouraging
development at appropriate densities with flexible building
arrangements not afforded by conventional lot-by-lot development.
(6) Fostering a sense of community through development of
recognizable neighborhoods and direct access to public spaces
such as centrally located public commons, greens, squares or
prominent scenic vistas.
(7) Encouraging development that complements rather than
eliminates the distinctive resources of the site, including
woodlands, wetlands, stream corridors, historical and cultural
resources, steep slopes, scenic viewsheds, and prime agricultural
soils.
(8) Providing opportunities to integrate age and income groups
through the provision of a wide range of housing alternatives that
are suitably mixed within the development.
(9) Promoting development that, through the use of distinctive
architectural elements and siting criteria, creates community
character that complements the historic development style of
Lancaster County and the Township.

improvements acceptable to the Board of Supervisors or unless
such land is, in the opinion of the Board of Supervisors,
integrated and integral to the overall common open space
design.
(4) Each neighborhood development shall be provided with at least one
green containing not less than 10,000 square feet. The size of the
green shall be increased to a minimum of 15,000 square feet for a
development of 51 to 149 dwelling units, and a minimum of 20,000
square feet for a development of 150 or more dwelling units. Other

where both end walls contain windows may be reduced to a
minimum of 20 feet.
(c) A minimum yard space of 30 feet is required between end walls
and front or rear faces of buildings.
K. Neighborhood centers. Each neighborhood development shall include a
minimum of one neighborhood center. Each neighborhood center shall
comply with the following:
(1) Uses are limited to those that residents are likely to need on a daily
or regular basis.
(2) The overall size and type of each use within the neighborhood
center is restricted to prevent the establishment of intensive
commercial-type facilities that exceed the local orientation. See
maximum size of commercial establishments in Subsection H.

(5) All neighborhood centers shall be provided with convenient
pedestrian access. Any necessary off-street parking facilities shall
be located to the side or rear of the principal building.
(6) The adaptive use of historical structures on the neighborhood
development tract is a preferred option for the siting of a
neighborhood center. However, when new construction must be
§ 285-34 WEST LAMPETER CODE § 285-34
278:490
undertaken, the design of such structure(s) shall not detract from
the community character of the neighborhood development and the
surrounding area.
(7) The applicant may initially use the neighborhood center as a sales
office. If the applicant uses the neighborhood center as a sales
office, the applicant shall ensure that not less than 50% of the floor

shall be provided either on the neighborhood/commercial center lot
or in designated on-street or off-street parking areas within 500
feet of the neighborhood/commercial center buildings or by a
combination thereof.
(a) As part of the conditional use process, the Board of
Supervisors may reduce the amount of required off-street
parking for principal nonresidential uses by up to 10% if three
or more principal nonresidential uses will share the same
parking area.
(3) Where necessary, parking requirements may be met through the
provision of off-street parking compounds. No more than 50% of
the required parking should be provided by means of off-street
parking lots. When required to accommodate the parking
requirements of any specific use, off-street parking lots shall be
located to the side or rear of the buildings they are intended to
serve. The size and/or location of parking lots shall not compromise
the design or interfere in any manner with provision of pedestrian
access. All nonresidential uses shall adequately accommodate both
handicap parking and bicycle parking.
M. Architectural guidelines. It is not the intent of the Board of Supervisors
to dictate architectural styles. However, a set of standards shall be
§ 285-34 WEAPONS § 285-34
278:491
chosen by the applicant and adhered to consistently throughout the
development. Standards selected shall enhance the design objectives
and goals as specified by Subsection A. See submission requirements in
Subsection E(6).
(1) Architectural guidelines shall be established and approved as a
condition of the conditional use approval. The applicant shall
submit a set of guidelines which shall include styles, proportions,
massing and detailing. To the extent necessary on each site, these
features shall be compatible with the design of historical resources
on and adjacent to the neighborhood development tract. The
architectural guidelines shall be recorded with or be part of
documentation imposing covenants and conditions upon the
neighborhood development. The architectural guidelines shall
include, but not be limited to, provisions to avoid monotony in
architectural designs, to establish minimum roof pitches, to
address window sizes and to address front porches.
N. Overall development form. In meeting the design objectives and goals
specified by Subsection A, new construction shall, to the greatest extent
possible, be sited so as to preserve natural vistas and existing resources
of the neighborhood development tract as delineated by the required
site plan.
(1) Components of the neighborhood development shall be designed in
a pattern of blocks and interconnecting streets and alleys, defined
by buildings, street furniture, landscaping, sidewalks, on-street
parking, and public space.

(4) Any street, lane or alley that may be allowed to have a cartway
width of less than 20 feet shall be maintained by a homeowners'
association. The Township is under no obligation to accept the
dedication of any street, lane or alley.
P. Sidewalks. Sidewalks are to be provided on both sides of all streets
within the neighborhood development as well as along existing streets
connecting the neighborhood development to existing or future
development adjacent to the neighborhood development tract.
(1) Sidewalks shall be no less than four feet wide in residential areas
and no less than five feet wide in areas providing access to

Rose Transit Authority (RRTA) bus route, a transit shelter and bench
shall be provided. A bus pullout lane shall also be provided to
accommodate the safe boarding of passengers and smooth transition of
traffic. Where the neighborhood development has been designed to
provide one or more through-street connections, the provision of
multiple transit sites may be warranted. If RRTA notifies the Township
that it will provide service within the neighborhood development tract
prior to approval of a final subdivision or land development plan, the
applicant shall provide a transit site to serve the neighborhood center
or, if more than one neighborhood center building is constructed, to
serve the neighborhood development center building selected by RRTA
or the Board of Supervisors.
R. Shade trees and street plantings. Shade trees shall be provided and
installed in accordance with the required landscaping plan. At a
§ 285-34 WEST LAMPETER CODE § 285-34

standards of § 240-33C of the Subdivision and Land Development
Ordinance.
(3) Street plantings may be used to complement the street tree and
landscaping requirements within public areas not included within
the common open space. If permanent containers are used to
accommodate such plantings, they shall contain vegetation which
is hardy in all seasons or shall be replanted according to the change
in seasons. The perpetual care and maintenance of such plantings
shall be the responsibility of the entity responsible for the common
open space.
(4) Alleys or other rear access to residential units shall not be required
to provide either sidewalks or street trees.
S. Incentives. Neighborhood developments which incorporate one or more
of the following elements shall qualify for reductions in the percentage
of common open space required, or an increase in the permitted density
of a neighborhood development, or other modification of the
requirements as specified herein. In no event shall density exceed the
maximum density with density incentives as set forth in Subsection J.
(1) For every two-percent increase in the number of single-family
detached dwelling units which meet the requirements of
Subsection I(1)(a), the density of the neighborhood development
may be increased by 0.1 dwelling units per acre, up to a maximum
increase of 0.3 dwelling units per acre.
(2) For every ten-percent increase in the total percentage of dwelling
units designed to permit individual conveyance beyond the
minimum established in Subsection J, the density of the
neighborhood development may be increased by 0.1 dwelling unit
per acre, up to a maximum increase of 0.3 dwelling units per acre.
(3) The minimum amount of the tract that is provided in common open
space may be reduced from 45% to 30% through use of the
following incentives:
(a) If the applicant provides evidence to the Board of Supervisors
that improvements will be provided to active recreational
§ 285-34 WEAPONS § 285-34
278:495
areas, such as construction of specific equipment, athletic
courts or fields, or jogging/stretching/fitness stations, the
Board of Supervisors may approve a reduction in the required
common open space by up to a maximum of 5%. The amount
of the reduction shall be dependent upon the extent of the
proposed improvements.
(b) If the applicant provides evidence that improvements will be
provided to passive recreational areas, such as extensive
landscaping beyond the minimum requirements, fountains,
benches, ADA-compliant trail surfacing or educational signage
related to natural or historic features, then each type of such
amenity provided shall qualify for consideration of a decrease
in the required common open space by 1%, with the total
reduction of common open space not to exceed 5%.
(c) If the applicant proves to the satisfaction of the Board of
Supervisors that the common open space layout and
improvements will protect and make available for public visual
and active enjoyment natural vistas, overlooks, watercourses
and wooded areas (which are in excess of 10,000 contiguous
square feet), then the Board of Supervisors may approve a
reduction in the required common open space by a maximum
of up to 5%.
(4) Subsection N(2) above includes provisions regarding the location
of driveways. The following is an incentive above that requirement.
This incentive shall apply if a minimum of 50% of the dwelling units
shall be provided with all vehicle garage(s) that are accessed from
the rear or that enter the garage from a side street or that have a
one-lane driveway leading to vehicle garages that are located a
minimum of 60 feet from the street and are designed to minimize
their visual impact from the street. If such 50% minimum is met,
then the density of the tract may be increased by 0.2 dwelling units
per acre. Alternatively, if a minimum of 70% of the dwelling units
meet such standard, then the density of the tract may be increased
by 0.4 dwelling units per acre.
(5) If a transfer of development rights is approved under § 285-33,
then the density of the neighborhood development may be
increased up to the maximum density with incentives. The amount
of dwelling units that are allowed to be transferred shall be
determined by § 285-33.
(6) Workforce housing is defined as dwelling units that meet the
standards of this Subsection S(6). If a neighborhood development
will include a minimum of 10% of the total dwelling units that are
be sold or leased as workforce housing, then a density bonus shall
be allowed. Such density bonus shall result in an ability to build two
additional dwelling units for every workforce housing dwelling
unit, up to the maximum density allowed by Subsection J using
§ 285-34 WEST LAMPETER CODE § 285-34
278:496
density incentives. Such dwelling units shall only be sold, leased or
subleased to individual(s) within a household that has an income
of less than 80% of the Lancaster County median income for
households as determined by the most recent data issued by the
United States Census Bureau. The census median income data
shall be increased by a standard U.S. government measurement of
inflation to update the median income to the present.
(a) The restriction upon the workforce housing shall continue for
15 years after each dwelling unit is initially occupied. The
restriction upon the workforce housing shall apply at the time
of the initial sale or lease of the dwelling units and any
subsequent sale, lease or sublease of the dwelling units. The
income determination shall be based upon the income of the
inhabitants of the dwelling unit during the previous calendar
year.
(b) The applicant shall, as part of its conditional use application,
provide documentation as to how this program shall be funded,
monitored, implemented and enforced and shall agree that the
program conditions and requirements will be made a condition
of conditional use approval under Article I. Applicants are
encouraged to propose to involve a third-party nonprofit
organization in overseeing compliance with this section, with
that organization responsible to periodically certify compliance
in writing to the Zoning Officer.
(c) The proposed workforce housing shall be integrated
throughout the development, as opposed to being isolated to
one area of land. In addition to complying with the
architectural guidelines established per Subsection M, the
workforce housing dwelling units shall be, to the greatest
extent possible, indistinguishable as viewed from the front
from other dwelling units within the development.
(d) This Subsection S(6) shall not by itself limit the sales price or
rental price of a dwelling unit.
(e) At the time of initial occupancy, a minimum of 50% of the
workforce housing dwelling units shall be available for
purchase as opposed to lease.

§ 285-34 WEST LAMPETER CODE § 285-34
278:500
deferred by the Board of Supervisors from the preliminary
subdivision plan stage to the final plan stage if the applicant
makes a legally binding commitment that no construction and
no major grading will begin until after final plan approval is
granted.
(4) Provided that any change is approved under the Subdivision and
Land Development Ordinance, an applicant may make minor
revisions to the neighborhood development site plan without
needing an additional conditional use approval for the following
changes:
(a) Alteration of any of the following items:
[1] Increase in the number of dwelling units or decrease in the
number of dwelling units not in excess of 10%.
[2] Change in the percentage or mix of each type of dwelling
unit by no more than 10% and still within the parameters
of Subsection I(2).
[3] Change in the amount of nonresidential building area or
land area to be devoted to nonresidential uses of not more
than 10%.
[4] Change in the amount by not more than 10% or location of
open space areas by not more than 800 feet.
[5] Change in the minimum lot sizes for the residential
dwellings by not more than 10%.
[6] Change in any improvement proposed to qualify for a
density incentive authorized by Subsection S.
(b) An applicant may make minor revisions to the site plan as may
be necessary to accommodate fully engineered stormwater
management facilities, public sewer facilities, public water
facilities, floodplains and changes to street design as may be
required by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation
(PennDOT) as part of a highway occupancy permit. The Board
of Supervisors during the subdivision and land development
process shall determine whether the applicant's proposed
changes to the approved site plan constitute minor revisions
necessary to accommodate fully engineered stormwater
management facilities, public sewer facilities, public water
facilities, floodplains, and changes to street design as may be
required by PennDOT as part of a highway occupancy permit.
(5) An applicant who desires to make a change to an approved site plan
which the Board of Supervisors determines does not constitute a
revision authorized by Subsection T(4) above shall apply for and
obtain an additional conditional use approval.
§ 285-34 WEAPONS § 285-34
278:501
(a) Any applicant for a change to an approved site plan shall
demonstrate that the change continues to meet all
requirements of this § 285-34.
(b) An applicant who desires to make a revision to an approved
site plan which affects a matter in excess of the modifications
allowed in Subsection T(4) above, or that affects a matter not
addressed by such section, shall demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the Board of Supervisors during the additional
conditional use approval process that such change will:
[1] Generally enhance the development plan, or in any case
not have an adverse impact on its physical, visual or
spatial characteristics.
[2] Generally enhance the streetscape and neighborhood, or
in any case not have an adverse impact on the streetscape
and neighborhood.
[3] Not result in configurations of lots or street systems which
shall be impractical or detract from the appearance of the
proposed neighborhood development.
[4] Not result in any danger to the public health, safety or
welfare by making access to the dwellings by emergency
vehicles more difficult, by depriving adjoining properties
of adequate light and air or by violating the other purposes
for which zoning ordinances are to be enacted under
Section 604 of the State Municipalities Planning Code.
[5] Allow for equal or better results than the originally
approved site plan and represent the minimum
modification necessary.
U. Modification of standards. The Board of Supervisors may, by conditional
use approval, permit the modification of the design standards in order
to encourage the use of innovative design. An applicant desiring to
obtain such conditional use approval shall, when making application for
conditional use approval for a neighborhood development using the
neighborhood design option, also make application for conditional use
approval under this Subsection U. The Board of Supervisors shall
consider both conditional use approval requests simultaneously. Any
conditional use to permit a modification of the design standards shall be
subject to the following standards:
(1) Such modifications of design standards better serve the intended
purposes and goals of the neighborhood design option as expressed
in Subsection A.
(2) Such modifications of design standards would not result in adverse
impact to adjoining properties nor future inhabitants within the
neighborhood development.
§ 285-34 WEST LAMPETER CODE § 285-34
278:502
§ 285-35. Additional requirements in the A District.
(3) Such modifications will not result in an increase in residential
densities permitted for the neighborhood development tract.
(4) Such modifications will not result in a decrease in common open
space below that required in Subsection F for the neighborhood
development tract.
(5) The extent of modification provides the minimum amount of relief
necessary to ensure compliance with the preceding criteria in this
§ 285-34.
V. Signs.
(1) As part of the final subdivision or land development plan for a
neighborhood development, a set of standards shall be submitted
that will be used to guide the design of signs in the development.
(2) The design, size and location of signs at entryways into the
neighborhood development shall be submitted with the conditional
use application.
(3) Internally illuminated signs shall be prohibited within a
neighborhood development.
(4) Signs in a commercial center or neighborhood center of a
neighborhood development shall comply with the same
requirements that apply to the MS Main Street District.
A. Limitations on subdivision/land development.
(1) In order to preserve the agricultural tracts, it is the express intent
of the A District regulations that the subdivision of lots from farms
or the development of nonagricultural uses and structures on
existing farms shall be limited. In addition, it is the express intent
of these provisions that the maximum size of lots created for any
use other than agriculture be limited in order to provide for the
retention of tracts of sufficient size to be used for agricultural
purposes. It is the intent of the Board of Supervisors to implement
the mandate of Section 604(3) of the Pennsylvania Municipalities
Planning Code to preserve prime agricultural land through the
enactment of these regulations.
(2) Each tract existing on April 20, 1988, shall be permitted to
subdivide new lots from the tract or establish new principal uses on
the tract based upon the lot area of the tract as it existed on April
20, 1988, as follows:
§ 285-34 WEAPONS § 285-35
278:503
Lot Area
(acres)
Number of New Lots Which May Be
Subdivided and/or Number of New

140 160 8
160 180 9
180 200 10
200 220 11
(3) A purpose of the A District is to limit the development of
agricultural tracts. It is the further purpose of this A District to
limit the number of single-family dwellings or other principal uses
which may be established on any tract within the A District. The
condition of the tract on April 20, 1988, or on the date on which the
tract was first zoned A District shall be the basis from which the
maximum development set forth in § 285-35A(2) above shall be
calculated.
(4) See § 285-33, which may allow transfers of the rights to develop
dwelling units from the A District to other districts. A density
incentive is offered.
(5) No subdivision shall be permitted which shall increase the lot size
of a lot used for residential purposes in excess of the maximum lot
size, except as provided in Subsection B(2). Any lot existing as of
March 16, 1996, which is two or fewer acres in size, shall be
presumed to be used for residential purposes.
(6) A subdivision, the sole purpose of which is to transfer land to
increase the size of a tract being used for agricultural purposes,
where both the tract from which the land is taken and the tract to
which the land is added will be 20 acres or greater after such
subdivision, shall not be included when computing the permissible
number of lots to be subdivided from a tract as set forth in
Subsection B(2) above.
(7) A subdivision to create a lot which will be transferred to the
Township or a municipal authority created by the Township shall
§ 285-35 WEST LAMPETER CODE § 285-35
278:504
not be included when computing the permissible number of lots to
be subdivided from a tract as set forth in Subsection A(2) above.
(8) Any subdivision or land development plan hereafter filed with the
applicable approving body for subdivision or land development of a
parent tract shall specify which lot or lots shall carry with it a right
of further subdivision or establishment of principal uses, if any such
right remains from the quota allocated to the parent tract on April
20, 1988, or on the date when such land was first included within
the A District. The right of further subdivision or establishment of
principal uses shall also be included in the deed for the newly
created lot. If the designation of the right of further subdivision or
establishment of principal uses was not included on a subdivision
or land development plan of a parent tract, it shall be conclusively
presumed that the largest lot remaining after subdivision shall
carry the right of further subdivision or establishment of principal
uses.
(9) In the event that a tract which was not classified as part of the A
District on April 20, 1988, is or was thereafter classified as part of
the A District, the size and ownership of the tract and the
development existing on the tract on the effective date of the
change in zoning classification shall determine the number of lots
which may be subdivided from or the number of principal uses
which may be established on such tract.
(10) The number of lots which may be created or principal uses which
may be established shall be fixed according to the size of the parent
tract. This number shall not be increased by the subdivision of such
parent tract. Any subsequent owner of a parent tract, land
remaining in the parent tract after subdivision or land which was
formerly part of a parent tract shall be bound by the actions of his
predecessor.
(11) In submitting an application for a subdivision/land development for
a dwelling unit within the A District, the applicant shall
demonstrate that measures have been used to:
(a) Minimize the loss of valuable farmland;
(b) Cluster residential lots on the subject property and, if
applicable, with those lots contained on adjoining farms;
(c) Minimize the length of property lines shared by all residential
lots and adjoining farms;
(d) Assure adequate vehicular access to future residences not
currently proposed;
(e) Assure that the proposed plan can comply with the Township's
Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance;
§ 285-35 WEAPONS § 285-35
278:505
(f) Make use of existing public sewer and/or public water
facilities; and
(g) Minimize the clearing or cutting of mature trees and
hedgerows.
(h) The applicant shall furnish evidence regarding how these
objectives have been satisfied.
B. Lot area requirements.
(1) Agricultural, horticultural and/or forestry-related uses: 20 acres
minimum for uses existing as of March 16, 1996; 50 acres minimum
for uses established after March 16, 1996.
(2) Single-family detached dwellings: 35,000 square feet, minimum lot
area; two acres, maximum lot area.
(a) The maximum lot area shall not apply if the applicant can
demonstrate by credible evidence that the area proposed for
the dwelling lot: 1) does not predominately consist of Class I, II
and/or III soils, as identified in the soil survey; or 2) is
generally unsuitable for agricultural purposes; or 3) where
additional lot area is needed to improve septic or water supply
facilities for the lot. Where an applicant proposes to subdivide
an existing dwelling from the parent tract, the applicant may
opt to impose the maximum lot area requirements of this
section upon such existing dwelling rather than on a proposed
dwelling to be constructed on the remainder of the parent
tract.
(b) The Township may also allow one lot to exceed the two-acre
maximum lot area if the applicant proves that the resulting
land that is removed from the parent tract will not be greater
than would result if a larger number of allowed lots would be
subdivided. For example, if an applicant was allowed three new
lots on a tract and only proposed one new lot, then that one
new lot could have a six-acre maximum lot area, which is
equivalent to three lots of two acres each. However, in this
example, that six-acre lot would be designated on deeds and
the record plan as having the right to subdivide the two
additional lots, and the remaining parent lot would not have a
right of further subdivision.
(3) Other allowed uses. Unless otherwise specified, all other principal
uses shall contain at least one acre. Except as specifically stated, in
no case shall any nonagricultural use contain more than five acres.
(4) See § 285-63, which may allow a lot to include two single-family
detached dwellings if the applicant proves to the Township that
each dwelling could be lawfully subdivided in the future to have
each dwelling on its own lot meeting Township requirements.
§ 285-35 WEST LAMPETER CODE § 285-35
278:506
C. Minimum lot width: 200 feet at the minimum front yard setback line;
150 feet at the lot frontage.
D. Minimum lot depth: 200 feet.
E. Minimum setbacks and maximum height requirements.
(1) Agricultural uses (other than farm dwellings).
(a) Front yard setback: 50 feet.
(b) Side yard setback: 50 feet on each of two sides.
(c) Rear yard setback: 50 feet.
(d) Additional setbacks. Except as provided for in the following
paragraph, no new slaughter area, area for the storage or
processing of garbage, or spent mushroom compost, or
structures for the cultivation of mushrooms shall be permitted
within 300 feet of any land within the R-1, R-2 and/or R-3
Zones. See additional setbacks in § 285-42 under "Livestock
and Poultry, Raising of."
[1] The Zoning Hearing Board may as a special exception,
however, reduce the above special setback requirements
where it is shown that, because of prevailing winds,
unusual obstructions, topography or other conditions, a
lesser distance would protect adjoining lands from odor,
dust or other hazards. In no case, however, shall the
Zoning Hearing Board reduce the special setback
requirement to less than 100 feet. The burden shall be
upon the applicant to prove that a lesser distance would
not be detrimental to the health, safety and general
welfare of the community.
(2) Single-family detached dwellings (including farm dwellings).
(a) Front yard setback: 50 feet.
(b) Side yard setbacks: 25 feet on each of two side yards.
(c) Rear yard setback: 50 feet.
(d) Maximum permitted height: 35 feet. [Amended 12-10-2007
by Ord. No. 202]
(3) Other permitted or special exception uses. Unless otherwise
specified, the following requirements shall apply to all other
principal uses permitted within the A District:
(a) Front yard setbacks: 50 feet.
(b) Side yard setbacks: 50 feet each of two side yards.
(c) Rear yard setback: 50 feet.
§ 285-35 WEAPONS § 285-35
278:507
(4) Residential accessory uses. Unless otherwise specified, the
following requirements shall apply to accessory uses:
(a) Front yard setback: No accessory use (except permitted signs)
shall be located within the front yard.
(b) Side yard setbacks: 10 feet on each of two side yards.
(c) Rear yard setback: 10 feet.
(d) Maximum permitted height: 15 feet. [Amended 12-10-2007
by Ord. No. 202]
(5) Maximum permitted mso-element-frame-height: 35 feet for
principal nonagricultural buildings; 150 feet for agricultural
buildings and structures, provided all structures are set back a
distance at least equal to their height from all property lines.
F. Maximum total impervious coverage.
(1) Agricultural uses: 10%.
(2) Single-family dwellings: 20%.
(3) Places of worship or primary or secondary schools: 60%.
(4) Other uses (unless otherwise specified): 20%.
G. Driveways. All lanes exclusively serving agricultural, horticultural and/
or forestry-related activities shall be exempt from driveway and access
drive requirements.
H. Warehousing and storage as a principal use. Warehousing and storage
shall be permitted as a principal use when meeting all of the following
criteria: [Added 12-10-2007 by Ord. No. 202119]
(1) Minimum lot size of two acres and maximum lot size of 10 acres.
(2) Maximum of one such building per lot.
(3) The use shall not be used for any commercial purposes.
(4) The storage area may not be sublet.
(5) Maximum floor area of 5,000 square feet.
(6) All buildings shall maintain a residential or agricultural
appearance, as viewed from the street.
(7) All other requirements shall be in compliance except as specified in
this chapter.
119. Editor's Note: This ordinance also relettered former Subsection H, Agricultural nuisance
disclaimer, as Subsection I.
§ 285-35 WEST LAMPETER CODE § 285-35

§ 285-36. Age-restricted residential development.
§ 285-37. Historic buildings. [Amended 12-12-2016 by Ord. No.
243]
I. Agricultural nuisance disclaimer. All lands within the A District are
located within an area where land is used for commercial agricultural
production. Owners, residents and other users of this property may be
subjected to inconvenience, discomfort and the possibility of injury to
property and health arising from normal and accepted agricultural
practices and operations, including but not limited to noise, odors, dust,
the operation of machinery of any kind including aircraft, the storage
and disposal of manure, the application of fertilizers, soil amendments,
herbicides and pesticides. Owners, occupants and users of this property
should be prepared to accept such inconveniences, discomfort and
possibility of injury from normal agricultural operations, and are hereby
put on official notice that the Right to Farm Law, 3 P.S. § 951 et seq., as
amended, may bar them from obtaining a legal judgment against such
normal agricultural operations. [Amended 12-10-2007 by Ord. No.
202]
A. This § 285-36 provides a density bonus for a residential development
that is age-restricted in compliance with the federal requirements for
housing for older persons as specified in the United States Code. (Note:
As of 2005, such provisions were in 42 U.S.C. 3607).
B. In order to be approved by the Township as age-restricted residential
development, every dwelling unit (except a unit for one manager) on a
tract of land shall be permanently restricted by deed, by any lease and
by notes on the recorded plan to the following occupancy limitations: 1)
a minimum of one head of household of each dwelling unit shall be age
55 years or older or physically disabled as defined by social security
disability regulations; and 2) no person under age 18 shall live in the
dwelling unit for more than 30 days in any calendar year. Any violation
of such age restrictions shall be a violation of this Zoning Ordinance. In
addition, in order to be approved as elderly housing, the applicant shall
establish an appropriate legal entity, such as a property owners'
association that has the duty, authority and responsibility to enforce
such age restrictions over time.
C. If a residential development is approved under this § 285-36, then the
minimum lot area or the minimum average lot area per dwelling unit, as
applicable, shall be reduced by 15%. An age-restricted residential
development shall meet all other requirements of Township ordinances.
A medical residential campus development shall not be eligible for agerestricted
residential development bonus.
A. Historic Buildings Table and Historic Buildings Map. The Historic
Buildings Table120 lists historic buildings within the Township. The
Historic Buildings Map121 shows the locations of the historic buildings
§ 285-35 WEAPONS § 285-37
278:509
by map numbers corresponding to the numbers on the Historic
Buildings Table. The Historic Buildings Table and the Historic Buildings
Map are hereby incorporated by reference. The Historic Buildings
Table and the Historic Buildings Map may be revised or replaced by an
amendment to this chapter.
B. Purposes. This section implements the mandatory requirements of the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code to use zoning to preserve
historic buildings. This section implements Sections 603(b), 603(g),
604(1) and 605 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code,
which address protecting and facilitating the preservation of historic
values through zoning and using zoning to regulate uses and structures
at or near places having unique historic, architectural or patriotic
interest or value.
C. Consideration of demolition. The following shall apply to buildings that
are identified on the Historic Buildings Table. Unless an accessory
building is specifically included on the Historic Buildings Table, this
§ 285-37 shall only apply to principal buildings.
(1) General requirement. A building identified on the Historic
Buildings Table shall not be demolished in part or in whole or be
removed without first obtaining conditional use approval for the
demolition, followed by a Township demolition permit.
(2) Application procedures. In addition to meeting the conditional use
requirements in § 285-17, a demolition permit application under
this section shall include the following:
(a) A site plan drawn to scale, showing the specific location of the
structure proposed to be demolished and its relationship to
adjacent property lines and all other buildings, structures and
improvements (such as sidewalks, driveways, parking areas,
landscape beds, mature trees), and shall indicate the general
topography of the property. In addition to the location of the
structure(s) to be demolished, the site plan shall include a
separate sheet showing the proposed future use of the lot,
including any proposed buildings and a scaled elevation/facade
drawing of the proposed use/structure.
(b) An explanation of why the building is being considered for
demolition, removal or relocation. The application shall include
an evaluation by a qualified historic preservation professional
of the historic and/or architectural significance of the historic
building.
(c) Proposed use for the property or portion thereof from which
the building will be removed and a time line for the
120. Editor's Note: Said table is included as an attachment to this chapter.
121. Editor's Note: Said map is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 285-37 WEST LAMPETER CODE § 285-37
278:510
implementation of the proposed use (including other local,
county, state and federal approvals).
(d) Photographs of the existing building proposed to be
demolished.
(3) Approval or disapproval of a demolition permit.
(a) Demolition permits for the partial or entire demolition of a
building regulated by this section shall need conditional use
approval by the Board of Supervisors, after an opportunity for
review by the Township Planning Commission and by any
appointed Township historical commission or Township
historic preservation task force that may exist. A partial
demolition shall include, but not be limited to, removal of an
attached porch roof, removal of porch columns, and removal of
architectural features.
[1] A building regulated by this section shall not be
demolished, in whole or in part, or removed unless the
applicant proves by credible evidence to the satisfaction of
the Board of Supervisors that one or more of the following
conditions exists:
[a] The existing building cannot feasibly and reasonably
be reused, for a use allowed by this chapter, and that
such situation is not the result of intentional neglect or
demolition by neglect by the owner, and that the
potential for reuse shall consider sale to another
party;
[b] The denial of the demolition would result in
unreasonable economic hardship to the owner, based
upon credible evidence, and the hardship was not selfcreated;
or
[c] The demolition is necessary to allow a project to occur
that will have substantial, special and unusual public
benefit that would greatly outweigh the loss of the
building regulated by this section, and the project
needs to occur at this location. For example, a
demolition may be needed for a necessary expansion
of an existing public building or to allow a street
improvement that is necessary to alleviate a public
safety hazard.
[2] An applicant is only required to meet one of the conditions
provided in Subsection C(3)(a)(1) above. However, the
applicant shall also describe how other conditions in
Subsection C(3)(a)(1) apply or do not apply.
§ 285-37 WEAPONS § 285-37
278:511
[3] For approval of a demolition, the standards of this § 285-37
shall apply in addition to any relevant general conditional
use standards. In reviewing the application, the Board of
Supervisors shall consider the following:
[a] The effect of the demolition on the historical
significance, streetscape and architectural integrity of
neighboring historic buildings and on the historic
character of the surrounding neighborhood.
[b] The feasibility of other alternatives to demolition.
[4] Evidence. The applicant shall provide sufficient credible
evidence to justify any claims that a building cannot
feasibly be repaired or reused. The conditions that justify
the proposed demolition shall not have been self-created
by the applicant.
[5] Exceptions. Conditional use approval shall not be needed
for the following:
[a] Interior renovations or removal of features (such as a
rear porch) that do not harm the structural stability of
the building and that are not visible from a public
street (not including an alley).
[b] Removal of features that were added less than 60
years previously, such as a modern porch or aluminum
siding or carport.
[c] Relocation of a building within the Township, provided
that the relocation does not result in a partial or
complete demolition that is regulated by this section.
(4) Conditions. Applicants whose applications for demolition, removal,
or relocation are approved shall be subject to conditions that
include, in addition to any other appropriate conditions, the
following:
(a) The Township shall have the right, at the Township's expense,
to hire and send a person who is skilled in documenting
historic structures to the subject property, and the applicant
shall have the obligation to cooperate with the Township's
efforts to record all relevant information relating to the history
of the subject property.
(5) Demolition by neglect. Demolition by neglect is defined as the
absence of routine maintenance and repair which leads to
structural weakness, decay and deterioration in a building or
structure to the point where the building or structure meets the
criteria for condemnation set forth in Chapter 197 of this Code,
§ 285-37 WEST LAMPETER CODE § 285-37
278:512
§ 285-38. Additional requirements for the OTR District.
known as the West Lampeter Township Property Maintenance
Code.
(a) Code violations: If the Code Enforcement Officer has cited a
property owner of an historic building for conditions that could
lead to structural weakness, decay or deterioration in a
building or structure and the property owner fails to correct
the condition(s) in the time specified, that property owner may
be cited also for demolition by neglect under these provisions
and be subject to the penalties contained herein.
(b) The owner of unoccupied principal or accessory buildings or
structures that have been cited for violations shall develop a
written maintenance program for the protection of any and all
unoccupied historic buildings. Said maintenance program shall
be established in accordance with the West Lampeter Property
Maintenance Code, as previously enacted and amended. A
copy of the maintenance program shall be filed with the Code
Enforcement Officer and implementation begun in accordance
with an established time-table.
[1] The maintenance program shall address measures to
assure that structural components are protected and
reinforced to stabilize and maintain the essential form of
the building or structure. Structural features requiring
stabilization include, but are not be limited to, roofs,
chimneys, cornices, soffit, fascia, spouting, columns,
beams, posts, and window and door sills, lintels and jambs.
[2] The exterior and interior of the building or structure shall
be inspected no less than annually by the Code
Enforcement Officer with the owner or the owner's agent
to determine compliance with the established
maintenance program.
D. In addition to or in lieu of the penalties and enforcement remedies
provided in this chapter, any violations of the provisions of this § 285-37
may be abated or enforced by proceedings seeking equitable relief
against the violator.
A. Planned mixed-use development. Section 285-27A establishes the
minimum lot area for the OTR District. That section allows a reduction
in the minimum lot area and the minimum lot width if conditional use
approval is first obtained for a planned mixed-use development. A
planned mixed-use development shall have a minimum tract size of 10
acres.
§ 285-37 WEAPONS § 285-38
278:513
(1) A planned mixed-use development shall only be approved if the
applicant proves to the Board of Supervisors that the following
conditions will be met:
(a) That the applicant submits a master site plan for the entire
tract that shows the approximate layout of lots and roads,
ranges of intended uses, and the methods to buffer adjacent
dwellings. Substantial compliance shall be required with that
master site plan, unless the applicant receives conditional use
approval for a revised planned mixed-use development in the
future. The master site plan shall be prepared to scale and
based upon accurate existing features. However, fully
engineered subdivision or land development plans may be
submitted as a later step, after conditional use approval is
granted.
(b) That the development will maximize use of interior streets, as
opposed to driveways from individual lots entering onto
exterior public streets.
(c) That the development will include an appropriate system to
minimize the number of stormwater basins and to ensure
proper maintenance of stormwater basins over time.
(d) That the subdivider will establish an appropriate set of
covenants or deed restrictions on each lot to ensure proper
development of individual lots. The substance of those
covenants or deed restrictions shall be provided to the Board of
Supervisors for its information. It is requested, but not
required, that the covenants or deed restrictions include
restrictions on exterior materials of the facades of buildings.
(2) Definition of planned mixed-use development. This term shall mean
a development approved as a planned mixed-use development as a
conditional use under the standards of § 285-38. A planned mixeduse
development is a tract designed with fully coordinated interior
road access, stormwater management, landscaping and buffering.
(3) Once a planned mixed-use development is granted conditional use
approval, then individual uses shall only be allowed if they are
consistent with the conditional use approval, unless a revised
conditional use approval is granted.
(4) Information on covenants. A planned mixed-use development shall
include a reasonable set of deed restrictions or covenants imposed
by the developer on each lot. These covenants should cover types of
uses, maintenance of lots and industrial operations, with a proper
means for enforcement. The covenants shall also be written to
carry out the purposes and requirements of a planned mixed-use
development. The substance of these covenants shall be presented
before a planned mixed-use development is approved.
§ 285-38 WEST LAMPETER CODE § 285-38
278:514
(5) See the note in the Table of Allowed Uses for restrictions on retail
sales, personal service and restaurant uses, including the
percentage of the development tract that can be occupied by such
uses.
(6) Within the OTR District, a neighborhood development developed in
compliance with the NDO regulations of § 285-34 shall be allowed
as a conditional use if the following additional requirements are
met:
(a) The land within the OTR District shall be allowed to have the
same density as would apply to an NDO development in the R-2
District. Only the portion of the tract that is developed as an
NDO shall count towards determining the allowed density.
(b) The NDO development shall be within a planned mixed-use
development, with an interior road system, stormwater
management system and landscaping design that is fully
coordinated between the business development and the
residential development within the OTR District. An access
management plan shall be presented for all lands that are in
common ownership.
(c) For the portion of the tract that is developed as an NDO
development, the dimensional, architectural, density, parking,
design and similar requirements of § 285-34 shall apply in
place of the corresponding requirements of other subsections
of this § 285-38.
(d) As part of the conditional use approval, the applicant shall
prove to the satisfaction of the Board of Supervisors that a
sufficient buffer is provided between residential areas and any
incompatible business areas, particularly uses that would
involve nighttime noise or regular trucking activities. The
Board of Supervisors may require additional setbacks,
landscaping, earth berming and/or limits upon hours of
operation as a condition of conditional use approval to ensure
compatibility.
(e) The NDO development shall not comprise more than 40% of
the total land area of a tract within the OTR District. The
maximum percentage of an OTR tract that can be developed in
retail, restaurant and service uses shall also apply to any
portion of the OTR developed in commercial uses. Therefore,
the percentage of land that can be developed in retail uses
under the OTR District may not be added together with the
percentage of an NDO that is allowed to be developed
commercial to result in a higher percentage of commercial
uses.
B. Additional setbacks.
§ 285-38 WEAPONS § 285-38
278:515
(1) Any industrial use or area routinely used for the parking, storage,
loading or unloading of two or more tractor-trailer trucks or
refrigerated trucks shall be set back a minimum of 200 feet from
the lot line of an existing dwelling. Such setback shall be reduced to
120 feet if a principal building or Township-approved sound wall or
six-foot minimum height landscaped earth berm will completely
buffer such activity from all adjacent residential lots. An earth berm
may include a suitable retaining wall on the business side, provided
a 3:1 minimum slope is maintained on the residential side.
(2) No new loading dock that is routinely used by tractor-trailer trucks
shall be located within 75 feet of the right-of-way of a public street.
C. Impervious coverage. The maximum impervious coverage provided in
§ 285-27A may be modified as follows within a planned mixed-use
development, if the flexibility is used to provide a substantial buffer
adjacent to existing dwellings:
(1) Within an approved planned mixed-use development, the maximum
impervious coverages of certain individual lots may be approved to
be a maximum of 80%, provided that deed restrictions are put into
place to restrict the maximum impervious coverage of other lots to
a lower percentage so as to ensure that a maximum impervious
coverage of 65% is maintained for the total land area of all lots.
This provision is intended to allow for substantial buffer areas
adjacent to dwellings or for common recreation areas.
(a) For example, by deed restrictions, one lot of two acres might
have a maximum impervious coverage of 75% while another
two-acre lot is approved with a maximum impervious coverage
of 55%, resulting in an average impervious coverage of 65%.
D. Height. A maximum height of 45 feet or four stories, whichever is more
restrictive, shall apply. However, for portions of a building that are
within 100 feet from an existing residential lot, a maximum height of 35
feet or three stories, whichever is more restrictive, shall apply.
Customary extensions of a building that are not occupied by persons
may exceed this height limit, such as elevator equipment, skylights,
water towers, chimneys, smokestacks and similar features.
E. Landscaping and screening.
(1) See §§ 285-65 and 285-66.
(2) Planting strips shall be provided adjacent to each public street. The
planting strip shall have a minimum width of 40 feet adjacent to the
curbline of an arterial street and 15 feet adjacent to the curbline of
any other street. If curbing is not provided, then such width shall
be measured from the street right-of-way line. A sidewalk of
approved width and approximately perpendicular driveways of
approved width may be placed within this planting strip. The
§ 285-38 WEST LAMPETER CODE § 285-38
278:516
planting strip shall be maintained in deciduous shade trees, shrubs
and an attractive vegetative ground cover.
(3) As part of land development review for each new principal building,
a landscaping plan shall be submitted to the Township. A minimum
of 20% of each lot shall be landscaped, which shall include grass or
other vegetative ground cover and an appropriate distribution of
trees and shrubs.
F. Utilities. Each principal use shall be served by public water and public
sewage service. All new electric and telephone service lines within the
development shall be placed underground.
G. Nuisances and hazards. An applicant for a new industrial use shall
provide a written description of methods that will be used to control
significant nuisances and hazards, including noise, dust, toxic hazards,
hazardous spill and leak hazards, explosion hazards, flammable
hazards, radiation hazards and similar nuisances and hazards.
H. Pedestrian access and amenities.
(1) See the provisions of the Subdivision and Land Development
Ordinance122 regarding sidewalks along streets. An applicant may
apply for a modification under such ordinance to allow a
bituminous asphalt bicycle/walking trail in place of concrete
sidewalks.
(2) Consideration should be given to providing pedestrian routes (such
as crushed stone paths in areas that are not along a public street)
and outdoor lunch areas with picnic tables and trees within a
subdivision for the use of employees of businesses within the
subdivision.
I. Additional OTR provisions.
(1) The applicant shall establish a set of architectural standards
through deed restrictions or a similar method that will be binding
upon each lot owner and developer. A draft of such provisions shall
be provided to the Township for review. It is strongly encouraged
that a minimum of 75% of the facades of buildings facing onto
streets consist of glass, brick or other decorative masonry. This
provision is intended to avoid metal or cinder block construction, at
least as visible from a street. Subdividers are strongly encouraged
to place such a requirement on each lot through deed restrictions.
(2) Landscaped front yards. A maximum of 80% of the required
minimum front yard setback area shall be maintained in
landscaped green space. The intent is that the remaining 20%
would be used for driveways, fire lanes, visitor parking,
122. Editor's Note: See Ch. 240, Subdivision and Land Development.
§ 285-38 WEAPONS § 285-38
278:517
§ 285-39. Additional requirements in the MS and MSL Districts.
handicapped parking and walkways. Other vehicle parking is
intended to primarily be placed to the side or rear of buildings.
(3) Loading docks. An applicant shall prove to the satisfaction of the
Township that loading docks routinely serving three or more
tractor-trailer trucks have been located within reason to seek to
minimize their visibility from dwellings, public streets and existing
and planned expressways. No loading dock routinely served by
tractor-trailer trucks shall be located within 75 feet of the existing
right-of-way of a public street.
(4) Coordinated stormwater management. The OTR shall include a
coordinated system of stormwater management. At best, where
feasible, this should include sufficient land set aside for a minimal
number of stormwater basins, with each lot owner assessed
sufficient fees each year to properly maintain the basins.
(5) Berming. The Board of Supervisors may require an earth berm to
be constructed between industrial uses and any existing or
prospective residential lots if the Board determines it will be
necessary to ensure compatibility between uses.
(a) The height of the berm shall average at least five feet, unless
the Board of Supervisors determines that a differing height is
appropriate considering the topography of the site.
(b) The maximum slope of the berm (on sides visible from outside
of the business) shall be three feet measured horizontally for
each one foot measured vertically.
(c) The plant screening required by § 285-65 shall be placed
towards the top, on the residential side, of the berm. Portions
of the berm that are visible from outside of the business
development shall be maintained with attractive vegetation.
A. Purposes. In addition to the overall purposes of this chapter, the MS
and MSL Districts are intended to: improve the appearance of the
Willow Street Corridor to help attract desirable types of development;
encourage appropriate infill development and adaptive reuse; attract
new sources of employment and tax revenue; encourage a proper mix of
uses; avoid development that would be inconsistent with the character
of the community; provide for reasonably safe and convenient
pedestrian, bicycle, and vehicle circulation; encourage persons to live,
work, shop, and enjoy recreation within the Township; encourage the
creation of a sense of place, feelings of belonging, and a community
spirit that promotes social interaction and volunteerism; and further
the purposes and objectives of and utilize the authority for traditional
neighborhood development that are set forth in the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code. [Amended 9-9-2013 by Ord. No. 232]
§ 285-38 WEST LAMPETER CODE § 285-39
278:518
B. Additional provisions within the MS and MSL Districts:
(1) Buildings may be developed in a condominium arrangement
without each building being on its own minimum-sized lot, provided
the applicant proves that the same dimensional requirements could
be met as if the dwellings were in fee-simple ownership. For
example, if a ten-foot side yard is required on each side of two
buildings, then a twenty-foot separation shall be provided, although
a lot line would not need to exist between the two buildings.
(2) Before zoning approval is granted for any new principal building, a
conceptual architectural plan shall be submitted to the Township
for review. Such plans shall show the front elevation of the building
and shall list the types of exterior building materials of the front
facade. A Township disapproval decision shall not be based upon
such architectural plans.
(3) Individual buildings and pedestrian entrances and parking areas
shall be laid out to promote pedestrian access among different
uses.
(4) Buildings of over 100 feet in length should be designed to have the
appearance of interconnected buildings and to avoid the
appearance of monotony. This should be accomplished through
variations in rooflines, overhangs, setbacks, colors and facade
materials and use of canopies, porches and awnings.
(5) Buildings should have the appearance of having a pitched or
peaked roof as viewed from a street or have a decorative cornice
roof.
(6) Retail stores should have display windows facing onto the street.
(7) Buildings should be designed and arranged to provide a character
similar to an older village. Street level storefronts shall be inviting
to pedestrians.
(8) No off-street parking spaces shall be located within: a) 40 feet from
the right-of-way of Route 272 Willow Street Pike or Village Road;
and b) 10 feet from the curbline of any other street. To the
maximum extent feasible, off-street parking should be located to
the rear or side of nonresidential buildings. Existing parking spaces
may be rearranged, provided they do not result in an increase in
the land area covered by off-street parking spaces in such location.
(9) Walkways through parking lots shall be well-defined and separated
from major vehicle corridors, except where crosswalks are
provided.
(10) Loading and unloading spaces for trucks shall not block major
pedestrianways or create blind spots.
§ 285-39 WEAPONS § 285-39
278:519
(11) Bike racks shall be provided in commercial developments of over
three acres.
(12) As viewed from a street, buildings should be constructed of
materials using the following exterior materials or other materials
with a closely similar appearance: brick, stone or clapboard.
(13) Maximum building setback. If a new principal building is
constructed on a lot adjacent to Willow Street Pike, at least a
portion of such building shall have a building setback from Willow
Street Pike that is not more than 15 feet greater than the average
building setback of all buildings on that same side of the block
along Willow Street Pike.
(14) Design guidelines. The following design guidelines are
recommended to be used by the Township and applicants when
considering changes to the MS and MSL Districts.
(a) Every effort should be made to preserve and reuse older
buildings and to rehabilitate historic features. Modern
additions and features should be placed towards the rear of the
property.
(b) Uninterrupted continuity of pedestrian-related uses and
activities should be encouraged along Willow Street Pike,
particularly in areas of present activity. Outward street
orientation is encouraged, with storefronts, entrances, window
displays and other windows relating to Willow Street Pike.
(c) Lighting. Privately installed light fixtures should be similar in
design to decorative public streetlights. Excessive illumination
and glare should be avoided.
(d) Signs. If more than one sign is used, the signs should be
consistent in design. Signs should not cover historic
architectural features.
(e) Parking. Parking areas should be well-screened from Willow
Street Pike by landscaping and a decorative masonry wall.
(f) Patterns. Where existing older buildings have a certain
horizontal or vertical orientation or pattern, that orientation or
pattern should be continued in new construction. Where
existing older buildings have a certain spacing of windows and
doors, similar spacing (and similar sizes of windows and doors)
should be continued. When larger buildings are proposed, they
should be articulated so that the major elements of the facade
reflect the width and proportion of the surrounding buildings.
(g) Blank walls. Blank walls without door and window openings
should be avoided along a street. Overly modernistic or bland
§ 285-39 WEST LAMPETER CODE § 285-39
278:520
buildings devoid of details should be avoided when adjacent
buildings have architectural details.
(h) Fencing. Chain link metal fencing should be avoided in the
front yard.
(i) Materials. On sides visible from a street, new construction
should use building materials that are similar to appearance to
older buildings. Artificial materials are acceptable if they have
a truly realistic appearance.
(15) Subject to any special or more particular provisions of this chapter,
any building exceeding 100 feet in length which is proposed as part
of multiple buildings on a lot may be set back greater than the
maximum setback required under § 285-39B(13), provided it is
screened and buffered from the front of the lot by plantings or
other approved materials. [Added 12-8-2008 by Ord. No. 209]
(16) Design features/bonus incentives. Because of the intended purpose
of the MSL District to promote adaptive reuse and preserve its
historic character, the following bonus incentives may be applied to
individual uses in the MSL District if an applicant demonstrates
that the applicable standards and criteria set forth in this
subsection will be met. These bonus incentives permit development
in a manner which exceeds the type of development otherwise
permitted in the MSL District, and therefore entitlement to the
bonus incentive is strictly limited to those uses or types of
development or redevelopment meeting the standards and criteria
set forth herein. [Added 9-9-2013 by Ord. No. 232]
(a) If the applicant adaptively reuses the existing structure, which
may include an addition not to exceed 20% of gross floor area
of the existing structure, then the maximum impervious
coverage may be increased by not more than 10% and the total
required parking spaces may be decreased by not more than
5% for a principal use.
(b) If the applicant provides coordinated vehicular access between
two or more adjoining lots that make use of only one shared
access driveway onto adjoining roads, the maximum
impervious coverage may be increased by not more than 5%,
subject to the submission of a long-term agreement defining
the joint use of the access drive which has been executed by all
parties concerned, approved by the Zoning Officer, and
recorded.
(c) If the applicant provides clear and convincing evidence that a
reduced number of parking spaces is justified because more
than one principal use will safely and efficiently share access
and the same off-street parking facility, then the total number
of spaces may be decreased by not more than 50% of the
§ 285-39 WEAPONS § 285-39
278:521
§ 285-40. Flag lots.
required spaces based on the calculation for all principal uses
intended to share parking subject to the following
requirements:
[1] The applicant must demonstrate that the peak parking
demand and principal operating hours for each use are
suitable for a shared parking facility.
[2] Shared parking areas shall not be located greater than 200
feet from buildings intended to share parking.
[3] Shared parking facilities containing greater than 50 total
spaces adjacent to an adjoining lot used primarily for a
principal residential purpose shall be planted with a plant
screen in accordance with § 285-65D(6)-(7).
[4] A long-term agreement defining the joint use of the
common parking facility shall be executed by all parties
concerned, approved by the Zoning Officer, and recorded.
[5] Any subsequent change in land uses for which the shared
parking proposal was approved that results in the need for
additional parking spaces shall require approval by the
Zoning Officer. Failure to obtain approval for required
parking shall be a violation of this chapter.
C. Circulation, traffic access and streets.
(1) Street standards. As authorized by the traditional neighborhood
provisions of the State Municipalities Planning Code, the Board of
Supervisors shall have the authority to modify specific street
requirements of the Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance
to result in a development that is pedestrian-oriented and that
promotes low-speed traffic.
(a) For example, the Board of Supervisors may approve reduced
street cartway widths, street right-of-way widths and street
curve radii.
(b) The applicant shall submit a request for modifications in
writing, which shall state the reasons why the modification
would be consistent with the purposes for a traditional
neighborhood development as stated in the State
Municipalities Planning Code and would be in the public
interest while protecting public safety.
A. A flag lot is defined as a lot intended for a single-family detached
dwelling that does not meet the minimum required lot width at the
minimum front yard building setback line. A flag lot may involve a more
§ 285-39 WEST LAMPETER CODE § 285-40
278:522
narrow "flagpole" extension of the lot that includes a driveway that
connects the bulk of the lot to a street.
B. As a conditional use, the Board of Supervisors may approve the
subdivision of land to create a flag lot in response to a written request
that states the reasons why the flag lot is needed. A flag lot shall not be
used to increase the number of dwelling units that otherwise would be
allowed on a tract of land. A flag lot shall only be allowed if the
applicant proves that a flag lot is necessary to minimize the amount of
disturbance of natural features on the tract, such as steep slopes and
mature woodland.
C. A maximum of one flag lot shall be allowed in any subdivision or land
development, except that if a subdivision or land development involves
more than 50 dwelling units, then one flag lot may be approved for
every 50 dwelling units.
D. A lot that is deed-restricted or restricted by a conservation easement to
not include any building or that only includes a water supply well or
wastewater pumping station may be approved by the Township as a flag
lot as a permitted by right use.
E. If a flag lot is approved, the lot shall meet the minimum lot width
requirement at the proposed front yard building setback line, instead of
the minimum building setback line. The principal building shall only be
placed on portions of the lot where the minimum lot width requirement
is met.
F. The flag lot shall have a minimum of 25 feet of frontage along a public
street, measured at the street right-of-way line. The driveway and the
street frontage shall be part of the same lot as the proposed building
site. No portion of the flag lot shall be less than 25 feet in width.
G. A flag lot shall only be approved if the applicant agrees to place a
permanent deed restriction on the flag lot that prevents the future
subdivision of the flag lot.

ARTICLE IV
Additional Requirements for Specific Uses
§ 285-41. Applicability.
§ 285-42. Additional requirements for specific principal uses.
A. This article establishes additional specific requirements for certain
specific uses, in addition to the sign, parking, environmental and other
general requirements of this chapter and the requirements of each
district. Wherever two requirements conflict, the stricter requirement
shall apply.
(1) For uses allowed within a specific zoning district as special
exception uses, see also the procedures and standards in § 285-16.
For conditional uses, see also § 285-17.
A. Each of the following uses shall meet all of the following requirements
for that use:
(1) Adult use. (This is limited to the following: adult bookstore, adult
movie theater, massage parlor, or adult live entertainment facility.)
(a) Purposes. The regulations on adult uses are intended to serve
the following purposes, in addition to the overall objectives of
this chapter.
[1] To recognize the adverse secondary impacts of adult uses
that affect health, safety and general welfare concerns of
the Township. These secondary impacts have been
documented in research conducted across the nation.
These secondary impacts typically include, but are not
limited to, increases in criminal activity, increases in
activities that increase the risk of transmission of sexually
transmitted diseases, increases in activities that increase
the risk of transmission of other communicable diseases,
increases in blight, decreases in the stability of residential
neighborhoods and decreases in property values for
surrounding homes, and decreases in the marketability of
nearby commercial business space. The research
conducted across the nation concludes that adult uses
typically involve insufficient self-regulation to control
these secondary effects.
[2] To limit adult uses to locations where these secondary
impacts can be minimized, particularly as they affect
residential neighborhoods and commercial revitalization.
[3] To not attempt to suppress any activities protected by the
free speech protections of the State and U.S.
Constitutions, but instead to control secondary effects.
§ 285-41 WEAPONS § 285-42
278:525
(b) An adult use and its parking area shall not be located within
any of the following distances, whichever is most restrictive:
[1] Two hundred lineal feet from the lot line of an existing
dwelling;
[2] Two hundred lineal feet from the lot line of any residential
zoning district,
[3] One thousand lineal feet from the lot line of any primary or
secondary school, place of worship, library, public park,
day-care center or child nursery.
(c) No adult use shall be located within 200 lineal feet from any
existing adult use.
(d) A fifty-foot buffer yard shall be provided, regardless of zoning
district, along the side and rear lot lines. If such buffer area
does not include substantial mature trees that will be
preserved, it shall include continuous screening by evergreen
trees with an initial height of five feet.
(e) No pornographic material, displays or words shall be placed in
view of persons who are not inside of the establishment.
Definite precautions shall be made to prohibit minors from
entering the premises.
(f) No adult use shall be used for any purpose that violates any
federal, state or municipal law.
(g) Obscene or pornographic signs shall be prohibited.
(h) The adult use shall not include the sale or display of obscene
materials, as defined by Pennsylvania Criminal Law, as may be
amended by applicable court decisions.
(i) An adult use shall only be allowed within the I/M Zoning
District.
(j) A minimum lot area of two acres is required.
(k) For public health reasons, private or semiprivate viewing
booths of any kind are prohibited. This specifically includes,
but is not limited to, booths for viewing adult movies or nude
dancers.
(l) No use may include live actual or simulated sex acts nor any
physical or sexual contact between employees and entertainers
nor between employees or entertainers and customers. At an
adult live entertainment use, employees or entertainers shall
maintain a minimum distance of three feet from customers.
(m) Only "lawful" massages, as defined by state court decisions,
shall be performed in a massage parlor.
§ 285-42 WEST LAMPETER CODE § 285-42
278:526
(n) All persons within any adult use shall wear nontransparent
garments that cover their genitals and the female areola,
except within a permitted lawful adult live entertainment
facility.
(o) Any application for such use shall state the names and home
addresses of: a) all individuals intended to have more than a
five-percent ownership in such use or in a corporation owning
such use; and b) an on-site manager responsible to ensure
compliance with this chapter on a daily basis. Such information
shall be updated at the beginning of each year in writing to the
Zoning Officer.
(p) The use shall not operate between the hours of 12:00 midnight
and 7:00 a.m.
(q) As specific conditions of approval under this chapter, the
applicant shall prove compliance, where applicable, with the
following state laws, as amended: the Pennsylvania Liquor
Code, Act 219 of 1990 (which pertains to sale or consumption
of alcohol between 2:00 a.m. and 8:00 a.m.); Act 207 of 1990
(which pertains to obscenity); and Act 120 of 1996 (which
pertains to adult-oriented establishments and which limits
enclosed viewing booths, among other matters).
(r) An adult use shall not exist within the same building as a use
with a liquor license.
(s) The use shall comply with the Township Obscenity Ordinance
(Ordinance No. 86, 1986), as amended.123
(2) Adult day-care center.
(a) The use shall be fully licensed by the state, if required by the
state.
(b) The use shall include constant supervision during all hours of
operation.
(c) The use shall not meet the definition of a "treatment center."
(3) After-hours club. This use is effectively prohibited by State Act 219
of 1990, as amended (Section 7327 of Title 18 of the Pennsylvania
Statutes).
(4) Airport.
(a) As part of a conditional use approval, the Board of Supervisors
shall have the authority to establish reasonable conditions that
limit the types, sizes and weights of aircraft and the hours of
operation in order to minimize noise nuisances to dwellings.
123. Editor's Note: See Ch. 85, Adult Entertainment.
§ 285-42 WEAPONS § 285-42
278:527
(b) As part of a conditional use application, the applicant shall
provide evidence that flight patterns will be designed to
minimize noise nuisances to dwellings.
(c) Each end of a runway shall be set back a minimum of 200 feet
from all lot lines. Each side of a runway shall be set back a
minimum of 100 feet from all lot lines.
(5) Animal cemetery.
(a) All the regulations for a cemetery in this section shall apply.
(b) The applicant shall prove to the satisfaction of the Zoning
Officer that the use will be conducted in such a manner that
the public health and groundwater quality will not be
threatened.
(6) Assisted living facility/personal care center. The standards for
nursing homes in this section shall apply.
(7) Auto, boat or mobile/manufactured home sales.
(a) No vehicle, boat or home on display shall occupy any part of
the existing or future street right-of-way or required customer
parking area. See buffer yard provisions in § 285-65.

[1] In a district other than a commercial or industrial district,
the antenna shall extend a maximum of 20 feet beyond the
existing structure to which it is attached. The antenna
shall be attached to one of the following existing lawful
structures:
[a] A principal agricultural building or silo;
[b] An electric high voltage transmission tower;
[c] An existing lawful commercial communications tower;
[d] A fire station or steeple or bell tower of a place of
worship; or
[e] A water tower.
[2] In a commercial or industrial district, the antenna shall
extend a maximum of 40 feet beyond an existing building
or structure (other than a dwelling), provided the antenna
is set back a distance equal to its total height above the
ground from any lot line of a dwelling on another lot.
(b) Any commercial communications antenna/tower that does not
meet Subsection A(15)(a) above (such as a new freestanding
tower) shall only be allowed where specifically authorized in
§ 285-26 and in compliance with the following additional
regulations:
[1] Such antenna/tower shall be set back from all lot lines and
street rights-of-way a distance that is greater than the
total height of the antenna/tower above the surrounding
ground level. The Board of Supervisors may permit an
easement arrangement to be used without meeting the
setback requirement from the edge of the leased area,
provided that there are legal safeguards to ensure that the
setback will continue to be met over time from a lot line.
[2] A new tower, other than a tower on a lot of an emergency
services station, shall be set back the following minimum
distance from any existing dwelling: 300 feet plus the total
height of the tower above the surrounding ground level.

and evergreen plantings or preserved vegetation with an
initial minimum height of four feet.
[4] The applicant shall provide a written statement sealed by a
professional engineer stating that the communications
antenna/tower will meet the structural and wind
resistance requirements of the Construction Code.125
[5] The applicant shall describe in writing the policies that will
be used to offer space on a tower to other communications
providers, which shall serve to minimize the total number
of towers necessary in the region. This policy shall be
designed to minimize the total number of towers necessary
in the Township.
[6] An applicant for a new commercial communications tower
shall provide evidence to the Board of Supervisors (the
Board) that they have investigated collocating their
facilities on an existing tower and other tall structures and
have found such alternative to be unworkable. The reasons
shall be provided.
[7] A maximum total height of 200 feet above the ground shall
apply in a commercial and industrial district and 150 feet
in any other district where it may be allowed, unless the
applicant proves to the Board of Supervisors as a
conditional use that a taller height is absolutely necessary
and unavoidable.
[8] The application shall describe any proposed lighting. The
Board may require lighting of an antenna even if it will not
be required by the Federal Aviation Administration. Such
lighting is intended to provide protection for emergency
medical helicopters. Strobe lighting shall not be used, but
flashing lights may be used.
[9] A new tower shall be designed in a manner that minimizes
its visual intrusiveness and environmental impacts to the
maximum extent feasible. For example, monopole designs
or designs worked into a flagpole are preferred over lattice
designs. Self-supporting towers are preferred over towers
with guy wires that would require removal of larger
numbers of trees.
(c) Purposes. These provisions for commercial communications
antennas/towers are primarily designed to serve the following
purposes, in addition to the overall objectives of this chapter:
125. Editor's Note: See Ch. 120, Construction Codes, Uniform.
§ 285-42 WEAPONS § 285-42
278:535
[1] To protect property values.
[2] To minimize the visual impact of antennas/towers,
particularly considering the importance of the scenic
beauty of the area in attracting visitors for outdoor
recreation.

that still provides for adequate telecommunications
services and competition.
(d) A tower/antenna that is intended to primarily serve emergency
communications by a Township-recognized police, fire or
ambulance organization and is on the same lot as an
emergency services station shall be permitted by right. Such
tower/antenna may also serve commercial purposes.
(e) Any antenna and tower that is no longer in active use shall be
completely removed within six months after the discontinuance
of use. The operator shall notify the Zoning Officer in writing
after the antenna or tower use is no longer in active use. Any
lease shall require such removal by the owner of the antenna/
tower. Any lease should provide that the lease shall expire once
the antenna/tower is removed. The Board of Supervisors may
require that a financial guarantee be posted to pay for removal
of the tower if the Board determines such guarantee is needed.
(f) All accessory utility buildings or cabinets shall: have a
maximum total floor area of 400 square feet (which may
divided among adjacent buildings serving separate
companies), have a maximum height of 10 feet and meet
principal building setbacks.
(g) No new or existing antenna shall cause interference with
public safety telecommunications. The Township may require
the applicant for a new commercial communications tower to
submit a study by a radio frequency engineer or other qualified
professional to analyze the threat of interference. The study
shall also show that the tower and antenna will not create
interference with other communications systems, such as
amateur ham radio operators.

[1] These provisions shall not regulate the following:
[a] Cutting of up to 10% of trees with a trunk diameter of
six inches or greater (measured 3.5 feet above the
ground level) on a lot in any calendar year, provided
such cutting does not involve clear-cutting but instead
involves routine thinning of woods;
[b] Cutting of trees with a trunk diameter of less than six
inches (measured 3.5 feet above the ground level);
[c] Cutting of dead trees; and
[d] Cutting of trees that the applicant proves to the

Township-approved subdivision, land development,
street, driveway, building, utility or use.
(c) Application requirements. An application for timber harvesting
shall be made a minimum of 30 days prior to the start of work.
No forestry shall occur until a permit has been issued by the
Zoning Officer.
[1] The application shall include a written timbering plan,
which shall be prepared by a qualified professional. The
provisions of the plan shall be followed throughout the
operation. The plan shall be available for inspection at the
harvest site at all times during the operation.
[2] The landowner, the applicant and the timber operator shall
be jointly and separately responsible for complying with
the terms of the timber harvesting plan and permit.

278:561
[g] The application shall also include the name and
address of the property owner and the person who will
be responsible to oversee the timber harvesting.
[h] The application shall also show proposed erosion and
sedimentation control measures, proposed crossings
of waterways and proposed vehicle entrance and exit
points onto streets.
(e) Timber harvesting practices.
[1] Felling or skidding on or across any public thoroughfare is
prohibited without the express written consent of the
Township or PennDOT, whichever is responsible for
maintenance of the street.
[2] No tops or slash shall be left within 25 feet of any public
thoroughfare, property line or private roadway providing
access to adjoining residential property.
[3] All tops and slash between 25 and 50 feet from a public
street right-of-way or private road providing access to
adjoining residential property or within 50 feet of
adjoining residential property shall be lopped so that they
do not extend more than four feet above the surface of the
ground.
[4] Streams are an important natural resource that provide
for water quality, flood control, bank stabilization and
other ecological benefits. To insure their adequate
protection, timber harvesting is prohibited within 100 feet
of the top of the bank on each side of all perennial
waterways, except this distance may be reduced to 50 feet
if all of the following conditions are met:
[a] The basal area of trees in that area within the onehundred-
foot setback shall not be reduced below 50%
of the basal area present before cutting.

floodway. Unless fully delineated, a floodway shall be
assumed to be all that area within 50 feet from the center
of a waterway.
[6] The use of clear-cutting must be fully justified by a timber
harvesting plan prepared by a qualified professional.
§ 285-42 WEST LAMPETER CODE § 285-42
278:562
Detailed information concerning increased stormwater
runoff, erosion control and a plan to assure regeneration
shall be provided. Clear-cutting shall not be allowed on
contiguous areas greater than 1/2 acre. Clear-cutting shall
be prohibited on slopes greater than 25%.
[7] A twenty-foot minimum setback shall be maintained for
timber harvesting from a public street right-of-way and
from any lot line of property, except such lot line setback
shall not apply if the adjoining property owner provides a
written, notarized and signed waiver of the setback to the
Zoning Officer.
[8] If timber harvesting involves more than two acres, a
minimum of 30% of the forest cover (canopy) shall be kept
and the residual trees shall be well distributed to promote
reforestation.
(f) Public road responsibility. The landowner and the operator
shall be responsible for repairing any damage at locations of
entry or exit to Township roads caused by traffic associated
with the timber harvesting operation to the extent the damage
is in excess of that caused by normal traffic. The Township may
require the landowner or operator to furnish a bond to
guarantee the repair of such damages. Such bond shall remain
in full force until the Zoning Officer issues a written
notification that all provisions of this chapter and the permit
have been complied with. In lieu of such bond, the operator or
landowner may post a cash deposit or certified check with the
Township.

designed so that garages and/or carports are not an overly
prominent part of the view from public streets. For this reason,
parking courts, common garage or carport structures or
garages at the rear of dwellings are encouraged instead of
individual garages opening onto the front of the building,
especially for narrow townhouse units.
§ 285-42 WEAPONS § 285-42
278:563
(d) Mailboxes. Any mailboxes provided within the street right-ofway
should be clustered together in an orderly and attractive
arrangement or structure. Individual freestanding mailboxes of
noncoordinated types at the curbside are specifically
discouraged.

streets shall be minimized to the lowest reasonable number. No
townhouse dwelling within a tract of five or more dwelling
units shall have its own driveway entering onto an arterial or
collector street.
(f) Common open space. Unless a higher amount of open space is
required under the conservation development provisions, a
minimum of 30% of the total lot area of the development
involving townhouses and multifamily dwellings and their
accessory uses shall be set aside as common open space for the
residents. The applicant shall prove that these areas will be
suitable for active or passive recreation. This subsection shall
not apply to the neighborhood development option.
[1] If a development includes over 30 dwelling units that will
not be restricted to at least one resident age 55 and older
and will not be time-share dwellings, then the common
open space shall at a minimum include a rectangular grass
field 50 feet by 150 feet that is suitable for free play by
young persons. If all dwellings in a development will be
restricted to at least one resident age 55 and older, then
the common open space shall at a minimum include
landscaped trails that are ADA-accessible.
[2] A recreation building or pool available to all residents of
the development may count towards the open space
requirement. Areas with a width of less than 50 feet shall
not count towards this requirement. This requirement
shall be in place of any requirement for recreation land or
fees under the Subdivision and Land Development
Ordinance.128
(52) Treatment center.
(a) See definition in § 285-20.
(b) The applicant shall provide a written description of all

§ 285-44 WEAPONS § 285-47
278:585
A. Purpose and authorization.
(1) This section serves the following major purposes:
(a) Promote the general health, welfare, and safety of the
Township.
(b) Encourage the utilization of appropriate construction practices
in order to prevent or minimize flood damage in the future.
(c) Minimize danger to public health by protecting water supply
and natural drainage.
(d) Reduce financial burdens imposed on the Township and its
residents by preventing excessive development in areas
subject to flooding.
(e) Comply with federal and state floodplain management
requirements.
(2) The Legislature of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has, by the
passage of the Pennsylvania Flood Plain Management Act of 1978,
delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt
floodplain management regulations to promote public health,
safety, and the general welfare of its citizenry. The Board of
Supervisors has enacted this section in accordance with the Flood
Plain Management Act, the Second Class Township Code, and the
MPC.
B. FP Floodplain District applicability and administration.
(1) The regulations of the FP Floodplain District shall apply throughout
the entire Township as overlay zoning regulations that supplement
the zoning district regulations. Where the regulations of this
section differ from the regulations of any other section of this
chapter, the provision that is more restrictive on development shall
apply.
(a) The inclusion of construction and floodproofing standards in
this section shall not be interpreted to allow any structure or
construction that is not expressly authorized by this section. If
the Zoning Hearing Board grants a variance to allow a
structure or construction not authorized by this section, such
structure or construction shall comply with all construction
and floodproofing standards in this section unless the Zoning
Hearing Board also so grants a variance from a specific
construction or floodproofing standard.
(2) The degree of flood protection sought by the provisions of this
chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is
based on accepted engineering methods of study. Larger floods
may occur or flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by
§ 285-47 WEST LAMPETER CODE § 285-47
278:586
debris. This chapter does not imply that areas outside any
identified floodplain areas, or that land uses permitted within such
areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter
shall not create liability on the part of the Township or any officer
or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance
on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder.
(3) This section supersedes any other conflicting provisions which may
be in effect in identified floodplain areas. However, any other
ordinance provisions shall remain in full force and effect to the
extent that those provisions are more restrictive. If there is any
conflict between any of the provisions of this chapter and
provisions of other ordinances, the more restrictive shall apply.
(4) The Zoning Officer is hereby appointed to administer and enforce
this section and for all purposes shall be considered and may
sometimes be referred to as the Floodplain Administrator. The
Floodplain Administrator may fulfill the duties and responsibilities
set forth in these regulations, delegate duties and responsibilities
set forth in these regulations to qualified technical personnel, plan
examiners, inspectors, and other employees, or enter into a written
agreement or written contract with another agency or private
sector entity to administer specific provisions of these regulations.
Administration of any part of these regulations by another entity
shall not relieve the Township of its responsibilities pursuant to the
participation requirements of the National Flood Insurance
Program as set forth in the Code of Federal Regulations at 44 CFR
§ 59.22. In addition to the powers and duties generally set forth in
this chapter, when serving as Floodplain Administrator the Zoning
Officer shall have the following powers and duties:
(a) The Floodplain Administrator shall issue a permit only after it
has been determined that the proposed work to be undertaken
will be in conformance with the requirements of this and all
other applicable codes and ordinances.
(b) Prior to the issuance of any permit, the Floodplain
Administrator shall review the application for the permit to
determine if all other necessary government permits required
by state and federal laws have been obtained, such as those
required by the Pennsylvania Sewage Facilities Act (Act
1966-537, as amended); the Pennsylvania Dam Safety and
Encroachments Act (Act 1978-325, as amended); the
Pennsylvania Clean Streams Act (Act 1937-394, as amended);
and the U.S. Clean Water Act, Section 404, 33 U.S.C. § 1344.
No permit shall be issued until this determination has been
made. In the case of existing structures, prior to the issuance
of any permit the Floodplain Administrator shall also review
the history of repairs to the subject building so that any
§ 285-47 WEAPONS § 285-47
278:587
repetitive loss concerns can be addressed before the permit is
issued.
(c) During the construction period, the Floodplain Administrator
or other authorized official shall inspect the premises to
determine that the work is progressing in compliance with the
information provided on the permit application and with all
applicable Township ordinances. He/she shall make as many
inspections during and upon completion of the work as are
necessary.
(d) In the discharge of his/her duties, the Floodplain Administrator
shall have the authority to enter any building, structure,
premises or development in the identified floodplain area, upon
presentation of proper credentials, at any reasonable hour to
enforce the provisions of this section.
(e) In the event the Floodplain Administrator discovers that the
work does not comply with the permit application or any
applicable laws and ordinances, or that there has been a false
statement or misrepresentation by any applicant, the
Floodplain Administrator shall revoke the permit and report
such fact to the Board of Supervisors for whatever action it
considers necessary.
(f) The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain in perpetuity all
records associated with the requirements of this section
including, but not limited to, finished construction elevation
data, permitting, inspection and enforcement.
(g) The Floodplain Administrator is the official responsible for
submitting a biennial report to FEMA concerning Township
participation in the National Flood Insurance Program.
(h) The responsibility, authority and means to implement the
commitments of the Floodplain Administrator can be
delegated, but the ultimate responsibility lies with the Zoning
Officer.
(i) The Floodplain Administrator shall consider UCC
requirements.
C. Floodplain compliance.
(1) No structure shall be used or located, relocated, constructed,
reconstructed, enlarged or structurally altered or land used except
in full compliance with these floodplain regulations and other
provisions of applicable Township ordinances. A Township zoning
permit is required for any development within the one-hundredyear
floodplain.

278:588
(2) Any alteration to a waterway, drainage channel or the one-hundredyear
floodplain, including development, redirecting drainage ways,
changes in grade or filling in, shall only occur after a determination
by the Zoning Officer that all Township ordinances have been
complied with and after any needed state or federal permits are
received.
(3) Any municipality that will be affected by a change in an alteration
or relocation of a waterway shall be given prior notice of such
proposal, with copies of such notice provided to the DCED and
FEMA.

278:598
(a) Description. The areas identified as Zone A in the FIS which
are subject to inundation by the one-percent-annual-chance
flood event determined using approximate methodologies.
Because detailed hydraulic analyses have not been performed,
no BFEs or flood depths are shown.
(b) Special requirements.
[1] No new construction or development shall be located
within the area measured 50 feet landward from the topof-
bank of any watercourse, unless a permit is obtained
from the DEP Regional Office.
[2] When available, information from other federal, state, and
other acceptable sources shall be used to determine the
BFE, as well as a floodway area, if possible. When no other
information is available, the BFE shall be determined by
using a point on the boundary of the identified floodplain
area which is nearest the construction site in question.
[3] In lieu of the above, the Township may require the
applicant to determine the elevation with hydrologic and
hydraulic engineering techniques. Hydrologic and
hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by
professional engineers or others of demonstrated
qualifications, who shall certify that the technical methods
used correctly reflect currently accepted technical
concepts. Studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be
submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical
review by the Township.
(c) The provisions of § 285-47K(2)(c), (d), and (e), are applicable to
the approximate floodplain area.

occurred.
SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA)  An area in the floodplain
subject to a one-percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year.
It is shown on the FIRM as Zone A, AO, A1-A30, AE, A99, or AH.
START OF CONSTRUCTION  Includes substantial improvement and
other proposed new development and means the date the permit was
issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within
180 days from the date of the permit. The actual start means either
the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site,
such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the
construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation;
or the placement of a manufacture home on a foundation. Permanent
construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/
or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it
include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such
as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of
the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of
construction means the first, alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or
§ 285-47 WEAPONS § 285-47
278:613
§ 285-48. Noise.
other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects
the external dimensions of the building.
STRUCTURE  A walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid
storage tank that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured
home.
SUBDIVISION  A subdivision as defined in the MPC.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE  Damage from any cause sustained by a
structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its beforedamaged
condition would equal or exceed 50% or more of the market
value of the structure before the damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT  Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals
or exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure before the start of
construction of the improvement. This term includes structures which
have incurred substantial damage or repetitive loss, regardless of the
actual repair work performed. The term does not include either any
project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of
state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have
been identified by the Township code enforcement official and which
are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions.
UNIFORM CONSTRUCTION CODE (UCC)  The statewide building
code adopted by the Pennsylvania General Assembly in 1999 applicable
to new construction in all municipalities, whether administered by the
municipality, a third party or the Department of Labor and Industry.
Applicable to residential and commercial buildings, the UCC adopted
the International Residential Code (IRC) and the International Building
Code (IBC), by reference, as the construction standard applicable with
the state floodplain construction. For coordination purposes, references
to the above are made specifically to various sections of the IRC and
IBC.
VIOLATION  The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with the Township's floodplain management regulations.
A structure or other development without the elevation certificate,
other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in 44 CFR
§ 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e) (2), (e) (4), (e) (5) is presumed to
be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

lights needed for air safety nor lights intended solely to illuminate an
architectural feature of a building, nor lighting of outdoor public
recreation facilities or a ski resort.
C. Diffused. All light sources, including signs, shall be properly diffused as
needed with a translucent or similar cover to prevent exposed bulbs
from being directly visible from streets, public sidewalks, dwellings or
adjacent lots.
D. Shielding. All light sources, including signs, shall be shielded around
the light source and carefully directed and placed to prevent the
lighting from creating a nuisance to reasonable persons in adjacent
dwellings, and to prevent the lighting from shining into the eyes of
passing motorists.
E. Flickering. Flashing, flickering or strobe lighting are prohibited, except
for nonadvertising seasonal lights between October 25 and January 10.
F. Spillover. Exterior lighting on an institutional, commercial or industrial
property shall not cause a spillover of light onto a residential lot that
exceeds 0.5 horizontal footcandle at a distance 20 feet inside the
residential lot line.
G. Gasoline sales canopies. All light fixtures under the canopy shall be
recessed into the canopy or screened by an extension around the

exempt from the requirements of this subsection.
I. Nonhorizontal lighting. For lighting of predominantly nonhorizontal
surfaces, such as but not limited to facades, signs and displays, fixtures
shall be fully shielded and shall be installed and aimed so as to not
project their output into the windows of neighboring residences,
adjacent uses, past the object being illuminated, skyward or onto a
public roadway. Fixtures with an aggregate-rated lamp lumen output
per fixture that does not exceed the rated output of a standard onehundred-
watt incandescent lamp are exempt from the requirements of
this subsection.
(1) However, lighting shall be allowed of the United States flag from
dusk to dawn, provided the light source shall have a beam spread
no greater than necessary to illuminate the flag.

ARTICLE VI
Off-Street Parking and Loading
§ 285-51. Required number of parking spaces.
§ 285-52. General regulations for off-street parking.
A. Overall requirements.
(1) Number of spaces. Each use that is newly developed, enlarged,
significantly changed in type of use or increased in number of
establishments shall provide and maintain off-street parking spaces
in accordance with the Table of Off-Street Parking Requirements129
and the regulations of this article.
(2) Uses not listed. Uses not specifically listed in the Table of Off-Street
Parking Requirements shall comply with the requirements for the
most similar use listed in the table, unless the applicant proves to
the satisfaction of the Zoning Officer that an alternative standard
should be used for that use.
(3) Multiple uses. Where a proposed lot contains or includes more than
one type of use, the number of parking spaces required shall be the
sum of the parking requirements for each separate use.
(4) Parking landscaping. See §§ 285-65 and 285-66 of this chapter.
A. General. Parking spaces and accessways shall be laid out to result in
safe and orderly use, and to fully take into account all of the following:
vehicular access onto and off the site, vehicular movement within the
site, loading areas, pedestrian patterns and any drive-through facilities.
No parking area shall cause a safety hazard or impediment to traffic off
the lot.
B. Existing parking.
(1) Any parking spaces serving such preexisting structures or uses at
the time of adoption of this chapter shall not in the future be
reduced in number below the number required by this chapter.
(2) If a new principal nonresidential building is constructed on a lot,
then any existing parking on such lot that serves such building shall
be reconfigured to comply with this chapter, including but not
limited to requirements for channelization of traffic from adjacent
streets, channelization of traffic within the lot, minimum aisle
widths, paving and landscaping.
C. Change in use or expansion. A structure or use in existence at the
effective date of this chapter that expands or changes in use an existing
principal building shall be required to provide all of the required
129. Editor's Note: The Table of Off-Street Parking Requirements is included at the end of this
article.
§ 285-51 WEAPONS § 285-52
278:619
parking for the entire size and type of the resulting use, except as
follows:
(1) If an existing lawful use includes less parking than would be
required if the use would be newly developed, then that deficit of
parking shall be grandfathered for reuses of an existing building.
For example, an existing store might include three parking spaces
and would have been required to provide six spaces if it was newly
developed. Therefore, there is an existing nonconforming deficit of
four spaces. Then, if that store is converted to an office that would
need 10 spaces, the office would need to provide a total of six
spaces (10 spaces minus the preexisting deficit of four equals six).
(2) If a nonresidential use expands by an aggregate total maximum of
5% in the applicable measurement (such as building floor area)
beyond what existed at the time of adoption of this chapter, then no
additional parking is required. For example, if an existing building
included 3,000 square feet, and a single minor addition of 150
square feet was proposed, then additional parking would not be
required. This addition without providing new parking shall only be
allowed one time per lot.
D. Continuing obligation of parking and loading spaces. All required
numbers of parking spaces and off-street loading spaces shall be
available as long as the use or building which the spaces serve still
exist, and such spaces shall not be reduced in number below the
minimum required by this chapter. No required parking area or offstreet
loading spaces shall be used for any other use (such as storage or
display of materials) that interferes with the area's availability for
parking.
E. Location of parking.
(1) Required off-street parking spaces shall be on the same lot or
abutting lot with the principal use served, unless the applicant
proves to the satisfaction of the Zoning Hearing Board as a special
exception that a method of providing the spaces is guaranteed to be
available during all of the years the use is in operation within 300
feet walking distance from the entrance of the principal use being
served. Such distance may be increased to 500 feet for employee
parking of a nonresidential use. A written and signed lease shall be
provided, if applicable.
(a) The Zoning Hearing Board may require that the use be
approved for a period of time consistent with the lease of the
parking, and that a renewal of the permit shall only be
approved if the parking lease is renewed.
F. Reduction of parking requirements as a special exception.
§ 285-52 WEST LAMPETER CODE § 285-52
278:620
(1) Purposes: to minimize the amount of land covered by paving, while
making sure adequate parking is provided; to recognize that
unique circumstances may justify a reduction in parking.
(2) As a special exception, the Zoning Hearing Board may authorize a
reduction in the number of off-street parking spaces required to be
provided for a use if the applicant proves to the satisfaction of the
Zoning Hearing Board that a lesser number of spaces would be
sufficient.
(a) The applicant shall provide evidence justifying the proposed
reduced number of spaces, such as studies of similar
developments during their peak hours. The applicant shall also
provide relevant data, such as numbers of employers, peak
expected number of customers/visitors and similar data.
(b) Under this section, an applicant may prove that a reduced
number of parking spaces is justified because more than one
principal use will share the same parking. In such case, the
applicant shall prove that the parking has been designed to
encourage shared use and that long-term agreements ensure
that the parking will continue to be shared. The amount of the
reduction in parking should be determined based upon
whether the different uses have different hours of peak
demand and/or overlapping customers.
[1] In addition, an applicant may prove that parking needs will
be reduced or that off-site parking is feasible because the
applicant agrees to make a long-term commitment to a
shuttle service for residents or employees.
(c) Reserved area for additional parking. Under this section, the
Zoning Hearing Board may require that a portion of the
required parking be met through a reservation of an area for
future parking. The Board may require the reservation for a
certain number of years or an indefinite period corresponding
to the years the buildings are in use.
[1] Such reservation shall be in a form acceptable to the
Zoning Hearing Board Solicitor that legally binds current
and future owners of the land to keep the reserved parking
area in open space and then to provide the additional
parking if the Township determines it is necessary. A deed
restriction is recommended.
[2] If approved under this Subsection F(2)(c), the applicant
shall present a site plan to the Zoning Officer that shows
the layout that will be used for the additional parking if the
parking is required to be provided in the future. The site
plan shall show that the additional parking is integrated
with the overall traffic access and pedestrian access for
§ 285-52 WEAPONS § 285-52
278:621
§ 285-53. Design standards for off-street parking.
the site and that the additional parking will be able to meet
Township requirements.
[3] The additional parking that is reserved under this
subsection shall be required to be kept as landscaped open
area until such time as the Zoning Hearing Board decision
may authorize the land's release from the restriction or
until the Township may require that the land be developed
as parking.
[4] The Zoning Officer shall periodically review the sufficiency
of the parking that is provided. If the Zoning Officer in the
future determines that the reserved parking is needed to
meet actual demand, he/she shall provide written notice to
the property owner. The property owner shall then have
one year to develop the reserved area into off-street
parking in compliance with this chapter.
A. General requirements.
(1) Backing onto a street. No parking area shall be designed to require
or encourage parked vehicles to back into a public street in order
to leave a parking space, except for a single-family or two-family
dwelling with its access onto a local street or parking court.
Parking spaces may back onto an alley.
(2) Every required parking space shall be designed so that each motor
vehicle may proceed to and from the parking space provided for it
without requiring the moving of any other vehicle, unless
specifically permitted otherwise.
(3) Parking areas shall not be within a required buffer yard or street
right-of-way.
(4) Separation from street. Except for parking spaces immediately in
front of individual dwellings, all areas for off-street parking, offstreet
loading and unloading and the storage or movement of motor
vehicles shall be physically separated from the street by a
continuous grass or landscaped planting strip, except for necessary
and approved vehicle entrances and exits to the lot.
(5) Stacking and obstructions. Each lot shall provide adequate area
upon the lot to prevent backup of vehicles on a public street while
awaiting entry to the lot or while waiting for service at a drivethrough
facility.
B. Size and marking of parking spaces.
§ 285-52 WEST LAMPETER CODE § 285-53
278:622
(1) Each parking space shall be a rectangle with a minimum width of
nine feet and a minimum length of 18 feet, except the minimumsized
rectangle shall be eight feet by 22 feet for parallel parking.
(2) For handicapped spaces, see Subsection F below.
(3) All spaces shall be marked to indicate their location, except those
of a one- or two-family dwelling.
C. Aisles.
(1) Each aisle providing for one-way traffic to access parking stalls
shall have the following minimum mso-element-frame width:
Angle of Parking
(degrees)
Minimum Aisle Width
(feet)
Parallel or 30 12
45 14
60 18
90 20
(2) Each aisle providing access to stalls for two-way traffic shall be a
minimum of 22 feet in width, except a width of 20 feet may be
allowed for parking areas with spaces that are parallel or involve
an angle of parking of 45° or less.
D. Accessways and driveways.
(1) Width of driveway/accessway at entrance onto a public street, at
the edge of the cartway:*
1-Way Use 2-Way Use
Minimum 12 feet * 25 feet *
Maximum 20 feet * 30 feet *
* Unless a different standard is required by PennDOT for an
entrance to a state road or the applicant proves to the
satisfaction of the Zoning Officer that a wider width is needed
for tractor-trailer trucks.
(2) Drainage. Adequate provisions shall be made to maintain
uninterrupted parallel drainage along a public street at the point of
driveway entry. The Township may require an applicant to install an
appropriate type and size of pipe at a driveway crossing.
(3) Residential driveways: see § 285-70. [Added 12-10-2007 by Ord.
No. 202]
E. Paving, grading and drainage.
§ 285-53 WEAPONS § 285-53
278:623
(1) Parking and loading facilities, including driveways, shall be graded
and adequately drained to prevent erosion or excessive water flow
across streets or adjoining properties.
(2) Except for landscaped areas, all portions of required parking,
loading facilities and driveways shall be surfaced with asphalt,
concrete, paving block or other low-dust materials preapproved by
the Township.
(a) However, by special exception, the Zoning Hearing Board may
allow parking areas with low or seasonal usage to be
maintained in stone, grass or other suitable surfaces. For
example, the Board may allow parking spaces to be grass,
while major aisles are covered by stone.
(b) If the design and material are found acceptable by the
Township Engineer, portions of parking areas may be covered
with a low-dust porous parking surface that is designed to
promote groundwater recharge. This might include porous
asphalt or pervious concrete placed over open graded gravel
and crushed stone. Porous parking surfaces shall not be
allowed in areas routinely used by heavy trucks.
(c) Curbing should not be required in parking areas except where
absolutely necessary to control stormwater runoff.
F. Lighting of parking areas. See "light and glare control" in Article V.130
G. Parking for persons with disabilities/handicapped parking.
(1) Number of spaces. Any lot including four or more off-street parking
spaces shall include a minimum of one handicapped space. The
following number of handicapped spaces shall be provided, unless
a different number of spaces is officially required under the Federal
Americans With Disabilities Act:
Total No. of
Parking Spaces on
the Lot

1,001 or more 20 plus 1% of required number of spaces
over 1,000
(2) Location. Handicapped parking spaces shall be located where they
would result in the shortest reasonable accessible distance to a
handicapped-accessible building entrance. Curb cuts shall be
provided as needed to provide access from the handicapped
spaces.
(3) Minimum size. Each required handicapped parking space shall be
eight feet by 18 feet. In addition, each space shall be adjacent to a
five feet wide access aisle. Such access aisle may be shared by two
handicapped spaces by being placed between them. However, one
out of every eight required handicapped parking spaces shall have
an adjacent access aisle of eight-foot width instead of five feet.
(4) Slope. Handicapped parking spaces shall be located in areas of less
than 2% slope in any direction.
(5) Marking. All required handicapped spaces shall be well-marked by
clearly visible signs and by pavement markings. Such signs and
markings shall be maintained over time. Blue paint is
recommended. The amount of the fine for violations shall be noted
on signs that are visible to persons parking in the space.
(6) Paving. Handicapped parking spaces and adjacent areas needed to
access them with a wheelchair shall be covered with a smooth
surface that is usable with a wheelchair.
H. Paved area setbacks (including off-street parking setbacks).
(1) Intent. To ensure that parked or moving vehicles within a lot do not
obstruct sight distance or interfere with pedestrian traffic, to aid in
stormwater management along streets and to prevent vehicles
from entering or exiting a lot other than at approved driveways.
(2) Any new or expanded paved area serving a principal nonresidential
use shall be separated from a public street by a planting strip. The
planting strip shall have a minimum width of 15 feet and be
maintained in grass or other attractive vegetative ground cover. At
least 10 feet of the planting strip shall be outside of the existing
street right-of-way. This fifteen-foot width shall be increased to 20
feet for a lot including 100 to 250 parking spaces and to 25 feet for
a lot including more than 250 parking spaces.
§ 285-53 WEAPONS § 285-53
278:625
§ 285-54. Off-street loading.
(a) The planting strip shall not include heights or locations of
plants that would obstruct safe sight distances but may include
deciduous trees that motorists can view under the leaf canopy.
(b) The planting strip may be placed inward from the shoulder of
an uncurbed street or inward from the curb of a curbed street.
The planting strip may overlap the street right-of-way, provided
it does not conflict with PennDOT requirements, and provided
that the Township and PennDOT, as applicable, maintain the
right to replace planting areas within the right-of-way with
future street improvements.
(c) Township-approved sidewalks, recreation paths and
approximately perpendicular driveway crossings may be
placed within the planting strip. Mostly vegetative stormwater
channels may be placed within the planting strip.
(d) The following shall be prohibited within the planting strip:
[1] Paving, except as allowed by Subsection H(2)(c) above,
and except for street widenings that may occur after the
development is completed;
[2] Fences; and
[3] Parking, storage or display of vehicles or items for sale or
rent.
(e) Where feasible, where a sidewalk is not installed, this setback
should include an unobstructed generally level width running
parallel to a street that is suitable for a person to walk.
(3) See landscaping requirements in §§ 285-65 and 285-66.
I. Parking set back from buildings. Parking spaces serving principal
nonresidential buildings and apartment buildings shall be located a
minimum of 10 feet from any principal building wall, unless a larger
distance is required by another provision. This distance shall not apply
at vehicle entrances into or under a building.
J. Speed bumps. Speed bumps, speed tables and similar raised areas to
reduce speeds shall be allowed on private streets and parking areas,
provided the raised area is maintained in a highly visible color or
pavement markings and a sign warns motorists of the raised pavement.
A. Each use shall provide off-street loading facilities, which meet the
requirements of this section, sufficient to accommodate the maximum
demand generated by the use and the maximum size vehicle in a
manner that will not routinely obstruct traffic on a public street and
traffic entering and exiting the lot. If no other reasonable alternative is
feasible, traffic may be obstructed for occasional loading and unloading
§ 285-53 WEST LAMPETER CODE § 285-54
278:626
§ 285-55. Fire lanes and access.
along an alley, provided traffic has the ability to use another method of
access.
B. At the time of review under this chapter, the applicant shall provide
evidence to the Zoning Officer on whether the use will have sufficient
numbers and sizes of loading facilities. The Planning Commission and/
or Board of Supervisors may provide advice to the Zoning Officer on
this matter as part of any plan review by such boards. For the purposes
of this section, the words "loading" and "unloading" are used
interchangeably.
C. Each space and the needed maneuvering room shall not intrude into
approved buffer areas and landscaped areas.
A. Fire lanes shall be provided where required by state or federal
regulations or other local ordinances.
B. Access shall also be provided so that fire equipment can reach all sides
of principal nonresidential buildings and multifamily/apartment
buildings. This access shall be able to support a loaded fire pumper
truck but shall not necessarily be paved.
C. The specific locations of fire lanes and fire equipment access are
subject to approval by the Township, after review by local fire officials.

1 In the MS, MSL or NC District, up to 10 square feet of the allowed building sign area
may be used for a sign that projects outward perpendicular to the front of the building.
Such sign shall project a maximum of four feet from the side of the building and shall
not be internally illuminated. See Note 5 below, which provides an exception from the
setback from the right-of-way. A projecting sign face shall have an appearance similar
to relief-cut wood or a fabric banner hung from a post. See minimum clearance in
§ 285-59A(14). See also Sidewalk Signs in Table 2.
2 The area permitted on each street frontage is 40 square feet for street frontage up
to 80 feet, plus 1 square foot per two feet of street frontage over 80 feet, up to a
maximum of 80 square feet. If a lot includes 10 or more separate establishments, then
a maximum sign area of 100 square feet shall be allowed on each street frontage, if the
additional sign area is used to identify the various establishments.

and delivery persons.
4 A home occupation sign shall be limited to the following information: name, an
address, telephone number, an occupation or activity, and a logo or trademark; there
may be no internal or spotlit illumination, except that a sign for a medical office or
emergency service may be externally illuminated when the business is open. The sign
shall have a maximum sign area of two square feet on a maximum of two sides. The
sign shall have a maximum height of six feet. The sign may be attached to a building,
a mailbox, a light post or a freestanding post. [Amended 12-10-2007 by Ord. No.

278:652
ARTICLE VIII
General Regulations
§ 285-63. Frontage onto improved streets; number of uses or
buildings; minimum size of dwellings.
A. Frontage required onto improved street. Each proposed new lot, each
land development and each proposed principal building shall be on a lot
which directly abuts a public street, a street proposed to be dedicated
to the Township by the subdivision plan which created or creates such
lot, or a private street which meets all of the requirements of the
Township Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance.134 In the case
of townhouses, manufactured/mobile home park or apartments, each
unit may have access onto a parking court which then has access onto a
public or private street meeting Township standards.
B. Number of principal uses and principal buildings per lot.
(1) A lot in a commercial or industrial district may include more than
one permitted principal use per lot and/or more than one permitted
principal building per lot, provided that all of the requirements are
met for each use and each building. If differing dimensional
requirements apply for different uses on the lot, then the most
restrictive requirement shall apply.
(a) For example, if Use One requires a one-acre lot area and Use
Two on the same lot requires a two-acre lot area, then the lot
shall have a minimum lot area of two acres.
(b) The applicant shall submit a site plan that demonstrates that
each structure would meet the requirements of this chapter.
(c) The uses and buildings shall be in common ownership.
However, a condominium form of ownership of individual
buildings, with a legally binding property owners' association,
may be established if the applicant proves to the satisfaction of
the Zoning Officer, based upon review by the Township
Solicitor, that there will be appropriate legal mechanisms in
place.
(2) A lot within a residential district shall not include more than one
principal use and shall not include more than one principal building
unless specifically permitted by this chapter.
(a) A manufactured/mobile home park, condominium residential
development or apartment development may include more
than one principal building per lot, provided all other
requirements of this chapter are met. A condominium form of
ownership of individual dwelling units, with a legally binding
homeowners' association, may be established if the applicant
134. Editor's Note: See Ch. 240, Subdivision and Land Development.
§ 285-63 WEAPONS § 285-63
278:653
§ 285-64. Height exceptions.
The maximum structure height specified for each district shall not apply
to: antenna that meet the requirements of this chapter, water towers, clock
or bell towers, steeples of places of worship, electrical transmission lines,
elevator shafts, windmills, skylights, chimneys or other appurtenances
usually required to be and customarily placed above the roof level and
not intended for human occupancy. See also the definition of "height" in
§ 285-20 and provisions in § 285-27B.
§ 285-65. Special lot and yard requirements, sight distance and
buffer yards.
proves to the satisfaction of the Zoning Officer, based upon
review by the Township Solicitor, that there will be appropriate
legal mechanisms in place and compliance with applicable
state law.
(b) A lot may include two single-family detached dwellings if the
requirements are met so a subdivision could occur in the future
so that each single-family detached dwelling could be on its
own conforming lot. For example, each dwelling unit shall be
able to meet minimum lot area, yards and lot width if the
dwelling would be subdivided onto its own lot. See also
provisions for the A District in § 285-35.
C. Minimum size of dwellings. Each dwelling unit shall include a minimum
of 600 square feet of enclosed habitable, indoor, heated floor area,
which shall be primarily above the ground level.
D. Maximum occupancy. No recreational vehicle shall be occupied on a lot
for more than 30 days in a calendar year, except as may be approved
within a campground with suitable central water and sewage service.
No mobile/manufactured home shall be occupied on a lot as a dwelling
unless it meets all of the requirements for a dwelling.
A. In general.
(1) No lot, structure or use shall be created or developed in such a way
that it would result in another lot, building or use not being able to
meet the requirements of this chapter. This includes, but is not
limited to, setback areas, non-impervious areas and off-street
parking areas.
(2) Emergency access. All uses and structures shall have adequate
provisions for access by emergency vehicles and fire ladders. Such
access shall be maintained in a passable condition by the owner of
the lot or, where applicable, by the property owners' association.
B. Exceptions to minimum lot areas, lot widths and yards.
§ 285-63 WEST LAMPETER CODE § 285-65
278:654
(1) Corner lots. For a corner lot, each yard that abuts a public street
shall be considered a front yard and meet the requirements for
minimum depth of a front yard. See definition of "lot, corner" in
§ 285-20.
(2) Projections into required yards.
(a) Cornices, eaves, roof overhangs, sills or other similar
architectural features, exterior stairways, unenclosed fire
escapes or other required means of egress, rain leads,
chimneys, Bilko-type doors for basement access, window
awnings, chaise for heating pipes, or other similar structures
that do not include space usable by persons, may extend or
project into a required yard not more than three feet, except as
may be required within a drainage or utility easement.
(b) Steps, stoops, fire escapes, handicapped ramps, and landings
necessary to provide entrance to a building may be located
within a required setback area.
(c) For decks and porches: see § 285-27.
(3) Lot widths around curves. Around the bulb of a cul-de-sac street or
on the outside of the curve of a street with a radius of less than 150
feet, the minimum lot width at the minimum building setback line
may be reduced to 60% of the width that would otherwise be
required.
(4) Front setback or buildings on built-up streets. Where at least two
adjacent buildings within 100 feet of a property are set back a
lesser distance than required, the average of the lesser distances
becomes the required minimum front setback for the property.
[Added 12-10-2007 by Ord. No. 202]
C. Sight clearance.
(1) See the sight clearance triangles and sight distance required in the
Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance.135
(2) The following minimum sight clearance triangle shall apply for
driveways onto a street:
(a) Driveways shall be located and constructed so that a clear
sight triangle of 75 feet, as measured along the street center
line, and five feet along the driveway center line is maintained;
no permanent obstructions shall be placed within this area at a
height of between three and 10 feet above the ground level.

§ 285-65 WEAPONS § 285-65
278:655
D. Buffer yards. Buffer yards and screening complying with the following
standards shall be required under the following situations, unless a
more restrictive provision is established by another section of this
chapter:
(1) A minimum thirty-foot-wide buffer yard with plant screening shall
be required along the rear and side lot lines of any lot used
primarily for principal nonresidential purposes that is contiguous
to a residentially zoned lot. A lot used primarily for principal
nonresidential purposes that is contiguous to a lot occupied by an
existing principal dwelling shall provide a plant screen in
accordance with § 285-65D(6). [Amended 12-10-2007 by Ord.
No. 202]
(a) If a principal business use will include areas used for
manufacturing or will have a loading dock that will be routinely
serviced by tractor-trailer trucks or refrigerated trucks, then
the minimum buffer yard width along such manufacturing area
and/or loading dock shall be increased to 70 feet, and the
minimum initial height of plantings shall be increased to eight
feet.
(b) If a lot will include more than 100,000 square feet of business
building floor area, then the minimum buffer yard width shall
be increased to 70 feet and the minimum initial height of
plantings shall be increased to eight feet.
(c) If a dwelling will be on the same lot as a principal business use,
then a buffer yard shall not be required by this section.
§ 285-65 WEST LAMPETER CODE § 285-65
278:656
(d) A ten-foot minimum buffer yard with landscaped screening
shall be required where a subdivision or land development of
new dwellings will have rear yards abutting a public street or
expressway.
(e) A buffer yard is required to be provided by the following, if they
are abutting and visible from a public street:
[1] Along lot lines of any newly developed or expanded
outdoor industrial storage or loading area; or
[2] Along lot lines of any newly developed or expanded area
routinely used for the overnight parking of two or more
tractor-trailer trucks or trailers of tractor-trailers.
(2) A required yard may overlap a required buffer yard, provided the
requirement for each is met. The buffer yard shall be measured
from the district boundary line, street right-of-way line or lot line,
whichever is applicable. Required plantings shall not be placed
within the right-of-way, except that the Township may allow
deciduous canopy trees.
(3) The buffer yard shall be a landscaped area free of structures,
dumpsters, commercial or industrial storage, or display, signs,
manufacturing or processing activity, materials, loading and
unloading areas or vehicle parking or display.
(4) Fence. Any fence in a buffer yard shall be placed on the inside
(nonresidential side) of any required plant screening. If a fence in a
buffer yard has one side that is more finished or smoother than the
other side, the more finished or smoother side shall face the outside
of the buffer yard.
(5) A well or septic system may be placed within a buffer yard,
provided the landscaping and tree preservation provisions are still
met.
(6) Each planting screen shall meet the following requirements:
(a) Plant materials needed to form the visual screen shall have a
minimum height when planted of five feet. In addition, an
average of one deciduous shade tree, with a minimum trunk
diameter of two inches measured six inches above the finished
ground level, shall be placed for each 40 feet of length of the
buffer yard. The shade trees may be clustered or spaced
unevenly.
(b) Plants needed to form the visual screen shall be of such
species, spacing and size as can reasonably be expected to
produce within three years a mostly solid year-round visual
screen at least six feet in height.
§ 285-65 WEAPONS § 285-65
278:657
(c) The plant screen shall be placed so that at maturity the plants
will not obstruct a street or sidewalk.
(d) The plant visual screen shall extend the full length of the lot
line, except for: 1) Township-approved points of approximately
perpendicular vehicle or pedestrian ingress and egress to the
lot; 2) locations necessary to comply with safe sight distance
requirements where the plantings cannot feasibly be moved
further back; and 3) locations needed to meet other specific
state, Township and utility requirements, such as stormwater
swales.
(e) American Arborvitae and similar weak-stem plants shall not be
used to meet the buffer yard requirements. A monotonous
straight row of the same species is discouraged. A more
naturalistic form of planting is encouraged with a mix of
species. If more than 20 evergreen plants are proposed, no
more than 50% shall be of one species.
(f) Evergreen trees should be planted at diagonal offsets so that
there is room for future growth of the trees.
(g) The plant screening shall primarily use evergreen trees.
(h) If existing healthy trees with a trunk diameter of six inches or
greater (measured 4.5 feet above the ground level) exist within
the buffer yard, they shall be preserved. The Zoning Officer
may certify that preserving existing mature trees and shrubs
within the buffer yard will meet the same purposes as the new
plant screening. In such case, part or all of the new plant
screening may be waived in writing by the Zoning Officer.
(i) The use of earth berms in combination with landscaping is
encouraged within buffer yards to provide additional
protection to dwellings and residential areas.
(j) If a residential lot abuts a street along its front lot line and
another street along its rear lot line, then a buffer yard with
plant screening shall be required along the rear lot line. This
provision shall not apply for an alley.
(7) Buffer yard plans.
(a) Prior to the issuance of a permit under this chapter, where a
buffer yard would be required and on any required subdivision
or land development plan, the applicant shall submit plans
showing:
[1] The location and arrangement of each buffer yard;
[2] The placement, general selection of species and initial size
of all plant materials; and
§ 285-65 WEST LAMPETER CODE § 285-65
278:658
§ 285-66. Landscaping.
[3] The placement, size, materials and type of all fences to be
placed in such buffer yard.
A. Any part of a commercial, industrial, institutional or apartment lot
which is not used for structures, loading areas, parking spaces and
aisles, sidewalks and designated storage areas shall be provided with
an all-season, well-maintained vegetative ground cover and shall be
landscaped with trees and shrubs. Landscaped areas shall be kept free
of debris, rubbish and noxious weeds.
B. See also the buffer yard provisions in § 285-65.
C. Street trees. As part of the creation of a new lot or the construction of a
new principal nonresidential building or development of parking area
for six or more parking spaces, deciduous shade street trees shall be
planted between such lot lines, building and/or parking area and any
adjacent public street(s). This requirement shall not apply along street
segments where existing healthy trees will be preserved and protected
during construction that will serve the same purpose.
(1) Number. A minimum average of one such tree shall be planted for
each 50 feet of length of street right-of-way around the lot.
(2) Location. Such trees shall be placed immediately outside of the
street right-of-way or an alternative location acceptable to the
Board of Supervisors.
(3) Ordinance. Such street trees shall be planted in a manner approved
by the Township Engineer to avoid conflicts with sidewalks and
utilities.
(4) Buffer. Where shade trees may be required under the buffer yard
provisions, the same tree may be used to count towards both
requirements.
(5) The street trees shall meet the requirements of Subsection D.
D. Parking lot landscaping.
(1) A minimum of one deciduous tree shall be required for every 15
new off-street parking spaces.
(2) If a lot will include 30 or more new parking spaces, landscaped
islands shall be provided within automobile parking areas.
Otherwise, the trees may be planted around the parking area.
(3) Deciduous trees required by this section shall meet the following
standards:
(a) Type of trees permitted. Required trees shall be chosen from
the following list of approved street trees, unless the applicant
§ 285-65 WEAPONS § 285-66
278:659
proves to the satisfaction of the Zoning Officer that another
type of tree would shade paved areas, be resistant to disease,
road salt and air pollution, and be attractive.

(b) Quality of trees. Required trees shall be of symmetrical growth
and free of insect pests and disease.
(c) Minimum size. The trunk diameter (measured at a height of six
inches above the finished grade level) shall be a minimum of
two inches or greater.
(d) Planting and maintenance. Required trees shall be:
§ 285-66 WEST LAMPETER CODE § 285-66
278:660
§ 285-67. Nonconformities.
[1] Planted in conformance with good landscaping practices,
with adequate unpaved surface around each for water and
air; and
[2] Properly protected by curbs, curbstops, distance or other
devices from damage from vehicles.
E. Parking lot landscaping. A minimum vegetative area shall be provided
that includes at least a three-foot minimum radius around all sides of
the trunk of each required deciduous tree within or adjacent to a
parking lot.
F. Review and approval. Where landscaping is required by this chapter,
the applicant shall submit a landscaping plan, in addition to a site plan,
showing proposed initial sizes, locations and species of plantings.
G. Landscaping maintenance. All shade tree, buffer yard and other
landscaping required by this chapter shall be perpetually maintained by
the property owner. Any landscaping needed to meet an ordinance
requirement that dies, is removed or is severely damaged shall be
replaced by the current property owner, on a one-to-one basis, as soon
as is practical considering growing seasons, within a maximum of 150
days.
A. Proof and registration of nonconformities. It shall be the responsibility
of, with the burden of proof upon, a party asserting a nonconformity to
provide the evidence that it is lawful. A property owner may request a
written statement of nonconformity from the Zoning Officer after
providing sufficient evidence.
B. Continuation of nonconformities.
(1) A lawful nonconforming use, structure or lot as defined by this
chapter may be continued and may be sold and continued by new
owners.
(2) Any expansion of, construction upon or change in use of a
nonconformity shall only occur in conformance with this section.
(3) If an existing use was not lawfully established, it shall not have any
right to continue as a nonconforming use.
C. Expansion of or construction upon nonconformities. The following shall
apply, unless the structure is approved under Subsection D.
(1) Nonconforming structure (including a dimensionally
nonconforming structure).
(a) The Zoning Officer shall permit a nonconforming structure to
be reconstructed or expanded, provided:
§ 285-66 WEAPONS § 285-67
278:661
[1] That such action will not increase the severity or amount
of the nonconformity (such as the area of the building
extending into the required yard) or create any new
nonconformity; and
[2] That any expanded area will comply with the applicable
setbacks in that district and other requirements of this
chapter.
(b) In the case of a nonconforming structure which is used by a
nonconforming use, any expansion shall also meet the
requirements of this section regarding nonconforming uses.
(2) Nonconforming lots.
(a) Permitted construction on a nonconforming lot. A single
permitted-by-right principal use and its customary accessory
uses may be constructed, reconstructed or expanded on a
nonconforming lot, provided all of the following additional
requirements are met:
[1] The lot must be a lawful nonconforming lot of record;
[2] Minimum setback requirements shall be met;
[3] State and federal wetland regulations shall be met;
[4] If a septic or well is used, the requirements for such shall
be met.
[5] The lot must be held in single and separate ownership
from any other nonconforming lot.
(b) Lot width. The fact that an existing lawful lot of record does not
meet the minimum lot width requirements of this chapter shall
not by itself cause such lot to be considered to be a
nonconforming lot.
(3) Expansion of a nonconforming nonresidential use. A
nonconforming use or a building used by a nonconforming use shall
not be expanded except in accordance with the following
provisions:
(a) An expansion of more than 5% in total building floor area shall
require special exception approval from the Zoning Hearing
Board under Article I.
(b) Such reconstruction or expansion shall be only upon the same
lot that the nonconforming use was located upon at the time
the use became nonconforming.
(c) The total building floor area used by a nonconforming use or
the total land area covered by the nonconforming use,
whichever is more restrictive, shall not be increased by greater
§ 285-67 WEST LAMPETER CODE § 285-67
278:662
than 50% beyond what existed in the nonconforming use at the
time the use first became nonconforming.
[1] The above maximum increase shall be measured in
aggregate over the entire life of the nonconformity. All
expansions of the nonconforming use and/or building(s)
that occurred since the use originally became
nonconforming shall count towards the above maximum
increase.
(d) Any expansion of a nonconforming use shall meet the required
setbacks and other requirements of this chapter, unless the
Zoning Hearing Board grants a variance.
(4) Expansion of a nonconforming residential use. An existing
nonconforming residential use may be expanded as a permitted by
right use, provided that: a) the number of dwelling units or rooming
house units are not increased; b) the expansion meets all applicable
setbacks; c) no new types of nonconformities are created; and d) a
nonconformity is not made more severe. A lawfully nonconforming
dwelling in a business district may follow the dimensional
requirements for the R-2 District and may add customary accessory
uses.
(5) Nonconforming sign. The provisions of this chapter shall not
provide a right to expand or extend a nonconforming sign. Instead,
any expansions or extensions of a nonconforming sign shall comply
with this chapter.
D. Damaged or destroyed nonconformities. A nonconforming structure or
nonconforming use that has been destroyed or damaged may be rebuilt
in a nonconforming fashion only if: 1) the application for a building
permit is submitted within 18 months after the date of damage or
destruction; 2) work begins in earnest within 12 months afterwards and
continues; and 3) no nonconformity may be newly created or increased
by any reconstruction. The property shall be properly secured during
such time in such a way to keep out trespassers and to avoid harm to
neighboring properties.
E. Abandonment of a nonconformity.
(1) If a nonconforming use of a building or land is discontinued, razed,
removed or abandoned for 12 or more months, subsequent use of
such building or land shall conform with the regulations of the
district in which it is located, except:
(a) As provided for in the "Damaged or destroyed
nonconformities" provisions of Subsection D.
(2) The applicant shall be responsible to provide clear and convincing
evidence that the nonconformity was not abandoned.
§ 285-67 WEAPONS § 285-67
278:663
§ 285-68. Dumpster screening and location.
(3) An existing lawful separate dwelling unit may be unrented for any
period of time without being considered abandoned under this
chapter.
F. Changes from one nonconforming use to another:
(1) Once changed to a conforming use, a structure or land shall not
revert to a nonconforming use. The approval to establish a
substituted use shall completely extinguish the right to the
previous nonconforming use.
(2) A nonconforming use may be changed to a different nonconforming
use only if approved as a special exception by the Zoning Hearing
Board. However, special exception approval is not needed for a
simple change within an existing building from one lawful
nonconforming retail store use to another retail store use or from
one lawful nonconforming personal service use to another personal
service use, provided that the new use complies with any Zoning
Hearing Board conditions that applied to the previous use and is
not more objectionable in external effects than the previous use.
(3) Where special exception approval is required for a change of a
nonconforming use, the Board shall determine whether the
applicant has provided sufficient proof to show that the proposed
new use will be equal or less objectionable in external effects than
the preexisting nonconforming use with regard to:
(a) Traffic safety and generation (especially truck traffic);
(b) Noise, dust, fumes, vapors, gases, odor, glare, vibration, fire,
hazardous substances, and explosive hazards;
(c) Amount and character of outdoor storage;
(d) Hours of operation if the use would be close to dwellings; and
(e) Compatibility with the character of the surrounding area.
(4) A nonconforming use shall not be changed to a nonconforming
adult use.
G. District changes. Any uses, structures or lots that become
nonconforming because of a zoning district change shall be regulated
under this section on nonconformities.
A. Any newly placed solid waste dumpster shall be screened on at least
three of four sides, as necessary to screen views from public streets and
dwellings.
§ 285-67 WEST LAMPETER CODE § 285-68
278:664
§ 285-69. Minimum setbacks from existing streets.
§ 285-70. Driveways.
B. Such screening shall consist of decorative masonry walls, mostly solid
weather-resistant wood fencing, fencing of a similar appearance (such
as solid vinyl post), or primarily evergreen plantings.
C. Setback from dwellings. An outdoor solid waste container (other than
for paper or cardboard) with a capacity of over 30 cubic feet shall be
kept a minimum of 20 feet from the lot line of a dwelling on an abutting
lot.
D. If a solid waste dumpster is moved from one part of a lot to another part
of a lot, then it shall come into compliance with this § 285-68.
E. This section shall not apply to dumpsters temporarily placed during
actual construction or demolition on the premises.
F. If a building includes four or more dwelling units, then the owner shall
provide at least one solid waste dumpster with a lid and have it
regularly emptied.
A. Where a front, side or rear yard would abut an existing street, then
such yard shall be measured from the following minimum distances
from the center line of the street right-of-way, unless a wider distance
would be within the street right-of-way:
(1) Forty feet from the center line of an arterial street,
(2) Twenty-five feet from the center line of any other street, and
(3) Ten feet from the center line of an alley.
B. Applicants are strongly encouraged to dedicate additional right-of-way
as appropriate to PennDOT or the Township for future street widenings
and utility and stormwater improvements. If such area is not accepted
for current dedication, then the approved plan should state that it is
reserved for future dedication at such time as PennDOT or the
Township may determine that the area is needed.
C. No building, fence or other structure (except for mailboxes, utility
poles, street trees and similar structures typically found within a rightof-
way) shall be placed within the setback required by Subsection A.
A. Number per lot. No more than two driveway connections allowing lefthand
turns onto a street per lot shall be permitted.
B. Setbacks. Driveways shall not connect with a public street within 40
feet of the right-of-way lines of any intersecting streets, nor within five
feet of a fire hydrant. Driveways shall be set back at least two feet from
any side lot line, unless a common or joint driveway location is
proposed;
§ 285-68 WEAPONS § 285-70
278:665
C. Slope. No part of a driveway shall have a slope greater than 15%. A
driveway shall not exceed a slope of 8% within 25 feet of the street
right-of-way lines.
D. Street classification. Driveway access shall be provided to the street of
lesser classification when there is more than one street classification
involved.
E. Driveways, unless otherwise regulated elsewhere in this chapter, shall
be a minimum of 12 feet in width and a maximum of 20 feet in width,
and the opening of such driveways shall not be located less than 10 feet
from the edge of each opening on the same lot as measured outside the
right-of-way. [Amended 12-8-2008 by Ord. No. 209]
F. PennDOT permit. Any driveway intersecting with a state-owned road
shall require the obtainment of a driveway permit from the
Pennsylvania Department of Transportation.
G. Turnaround. Driveways which intersect an arterial or collector street
shall provide adequate turnaround area within the lot so that vehicles
do not back out onto the street.
H. Driveways shall be a minimum of 22 feet in length as measured outside
the street right-of-way. [Added 12-8-2008 by Ord. No. 209]
