133.
§ 36-1. Purpose and findings; interpretations.
A. Purpose.
(1) Pursuant to the authority granted in the Second Class Township
Code to promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of
the inhabitants of Jackson Township (hereinafter "Township"), to
regulate and inspect the use and occupancy of buildings, to
regulate places of public entertainment, amusement, and
recreation, and to prevent and prohibit public nuisances due to
adverse secondary effects, the Township enacts this chapter to
minimize and control the adverse secondary effects of sexually
oriented businesses, including adult bookstores, adult cabarets,
and adult theaters, and thereby to protect the health, safety, and
welfare of its citizens, protect the citizens' property values and the
character of surrounding neighborhoods, and deter the spread of
blight.
(2) The Township has determined that licensing is a legitimate and
reasonable means of accountability to insure that operators of
sexually oriented businesses comply with reasonable regulations
and to insure that operators do not knowingly allow their
establishments to be used as places of illegal sexual activity or
solicitation.
(3) The Township does not intend this chapter to suppress any speech
activities protected by the First Amendment but to enact a contentneutral
ordinance, which addresses the secondary effects of
sexually oriented businesses. It is not the intent of the Township in
enacting this legislation to deny any person rights of speech
protected by the Constitution of the United States or the
Constitution of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, or both, nor is
it the intent of the Township to impose any additional limitations or
restrictions on the contents of any communicative materials,
including sexually oriented films, videotapes, books, or other
materials. Further, by enacting this legislation the Township does
not intend to deny or restrict the rights of any adult to obtain or
view, or both, any sexually oriented materials or conduct protected
§ 32-2 JACKSON CODE § 36-1
36:32
by the Constitution of the United States or the Constitution of
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, or both, nor does it intend
to restrict or deny any constitutionally protected rights that
distributors or exhibitors of sexually oriented materials have to sell,
distribute, or exhibit these materials.
B. The Township Board of Supervisors finds as follows:
(1) Law enforcement personnel have determined, and statistics and
studies performed in a substantial number of communities in this
commonwealth and in the United States indicate, that sexually
oriented businesses have adverse secondary effects, which
secondary effects should be regulated to protect the public health,
safety, and welfare. These secondary effects include, but are not
limited to, the spread of communicable diseases, performance of
sexual acts in public places, presence of discarded sexually
oriented materials on public and private property, sexual
harassment, obscenity, prostitution and other illegal sexual
activities, crime, decreased property values, and neighborhood
deterioration.
(2) Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of
adult uses on the community in findings incorporated in the cases
of City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986),
Young v. Amer. Mini Theatres, 426 U.S. 41 (1976), and Barnes v.
Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991) and on other information
available to the Township, the Township finds as follows:
(a) Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary
unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently
uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments.
(b) Certain employees of adult cabarets engage in higher
incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than
employees of other establishments.
(c) Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex,
occur at sexually oriented businesses, especially those which
provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing
films, videos, or live sex shows. Furthermore, adult bookstores
tend to attract customers who engage in unprotected, high-risk
sexual activities.
(d) Offering and providing such space encourages such activities,
which creates unhealthy conditions.
(e) Persons frequent certain adult theaters and other sexually
oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sexual
activities within the premises of such sexually oriented
businesses.
§ 36-1 ADULT USES § 36-1
36:33
(f) At least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities
occurring in sexually oriented businesses, including but not
limited to syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus
infection (HIV-AIDS), genital herpes, hepatitis B, Non A, Non B
amebiasis, salmonella infections and shigella infections.
(g) The Surgeon General of the United States in his report of
October 22, 1986, has advised the American public that AIDS
and HIV infection may be transmitted through sexual contact,
intravenous drug abuse, exposure to infected blood and blood
components, and from an infected mother to her newborn
child.
(h) According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV
infection, as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally
transmitted by sexual acts.
(i) Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are
unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are
unhealthy, and, in part, because of the unregulated nature of
the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of
the facilities to self-regulate those activities and maintain those
facilities.
(j) Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is
found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where
persons view sexually oriented films.
(k) Numerous studies have indicated that sexually oriented
businesses have a substantial negative impact on property
values and cause neighborhood blight.
(l) The findings noted in Subsection B(2)(a) through (k) raise
substantial governmental concerns.
(3) Sexually oriented businesses have adverse secondary effects,
which secondary effects should be regulated to protect the public
health, safety, and welfare.
(4) Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics that
should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those
substantial governmental concerns.
(5) A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to
place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and
the operators of sexually oriented businesses. Further, such a
licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive
on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in
a manner consistent with the health, safety, and welfare of its
patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the Township. It is
appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is
the actual operator of the sexually oriented business, fully in
§ 36-1 JACKSON CODE § 36-1
36:34
possession and control of the premises and activities occurring
therein.
(6) Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting
on premises with adult booths advances a substantial
governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual
activity occurring in adult facilities.
(7) Requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep
information regarding current employees and certain past
employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of
criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential
witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in
such establishments.
(8) The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately
responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the
sexually oriented business, where such information is substantially
related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of
such uses, will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted
diseases.
(9) It is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable
diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding
certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this
chapter is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to
such activity.
(10) The fact that an applicant for a sexually oriented business license
has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational
assumption that the applicant is likely to engage in that conduct in
contravention of this chapter.
(11) The barring of such individuals from the management of sexually
oriented businesses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to
and prevents conduct that leads to the transmission of sexually
transmitted diseases.
(12) The general welfare, health and safety of the citizens of the
Township will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter.
(13) The limitation of operating hours of sexually oriented businesses
from 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m., Mondays through Saturdays, and
closure of such businesses on Sundays and holidays reduces the
adverse secondary effects of such businesses, including
particularly, but not limited to, late night noise levels, crime and
sexually offensive materials and activities in public areas, and
promotes the public health, safety, and welfare.
(14) The reasonable regulation and supervision of sexually oriented
businesses tends to discourage sexual acts and prostitution and

renewal upon the written application of the applicant and a finding by

[Adopted 5-3-2016 by Ord. No. 209-16]
§ 61-1. Short title.
This article shall be known and may be cited as the "Jackson Township
Emergency Service Provider Cost Reimbursement Ordinance."
§ 61-2. Authority.
This article is adopted pursuant to the provisions of the Second Class
Township Code, 53 P.S. § 65101 et. seq., as amended (the "code") and, in

the Township to make rules and regulations for the government of fire
companies located within the Township.
§ 61-3. Findings.
The Board recognizes that responses to hazardous materials incidents and
motor vehicle accidents require specialized emergency rescue tools,
equipment, and materials and hazardous material abatement equipment
and materials. The Board further recognizes that such tools and equipment
place a financial burden on volunteer fire companies, and the replacement
of such equipment and materials and specialized training places additional
financial burden on such emergency services providers.
§ 61-4. Purposes.
The Board hereby adopts and enacts this article for the following purposes:
§ 61-5. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms are hereby given the meanings
set forth below:
EMERGENCY SERVICE PROVIDER  Any volunteer fire department,
ambulance and/or fire and rescue company duly organized, acknowledged
and existing in and/or serving Jackson Township, York County, Pennsylvania.

protect and promote the public health, safety and welfare, by
authorizing emergency service providers to seek reimbursement of the
reasonable costs of responding to hazardous materials incidents and/or
motor vehicle accidents.

experiencing ever-increasing financial burdens and costs, which costs
have an adverse impact on the provision of emergency services in the
Township.

PERSON  Any individual, partnership, company, association, society, trust,
corporation, utility company or other legal or commercial group or entity,

§ 61-6. Authorization to recover fees, costs and expenses.
§ 61-7. Enforcement.
In the event that any insurance carrier fails to pay any bill or invoice within
30 days of the mailing of such notice of charges, the emergency service
provider directly, or any authorized agent who mailed the bill or invoice,
may enforce the provisions of this article by filing a civil action at law in

recover the reasonable costs associated with responding to hazardous
materials incidents and/or motor vehicle accidents, which may include,
but not be limited to, the cost of emergency rescue tools, equipment
and materials; hazardous materials abatement tools, equipment and
materials; and personnel hours involving a hazardous materials
incident or motor vehicle accident. Such reimbursement shall be filed
as an additional claim for damages to vehicles, property or injuries with
the motor vehicle insurance carrier of the person or persons owning or
operating a vehicle involved in a hazardous materials incident and/or
motor vehicle accident or other responsible person.
B. The reasonable costs incurred by the emergency service provider shall
be recovered directly by the emergency service provider, attorney,
collection agency or third-party billing service ("authorized agent") for
collection of such costs.
C. The emergency service provider or authorized agent shall have the
authority hereunder to recover the aforementioned costs from the
applicable insurance company/carrier only and not from the person or
persons owning or operating the vehicle involved in the response.
D. The reimbursement rates for the aforementioned tools, equipment and
materials shall be set by the emergency service providers from time to
time from and which may be charged for services provided after the
effective date of this article. Such rates shall be approved by resolution
of the Township from time to time and kept on file in the Township
office.
E. In addition to the reimbursement of reasonable costs, the emergency
service provider or authorized agent shall be authorized to collect
reasonable interest and administrative expenses for collection of the

the Hazardous Material Emergency Planning and Response Act,17 as
amended, otherwise authorized by statute or law.

ARTICLE IV
Identification of Floodplain Areas
§ 69-18. Identification.
§ 69-19. Description and special requirements of identified
floodplain areas.
The identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific areas:
A. The identified floodplain area shall be:
(1) Any areas of Jackson Township, classified as special flood hazard
areas (SFHAs) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and the
accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) dated
December 16, 2015, and issued by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) or the most recent revision thereof,
including all digital data developed as part of the Flood Insurance
Study; and
(2) Any area within the Township designated by the community as a
community-identified flood hazard area.
B. The above-referenced FIS and FIRMs, and any subsequent revisions
and amendments, are hereby adopted by Jackson Township and
declared to be a part of this chapter.
A. The floodway area shall be those areas identified in the FIS and the
FIRM as floodway and which represent the channel of a watercourse
and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge
the base flood without increasing the water surface elevation by more
than one foot at any point. This term shall also include floodway areas
which have been identified in other available studies or sources of
information for those special flood hazard areas where no floodway has
been identified in the FIS and FIRM.
(1) Within any floodway area, no encroachments, including fill, new
construction, substantial improvements, or other development,
shall be permitted unless it has been demonstrated through
hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with
standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment
would not result in any increase in flood levels within the
community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
(2) Within any floodway area, no new construction or development
shall be allowed, unless the appropriate permit is obtained from the
Department of Environmental Protection regional office.
B. The AE Area/District shall be those areas identified as an AE Zone on
the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base flood
elevations have been provided.
§ 69-18 BUILDING CONSTRUCTION § 69-19
47:93
(1) The AE Area adjacent to the floodway shall be those areas
identified as an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared
by FEMA for which base flood elevations have been provided and a
floodway has been delineated.
(2) AE Area without floodway shall be those areas identified as an AE
Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which
base flood elevations have been provided but no floodway has been
determined.
(a) No permit shall be granted for any construction, development,
use, or activity within any AE Area/District without floodway
unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the
proposed development would not, together with all other
existing and anticipated development, increase the BFE more
than one foot at any point.
(b) No new construction or development shall be located within
the area measured 50 feet landward from the top-of-bank of
any watercourse, unless the appropriate permit is obtained
from the Department of Environmental Protection regional
office.
C. A Area/District.
(1) The A Area/District shall be those areas identified as an A Zone on
the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no
base flood elevations have been provided. For these areas,
elevation and floodway information from other federal, state, or
other acceptable sources shall be used when available. Where
other acceptable information is not available, the base flood
elevation shall be determined by using the elevation of a point on
the boundary of the identified floodplain area which is nearest the
construction site.
(2) In lieu of the above, the municipality may require the applicant to
determine the elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering
techniques. Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken
only by professional engineers or others of demonstrated
qualifications, who shall certify that the technical methods used
correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. Studies,
analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail
to allow a thorough technical review by the municipality.
D. The AO and AH Area/District shall be those areas identified as Zones
AO and AH on the FIRM and in the FIS. These areas are subject to
inundation by one-percent-annual-chance shallow flooding where
average depths are between one and three feet. In Zones AO and AH,
drainage paths shall be established to guide floodwaters around and
away from structures on slopes.
§ 69-19 JACKSON CODE § 69-19
47:94
§ 69-20. Changes in identification of area.
The identified floodplain area may be revised or modified by the Board of
Supervisors where studies or information provided by a qualified agency
or person documents the need for such revision. However, prior to any
such change to the special flood hazard area, approval must be obtained
from FEMA. Additionally, as soon as practicable, but not later than six
months after the date such information becomes available, a community
shall notify FEMA of the changes to the special flood hazard area by
submitting technical or scientific data. See § 69-23B for situations where
FEMA notification is required.
§ 69-21. Boundary disputes.
Should a dispute concerning any identified floodplain boundary arise, an
initial determination shall be made by the Floodplain Administrator, and
any party aggrieved by this decision or determination may appeal to the
Jackson Township Board of Supervisors. The burden of proof shall be on the
appellant.
§ 69-22. Jurisdictional boundary changes.
Prior to development occurring in areas where annexation or other
corporate boundary changes are proposed or have occurred, the community
shall review flood hazard data affecting the lands subject to boundary
changes. The community shall adopt and enforce floodplain regulations in
areas subject to annexation or corporate boundary changes which meet or
exceed those in 44 CFR 60.3.
E. Community-identified flood hazard areas shall be those areas where
Jackson Township has identified local flood hazard or ponding areas, as
delineated and adopted on a "Local Flood Hazard Map" using the best
available topographic data and locally derived information such as flood
of record, historic high water marks, soils or approximate study
methodologies.

been obtained from the Department of Environmental Protection
regional office.
(2) No encroachment, alteration, or improvement of any kind shall be
made to any watercourse unless it can be shown that the activity
will not reduce or impede the flood-carrying capacity of the
watercourse in any way.
(3) In addition, FEMA and the Pennsylvania Department of Community
and Economic Development shall be notified prior to any alteration
or relocation of any watercourse.
B. When a community proposes to permit the following encroachments:
any development that causes a rise in the base flood elevations within
the floodway; or any development occurring in Zones A1-30 and Zone
AE without a designated floodway, which will cause a rise of more than
one foot in the base flood elevation; or alteration or relocation of a
stream (including but not limited to installing culverts and bridges), the
applicant shall (as per 44 CFR 65.12):
(1) Apply to FEMA for conditional approval of such action prior to
permitting the encroachments to occur.
(2) Upon receipt of the Administrator's conditional approval of map
change and prior to approving the proposed encroachments, a
community shall provide evidence to FEMA of the adoption of
floodplain management ordinances incorporating the increased
base flood elevations and/or revised floodway reflecting the postproject
condition.

ARTICLE I
General Provisions
§ 107-1. Short title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Jackson Township
Stormwater Management Ordinance."
§ 107-2. Statement of findings.
The Board of Supervisors of Jackson Township finds that:
§ 107-3. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to promote health, safety, and welfare within
the Township and its watershed(s) by minimizing the harm and maximizing
the benefits described in § 107-2 of this chapter, through provisions
designed to:
A. Inadequate management of accelerated runoff of stormwater resulting
from development throughout a watershed increases flows and
velocities, contributes to erosion and sedimentation, overtaxes the
carrying capacity of streams and storm sewers, greatly increases the
cost of public facilities to carry and control stormwater, undermines
floodplain management and flood control efforts in downstream
communities, reduces groundwater recharge, threatens public health
and safety, and increases nonpoint source pollution of water resources.
B. A comprehensive program of stormwater management, including
reasonable regulation of development and activities causing
accelerated runoff, is fundamental to the public health, safety, and
welfare and the protection of the people of the commonwealth, their
resources, and the environment.
C. Stormwater is an important water resource, which provides
groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams,
which also protects and maintains surface water quality.
D. Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to
implement a program of stormwater controls. These municipalities are
required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their
separate storm sewer systems under the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES).
A. Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including
regulations at 25 Pa. Code 93 to protect, maintain, reclaim, and restore
the existing and designated uses of the waters of this commonwealth.
B. Preserve the natural drainage systems as much as possible.
C. Manage stormwater runoff close to the source.
§ 107-1 SEWERS § 107-3
99:191
§ 107-4. Statutory authority.
§ 107-5. Applicability.
All regulated activities and all activities that may affect stormwater runoff,
including land development and earth disturbance activity, are subject to
regulation by this chapter. Article VIII, Detection and Elimination of Illicit
Discharges to Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System, shall be applicable
to all water entering the storm drain system of the Township generated
on any developed and undeveloped lands unless explicitly exempted by the
Township.
§ 107-6. Compatibility with other permit and ordinance
requirements.
Permits and approvals issued pursuant to this chapter do not relieve the
applicant of the responsibility to secure required permits or approvals for
activities regulated by any other applicable code, rule, act or ordinance.
If more stringent requirements concerning regulation of stormwater or
erosion and sedimentation control are contained in another code, rule, act
or ordinance, the more stringent regulations shall apply.
D. Provide procedures and performance standards for stormwater
planning and management.
E. Maintain groundwater recharge to prevent degradation of surface
water and groundwater quality and to otherwise protect water
resources.
F. Prevent scour and erosion of streambanks and streambeds.
G. Provide proper operation and maintenance of all SWM BMPs that are
implemented within the Township.
H. Provide standards to meet NPDES permit requirements.
A. Primary authority. The Township is empowered to regulate land use
activities that affect stormwater impacts by the authority vested in
Second Class Townships by the Second Class Township Code, 53 P.S.
§ 65101 through § 67201, and the Act of October 4, 1978, P.L. 864 (Act
167), 32 P.S. § 680.1 et seq., as amended, the Storm Water Management
Act.
B. Secondary authority. The Township is also empowered to regulate land
use activities that affect runoff by the authority of the Act of July 31,
1968, P.L. 805, No. 247, The Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning
Code, as amended.46

§ 107-7. Interpretation.
Unless otherwise expressly stated, the succeeding shall, for the purposes of
this chapter, be interpreted in the following manner:
§ 107-8. Erroneous permit.
Any permit or authorization issued or approved based on false, misleading
or erroneous information provided by an applicant is void without the
necessity of any proceedings for revocation. Any work undertaken or use
established pursuant to such permit or other authorization is unlawful.
No action may be taken by a board, agency or employee of the Township
purporting to validate such a violation.
A. Words used in the present tense also imply the future tense.
B. Words used in the singular imply the plural, and vice versa.
C. Words of masculine gender include feminine gender, and vice versa.
D. The words and abbreviation "includes," "including," "shall include,"

downstream watershed areas.
(3) When a project or land disturbance activity is located in more than
one stormwater management district, stormwater may not be
transferred from a district with stricter stormwater management
criteria to a district with less strict criteria, unless the need for
such a transfer is identified in the regional water quality
management plan Act 167 study. In any district, infiltration and
volume regulations dictated in § 107-13 will be required.
(4) Runoff rate criteria.
(a) District 1: Little Conewago.
(b) District 2: Codorus.
(c) District 3: Conewago West.
(5) Regulated storms for all three districts listed above shall include

§ 107-13. Volume controls.
The low-impact development practices provided in the BMP Manual shall be
utilized for all regulated activities to the maximum extent practicable. Water
volume controls shall be implemented using the Design Storm Method in
Subsection A or the Simplified Method in Subsection B below. For regulated
activity areas equal to or less than one acre that do not require hydrologic
routing to design the stormwater facilities, this chapter establishes no
preference for either methodology; therefore, the applicant may select
either methodology on the basis of economic considerations, the intrinsic
limitations on applicability of the analytical procedures associated with
each methodology, and other factors.
A. The Design Storm Method (CG-1 in the BMP Manual) is applicable to
any size of regulated activity. This method requires detailed modeling
based on site conditions.
(1) Do not increase the post-development total runoff volume for all
storms equal to or less than the two-year, twenty-four-hour
duration precipitation.
(2) For modeling purposes:
(a) Existing (predevelopment) nonforested pervious areas must be
considered meadow.
(b) For computation of predevelopment runoff volume, 20% of
existing impervious areas, when present, shall be considered
meadow.
B. The Simplified Method (CG-2 in the BMP Manual) provided below is
independent of site conditions and should be used if the Design Storm
Method is not followed. This method is not applicable to regulated
activities greater than one acre or for projects that require design of
stormwater storage facilities. For new impervious surfaces:
(1) Stormwater facilities shall capture at least the first two inches of
runoff from all new impervious surfaces.
(2) At least the first one inch of runoff from new impervious surfaces
shall be permanently removed from the runoff flow, i.e., it shall not
be released into the surface waters of this commonwealth. Removal
options for the first one inch of runoff include reuse, evaporation,
transpiration, and infiltration.
(3) Wherever possible, infiltration facilities should be designed to
accommodate infiltration of the entire permanently removed
runoff; however, in all cases at least the first 0.5 inch of the
permanently removed stormwater runoff shall be infiltrated.
(4) This method is exempt from the requirements of § 107-14, Rate
controls.

§ 107-16. Design criteria.
A. For computation of predevelopment peak discharge rates, 20% of the
existing impervious area of a project site, when present, shall be
considered meadow.
B. Post-development discharge rates shall not exceed the predevelopment
discharge rates provided in § 107-12B for the one-, two-, five-, ten-,
twenty-five-, fifty-, and one-hundred-year, twenty-four-hour storms. If it
is shown that the peak rates of discharge indicated by the postdevelopment
analysis are less than or equal to the peak rates of
discharge indicated by the predevelopment analysis for one-, two-, five-,
ten-, twenty-five-, fifty-, and one-hundred-year, twenty-four-hour
storms, then the requirements of this section have been met.
Otherwise, the applicant shall provide additional controls as necessary
to satisfy the peak rate of discharge requirement.

elements, contained within the York County Integrated Water
Resources Plan, and this chapter, design policy pertaining to
stormwater management facilities for Pennsylvania Department of
Transportation (PennDOT) roadways and associated facilities is
provided in Section 13.7 (Antidegradation and Post Construction
Stormwater Management Policy) of PennDOT Publication No. 13M,
Design Manual Part 2 (August 2009), as developed, updated, and
amended in consultation with the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Resources (DEP). As stated in DM-2.13.7.D (Act 167 and
Municipal Ordinances), PennDOT and PTC roadways and associated
facilities shall be consistent with Act 167 Plans. Dm-2.13.7.B (Policy on
Antidegradation and Post Construction Stormwater Management) was
developed as a cooperative effort between PennDOT and DEP.
DM-2.13.7.C (Project Categories) discusses the anticipated impact on
the quality, volume, and rate of stormwater runoff.
B. Where standards in the Act 167 elements of the IWRP and this chapter
are impractical, PennDOT may request assistance from DEP, in
consultation with the Township and county, to develop an alternative
strategy for meeting state water quality requirements and the goals and
objectives of the Act 167 elements within the IWRP.
C. For the purposes of the Act 167 elements in the IWRP and this chapter,
road maintenance activities are regulated under 25 Pa. Code Chapter
102.
A. Off-site areas. Off-site areas which drain through a proposed
development site are not subject to release rate criteria when
§ 107-14 SEWERS § 107-16
99:211
determining allowable peak runoff rates. However, on-site drainage
facilities shall be designed to safely convey off-site flows through the
development site.
B. On-site areas. On-site areas proposed to remain undisturbed as part of
the regulated activity, including previously developed areas, that are
not within the drainage area of any proposed BMPs shall be considered
as existing conditions, without considering any reductions in cover
type.
C. Downstream hydraulic capacity analysis. Any existing downstream
hydraulic capacity analysis shall be conducted in accordance with this
chapter.
(1) All downstream facilities impacted by the total site area of the
regulated activity shall be studied to determine if the facility has
adequate capacity to handle existing and proposed flows. An
impacted downstream facility is one to which the runoff from the
total site area of the regulated activity comprises more than 50% of
the total flow to such a facility. The study shall end at a perennial
stream. Downstream facilities include, but are not limited to, manmade
or natural swales and open channels, pipes, inlets, culverts,
bridges and roadways.
(2) If any public or private facility is found to be undersized or
inadequate, the applicant shall be responsible for alterations to
eliminate the concerns with the undersized or inadequate facility in
coordination with the regulated activity.
D. Regional detention alternatives. For certain areas within the study
area, it may be more cost-effective to provide one control facility for
more than one development site than to provide an individual control
facility for each development site. The initiative and funding for any
regional runoff control alternatives are the responsibility of prospective
developers. The design of any regional control basins must incorporate
reasonable development of the entire upstream watershed. The peak
outflow of a regional basin would be determined on a case-by-case basis
using the hydrologic model of the watershed consistent with protection
of the downstream watershed areas. "Hydrologic model" refers to the
calibrated model as developed for the stormwater management plan.
E. Capacity improvements of local drainage networks. In certain
instances, local drainage conditions may dictate more stringent levels
of runoff control than those based upon protection of the entire
watershed. In these instances, if the developer could prove that it would
be feasible to provide capacity improvements to relieve the capacity
deficiency in the local drainage network, then the capacity
improvements could be provided by the developer in lieu of runoff
controls on the development site. Any capacity improvements would be
designed based upon development of all areas tributary to the proposed
improvement and the capacity criteria specified in § 107-17. In
§ 107-16 JACKSON CODE § 107-16
99:212
§ 107-17. Regulations governing stormwater management facilities.
addition, all new development upstream of a proposed capacity
improvement shall be assumed to implement the applicable runoff
controls consistent with this chapter except that all new development
within the entire subarea(s) within which the proposed development
site is located shall be assumed to implement the developer's proposed
discharge control, if any.
F. Capacity improvements may also be provided as necessary to
implement any regional or subregional detention alternatives.
G. Where the potential for groundwater and/or surface water
contamination exists, based on the proposed use of the regulated
activity, safeguards shall be incorporated into the site.
(1) For industrial or commercial sites where it is possible that toxic or
hazardous substances may come into contact with stormwater
runoff, pretreatment of the first-flush (first 1/2 inch) runoff over
areas where industrial and commercial operations take place shall
be provided. Pretreatment shall include means for separating light
and heavy toxic and hazardous substances from the stormwater
before the stormwater is conveyed to the general stormwater
management facility(ies).
(2) Infiltration systems may be used to handle runoff from commercial
or industrial working or parking areas only after the first-flush
stormwater from these areas has been pretreated for removal of
toxic and hazardous substances.
H. Roof drains and sump pumps shall discharge to infiltration or
vegetative BMPs and to the maximum extent practicable satisfy the
criteria for DIAs.
A. Any stormwater facility located on state highway rights-of-way shall be
subject to approval by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation
(PennDOT).
B. Any stormwater management facilities regulated by this chapter that
would be located in or adjacent to waters of the commonwealth or
wetlands shall be subject to approval by PA DEP through the joint
permit application process or, where deemed appropriate by PA DEP,
the general permit process. When there is a question whether wetlands
may be involved, it is the responsibility of the developer or his agent to
show that the land in question cannot be classified as wetlands;
otherwise approval to work in the area must be obtained from PA DEP.
C. Any stormwater management facility located within the vicinity of a
floodplain shall be subject to approval in accordance with PA DEP 25
Pa. Code Chapter 106 (Floodplain Management) of PA DEP's Rules and
Regulations.
§ 107-16 SEWERS § 107-17
99:213
D. All earthmoving activities must be reviewed and approved by the York
County Conservation District prior to commencing work.
E. The design of all stormwater management facilities shall incorporate
good engineering principles and practices. The Township shall reserve
the right to disapprove any design that would result in the occupancy or
continuation of adverse hydrologic or hydraulic conditions within the
watershed.
F. The existing points of concentrated drainage that discharge onto
adjacent property shall not be altered without permission of the
adjacent property owner(s) and shall be subject to any applicable
discharge criteria specified in this chapter.
G. Areas of existing diffused drainage discharge shall be subject to any
applicable discharge criteria in the general direction of existing
discharge, whether proposed to be concentrated or maintained as
diffused drainage areas, except as otherwise provided by this chapter. If
diffused flow is proposed to be concentrated and discharged onto
adjacent property, the developer must document that adequate
downstream conveyance facilities exist to safely transport the
concentrated discharge, or otherwise prove that no erosion,
sedimentation, flooding or other harm will result from the concentrated
discharge.
H. Where a development site is traversed by watercourses, drainage
easements shall be provided conforming to the line of such
watercourses. The terms of the easement shall prohibit excavation, the
placing of fill or structures, and any alterations that may adversely
affect the flow of stormwater within any portion of the easement. Also,
maintaining of vegetation in a natural state within the easement shall
be required, except as approved by the appropriate governing
authority.
I. When it can be shown that, due to topographic conditions, natural
drainageways on the site cannot adequately provide for drainage, open
channels may be constructed conforming substantially to the line and
grade of such natural drainageways. Work within natural drainageways
shall be subject to approval by PA DEP through the joint permit
application process or, where deemed appropriate by PA DEP, through
the general permit process.
J. Roof drains must not be connected to streets, sanitary or storm sewers
or roadside ditches to promote overland flow and infiltration/
percolation of stormwater where advantageous to do so. When it is
more advantageous to connect directly to streets or storm sewers, then
it shall be permitted on a case-by-case basis by the Township.
K. Special requirements for areas falling within defined exceptional value
and high quality subwatersheds. The temperature and quality of water
and streams that have been declared as exceptional value and high
quality is to be maintained as defined in Chapter 93, Water Quality
§ 107-17 JACKSON CODE § 107-17
99:214
§ 107-18. Calculation methodology.
Standards, Title 25 of Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Protection Rules and Regulations. Temperature-sensitive BMPs and
stormwater conveyance systems are to be used and designed with
storage pool areas and supply outflow channels and should be shaded
with trees. This will require modification of berms for permanent ponds
and the relaxation of restrictions on planting vegetation within the
facilities, provided that capacity for volumes and rate control is
maintained. At a minimum, the southern half on pond shorelines shall
be planted with shade or canopy trees within 10 feet of the pond
shoreline. In conjunction with this requirement, the maximum slope
allowed on the berm area to be planted is 10 to 1. This will lessen
the destabilization of berm soils due to root growth. A long-term
maintenance schedule and management plan for the thermal control
BMPs is to be established and recorded for all development sites within
defined exceptional value and/or high quality subwatersheds.
A. Stormwater runoff from all development sites shall be calculated using
the Rational Method, Modified Rational Method, or a Soil Cover
Complex methodology.
(1) Any stormwater runoff calculations involving drainage areas
greater than 200 acres, including on- and off-site areas, shall use a
generally accepted calculation technique that is based on the
NRCS Soil Cover Complex Method. It is assumed that all methods
will be selected by the design professional based on the individual
limitations and suitability of each method for a particular site.
(2) The Township may allow the use of the Rational Method or
Modified Rational Method to estimate peak discharges from
drainage areas that contain less than 200 acres.
(3) All calculations consistent with this chapter using the Soil Cover
Complex Method shall us the appropriate design rainfall depths. If
a hydrologic computer model such as PSRM or HEC-RAS is used for
stormwater runoff calculations, then the duration of rainfall shall
be 24 hours. The SCS Rainfall Type II curve shall be used for the
rainfall distribution.
(4) For the purposes of predevelopment flow rate determination,
undeveloped land, including areas to be disturbed as part of the
regulated activity, shall be considered as "meadow" in good
condition, unless the natural ground cover generates a lower curve
number or Rational "C" value (i.e., forest), as listed it Tables 1 and
2, respectively.56
(5) All calculations using the Rational Method shall use rainfall
intensities consistent with appropriate times of concentration for
56.Editor's Note: Tables 1 and 2 are included at the end of this chapter.
§ 107-17 SEWERS § 107-18
99:215
overland flow and return periods. Times of concentration for
overland flow shall be calculated using the methodology presented
in Chapter 3 of Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds, NRCS,
TR-55 (as amended or replaced from time to time by NRCS). Time
of concentration for channel and pipe flow shall be computed using
Manning's Equation.
(6) Runoff curve numbers (CN) for both existing and proposed
conditions to be used in the Soil Cover Complex Method shall be
obtained from Table 1.57
(7) Runoff coefficients (c) for both existing and proposed conditions for
use in the Rational Method shall be obtained from Table 2.58
(8) Where uniform flow is anticipated, the Manning Equation shall be
used for hydraulic computations such as the capacity of open
channels, pipes, and storm sewers. Values for Manning's roughness
coefficient (n) shall be consistent with Table 3.59
(9) The design of any stormwater detention facilities intended to meet
the performance standards of this chapter shall be verified by
routing the design storm hydrograph through these facilities, using
either manual methods or computerized routing. Routing shall be
based upon the modified PULS method; other routing
methodologies shall be subject to the approval of the Township
Engineer.
(10) The stormwater collection system shall be designed using the peak
discharge computed using the Rational Formula.
B. Design standards: water-carrying facilities.
(1) All storm sewer pipes, streets, and inlets (excluding detention and
retention basin outfall structures) shall be designed for a ten-year
storm event. Sole access structures (culverts and bridges) shall be
designed to convey the twenty-five-year flood without overtopping
the roadway.
(a) When a pipe or culvert is intended to convey the discharge
from a stormwater management facility, its required capacity
shall be computed by the Rational Method and compared to the
peak outflow from the stormwater facility for the one-hundredyear
storm. The greater flow shall govern the design of the
pipe or culvert.
(b) When a pipe is part of a storm sewer system and crosses the
roadway, it shall be designed as a storm sewer with the same
design storm as the remainder of the drainage system.
57.Editor's Note: Table 1 is included at the end of this chapter.
58.Editor's Note: Table 2 is included at the end of this chapter.
59.Editor's Note: Table 3 is included at the end of this chapter.
§ 107-18 JACKSON CODE § 107-18
99:216
(c) Greater design frequencies may be justified on individual
projects.
(d) A one-hundred-year storm frequency may be required for
design of the stormwater collection system to insure that the
resultant stormwater runoff from the post-development storm
is directed into the management facility.
(2) In general, inlets shall be spaced such that, based upon the
Rational Method, tc = 5 min. and ten-year rainfall intensity, the
area contributing to the inlet shall not produce a peak runoff of
greater than four cfs. Also, inlets shall be spaced so that their
efficiency, based upon efficiency curves published by the
Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, is not less than 65%.
(3) Inlets shall be placed on both sides of the street at low spots and at
the upper side of street intersections to prevent stormwater from
crossing an intersection. Other devices such as high-efficiency
grates or perforated pipe may be required if conditions warrant. All
inlets at low points along the roadway shall have a ten-inch curb
reveal and shall be equipped with pavement base drain extending
50 feet in either direction, parallel to the center line of the roadway.
(4) In all cases where drainage is picked up by means of a headwall,
the pipe shall be designed as a culvert. Inlet and outlet conditions
shall be analyzed. The minimum diameter of culvert shall be 18
inches. The procedure contained in Hydraulic Engineer Circulars
No. 5 and No. 13, as prepared by the U.S. Department of
Transportation, Federal Highway Administration, Washington,
D.C., shall be used for the design of culverts. All culverts shall
include concrete headwalls and endwalls.
(5) Guards shall be provided on all intake structures. The guard bars
shall be one-half-inch-diameter galvanized bars on six-inch centers
attached to the structure with three-eighths-inch-diameter
stainless steel anchors.
(6) Manholes, inlets, headwalls, and endwalls shall conform to the
requirements of the PennDOT Publication 408, as modified by the
adopted Township standards.
(7) Proposed channels or swales must be able to convey the increased
runoff associated with a proposed one-hundred-year return period
event within their banks at velocities consistent with protection of
the channels from erosion. Acceptable velocities shall be based
upon criteria included in the PA DEP Erosion and Sediment
Pollution Control Program Manual.
(8) Existing natural or man-made channels or swales must be able to
convey proposed one-hundred-year return period runoff without
creating any hazard to persons or property.
§ 107-18 SEWERS § 107-18
99:217
(9) Stormwater runoff on roadways (i.e., gutter spread, lane
encroachment, etc.) shall be controlled in accordance with
PennDOT Publications 13M, "Design Manual, Part 2" and 584,
"Drainage Manual."
C. Design standards: detention and retention basins.
(1) Permanent detention and retention basins shall be designed to
meet the following standards:
(a) The maximum permitted depth for detention or retention
basins shall be six feet, measured from the bottom of the
emergency spillway to the lowest point in the basin.
(b) The minimum top width of all basin embankments shall be
eight feet.
(c) The maximum permitted side slopes for detention or retention
basins shall be four horizontal to one vertical. In order to
obtain a waiver for slopes steeper than 4:1, the plan must
include a planting schedule to stabilize the embankments. The
proposed vegetation shall be low-maintenance varieties.
(d) Minimum bottom slope. All detention basins shall have a
minimum bottom slope of 2% unless infiltration facilities are
provided.
(e) Outlet control structures. Outlet control shall be accomplished
utilizing (six-inch diameter or six-inch width maximum)
perforations arranged vertically to provide for positive control
of stormwater runoff. Outlet controls shall also provide for
modification of the orifice to a smaller diameter through the
use of removable plates.
(f) Discharge dispersion. Discharges from piping outlets of
stormwater management facilities shall be provided with a
concrete level spreader to convert point discharge back to
simulated sheet flow. The length of the spreader shall be equal
to 10 times the outlet pipe diameter (e.g., an eighteen-inch
discharge pipe would require a fifteen-foot-wide level
spreader).
(g) Any stormwater management facility (i.e., detention basin)
designed to store runoff and requiring a berm or earthen
embankment required or regulated by this chapter shall be
designed to provide an emergency spillway to handle flow up to
and including the one-hundred-year, twenty-four-hour design
storm at post-development conditions, assuming the principal
outlet structure to be clogged. The height of embankment must
be set as to provide a minimum one foot of freeboard above the
maximum elevation computed for the clogged orifice condition.
Should any stormwater management facility require a dam
§ 107-18 JACKSON CODE § 107-18
99:218
§ 107-19. Carbonate geology.
In areas of carbonate geology, a geologist shall certify to the following:
safety permit under PA DEP 25 Pa. Code Chapter 105, the
facility shall be designed in accordance with PA DEP 25 Pa.
Code Chapter 105 and meet the regulations of PA DEP 25
Pa. Code Chapter 105 concerning dam safety which may be
required to pass storms larger than the one-hundred-year
event.
(h) A cutoff trench of impervious material shall be provided within
all basin embankments.
(i) Where a basin embankment is constructed using fill on an
existing fifteen-percent or greater slope, the basin must be
keyed into the existing grade.
(j) All outlet structures and emergency spillways shall include a
satisfactory means of energy dissipation at its outlet to assure
conveyance and flow without endangering the safety and
integrity of the basin and the downstream drainage area.
(k) A concentrated discharge of stormwater to an adjacent
property shall be within a natural drainageway or watercourse,
or an easement shall be required.
(l) Plans for infiltration must show the locations of existing and
proposed septic tank infiltration areas and wells. Unless a
minimum twenty-five-foot separation from on-lot disposal
systems (OLDS) infiltration areas, including replacement
areas, is provided, it will be evaluated by the Township on a
case-by-case basis. However, the separation shall not be less
than 10 feet. Infiltration rates shall be based upon perc and
probe tests conducted at the site of the proposed facility.
A. No stormwater management facility will be placed in, over, or
immediately adjacent to the following features:
(1) Closer than 100 feet to sinkholes.
(2) Closer than 100 feet to closed depressions.
(3) Closer than 100 feet to caverns, intermittent lakes, or ephemeral
streams.
(4) Closer than 50 feet to lineaments in carbonate areas.
(5) Closer than 50 feet to fracture traces.
(6) Closer than 25 feet to bedrock pinnacles (surface or subsurface).
B. Stormwater resulting from regulated activities shall not be discharged
into sinkholes.
§ 107-18 SEWERS § 107-19
99:219
C. If the developer can prove through analysis that the project site is an
area underlain by carbonate geology, and such geologic conditions may
result in sinkhole formations, then the project site is exempt from
recharge requirements as described in § 107-13, Volume Controls.
However, the project site shall still be required to meet all other
standards found in this chapter.
D. It shall be the developer's responsibility to verify if the project site is
underlain by carbonate geology. The following note shall be attached to
all stormwater management plans and signed and sealed by the
developer's geologist: "I, __________, certify that the proposed
stormwater management facility (circle one) is/is not underlain by
carbonate geology."
E. Whenever a stormwater management facility will be located in an area
underlain by carbonate geology, a geological evaluation of the proposed
location by a geologist shall be conducted to determine susceptibility to
sinkhole formation. The evaluation may include the use of impermeable
liners to reduce or eliminate the separation distances listed in the BMP
Manual. Additionally, the evaluation shall, at a minimum, address soil
permeability, depth to bedrock, seasonally high groundwater table,
susceptibility for sinkhole formation, suitability of stormwater
management facilities, subgrade stability and maximum infiltration
capacity in depth of water per unit area.
F. A detailed soils evaluation of the project site shall be performed to
determine the suitability of recharge facilities. The evaluation shall be
performed by a qualified professional and, at a minimum, address soil
permeability, depth to bedrock, susceptibility to sinkhole formation, and
subgrade stability. The general process for designing the infiltration
BMP shall be:
(1) Site evaluation to determine general areas of suitability for
infiltration practices.
(2) Provide field test throughout the area proposed for development to
determine appropriate percolation rate and/or hydraulic
conductivity. At least one infiltration test must be included in each
soil group, and at least one infiltration test must be conducted for
each five lots proposed for development. Infiltration tests must be
taken at the location and depth of all proposed infiltration
structures.
(3) Design infiltration structure for required storm volume based on all
available data.
G. Extreme caution shall be exercised where infiltration is proposed in
geologically susceptible areas such as strip mine or limestone areas. It
is also extremely important that the design professional evaluate the
possibility of groundwater contamination from the proposed
infiltration/recharge facility and recommend a hydrogeologic
justification study be performed if necessary. Whenever a basin will be
§ 107-19 JACKSON CODE § 107-19
99:220
§ 107-20. Erosion and sedimentation control requirements.
located in an area underlain by limestone, a geological evaluation of
the proposed location shall be conducted to determine susceptibility
to sinkhole formations. The design of all facilities over carbonate
formations shall include measures to prevent groundwater
contamination and, where necessary, sinkhole formation. The
infiltration requirement in the high quality/exceptional waters shall
be subject to the Department's Chapter 93 and anti-degradation
regulations. A detailed hydrogeologic investigation may be required by
the Township, and, where appropriate, the Township may require the
installation of an impermeable liner in detention basins.
A. As required in § 107-10D, whenever the vegetation and topography are
to be disturbed, such activity must be in conformance with PA DEP 25
Pa. Code Chapter 105, Rules and Regulations, Part I, Subpart C,
Protection of Natural Resources, Article II, Water Resources, Chapter
102, Erosion Control, and in accordance with the York County
Conservation District.
B. It is extremely important that strict erosion and sedimentation control
measures be applied surrounding infiltration structures during
installation to prevent the infiltrative surfaces from becoming clogged.
Additional erosion and sedimentation control design standards and
criteria must be applied where infiltration BMPs are proposed and shall
include the following:
(1) Areas proposed for infiltration BMPs shall be protected from
sedimentation and compaction during the construction phase, so as
to maintain their maximum infiltration capacity.
C. Fencing for sedimentation basins or traps must comply with
§ 107-18C(1)(j).
D. The developer shall demonstrate that the post-development hydrograph
flows during erosion and sedimentation control phase are less than or
equal to the predevelopment hydrograph flows to assure the rate and
volume of runoff leaving the site is controlled for the two-, five-, and tenyear
frequency storms. All calculation methodology shall be in
accordance with §§ 107-12. through 107-19.

plan is included in a subdivision and/or land development plan
application, the Township's governing body may, after consulting
with DEP as noted in § 107-10C of this chapter, grant a modification
of the requirements of one or more provisions of this chapter if the
literal enforcement will enact undue hardship because of peculiar
conditions pertaining to the land in question, provided that such
modification will not be contrary to the public interest and that the
purpose and intent of the ordinance is observed.
(2) All requests for modifications from an applicant shall be in writing
and shall accompany and be a part of the application for approval
of an SWM site plan and/or a subdivision or land development plan
as applicable. The request shall state in full the grounds and facts
of unreasonableness or hardship on which the request is based, the

§ 107-24. Revision of plans.
A revision to a previously submitted SWM site plan that involves a change
in SWM BMPs, stormwater management facilities, or changes in analytical
techniques, or that involves the relocation or redesign of SWM BMPs, or
that is necessary because soil or other conditions are not as stated on the
SWM site plan, as determined by the Township, shall require a resubmission
of the revised SWM site plan in accordance with this Article, including
applicable fees. For NPDES permitted sites, any revised SWM site plan shall
also be resubmitted to the York County Conservation District for review. In
the case of an SWM site plan which contains minor deficiencies, such as a
missing label, omission of a required note or minor construction detail, as
determined by the Township, the Township may accept a resubmission of
such SWM site plan without the requirement of a review fee, or for a lesser
fee as provided for in the Township fee schedule.
§ 107-25. Resubmission of disapproved SWM site plans.
A disapproved SWM site plan may be resubmitted, with the revisions
addressing the Township's concerns as stated regarding the original

decision by the Township shall specify the defects in the application,
describe the requirements which were not met, and shall cite the
provisions of the Ordinance relied upon. If the SWM site plan is
approved with conditions, the notification to the applicant shall state
the acceptable conditions for approval and the time limit for satisfying
such conditions. The time limit for satisfying conditions of approval
shall be the time limit prescribed for conditional approval of subdivision
and land development plans as stated in the Township's Subdivision and
Land Development Ordinance.63
A. SWM site plans independent of subdivision and land development
plans. The Township's approval of an SWM site plan, when such plan is
submitted independent of a subdivision and/or land development plan,
authorizes the regulated activities contained in the SWM site plan for a
maximum term of validity of five years following the date of approval.
The Township may, in its sole discretion, specify a term of validity
shorter than five years in the approval for any specific SWM site plan,
particularly if the nature of the proposed SWM facilities require more
frequent maintenance and/or short-term replacement of certain
components. Terms of validity shall commence on the date the
Township signs the approval for an SWM site plan. If an approved SWM
site plan is not completed according to Section 407 within the term of

B. SWM site plans included in a subdivision and/or land development plan.
The Township's approval of an SWM site plan, which is a part of a
subdivision and/or land development plan, authorizes that plan and the
regulated activities therein so that no subsequent change or
amendment in this chapter or other governing ordinances or plans shall
be applied to affect adversely the right of the applicant to commence
and to complete any aspect of the approved development in accordance
with the terms of such approval within five years from such approval, as
specified in Section 508(4)(ii) through (vii) of the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code.64
A. The developer shall be responsible for providing as-built plans of all
SWM BMPs included in the approved SWM site plan. The as-built plans
and an explanation of any discrepancies with the construction plans
shall be submitted to the Township.
B. The as-built submission shall include a certification of completion
signed by a designer verifying that all permanent SWM BMPs have
been constructed according to the approved plans and specifications.
C. After receipt of the completion certification by the Township, the
Township may conduct a final inspection to verify compliance with, and
accuracy of, the as-built plans.
D. The financial guarantee, as discussed under § 107-31, shall not be
released by the Township until the items of § 107-27 are completed.

with the provisions of Sections 509, 510, and 511 of the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code.66
§ 107-32. Maintenance guarantee.
For SWM site plans that involve the dedication of all or some of the required
improvements following completion, the Township may require the posting
of financial security to secure structural integrity of said improvements as
well as the functioning of said improvements in accordance with the design
and specifications as depicted on the SWM site plan for a term not to
exceed 18 months from the date of acceptance of dedication. Said financial
security shall be of the same type as otherwise required in § 107-31 with
regard to installation of such improvements, and the amount of the financial
security shall not exceed 15% of the actual cost of installation of said
improvements in accordance with the provisions of Section 509 of the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code.67
shall be submitted by the owner to the Township within 10 working
days of the change.
B. The owner is responsible for operation and maintenance (O&M) of the

Detection and Elimination of Illicit Discharges to Municipal
Separate Storm Sewer System
§ 107-34. Ultimate responsibility.
The standards set forth herein and promulgated by this article are minimum
standards; therefore, this article does not intend nor imply that compliance
by any person will ensure that there will be no contamination, pollution, nor
unauthorized discharge of pollutants.
§ 107-35. Prohibition of illicit discharges.
A. No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged into storm drain
systems or waters of this commonwealth any materials, including, but
not limited to, pollutants or waters containing pollutants that cause or
contribute to a violation of applicable water quality standards, other
than stormwater. Any discharge in violation of this article shall be
considered illicit discharges, except as exempted below.
B. Exceptions.
(1) The commencement, conduct or continuance of any illicit discharge
to the storm drain system or waters of this commonwealth is
prohibited except as follows:
(a) Discharges from fire-fighting activities.
(b) Potable water sources, including water line flushing.
(c) Irrigation drainage.
(d) Air-conditioning condensate.
(e) Springs.
(f) Water from crawl space pumps.
(g) Pavement wash waters where spills or leaks of toxic or
hazardous materials have not occurred (unless all spill
material has been removed) and where detergents are not
used.
(h) Diverted stream flows.
(i) Groundwater infiltration to storm drains.
(j) Dye testing is an allowable discharge (but requires a verbal
notification to the Township 48 hours prior to the time of the
test).
(k) Flows from riparian habitats and wetlands.

discharge order issued to the discharger and administered under
the authority of DEP; provided, that the discharge is in full
compliance with all requirements of the permit, waiver, or order
and other applicable laws and regulations; and, provided, that
written approval has been granted for any discharge to the storm
drain system and/or waters of this commonwealth.
C. In the event that the Township or DEP determines that any of the
discharges identified in § 107-35B significantly contribute to pollution
of the waters of this commonwealth, the Township or DEP will notify the
responsible person(s) to cease the discharge.
A. This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit
connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection
was permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the
time of connection.
B. A person is considered to be in violation of this article if the person
connects a line conveying sewage to the MS4, or allows such a
connection to continue.

§ 107-38. Industrial or construction activity discharges.
Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES
stormwater discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such
permit. Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form
acceptable to the Township prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4.
§ 107-39. Monitoring of discharges.
America may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to
a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or
threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and
substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of
persons, or to the MS4 or waters of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania,
or the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension
order issued in an emergency, the Township may take such steps as
deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or waters
of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania or the United States, or to
minimize danger to persons, including, without limitations, entering
the property for the purpose of disconnecting and/or performing
emergency maintenance or repairs to storm sewers. In the event the
Township must disconnect or perform emergency maintenance and/
or repairs, the Township may file and attach a municipal lien on the
property which is causing the illicit discharge.
B. Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge or illicit connection.
Any person discharging to the MS4 in violation of this article may have
their MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce
an illicit discharge or illicit connection. The Township will notify a
violator of the proposed termination of its MS4 access. The violator may
petition the Township for a reconsideration and hearing.
C. A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to
premises terminated pursuant to this section, without the prior
approval of the authorized enforcement agency.
A. Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that have stormwater
discharges associated with industrial activity, including construction
activity.
B. Access to facilities.
(1) The Township shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities
subject to regulation under this article as often as may be
necessary to determine compliance with this article. If a discharger
has security measures in force which require proper identification
and clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall
make the necessary arrangements to allow access to
representatives of the Township.
§ 107-37 SEWERS § 107-39
99:239
§ 107-40. Requirements to prevent, control and reduce stormwater
pollutants by the use of BMPs.
The Township will adopt requirements identifying best management
practices for any activity, operation, or facility which may cause or
contribute to pollution or contamination of stormwater, the storm drain
system, or waters of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania or the United
(2) Facility operators shall allow the Township ready access to all parts
of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling,
examination and copying of records that must be kept under the
conditions of an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater, and the
performance of any additional duties as defined by state and
federal law.
(3) The Township shall have the right to set up on any permitted
facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the
Township to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's
stormwater discharge.
(4) The Township has the right to require the discharger to install
monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and
monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and
proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense.
All devices used to measure stormwater flow and quality shall be
calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
(5) Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly
removed by the operator at the written or oral request of the
Township and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such
access shall be borne by the operator.
(6) Unreasonable delays in allowing the Township access to a
permitted facility are a violation of a stormwater discharge permit
and of this article. A person who is the operator of a facility with an
NPDES permit to discharge stormwater associated with industrial
activity commits an offense if the person denies the Township
reasonable access to the permitted facility for the purpose of
conducting any activity authorized or required by this article.
(7) If the Township has been refused access to any part of the premises
from which stormwater is discharged, and the Township
representative is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe
that there may be a violation of this chapter, or that there is a need
to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and
sampling program designed to verify compliance with this article
or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public
health, safety, and welfare of the community, then the authorized
enforcement agency may seek issuance of a search warrant from
any court of competent jurisdiction.

drain system or watercourses through the use of these structural and
nonstructural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a property or
premises which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be
required to implement, at said person's expense, additional structural and
nonstructural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the
municipal separate storm sewer system. Compliance with all terms and
conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater
associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be
deemed in compliance with the provisions of this section. These BMPs shall
be part of a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) as necessary for
compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit.
§ 107-41. Watercourse protection.
Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such
person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within
the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other obstacles
that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water
through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain
existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse,
so that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or
physical integrity of the watercourse.
§ 107-42. Notification of spills.
Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person
responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency
response for a facility or operation, has information of any known or
suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in illicit
discharges or pollutants discharging into stormwater, the storm drain
system, or water of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania or the United States,
said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery,
containment, and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release
of hazardous materials, said person shall immediately notify emergency
response agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In
the event of a release of nonhazardous materials, said person shall notify
the authorized enforcement agency in person or by phone or facsimile no
later than the next business day. Notifications in person or by phone shall be
confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to the Township within
three business days of the phone notice. If the discharge of prohibited
materials emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment, the
owner or operator of such establishment shall also retain an on-site written
record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence.
Such records shall be retained for at least three years.

Any person receiving a notice of violation may appeal the determination of
the Township. The notice of appeal must be received within 30 days from
the date of the notice of violation. A hearing on the appeal before the Board
of Supervisors or designated appropriate authority (by resolution) shall take
place within 15 days from the date of receipt of the notice of appeal or the
next regularly scheduled meeting of the Board of Supervisors, whichever
occurs first. The decision of the Township authority or its designee shall be
final.
§ 107-45. Enforcement measures after appeal.
If the violation has not been corrected pursuant to the requirements set
forth in the notice of violation or, in the event of an appeal, within 15
days of the hearing representative's decision upholding the decision of the
Township, then representatives of the Township shall enter upon the subject
private property and are authorized to take any and all measures necessary
to abate the violation and/or restore the property. It shall be unlawful for
any person, owner, agent, or person in possession of any premises to refuse
to allow the Township or designated contractor to enter upon the premises
for the purposes set forth above.
A. Notice of violation. Whenever the Township finds that a person has
violated a prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this article, the
Township may order compliance by written notice of violation to the
responsible person. Such notice may require without limitation:
(1) The performance of monitoring, analyses, and reporting;
(2) The elimination of illicit connections or discharges;
(3) That violating discharges, practices, or operations shall cease and
desist;
(4) The abatement or remediation of stormwater pollution or
contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected
property;
(5) Payment of a fine to cover administrative and remediation costs;
and
(6) The implementation of source control or treatment BMPs.
B. If abatement of a violation and/or restoration of affected property is
required, the notice shall set forth a deadline within which such
remediation or restoration must be completed. Said notice shall further
advise that, should the violator fail to remediate or restore within the
established deadline, the work will be done by a designated
governmental agency or a contractor and the expense thereof shall be
charged to the violator or assessed as a municipal lien on the property.

shall be raised, with material and in a manner authorized by the
Township for the type of existing shoulder, so that the overlaid

STREET, CUL-DE-SAC  A type of street which is terminated at one end
by a permitted turnaround and which intersects another street at the other
end.
STREET, CUL-DE-LOOP OR P-STREET  A street that turns into and
reconnects with its main axis, with lot area remaining between the two
segments of street, and which has a single point of access from the cul-deloop
street to any preexisting street.
STREET GRADE  The officially established grade of the street upon which
a lot fronts or, in its absence, the established grade of other streets upon
which the lot abuts at the midway of the frontage of the lot thereon. If there
is no officially established grade, the existing grade of the street at such
midpoint shall be the street grade.
RURAL MINOR ARTERIAL STREET  An arterial street that forms
a network to link cities and towns (and other generators that
are capable of attracting travel over similarly long distances) and
that forms an integrated network providing primarily intercounty
service.
(2)
COLLECTOR STREET  A street that collects traffic from local streets
and directs that traffic to arterial streets. A collector street typically
is designed to eventually serve 1,500 to 3,500 vehicles per day. All
existing collector streets within Jackson Township are currently
classified by the Comprehensive Plan as rural minor collectors.
Collector streets within Jackson Township are divided into the following
types:
MAJOR COLLECTOR STREETS  This type of collector street
is designed to provide service to towns that are not served by
streets with a higher classification and to other traffic generators
of equivalent intercounty importance and then to link this traffic
with nearby larger towns and routes of higher classification. This
type of street also serves important intercounty travel corridors.
(1)
MINOR COLLECTOR STREETS  This type of collector street
is designed to be spaced at intervals, consistent with population
density, to collect traffic from local streets and bring all developed
areas within a reasonable distance of a collector street. This type of
street also provides service to the remaining smaller communities
and links locally important traffic generators with the rural
hinterland.
(2)
B.
LOCAL STREET or LOCAL ACCESS STREET  This type of street
primarily is designed to provide access to adjacent land and provide
travel over relatively short distances, compared to collector streets.
C.
ALLEY  A minor right-of-way, privately or publicly owned, primarily
for vehicular access to the rear of properties.
D.
§ 113-21 SEWERS § 113-21

separating the street from abutting property or lots. This is commonly
known as the street "right-of-way line."
STREET, MARGINAL ACCESS  A type of local street which is parallel
and adjacent to collector or arterial streets and provides access to abutting
properties.
STREET, PRIVATE  A street that is not owned or maintained by the state
or the Township.
STREET, PRIVATE ACCESS  A vehicle accessway that connects residential
lots to an approved street where the residential lots do not abut the
approved street. A private access street shall have a minimum right-of-way
of 20 feet. Construction and maintenance of a private access street shall be
the sole responsibility of owners benefitted by the use of the street and shall
not be offered to the municipality for public maintenance.

Engineer, at least 90% (based upon the cost of the required improvements
for which financial security was posted) of those improvements required
The division or redivision of a lot, tract or parcel of land by any means
into two or more lots, tracts, parcels, or other divisions of land,
including changes in existing lot lines for the purpose, whether
immediate or future, of lease, partition by the court for distribution to
heirs or devisees, transfer of ownership or building or lot development.
A.
The subdivision by lease of land for agricultural purposes into a parcel
of more than 10 acres, not involving any new street or easement of
access or residential dwellings, is not a subdivision.

Overview of General Procedures
§ 113-22. Purpose.
This article summarizes the general procedures for the submission and
review of proposed subdivisions and land developments. This article is only
a general explanation and is not binding on the Township or an applicant.
See the actual provisions of the other articles of this chapter.
§ 113-23. General procedure for subdivisions and land
developments.
A. Review and approval stages. Three types of plan submissions are
established: sketch, preliminary, and final, as outlined below.

NOTES:
* See definitions in Article II.
** See Article VII for minor subdivision final plan submission and review
requirements. See § 113-40 for submission requirements for a lot line
adjustment.
*** At its option, the Board of Supervisors may grant combined preliminary/final
plan approval if the preliminary plan submission meets the requirements of a
final plan submission and if the Board of Supervisors determines that there are
no outstanding matters.
**** Except where exempted by § 113-29.
B. Sketch plan. While a sketch plan is not required, it is strongly
recommended that it be filed to allow the applicant to consult early and
informally with the Planning Commission before preparing a
preliminary plan. This will often avoid expensive redesign and delay to
the applicant.
§ 113-22 SEWERS § 113-23
99:297
§ 113-24. General plan submission procedures.
C. Preliminary plan. Preliminary plans are required to be submitted for
any major subdivision and for certain land developments, as described
above.
D. Final plan. After approval of the preliminary plan of a major subdivision
or certain land developments, and to obtain approval of a minor
subdivision, the applicant files a final plan. A final plan must be
approved by the Township Board of Supervisors prior to recording of
the plans at the County Recorder of Deeds' office and prior to the sale of
any lots or the construction of any buildings. (See Article IX.)
E. Guaranty of improvements installation. Where improvements are
required by this chapter, in most cases, the Township will require that
the applicant enter into a development agreement and/or require the
posting of financial security sufficient to guarantee the costs of any
improvements which may be required. (See Article VIII).
A. Submission. Sketch, preliminary and final plans and all required
accompanying information are required to be submitted to the
Township staff by delivery in person.
B. Attendance. The applicant or his/her duly authorized representative
should endeavor to attend the Commission meeting to discuss the filed
plans. If the applicant fails to appear at a meeting where the plans will
be considered, it may result in plan disapproval, if the Township
determines that it resulted in insufficient information to render
approval.
C. Action by the Commission and the Board of Supervisors. The Planning
Commission advises the Board of Supervisors on proposed plans. The
Board of Supervisors has the authority to approve or deny those plans.
There are time limits in state law for approval of a subdivision or land
development, unless the applicant grants a time extension.
§ 113-23 JACKSON CODE § 113-24
99:298
ARTICLE IV
Sketch Plan
§ 113-25. Pre-plan consultation.
Prior to submitting a sketch plan, applicants for developments are
encouraged to informally discuss their proposal with the Zoning Officer and/
or other appropriate Township staff. See also discussion of a site tour in
§ 113-28.
§ 113-26. Sketch plan submission requirements.
Prior to the submission of a preliminary plan, applicants are very strongly
encouraged to submit a sketch plan. A sketch plan review often allows an
applicant to save substantial time and engineering costs, because many
concerns about layout and issues concerning Township ordinances can be
resolved prior to detailed engineering. This can often reduce the need
for future redesign at a more-detailed stage, thereby saving the applicant
significant money and time. When submitted, sketch plans shall include the
following information:
A. Submission requirement. If submitted, seven print copies of the sketch
plan and the accompanying application should be submitted to the
Township staff prior to a regular Township Planning Commission
meeting. It is requested that a sketch plan be provided at least seven
days before a Planning Commission meeting where it will be discussed.
B. Drawing requirements. Any sketch plan shall be drafted to approximate
scale and is recommended to include the following, as applicable:
(1) Boundary line of the development.
(2) Existing resources and site analysis map: the approximate location
of the following:
(a) Any concentrations of steeply sloped lands (such as 15% to
25%, and greater than 25%).
(b) Locations of watercourses (with any name), natural springs,
ponds, lakes and suspected wetlands. (NOTE: Applicants are
requested to review the locations of hydric soils in the York
County Soil Survey to provide an initial indication of areas that
are likely to include some wetland areas.)
(c) Any known sinkholes and topical depressions.
(d) Any areas within the one-hundred-year floodplain.
(e) Suggestions from the applicant regarding possible locations of
any proposed common open space or recreation land or
whether the applicant seeks to pay recreation fees, if
applicable.
§ 113-25 SEWERS § 113-26
99:299
(f) Any major easements or proposed recreation trails, existing
trails and trail easements.
(g) Major existing utility easements/rights-of-way that might affect
development layout.
(h) Approximate locations of tree lines and existing forested areas.
(3) Conceptual proposed lot and street layout with approximate areas
of lots (such as "two acres").
(4) Site data, including:
(a) Acreage of the entire tract.
(b) Number of lots and types of dwelling units (if residential).
(c) Zoning district and major applicable lot area and setback
requirements.
(5) North point and scale and a tentative name of the project (may be
the developer's name).
(6) Approximate proposed locations of any nonresidential buildings (if
known) and statement of the general proposed types of any
nonresidential uses.
(7) A map showing the general location of the project in relation to
nearby roads/streets and creeks (may be a photocopy of USGS or
Township base map or a commercial map).
(8) Tentative approximate locations of any stormwater detention
basins and any major stormwater drainage channels.
(9) Note stating the general methods of providing water and sewer
service.
(10) Names of any adjacent nonresidential uses and any zoning district
boundaries in the area.
(11)Name and address of person responsible for the preparation of the
plan and the date of preparation.
C. Site design process. See § 113-32, which requires applicants for certain
subdivisions and land developments to submit maps showing how their
project follows the site design process. If this provision is not met at the
sketch plan stage, then it must be met at the preliminary plan
submission.
(1) Applicants are strongly encouraged to submit these maps as part of
the sketch plan process, to avoid delays to the applicant in
preliminary plan approval. Submittal at the sketch plan stage will
greatly increase the likelihood that all issues will be able to be
resolved in a timely manner.
§ 113-26 JACKSON CODE § 113-27
99:300
§ 113-27. Sketch plan review procedures.
A. No official action shall be taken on a sketch plan. The Township shall
not be bound by comments made or not made as part of a sketch plan
review.
B. The Township should distribute copies of the sketch plan to the
Township Engineer, the relevant Township staff person and the
Planning Commission for advisory reviews.
C. The sketch plan should be reviewed by the Planning Commission and
the Board of Supervisors, with any comments reported to the applicant
or his/her representative. It is recommended that the following matters
be emphasized in a review of a sketch plan:
(1) The suitability of areas proposed for development and areas
proposed as open space, considering the process of § 113-32.
(2) The most suitable methods of providing street access, including
access points onto existing streets, and possible interconnections
with existing streets or streets within approved developments.
(3) Methods to reduce the total percentage of the site that will be
regraded, paved or deforested.
D. County review. The Township may forward a copy of the sketch plan to
the York County Planning Commission for any informal review if the
Township believes it may have significant impacts.

ARTICLE V
Preliminary Plans for Major Subdivisions and Certain Land
Developments
§ 113-28. Initial steps.
§ 113-29. Submission and review procedure.
A. Presubmission consultation. As described in § 113-25, applicants are
encouraged to informally discuss their proposals with applicable
Township staff persons or other Township officials before preparing
engineered plans.
B. Site tour. Applicants are very strongly encouraged to cooperate in an
on-site tour of the property by Township officials. See the language in
the application form that requests permission for a site tour. This site
tour should be scheduled as soon as possible after the applicant has
provided copies of a map of existing conditions. At best, this would
occur after a sketch plan has been submitted but before preliminary
plans have been completed.
(1) This site tour is intended to informally:
(a) Familiarize Township officials with the property's existing
features, particularly including scenic views and the site's
relationship to surrounding areas;
(b) Identify potential site design issues that will need to be
addressed; and
(c) Discuss site design concepts, including the general layout of
proposed development and open spaces.
(2) Comments made during the site visit shall not be binding upon the
Township, and no formal action or recommendation shall be made
during the site visit.
C. Sketch plan. Prior to the submission of a preliminary plan, applicants
are very strongly encouraged to submit a sketch plan. A sketch plan
review often allows an applicant to save substantial time and
engineering costs, because many concerns about layout and issues
concerning Township ordinances can be resolved prior to detailed
engineering. This can often reduce the need for future redesign at a
more-detailed stage, thereby saving the applicant significant money
and time.
(1) No official action is required on a sketch plan, so it will not delay
the submittal of a preliminary plan.
A. Preliminary plan submission required.
(1) A preliminary plan submission for a major subdivision or land
development [except as provided in Subsection A(2) below]
§ 113-28 SEWERS § 113-29
99:303
meeting all of the requirements of this article shall be filed by the
applicant and reviewed in accordance with the provisions of this
article.
(2) A preliminary plan submission is not required for the following
applications, which instead shall meet the requirements in Article
VII:
(a) A minor subdivision (as defined in Article II);
(b) A submission that only involves a lot line adjustment (as
defined in Article II) or minor adjustments to a previously
approved plan as specified in § 113-40 or a merger or
consolidation of lots (also referred as reverse subdivision); or
(c) A land development that involves only one principal
nonresidential building or addition of less than 3,000 square
feet of building floor area on one lot without any additional
dwelling units.
B. Filing and distribution.
(1) The applicant shall file with the Township staff, at least 25 calendar
days prior to a regular Township Planning Commission meeting
(not including a workshop meeting): the required fees and the
information and plans required under § 113-30.
(a) Any subsequent submittal of revised plans shall be submitted
at least seven calendar days before a Planning Commission
meeting where the plans are intended to be reviewed, unless
permission is granted for a later submittal by the Township
Engineer, particularly when a revision only involves minor
technical changes or corrections.
(b) If the Planning Commission determines that a submittal is
significantly incomplete, it may recommend to the Board of
Supervisors that the application be denied. An application may
be denied if it is significantly incomplete.
(2) The Township staff shall forward applicable plans and documents
to the following persons or agencies to seek their comments prior
to preliminary plan approval:
(a) Sewer Authority (if applicable).
(b) Township Fire Marshal.
(c) The Township Planning Commission, provided prior to the first
regularly scheduled Planning Commission meeting after a
complete submission.
(d) United States Postal Service and York County 911.
§ 113-29 JACKSON CODE § 113-29
99:304
(3) Applicant's distribution. The applicant is fully responsible for the
following:
(a) Contacting the appropriate utility authorities/companies, as
appropriate, including the water supplier, to determine
availability of service.
(b) Seeking at least an informal review by PennDOT of any
proposed access onto a state road and providing PennDOT with
sufficient information for such a review.
(c) Determining whether any permits or approvals are needed
from any agency outside of the Township, including the DEP
(including any obstruction to a waterway) and the Army Corps
of Engineers (including determining whether any wetland will
be disturbed).
(d) Providing a copy of the sedimentation and erosion control
plans to the York County Conservation District, together with
its required review fees, if any earth disturbance is proposed,
unless the applicant states, in writing, in a signed letter to the
Township, that earth disturbance will not occur until approval
of the final plan (in which case the erosion control plan may be
submitted at the final plan stage).
(e) Adjacent municipalities. If any portion of a major subdivision or
land development is proposed within 200 feet of the boundary
of another municipality or would clearly have a regional impact
upon another municipality, as determined by the Township
Planning Commission, then the applicant shall provide a copy
of the layout plan to that municipality for an advisory review.
(f) Providing a copy of the plans and required fees to the York
County Planning Commission.
(g) Providing copies and making submittals to the Township and
review agencies as required under the Pennsylvania DEP's
sewage planning module process, if applicable.
(h) Providing materials needed by the Sewage Enforcement
Officer, if applicable.
(4) Notice to adjacent landowners. At the time of initial submittal of a
preliminary plan for any land development or major subdivision,
the applicant shall mail written notice of the proposal to all owners
of property that is contiguous or directly across a road from the
subject property. Such notice shall include the date, time and place
of the first Planning Commission meeting at which the application
is expected to be reviewed, with the phone number of the Township
Building. Such notice shall include a brief description of the
location of the proposed subdivision or land development and state
that copies of the proposal may be reviewed at the Township
§ 113-29 SEWERS § 113-29
99:305
Building. The notice shall state that meetings of the Township on
the proposal are open to the public.
(a) Such notices shall be mailed by United States mail with return
receipt requested at the applicant's expense. The applicant
shall furnish the Township with return receipts or other
evidence of compliance with this section prior to final plan
approval.
(5) Each preliminary plan and supporting documents should seek to
incorporate any revisions recommended by the Township and York
County Planning Commissions, the Township Engineer and other
appropriate Township officials during any sketch plan review.
(6) Colored layout plan. It is suggested that the applicant provide one
copy of the layout plan that is lightly colored to highlight major
features (such as paving, trees, waterways, streets, wetlands and
building locations, if known) to allow clear understanding by the
general public at public meetings.
(7) Revisions. A detailed list of revisions from a previously submitted
plan shall be provided whenever a revised plan is submitted. The
developer's plan preparer shall certify that the list of revisions is
complete.
C. Review by Township Engineer.
(1) After the plans are duly submitted for review (unless the plans are
significantly incomplete), the Township Engineer should review the
engineering considerations of the preliminary plan and prepare a
report on such considerations to the Planning Commission.
(2) The Township Engineer may make additional reports and
recommendations to the Commission and the Board of Supervisors
during review of the plan.
(3) The applicant and/or his/her engineer should make reasonable
efforts to resolve technical engineering considerations outside of
and prior to Planning Commission meetings.
(4) A copy of findings of the Township Engineer shall be sent or handed
in person to the applicant or his/her representative.
D. Review by Commission. The Planning Commission shall accomplish the
following within the time limitations of the Pennsylvania Municipalities
Planning Code (unless the applicant grants a written time extension),
while allowing a sufficient number of days within this deadline for a
decision by the Board of Supervisors:
(1) Review applicable reports received from any official reviewing
agencies.
§ 113-29 JACKSON CODE § 113-29
99:306
(2) Provide a recommendation regarding whether the preliminary plan
submission meets the requirements of this chapter and other
applicable ordinances.
(3) Recommend any revisions to the submission that are needed to
comply with this chapter or that would generally improve the plan.
(4) Recommend approval, conditional approval, or disapproval of the
preliminary plan submission in writing, via Commission minutes to
the Board of Supervisors, that should: specify any recommended
conditions for approval, identify defects found in the application,
describe requirements which have not been met, and cite the
provisions of the ordinance relied upon.
E. Review and action by Board of Supervisors. The Board of Supervisors
shall:
(1) Review the recommendation of the Commission and any reports
that have been received from reviewing agencies.
(2) Determine whether the preliminary plan submission meets the
requirements of this chapter and other ordinances.
(3) Approve, conditionally approve or disapprove the preliminary plan
submission within the time limits required by the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code. (As of adoption date of this chapter,
this law requires:

following the date of the first regular meeting of the
Commission held after the preliminary plan has been properly
filed for review; but in no case shall the Board of Supervisors'
decision be made later than 90 days following the date the
submission was accepted as being filed for review, unless the
applicant grants a written extension of time; and
(b) That no subdivision or land development shall be granted final
approval until a report is received from the County Planning
Commission or until the expiration of 30 days from the date the
application was forwarded to the County Planning
Commission, whichever comes first.)
F. Decision by Board of Supervisors.
(1) The decision of the Board of Supervisors shall be in writing and
shall be communicated to the applicant personally or by mail at his/
her last known address not later than 15 days following the
decision.
(2) Approval of the preliminary plan submission shall constitute
approval of the subdivision or land development as to the character
and intensity but shall not constitute approval of the final plan or
authorize the sale of lots or construction of buildings.
§ 113-29 SEWERS § 113-29
99:307
§ 113-30. Preliminary plan requirements.
See § 113-29A regarding when a preliminary plan is required.
(3) If the preliminary plan submission is disapproved, the decision
shall: specify defects found in the submission, describe
requirements which have not been met and cite the provisions of
the statute or ordinance relied upon in each case.
(4) At the discretion of the Board of Supervisors, the Board may grant
combined preliminary/final plan approval if the preliminary plan
submission also meets all of the requirements of a final plan
submission and the Board determines that there are no significant
outstanding matters regarding the plan.
(5) Acceptance of conditions. If conditions are placed upon an
approval, it shall be the responsibility of the applicant or his
authorized representative, in writing, to accept or reject the
conditions within a maximum of 30 days after the date of the
decision. If the applicant fails to accept or reject the conditions
within such time period, then it shall be presumed that the
applicant has accepted all of the conditions upon the approval. If
the applicant rejects any condition within such time period, then
the approval shall be rescinded, unless a decision of a court
determines such condition was not valid.
(a) The applicant shall be required to show compliance with all the
conditions upon the final plan approval within one year after
the date of the decision by the Board of Supervisors, unless a
written extension is granted by the Board of Supervisors.
G. Final plan submission deadline.
(1) An applicant shall file a final plan within five years from the date of
the approval of the preliminary plan by the Board of Supervisors.

preliminary plan null and void, and a new preliminary plan
submission and approval shall be required.
H. Development in stages. See § 113-34H.
A. All of the following information and materials listed in this section are
required as part of all preliminary plan submissions for any land
development and any major subdivision. This list of requirements shall
serve both to establish the requirements and as a checklist for the
applicant and the Township to use to ensure completeness of
submissions. The applicant shall submit completed photocopies of the
checklist in § 113-30C as part of the application.
§ 113-29 JACKSON CODE § 113-30
99:308
§ 113-31. Certification.
All certifications shall comply with the state professional licensing laws. All
subdivisions of land shall be certified and stamped by a registered land
surveyor. At least one set of all plans provided to the Township, including
revisions, shall bear original signatures and original seals of plan preparers,
which shall be marked as a "Township file copy."
§ 113-32. Site design process.
As part of the submittal of a sketch plan or preliminary plan, whichever
comes first, for a major subdivision or land development that involves over
10 acres of land for a nonresidential project or 20 or more dwelling units for
a residential project, the applicant shall provide the following mapping and
prove to the Planning Commission that the following process was followed
in designing the proposed development:
B. The required information listed in this section may be combined or
separated onto different sheets, provided that all information is clearly
readable.
C. Checklist and List of Submittal Requirements.85
A. Applicants are strongly encouraged to submit these sketches as part of
the sketch plan process, to avoid delays to the applicant in preliminary
plan approval. Submittal at the sketch plan stage will greatly increase
the likelihood that all issues will be able to be resolved in time to meet
the standard ninety-day time clock for approval of a preliminary plan
without needing time extensions.
B. This process is intended to show everyone how the special features of
the property relate to resource areas on adjacent lands and how the
development will properly relate to the features of the land that are
most worthy of conservation. See the "existing resources and site
analysis map" provisions in § 113-30C, Part D. Existing conditions shall
be accurately mapped. For the sole purposes of meeting this section,
the mapping of proposed development may be at a sketch plan level of
detail.
(1) Delineation of open space. Using the map of existing resources and
site analysis map, the applicant shall delineate areas that are
proposed to be preserved as common open space (if required by
§ 113-65 of this chapter, in a cluster development or other sections
of Chapter 133, Zoning) and/or otherwise through conservation
easements.
(a) If common open space in a development is proposed, then the
applicant shall show compliance with the applicable
85.Editor's Note: The Checklist and List of Submittal Requirements is included at the end of
this chapter.
§ 113-30 SEWERS § 113-32
99:309
requirements of Chapter 133, Zoning, including but not limited
to the following:
[1] Providing calculations of the minimum percent and
acreage of required common open space, which shall be
submitted at the sketch plan stage or the preliminary plan
stage, whichever submission occurs first.
[2] Proposed common open space shall be designated using
the existing resources and site analysis map as a base
map. The applicant shall prove compliance with applicable
provisions of Chapter 133, Zoning, and § 113-65 of this
chapter. The following areas shall be shown: one-hundredyear
floodplains, wetlands and slopes over 25%.
[3] The proposed common open space shall maximize
opportunities to interconnect open spaces with important
natural features and common open space on neighboring
properties (see the context map in § 113-30C, Part C). The
applicant should consider the Future Greenways and
Recreation System Map in the Joint Comprehensive Plan,
unless or until a more-detailed map is prepared for Jackson
Township.
[4] The applicant shall then prioritize natural resources on the
parcel in terms of highest to least suitabilities for inclusion
in the proposed common open space in consultation with
the Planning Commission and in accordance with § 113-71
of this chapter and applicable sections of Chapter 133,
Zoning,.
[5] On the basis of those priorities and practical
considerations given to the parcel's configuration, its
context in relation to resource areas on adjoining and
neighboring properties, and the applicant's subdivision
objectives, priority areas for conservation shall be
delineated to meet at least the minimum area percentage
requirements for common open space and in a manner
clearly indicating their boundaries as well as the types of
resources included within them.
(b) If open space in a development is not proposed, the applicant
shall show measures that will be used to minimize impacts
upon important natural features. The applicant shall show that
every reasonable effort has been made to locate development
to avoid the over-25% slopes and one-hundred-year floodplain
and wetlands and to minimize impact upon other natural and
historic resources. In addition to meeting any requirement for
common open space, important natural features should also be
protected as part of individual lots (such as large rear yards
and/or through conservation easements).
§ 113-32 JACKSON CODE § 113-32
99:310
(2) Potential development areas concept map. Based upon
consideration of the existing features map and the process
described above, the potential development areas shall be mapped.
These Potential development areas are areas that are best suited
for the majority of the development on the parcel.
(3) Location of home sites. In respect of the process described above,
the approximate proposed locations of new homes/principal
buildings shall then be selected. It is recognized that on-lot septic
system suitability needs to influence these choices, when septic
systems are used. It is also recognized that some intrusions into the
natural and historic resources may be necessary to allow
reasonable uses of the land, provided that such development is
carefully located and designed to minimize impacts upon valuable
resources and features.
(a) While the mapping of existing features required by this section
is required to be accurate and to scale, the locations of
proposed home sites, lot lines, roads and trails may be at a
sketch plan level of detail for the purposes of complying with
this section.
(b) The applicant shall provide a written and graphic analysis of
how the proposed development will respect and incorporate
the important resources of the site and be coordinated with
resources, open space/trail corridors and views on surrounding
properties. This may involve an overlay map that shows
important natural features and proposed development.
(4) Layout of streets and trails. A sketch of the tentative street layout
shall then be designed to serve the appropriate building sites.
Trails should also be considered to link together common open
spaces, clusters of homes and other destinations (such as nearby
stores, parks and schools). Building sites should be clustered
together to minimize expensive wetland and creek crossings by
roads.
(5) Drawing the lot lines. Tentative lot lines should then be drawn on
the site to encompass the proposed building sites, to result in a
development concept plan. Once this sketch is prepared, then
more-detailed engineering may be completed.

(1) The guaranty shall be secured by the credit of any of the following:
(a) An irrevocable and unconditional letter of credit of a federal- or
state-chartered lending institution;
(b) A restrictive or escrow account in a federal- or state-chartered
lending institution; or
(c) Such other financial security approved by the Board of
Supervisors (which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld), but not including a second or third mortgage on the
unimproved lands.
(2) Such approved security shall provide for, and secure to the public,
the completion of any improvements which may be required within
one year of the date fixed in the development agreement for the
completion of such improvements.

§ 113-47. Approval of improvements.
(3) Such financial security shall be posted with a federally issued or
state-chartered lending institution chosen by the party posting the
financial security, or such other approved entity, provided that such
institution or entity is authorized to conduct such business within
the state.
(a) The Board of Supervisors may require that evidence be
provided that such institution or entity has sufficiently
adequate and secure assets to cover the security.
(b) The Township shall be the authorized signatory on any account
in which the escrow funds are held.
B. Amount of security.
(1) The amount of financial security to be posted for the completion of
the required improvements shall be equal to 110% of the cost of
completion, estimated as of 90 days following the date scheduled
for completion by the developer in the official development
schedule, and within the process for increases to cover inflation as
permitted by the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code.
(2) The cost of the improvements shall be established by an estimate
prepared by a Pennsylvania Registered professional engineer,
which shall be reviewed by the Township Engineer, within the
arbitration process permitted by the Pennsylvania Municipalities
Planning Code.
(3) If the party posting the financial security requires more than one
year from the date of posting of the financial security to complete
the required improvements, the amount of financial security may
be increased by a maximum of an additional 10% for each one-year
period beyond the first anniversary date from posting of financial
security or to an amount not exceeding 110% of the cost of
completing the required improvements, as reestablished on or
about the expiration of the preceding one-year period by using the
above procedure.
(4) Inspection fees. The amount of financial security shall also include
an additional 5% of the estimated cost of completion of the work to
guarantee payment of inspection fees and related engineering
costs.
C. Multiyear or multistage development. In the case where development is
projected over a period of years, the Board of Supervisors may
authorize submission of final plans by phases/stages of development,
subject to such requirements or improvement guaranties concerning
future improvements as it finds necessary for the proper functioning of
each phase and for the eventual development as a whole.
§ 113-46 JACKSON CODE § 113-47
99:328
A. Advance notice by developer of construction of improvements.
(1) Meetings. Prior to construction or installation of improvements in
any new phase or any major facet of construction, the developer or
his/her representative shall contact the Township Engineer to
determine whether a preconstruction meeting is needed. The
Township Engineer may require that such meeting be attended by
the responsible contractor(s) and responsible representatives of
the developer. In addition, meetings may be required with the
utility companies as needed.
(2) The developer or his/her representative shall provide a minimum of
three business days' prior notice to the Township staff prior to
beginning each major facet of construction, in order to allow the

and a list of those items completed.
(4) See § 113-48A(1)(a) concerning improvements completed without
proper Township inspection.
B. Request for release of security. When an improvement has been
completed, the party posting the financial security shall notify the
Township and request, in writing, to the Board of Supervisors, by
certified or registered mail, release of related financial security. The
developer shall send a copy of that letter to the Township Engineer at
the same time.
C. Engineer's report.
(1) Within 30 days of a receipt under § 113-47B, the Township
Engineer shall submit a written report certifying which
improvements have been completed in accordance with the
approved plan to the Board of Supervisors and mail a copy of such
report by certified or registered mail to the developer or his/her

90.Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10510.
§ 113-47 JACKSON CODE § 113-48
99:330
§ 113-49. Maintenance guaranty.
the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code.91 In addition, the
Township may pursue civil prosecution of a violation of this chapter.
(a) Construction without inspection. If required improvements
have been completed without providing the Township Engineer
or his/her representatives with proper opportunity for
inspection, and as a result the Township Engineer cannot
determine whether the improvements were properly
constructed, then the Board of Supervisors may require that
the developer, at the developer's expense, remove, replace,
sample, test or reconstruct such improvements as necessary to
determine compliance with this chapter and other applicable
Township standards.
(2) Rate of construction. Failure of a developer to construct streets and
other public improvements approximately at the same time or prior
to the construction of the buildings served by those streets or
public improvements, and at the same rate in time at which
buildings are completed, shall be a violation of this chapter and a
cause for default of the security.
B. Completion by Township. If the proceeds of such security are
insufficient to pay the cost of installing or making repairs or corrections
to all the improvements covered by said security, the Board of
Supervisors may, at its option, install or replace part of such
improvements in all or part of the subdivision or land development and
may institute appropriate legal or equitable action to recover the
moneys necessary to complete the remainder of the improvements.
C. Proceeds for installation of improvements. The proceeds from use of the
security and/or from any legal or equitable action brought against the
developer shall be used solely for the installation of the improvements
covered by such security and directly related administrative costs.
A. Maintenance guaranty required. All applicants proposing any
subdivision or land development which provides for the dedication of
improvements required by this chapter shall be required to provide a
legally binding maintenance guaranty to the Township prior to
acceptance of dedication of the improvements by the Township. In most
cases, this guaranty will be part of the security agreement.
B. Terms of maintenance guaranty. The maintenance guaranty shall be
acceptable in legal form to the Township Solicitor and in content to the
Board of Supervisors and shall include all of the following:
(1) That the applicant make any repair or reconstruction of any
improvement stipulated in the maintenance agreement which is
91.Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10511.
§ 113-48 SEWERS § 113-49
99:331
specified by the Board of Supervisors if needed because of faulty
construction, workmanship, or materials, prior to acceptance of
such improvement by the Township;
(2) That the applicant maintain, at his/her own cost, all improvements
stipulated in the maintenance agreement, up to a maximum period
of 18 months from the date of completion, except for any specialpurpose
escrow or maintenance agreements required by the
Township; and
(3) That the applicant post financial security to secure structural
integrity of said improvements as well as the functioning of said
improvements in accordance with the design and specifications as
depicted on the final plan, for a maximum term of 18 months from
the date of completion.
C. Public utilities and authorities. If water mains or sanitary sewer lines,
or both, and related apparatus or facilities are to be installed under the
jurisdiction and under the rules and regulations of a public utility or
municipal authority, financial security to assure proper completion and
maintenance thereof shall be posted in accordance with the regulations
of the controlling public utility or municipal authority. This amount of
financial security shall not also be required by the Township if it is
required by such utility or authority.
D. Type of security. The maintenance guaranty shall be secured by the
same form of security as is permitted for the improvements guaranties.
E. Terms. Such maintenance guaranty shall be in the form approved by the
Township Solicitor and Board of Supervisors, payable to the Township,
to guarantee the maintenance and repair of the streets and other public
improvements in the subdivision or land development for 18 months
from the date of completion. The applicant shall prove to the
satisfaction of the Board of Supervisors that there will be an acceptable
system for the long-term maintenance of any stormwater detention
basins.
F. Amount. The amount of the maintenance guaranty shall be determined
by the applicant's engineer, conditioned upon acceptance by Board of
Supervisors, but shall not exceed 15% of the actual cost of installation
of such improvements.
G. Release. After a maximum of 18 months from the date of acceptance of
dedication of said improvements, the Township shall release the
maintenance guaranty to the developer (or party that posted the
guaranty) if all improvements are in satisfactory condition, as
determined by the Township.

Design Standards and Required Improvements
§ 113-53. Streets.
A. Access to streets.
(1) All proposed subdivisions and land developments shall have
adequate and safe access to the public street system.
(2) Frontage.
(a) Any lot created under this chapter shall have frontage and
access onto a public street (which may be required to be
improved as necessary under § 113-53J).
(b) If a residential lot is adjacent to two streets, it shall only have
vehicle access onto the street with the lesser classification.
Such limitation shall be stated on the plan.
B. Street continuations.
(1) Stub street right-of-way. Where deemed necessary by the Township
for efficient movement of traffic, a subdivision or land development
shall include the extension of a street right-of-way to the boundary
line of the parcel proposed for development to provide for an
eventual extension into the adjacent tract for efficient circulation of
traffic throughout the area. If a stub street is constructed, see
§ 113-53H, which addresses temporary turnarounds.
(a) Where a stub street exists on an adjacent property, a
connection to that stub street is required to be built by the
applicant/developer.
(2) Widening. Where a subdivision or land development abuts or
contains an existing street of inadequate cartway or right-of-way
width, additional right-of-way and/or cartway width shall be
required conforming with Table 10.1, Design Standards for Streets.
See § 113-53J(3) concerning right-of-way and fees in lieu of
widening.
C. Intersections.
(1) The center lines of streets shall intersect at right angles.
(2) Alignment of street intersections.
(a) No more than two streets shall intersect at one point.
(b) Where a proposed street or access drive intersects an existing
cross street, such proposed street or access drive shall be
aligned with any street intersecting on the other side of the
cross street.
§ 113-53 SEWERS § 113-53
99:335
(c) If a proposed street cannot intersect at the same location as a
street on the other side of the cross street, then the proposed
street shall be offset by the following minimum distances from
the nearest intersection of streets:
[1] One hundred fifty feet along a local street.
[2] Four hundred feet along a collector street.
[3] Eight hundred feet along an arterial street.
(d) Measurement. The minimum distances of this subsection shall
be measured between the points where the center lines of the
rights-of-way of the intersecting streets intersect with the
center line of the cross street.
(3) At street intersections, curblines shall be rounded by arcs with the
radii listed below, whichever is most restrictive. The right of way
shall be maintained at least 10 feet from the inside of the curbline
or edge of pavement.

99:336
(2) The restriction of ingress and egress involving left-hand turns onto
or off of the arterial or collector street with Township-approved
medians, signage and/or other devices to prevent unauthorized
turns; and/or
(3) The prohibition of driveways from individual dwellings entering
directly onto an arterial or collector street. If there is no alternative
to this, each driveway entering onto an arterial or collector street
shall have adequate turnaround space for vehicles provided within
the lot so that vehicles do not back onto the street.
E. Street design standards.
(1) Minimum street design standards shall be as shown in Table 10.1,
unless PennDOT establishes a more-restrictive requirement along a
state road. The definitions of types of streets in Article II shall
apply.
(2) Shoulders. In addition to the cartway widths stated above, any
street that does not have curbs shall include appropriate six-footwide
shoulders along each side of the cartway of an arterial street
and four-foot-wide shoulders on each side of the cartway of any
other street. See the Township Construction and Materials
Specifications.92
(3) Horizontal curves shall connect street lines with deflections.
Vertical curves shall be used at all changes of grade. The length of
the vertical curve shall be determined by the required site distance
specified in Table 10.1.
(4) All approaches to intersections shall have a leveling area not
greater than 4% grade for a minimum distance of 25 feet,
measured from the nearest edge of the cartway of the intersecting
street.

(b) If the applicant proves to the Township that it is not possible to
meet the required sight distances that are stated in PennDOT
regulations, then the intersection shall be located at the point
of maximum sight distances that are achievable within the
street length of the property.
(c) In the event that turning movements from an intersection are
to be restricted, the applicant shall provide a detailed design of
the proposed intersection and an engineering analysis of the
anticipated impacts resulting from such restricted turning
movements. The design and analysis shall be prepared by a
professional engineer with expertise in traffic engineering and
shall address the following:
[1] The impacts on other lots and streets within the vicinity
that may be used by motorists for turnarounds.
[2] The impacts on public safety, considering sight distance
and types of vehicles.
[3] The provision of appropriate methods to ensure
compliance with the turning restrictions, such as
channelization, alignment, and signage. Such methods
must meet applicable standards of PennDOT.
H. Cul-de-sac streets.
(1) Cul-de-sac, cul-de-loop and P-streets shall be permitted with a
maximum length of 800 feet and a minimum length of 250 feet.

case, the temporary cul-de-sac land area that is excess shall revert
to the adjacent landowners after the turnaround is no longer used.
(4) The maximum cross slope on the circular part of a cul-de-sac shall
be 6%.
(5) A cul-de-sac street shall serve a maximum of 25 dwelling units or
250 trips per weekday for nonresidential uses.
(6) A snow storage easement shall be established at the end of the culde-
sac, which shall provide for proper drainage as the snow melts.
This easement shall be located so that a snowplow can push snow
relatively straight from the street to the far end of the cul-de-sac.
This snow storage easement shall be located clear of any driveways
and mailboxes and have a minimum width of 40 feet and minimum
depth of 20 feet. The easement shall be grassed and maintained by
the owner of the lot on which the easement is located.
(7) The Township may require that a cul-de-sac street near the edge of
a subdivision or land development include provisions to allow the
street to be extended in the future onto an adjacent tract. This shall
include provisions for a public street right-of-way to the edge of the
tract. In such case, the construction costs to extend the street shall
be borne by the adjacent developer in the future.
I. Street design standards.
(1) Streets (and alleys, where provided) shall be graded, improved and
surfaced to the grades and dimensions shown on plans, profiles and
cross sections submitted by the developer and as approved by the
Board of Supervisors and shall meet applicable Township
standards.
(2) Right-of-way grading.
(a) The right-of-way shall be graded according to the approved
cross-section and grading plan.
(b) The finished street surface shall be crowned in conformance
with the Township specifications.
(c) A proper superelevation (banked curves) shall be provided on
arterial and collector streets when required by AASHTO
Design Standards.
(3) Grading beyond right-of-way.
§ 113-53 SEWERS § 113-53
99:341
(a) The subdivider or developer may be required to grade beyond
the right-of-way line in order to provide continuous slope from
the right-of-way line to the proposed elevation of the abutting
property.
(b) Such grading beyond the right-of-way shall generally maintain
the original directions of slope, except where stormwater
runoff designs dictate changes.
(c) Approved plans, either preliminary or final, showing proposed
grading, shall be binding upon all future lot owners.
(d) In no case shall the required street grading extend onto an
adjoining property with a different landowner, unless the other
adjoining property owner gives a written agreement to the
developer to accomplish such work. A copy of such agreement
shall be provided to the Township.
(4) Stormwater design. Drainage of streets shall comply with Chapter
107, Stormwater Management.
(5) Street construction standards. All materials, construction
procedures and other specifications shall be in conformance with
the Jackson Township Construction and Materials Specifications.93
(6) Guide rails. Streets shall be designed with geometric features that
minimize the need for guide rails. Guide rails shall only be installed
where the result of striking an object or leaving the roadway would
be more severe than the consequence of striking the guide rail.
(a) Guide rails shall be installed by the developer where necessary
to meet the guide rail standards in the PennDOT publication
entitled "Guidelines for Design of Local Roads and Streets."
Guide rails shall meet the construction standards of PennDOT
Publication 408 and PennDOT Standards for Roadway
Construction.
(7) The Township will require an applicant to provide traffic and
engineering studies for all proposed traffic control signs.
J. Required transportation improvements.
(1) Purpose. In recognition of Sections 503(2)(ii) and 503(3) of the
Municipalities Planning Code,94 this section is primarily intended to
ensure that streets bordering a subdivision or land development
are coordinated and of such widths and grades and in such
locations as deemed necessary to accommodate prospective traffic
and to facilitate fire protection and to ensure that the access into
and out of subdivisions and land developments is sufficiently safe.
93.Editor's Note: The Construction and Materials Specifications are on file in the Township
offices.
94.Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10503.
§ 113-53 JACKSON CODE § 113-53
99:342
(2) Process. This Subsection J shall be carried out through
determinations of the Board of Supervisors, after considering any
recommendations of the Planning Commission, the Township
Engineer, the applicant, the applicant's professional
representatives, any comments from PennDOT that may be
provided regarding a state road, and any professional traffic
studies that may have been submitted.
(3) On-site/abutting traffic improvements. If, in the determination of
the Board of Supervisors, there is a reasonable relationship
between the need for an on-site improvement and the traffic
created by a proposed subdivision or land development, the
applicant for such subdivision or land development shall be
required to complete the needed improvement or fund his/her fair
share of the cost of such transportation improvement and to
dedicate sufficient street right-of-way for needed improvements.
(a) On-site improvements include all street improvements
constructed on the applicant's property or the improvements
constructed on the property abutting the applicant's property
necessary for the ingress or egress to the applicant's property.
(b) On-site improvements may include but are not limited to a new
or upgraded traffic signal, land dedication to improve an
abutting intersection, realignment of an abutting curve in a
road or the widening of the abutting cartway and right-of-way.
(c) Widening of abutting street. An applicant for any land
development or subdivision shall be required to widen, pave
and improve any abutting street and provide additional rightof-
way as needed to meet current Township standards.
(d) Existing streets with insufficient right-of-way. Where a public
street exists with a right-of-way of less than the width required
by this section, then, as part of any new subdivision or land
development, additional right-of-way shall be dedicated to
bring the adjacent street segment into conformance. For
example, if a street has a thirty-three-foot-wide right-of-way,
and a fifty-foot-wide right-of-way is required, and a subdivision
only involves one side of the street, then the applicant shall
dedicate 8.5 feet of additional right-of-way so that there is at
least 25 feet of right-of-way from the original center line of the
street.
(e) Any improvement to a state road shall meet all PennDOT
standards.
(f) Fee in lieu of street improvements. Where this chapter would
require widening of a street and/or the construction of curbing,
and where the applicant desires to not complete such
improvements, and where the applicant proves to the
satisfaction of the Board of Supervisors that such widening
§ 113-53 SEWERS § 113-53
99:343
and/or curbing is not essential at that location at the present
time, then the Board of Supervisors may offer the option of a
fee in lieu of the street widening or curbing.
[1] The Township Engineer shall provide a review of the need
for and cost of the street widening or curbing to the Board
of Supervisors. The fee shall be equal to 100% of the
estimated costs of the street widening and/or curbing,
unless another fee is established by resolution of the Board
of Supervisors.
(4) Funding. In place of completing a required street improvement as a
condition of final approval, an applicant may enter into a legally
binding development agreement with the Township for the
applicant to fund the improvement, or his/her fair share of such
improvement, as determined by the Board of Supervisors.
(5) Staging. Any completion or funding of a required improvement may
occur in stages in relationship to the stages of the development, if
so stated in a legally binding development agreement and/or as a
condition of final plan approval.
K. Traffic impact studies.
(1) Purposes:
(a) To enable the Township to assess the impact of a proposed
development on the transportation system.
(b) To ensure that proposed developments do not adversely affect
the transportation network.
(c) To identify any traffic problems associated with access from
the site to the existing transportation network.
(d) To delineate solutions to potential problems and propose
improvements to be incorporated into the proposed
development.
(2) Applicability.
(a) A traffic impact study shall be required for any subdivision or
land development that at build-out after completion of all
phases is projected to generate 250 or more average daily trip
ends. "Trip ends" shall mean the total number of trips both
entering and exiting the proposed development. These
projected trip ends shall be based on the latest edition of the
publication titled Trip Generation, published by the Institute
of Transportation Engineers, or upon traffic studies conducted
within the last five years at comparable developments that are
acceptable to the Township Engineer. The ITE land use codes
shall be stated.
§ 113-53 JACKSON CODE § 113-53
99:344
[1] The traffic impact study requirements of this section shall
still be met even if PennDOT requires a separate traffic
impact study. However, the Township Engineer shall
require technical adjustments in the traffic impact study
provisions so there are not inconsistencies between the
two sets of requirements. See PennDOT's HOP Handbook,
Publication 282.
(b) The traffic impact study shall consider the entire development
at build-out. If a development is proposed to be submitted in
phases, the initial traffic study shall consider a reasonable
estimate of the likely development in later phases, in addition
to the current phase.
(c) The boundaries of the study area to be analyzed shall include
those existing and proposed streets and intersections which
may be affected by the proposed subdivision or land
development. If there is any dispute as to whether existing and
proposed streets and intersections may be affected or not, the
final discretion shall rest with the Township Engineer or
designated traffic engineer.
(d) In lieu of submitting a traffic impact study, under the
provisions of § 113-7, the Board of Supervisors may accept a
fee from an applicant to be put towards the cost of a larger,
more-comprehensive traffic study or to accept a developer
making an improvement to a street that otherwise would not
be required by the Township or PennDOT. For a larger traffic
study, the Township shall have the authority to select a
consultant or request that PennDOT conduct a study.
(e) Prior to preparing a traffic impact study, the applicant is
requested to meet with the Township Engineer, Township staff,
officials of PennDOT and York County Planning Commission
(YCPC) staff.
(3) Traffic impact study contents.
(a) Site description. This section shall include the location,
proposed land uses, acreage, construction staging and
completion date of the proposed land development. Types of
dwelling units and number of bedrooms shall be included for
residential developments, and gross and usable floor area for
nonresidential developments. A brief description of
surrounding land uses and other proposed land developments
within the study area shall be provided. A study area map
should also be included.
(b) Transportation facilities description.
[1] The study shall describe the proposed internal
transportation system, including vehicular, bicycle, bus
§ 113-53 SEWERS § 113-53
99:345
and pedestrian circulation, all internal roadway widths
and rights-of-way, parking conditions, traffic
channelizations and any traffic controls within the site. If
the site will be served by public transit, the study shall
describe any benches, shelter or transit signs that will be
provided.
[2] The study shall describe the location and design of
proposed access, including sight distance limitations and
distance from adjacent driveways and intersections.
[3] The report shall describe the external roadway system
within the study area. Major intersections in the study
area shall be identified and mapped. Pedestrian and
bicycle facilities on abutting properties shall also be
documented. All proposed or approved roadway
improvements within the study area shall be noted.
[a] As applicable, the study shall also assess transit
service, rail freight operations, potential ride-sharing
services and other modes of transportation and their
impacts. The potential for a bus shelter at a public
transit stop should be considered. The design of any
new public transit stop or bus shelter shall be
forwarded to the local public transit agency for
comment.
[b] The study shall also consider whether any
improvements are needed to encourage bicycle or
pedestrian access.
[4] The report shall list the proposed timing of construction of
transportation improvements, including current
scheduling on the York Area Metropolitan Planning
Organization (YAMPO) Transportation Improvement
Program. If construction bid, let and completion dates
have been determined, they shall be noted. If there are any
conflicts between the scheduled completion of external
road improvements versus transportation improvements
to be completed within the development, the conflict shall
be evaluated, with recommendations to resolve any
conflicts. This section shall also consider the scheduled
timing of any external public transit, rail or recreation trail
improvements.
(c) Existing traffic conditions.
[1] Existing traffic conditions shall be documented for all
streets and intersections in the study area. Traffic volumes
shall be recorded for existing average daily traffic, for
existing peak-hour traffic and for traffic during the
development's peak hour. Complete traffic counts at all
§ 113-53 JACKSON CODE § 113-53
99:346
intersections in the study area shall be conducted,
encompassing the peak hours of the development and
roadway. If the use will not be open during a peak hour of
adjacent traffic, that hour does not need to be evaluated.
If a use/development will have a peak hour of traffic
generation that is different from the peak hour of adjacent
traffic, that peak hour for the use/development shall also
be considered. A volume capacity analysis using the
procedures of the current Highway Capacity Manual and
based upon existing volumes shall be performed during
the peak hour(s) of the development for the peak hour(s)
of all roadways and major intersections in the study area.
Levels of service shall be determined for each location.
[2] The study shall include information on traffic accidents at
intersections in the study area for the previous five years,
if such information is available from PennDOT or local
police. Safety conditions shall be assessed. Accident
frequency per year should be noted.
(d) Traffic impact of the development.
[1] Estimation of vehicular trips to result from the proposal
shall be completed for the peak hour(s) of both the street
system and the development. Acceptable source(s) and
methodology shall be followed. Data sources and study
methodology shall be referenced in the report. These
generated volumes shall be distributed to the study area
and assigned to the existing streets and intersections
throughout the study area. The report shall describe the
basis for distributing trips in various directions.
Documentation of all assumptions used in the distribution
and assignment phase shall be provided. Traffic volumes
shall be assigned to all access points.
[2] Safety issues for any pedestrian crossings shall be
described, including any need for improvements and
whether the applicant proposes to fund such
improvements.
[3] The method of calculating trip generation shall be
included. Any characteristics of the site that will cause trip
generation rates that vary from the most current ITE
Manual are subject to approval by the Township Engineer.
[4] Calculations performed in the study analysis shall be
included in an appendix of the report.
[5] The distribution of trips and the assignment of
percentages and volumes shall be presented in graphic
form for each major intersection, along with an
explanation of their derivation.
§ 113-53 SEWERS § 113-53
99:347
(e) Analysis of traffic impact.
[1] The study shall project future traffic conditions if the
proposed subdivision/land development would not be built.
This demand shall consist of the combination of the
existing traffic expanded to the completion year through
the use of an accepted background growth rate and the
traffic generated by other proposed developments in the
study area. To assist in determining the background
growth rate, the Annual PennDOT Traffic Report shall be
considered. A compound interest rate shall be used to
calculate yearly estimate increases in background traffic.
[2] The total future traffic demand based on full occupancy of
the proposed subdivision or land development shall be
calculated for the existing and proposed streets and
intersections.
[3] A volume/capacity analysis shall also be conducted using
the total future demand and the future roadway capacity.
This analysis shall be performed using the peak hour(s) for
all streets and major intersections in the study area. The
Township Engineer may also require this analysis to be
conducted for the peak hour(s) of the development.
Volume/capacity calculations shall be completed for all
movements at major intersections. Levels of service for all
streets and intersections shall be listed.
[4] The study shall consider the opening year for the
development. If the development will be phased, the study
shall consider the year the first phase will be completed
and the year when the entire development will be
complete. The study shall also evaluate a time period 10
years after the opening year.
[5] In addition to intersection analysis, the Township may
require level-of-service analysis of a road corridor if a
particular concern exists.
[6] As applicable, the study shall analyze traffic signal
warrants, traffic signal optimization, turn lane needs, right
turn lane/deceleration lane needs, intersection gap
analysis and queue analysis.
[7] The analysis shall use the latest version of the Highway
Capacity Manual software or its equivalent.
[8] The study shall be conducted for improvements proposed
to mitigate the traffic deficiencies that were identified,
such as a new traffic signal.
§ 113-53 JACKSON CODE § 113-53
99:348
[9] Pedestrian circulation and transit service shall also be
evaluated.
(f) Conclusions and recommended improvements.
[1] Any movements on streets and intersections within the
study area showing a Level of Service E or worse, based on
the latest edition of the Highway Capacity Manual, shall be
considered deficient. Specific recommendations for the
elimination of these problems shall be listed. Unsignalized
intersections shall be evaluated for a signal warrant.
Highway capacity evaluations shall consider not only the
overall intersection level of service but also each approach
and movement to identify any substandard values which
need to be improved.
[2] At all locations where the level of service for the
completion year of the development is deficient without
the proposed development, the study shall determine
improvements which would provide a level of service and
delay no worse than future conditions without the subject
development. These improvements may include street and
intersection design and improvements, traffic signal
installation and operation, traffic signal timing and other
improvements. The study shall also provide an analysis to
determine improvements which would eliminate all
deficient levels of service.
[3] Actions to facilitate use of bus or van service and
carpooling should be included, if applicable.
[4] The listing of recommended improvements for both streets
and transit shall include, for each improvement, the party
responsible for the improvement, a preliminary cost
estimate and funding of the improvement, and the phase of
development during which the improvement is proposed to
be completed. Any roadway improvement which requires
increased right-of-way shall be identified. The study should
estimate the applicant's fair share of the costs of the
needed improvements. Calculations to support a fair-share
allocation of costs shall be included in the appendix of the
report.
[5] The traffic impact study may be used as a basis for a
Township requirement under § 113-53J or another section
of this chapter
[6] Improvement plans should not be submitted to the
Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT)
before they are submitted to the Township. Approval of a
site access plan by PennDOT does not guarantee approval
by the Township and vice versa.
§ 113-53 SEWERS § 113-53
99:349
§ 113-54. Access drives and driveways.
[7] This section shall also address any pedestrian, bicycle,
transit and rail freight issues. Any proposed railroad
sidings or crossings shall be described, as well as any
related safety issues.
[8] See also the airport safety zones' provisions in Chapter
133, Zoning.
(g) Preparation and review. The preparer of the traffic impact
study shall be a professional engineer or transportation
planner. The developer shall reimburse the Township for
reasonable fees and expenses incurred by the Township
Engineer or traffic engineer for the review of the developer's
traffic impact study and plans.
(h) Data sources and methodology shall be included in the report.
A. Construction standards. See the Township Construction and Materials
Specifications.95
B. Access; state roads. A state highway occupancy permit is required for
all access onto or work within the right-of-way of a state road. A
Township driveway permit shall be obtained before any vehicle access
is allowed from a state road or Township-owned street.
(1) The applicant shall comply with any requirement of PennDOT to
provide advance notice to the York County Planning Commission of
a driveway highway occupancy permit application.
C. Additional requirements. See §§ 133-34 and 133-35 of Chapter 133,
Zoning.
D. Drainage. The developer shall make adequate provisions to maintain
uninterrupted parallel drainage along a street where intersected by an
access drive or driveway. Access drives and aisles within parking lots
shall be graded and drained to keep the primary travel lane free of
stormwater.
E. Shoulder. The grade of the shoulder of a road shall be maintained along
its length and shall not be filled in to allow the construction of a
driveway or access drive at a higher grade.
F. Shared driveways. A shared driveway serving more than one lot shall
only be approved if a variance is secured from the Township Zoning
Hearing Board.
G. Turnarounds. For lots abutting collector or arterial streets, driveways
shall be designed with a location on the lot to turn a vehicle around, so

§ 113-56. Sidewalks, pathways and driveway aprons.
as not to require a vehicle to back out onto that collector or arterial
street.
A. Interconnected parking lots. Adjacent to a collector or arterial street
where two lots that are each intended for current or future business
uses will be contiguous to each other, the following shall apply:
(1) When two contiguous business uses or lots are in common
ownership at the time of subdivision or land development
application, the parking lots shall include an interconnection to
allow motorists and pedestrians to travel from one business to
another business without needing to reenter a public street.
(2) Where two contiguous lots involving current or future businesses
are not in common ownership, the applicant for a subdivision or
land development shall seek permission from the abutting lot
owner to allow a vehicle interconnection between the parking lots.
Unless the abutting property owner refuses to permit the
interconnection, the subdivision or land development shall include
the construction of a vehicle and pedestrian interconnection
between the parking areas.
(a) If the abutting property owner refuses to permit the
interconnection or the interconnection is currently not
feasible, the Board of Supervisors may require that the
subdivision or land development include an easement allowing
a future interconnection and/or construct the interconnection
as a stub up to the applicant's property line.
(3) Where an interconnection is required or planned between two uses
or lots, the subdivision or land development shall include a suitable
cross-easement that permits vehicles and pedestrians from one use
or lot to have access through the parking lot and driveway of the
adjacent use or lot.
A. Sidewalks built to Township specifications shall be required, unless the
Board of Supervisors determines they are not necessary for safe
pedestrian movement or unless the applicant proves that sidewalk
construction is not feasible considering the topography or other natural
limitations. In any case, sidewalks shall not be required along singlefamily
detached dwelling lots of greater than 20,000 square feet in lot
area, unless the Board of Supervisors determines that a situation exists
that is exceptionally hazardous to pedestrians and/or is within close
proximity to a public school or is needed to tie into an existing walkway
system.
§ 113-54 SEWERS § 113-56
99:351
(1) An applicant may propose an alternate system of pathways that
serve the same purposes as sidewalks and which guarantee public
access but which are not necessarily within a street right-of-way.
B. Pathway or bikeway.
(1) If deemed necessary for the convenient and safe circulation of
bicycles and pedestrians, the Board of Supervisors, upon the
recommendation of the Planning Commission, may require that a
major subdivision or land development include the construction of
a pathway or bikeway.
(2) A bikeway/pathway shall have a minimum width of eight feet and a
maximum width of 12 feet. It may be required to be placed within a
street right-of-way in place of a sidewalk or may be placed
elsewhere on a lot within an easement or other right-of-way.
C. Location and width of sidewalks.
(1) Sidewalks, where required or provided, shall be located within the
street right-of-way and should be no closer than four feet from the
curbline. Any area between the sidewalk and curb shall be planted
in an attractive vegetative ground cover, such as grass. This strip
shall only be paved at driveway entrances.
(2) Any required sidewalks shall have a minimum width of five feet
along arterial streets or along routes used to access primary or
secondary schools and four feet along collector or local streets in
other locations.
D. Construction.
(1) Sidewalks shall meet construction specifications in the Township
Construction and Materials Specifications.96
(2) Bikeways/pathways shall be constructed of a one-inch bituminous
surface course, a one-and-five-tenths-inch bituminous binder
course, and six inches of compacted gravel or crushed stone, unless
an alternative standard is preapproved by the Township. To the
maximum extent feasible considering topography, pathways should
be accessible to persons in wheelchairs. Stop signs shall be posted
along bikeways where they meet streets. Pedestrian advisory signs
shall be posted along streets where they meet bikeways/pathways.
E. Accessibility requirements. Federal ADA requirements shall be met.
F. Maintenance. It shall be the responsibility of adjacent landowners to
maintain, plow snow and remove ice off of and repair sidewalks.

§ 113-57. Illumination.
Where a use involves exterior lighting, the lighting must be so located and
shielded that no objectionable illumination or glare is cast upon adjoining
properties or any adjacent public street. To allow performance evaluation, a
lighting plan is required.
A. Applicability.
(1) Outdoor lighting shall be required for safety and personal security
for uses that operate or have activity during hours of darkness
where there is public assembly and traverse, including but not
limited to the following uses: residential developments containing
lot sizes of less than 20,000 square feet, residential developments
of greater than 10 lots, multifamily residential developments, and
commercial, industrial, municipal, recreational and institutional
developments.
(2) The Township Supervisors may require that lighting be
incorporated for other uses or locations or restrict lighting in any of
the above uses when deemed necessary to accomplish the purposes
of this chapter.
(3) The glare-control requirements herein contained apply to lighting
in all above-mentioned uses, as well as but not limited to sign,
architectural, landscape, recreational and residential lighting.
(4) Temporary decorative lighting may be exempt from the
requirements of this chapter when approved by the Zoning Officer
for periods of short duration.
B. Criteria.
(1) Illumination levels.
(a) Lighting, where required or permitted by this chapter, shall
have intensities and uniformity ratios in accordance with the
current recommended practices of the Illuminating
Engineering Society of North America (IESNA), as contained in
the IESNA Lighting Handbook or separately in IESNA
Recommended Practices.
(b) Future amendments to said recommended practices shall
become a part of this chapter without further action of the
Township.
(c) Examples of intensities for typical outdoor applications, as
extracted from the Lighting Handbook, are presented below

Notes:
1. Illumination levels are maintained horizontal
footcandles on the task, e.g., pavement or area surface.
2. Uniformity ratios dictate that average illuminance
values shall not exceed minimum values by more than
the product of the minimum value and the specified
ratio, e.g., for high-activity commercial parking, the
average illuminance shall not exceed 3.6 footcandles
(0.9 x 4).
* In no case shall the maximum to minimum uniformity
ratio for parking be in excess of 20:1.
(2) Lighting fixture design.
(a) Fixtures shall be of a type and design appropriate to the
lighting application and aesthetically acceptable to the
Township Supervisors.
(b) For the lighting of predominantly horizontal surfaces, such as
but not limited to roadways, areas of vehicular and pedestrian
passage, loading areas, and parking areas, fixtures, whether
freestanding, wall-mounted, or any other type, shall be aimed
straight down and shall meet IESNA full-cutoff criteria.
(c) Where the use of fixtures meeting IESNA full-cutoff criteria is
not practical or possible, fixtures shall be equipped with
aiming and/or light-redirecting devices such as shields, visors,
baffles, skirts or hoods when necessary to direct or redirect
offending light distribution.
(d) The use of floodlighting, spotlighting, noncutoff wall-mounted
fixtures, internally illuminated decorative globes and spheres,
lanterns and other fixtures not meeting IESNA full-cutoff
criteria shall be permitted only with the approval of the
Township, based upon acceptable justification and
achievement of adequate glare control.
(e) National Electrical Manufacturers' Association (NEMA) - head
fixtures, also known as "barn lights" or "dusk-to-dawn lights,"
shall not be permitted where they are visible from other uses,
unless fitted with a reflector or shield to render them full cutoff
(i.e., shielded to prohibit light emission at a ninety-degree
angle or greater).
(3) Control of nuisance and disabling glare
(a) All outdoor lighting, whether or not required by this chapter,
on private, residential, commercial, industrial, municipal,
recreational or institutional property shall be aimed, located,
designed, fitted and maintained so as not to present a hazard
§ 113-57 SEWERS § 113-57
99:355
§ 113-58. Streetlighting.
to drivers or pedestrians by impairing their ability to safely
traverse and so as not to create a nuisance by projecting
or reflecting objectionable light onto a neighboring use or
property.
(b) The use of floodlights and spotlights shall be so installed or
aimed that they do not project their output beyond the
boundaries of the property on which they are located.
(c) Unless otherwise permitted by the Township Supervisors, e.g.,
for safety or security or businesses that operate all night or
past 11:00 p.m., lighting for commercial, industrial, municipal,
recreational and institutional applications shall be controlled
by automatic switching devises, such as time clocks or
combination motion detectors and photocells, to permit
reducing or extinguishing outdoor lighting fixtures between
11:00 p.m. and dawn to mitigate light trespass, nuisance glare
and skylighting consequences.
(d) Lighting proposed for use after 11:00 p.m., or after normal
hours of operation of a business, whichever is earlier, for
commercial, industrial, institutional or municipal applications
shall be reduced by at least 50% from then until dawn, unless
supporting a specific purpose and approved by the Township
Supervisors.
(e) All illumination for advertising signs, buildings and/or
surrounding landscapes for decorative, advertising or esthetic
purposes is prohibited between 11:00 p.m. and sunrise, except
that such lighting situated on the premises of a commercial
establishment may remain illuminated while the establishment
is actually open for business and until one hour after closing.
(f) Vegetation screens shall not be employed to serve as the
primary means for controlling glare. Rather, glare control shall
be achieved primarily through the use of such means as cutoff
fixtures, shields and baffles and appropriate application of
fixture-mounting height, wattage, aiming angle and fixture
placement.
A. Streetlights shall be provided and installed by the developer along
streets within and abutting a proposed subdivision or land development
in the following situations:
(1) Two lights at an intersection of two or more streets; and
(2) At other locations where the Board of Supervisors deems them
necessary to provide safe traffic or pedestrian circulation, to
illuminate curves in streets or to illuminate the more-isolated areas

forestry operation; and/or
[2] For the routine thinning of woods.
(b) All trees and vegetation shall be removed from all existing and
proposed road rights-of-way.
(4) Protection of trees during construction.
(a) Reasonable efforts shall be taken during any construction to
ensure the protection of trees protected by this section to
ensure that the trees are not accidentally injured or killed.
These efforts shall ensure that equipment does not damage
tree trunks, that roots are not compacted by vehicles and that
the grade level around trees is not changed by more than eight
inches. Temporary barricades shall be placed around the root
systems of trees.
(b) If an approved subdivision or land development plan states
that certain trees are to be preserved, and if those trees are
killed, then the developer shall be required to replace those
trees with new mature trees, in addition to any other penalties
provided in this chapter.
D. Landscape plan. A landscape plan shall be required for each major
subdivision plan or land development plan at the plan submittal stages.
(1) Components of landscape plan. The following shall be required for

drives.
(2) Maintenance/replacement guaranty. An eighteen-month
maintenance and replacement guaranty in a form acceptable to the
Township shall be provided by the developer and/or contractor
implementing the landscape plan. It shall commence upon final
inspection and approval by the Township of all landscape elements
shown on the landscape plan.
E. Parking area landscaping.
(1) Landscaping shall be required for any parking area which provides
more than 10 parking spaces, to reduce heat and noise and the
glare of vehicle lights; to reduce the level of carbon dioxide; to
improve stormwater control; and to replenish the groundwater
table.
(2) A minimum of 10% of any parking lot facility over 2,000 square feet
in gross area (as measured to and from the outside edges of paving)
shall be devoted to landscaping. All planting beds within a parking
lot shall be surfaced in natural lawn or ground cover planting.
(3) The interior of each parking lot shall have at least one three-inchcaliper
deciduous shade tree for every five parking spaces, if there
are no existing shade trees to satisfy this requirement. Shrubs and
other plant materials are encouraged to be used to complement the
trees but shall not be the sole contribution to the landscaping.
These trees shall be in addition to those required as a screen/buffer.
(4) Landscaped planting areas shall be reasonably dispersed
throughout the parking lot. Such areas shall be located along
sidewalks or walkways, in traffic separation islands, at the end of
parking aisles or bays, and can be located between parking stalls or
spaces. In addition, where there are more than 20 parking spaces,
landscaped areas at least 10 feet wide shall be provided around the
periphery of parking areas. Such areas shall, at a minimum, extend
the full length and width of the parking areas, except for necessary
accessways.
A. Curbs shall be required, unless the Board of Supervisors deems they
are not necessary based upon review by the Township Engineer. In
deciding whether to require curbs, the Township should consider
whether the curbs are needed to continue existing curbing along an
existing street, whether they are needed for stormwater management
purposes, and/or whether they are needed for road edge stabilization.
§ 113-61 JACKSON CODE § 113-62
99:362
§ 113-63. Blocks.
§ 113-64. Lots.
B. If curbs are not provided, appropriate stabilized drainage channels
designed to meet Chapter 107, Stormwater Management, shall be
required along all streets, within the street right-of-way, or drainage
easements.
C. Required curbs shall meet the following specifications, unless other
specifications are preapproved by the Township:
(1) Only straight or slant concrete curbs shall be provided, unless a
modification is approved under § 113-7. Such curbs shall meet
standards of the Township Construction and Materials
Specifications.98
(2) Gutter design shall be subject to the approval of the Township
Engineer based upon standard engineering practices.
D. Fees in lieu of curbing. See § 113-53J.
A. Maximum length. Residential blocks shall not exceed 2,000 feet in
length in subdivisions using an average lot size of one acre or larger
and shall not exceed 1,500 feet in length in subdivisions having an
average lot size less than one acre.
(1) Pedestrian crossings. The Board of Supervisors may require that a
pedestrian access easement be provided to provide pedestrian
access where street connections are not available to serve the
same purpose. For a crosswalk on a street, the developer shall
provide pavement markers and curb cuts in conformance with
Township Materials and Construction Specifications.99
(2) Future streets. Blocks shall be considered to be separated by the
reservation, as part of an approved subdivision plan, of a fifty-foot
minimum right-of-way reserved for a future cross-street, such as a
street which is intended to serve future interior lots. Such future
street is not required to be constructed until such time as the lots
fronting on it are subdivided. Such right-of-way shall be retained in
the same ownership as the abutting interior lot(s) until a street may
be developed. Potential future street extensions shall be shown on
the plan.
B. Blocks shall be of sufficient width to permit two tiers of lots, except
where access is limited by virtue of an adjoining arterial street or by
virtue of topographic limitations.

§ 113-65. Recreation areas and fees.
A. Zoning. All lots shall conform to all requirements of Chapter 133,
Zoning, as were in effect at the time such subdivision plan was duly
submitted.
B. Street frontage. Section 113-53A(2) shall apply.
C. Side lot lines shall abut and be approximately at right angles to straight
street rights-of-way and on radial lines to curved street rights-of-way.
Pointed or very irregularly shaped lots shall be avoided.
D. Double-frontage lots shall ordinarily not be created except as needed to
avoid direct vehicular access onto an arterial or collector street.
(1) Rear yard buffers along collector or arterial streets.
(a) Any residential lot of less than two acres with a rear yard
directly abutting a collector or arterial street shall, along such
rear yard, include a ten-foot-wide planting strip along the back
of the lot, in addition to the minimum yard requirement, with
access across this strip clearly prohibited on notes on any
approved plan.
(b) In addition to any street trees required by § 113-61 of this
chapter, this planting strip shall include evergreen plantings
meeting the buffer yard requirements of § 113-61 or
alternative landscaping approved by the Township. American
arborvitae and similar weak-stem plants shall not be used.
A. Purposes:
(1) To provide adequate open spaces, recreational lands and
recreational facilities to serve new inhabitants/occupants of new
developments, for both active and passive recreation.
(2) To recognize and work to carry out the recreation plan portion of
the Joint Comprehensive Plan for Jackson Township, which is the
adopted recreation plan for the Township.
B. Applicability. This section shall apply to any subdivision or land
development for which a final plan or a combined preliminary/final plan
is submitted after the enactment date of this amendment.
(1) This § 113-65 shall not apply to plans that the Township determines
only involve adjustments or corrections to an approved preliminary
plan or a preliminary plan that was actively before the Township for
consideration as of the date of the adoption of this section,
provided that the adjustments do not increase the number of
proposed dwelling units.
C. Limitations on use of fees.
§ 113-64 JACKSON CODE § 113-65
99:364
(1) Any fees collected under this section shall be placed within the
Township Recreation Escrow Fund, or its successor account.
(2) To make sure that the lands and facilities are accessible to the
inhabitants of the developments that paid fees towards their cost,
such fees should only be used within a five-mile radius of the
boundaries of the subdivision or land development that paid the
fees, unless the fees are used within a recreation area open to the
public that the Township intends to serve the entire Township.
(3) Such fees shall only be used for the following: acquisition of public
open space/recreation land and related debt payments,
development of public recreational facilities, landscaping of public
open space, and necessary engineering and design work for those
endeavors.
D. Land to be preserved. Any subdivision or land development regulated
under this § 113-65 shall be required to preserve the specified amount
of recreation land, unless the Board of Supervisors and the applicant
mutually agree that recreation fees shall be required in lieu of land.
(1) As a general nonbinding guideline, it is the intent of this section
that smaller developments (such as 10 or fewer dwelling units) that
do not include land that is adjacent to existing publicly owned land
shall be encouraged to pay a recreation fee in lieu of dedicating
land. However, if the applicant refuses to pay such fees, then
recreation land shall be required to be dedicated.
(2) The land and fee requirements of this section shall be based upon
the number of new dwelling units that would be allowed on the lots
of a subdivision or land development after approval.
(3) Prime recreation land. For the purposes of this section, the term
"prime recreation land" shall mean land proposed to be established
as recreation land that would meet all of the following standards:
(a) Less than 6% slope;
(b) Not a wetland under federal and/or state regulations;
(c) Be adjacent to a contiguous parcel of at least two acres (which
may include existing adjacent recreation land) or be
contiguous to an existing or planned recreational trail system;
and/or
(d) Not be within the one-hundred-year floodplain, as defined by
official floodplain maps of the Township.
(4) Amount of recreation land. If a subdivision or land development is
required to include recreation land, the following amounts for each
permitted new dwelling unit shall apply:
§ 113-65 SEWERS § 113-65
99:365
Percentage of the Total
Required Recreation Land
that Would Meet the
Definition of Prime
Recreation Land
Minimum Required
Recreation Land Per
Permitted Dwelling Unit
(square feet)
0% to 25.0% 5,200
25.1% to 75.0% 2,600
75.1% to 100% 1,300
E. Fees. If the Board of Supervisors determines that a proposed
subdivision or land development is required to pay fees in lieu of
dedicating recreation land, this fee shall be $1,500 for each new
dwelling unit, unless such fee is revised by a future amendment by the
Board of Supervisors.
F. Decision on land vs. fees. The Board of Supervisors shall determine
whether a land dedication would be in the public interest or whether
the payment of fees is required. This initial determination should, but is
not required to, be made at the time of sketch plan review. The
Township should, at a minimum, consider the following in this decision:
(1) Whether the land in that location would serve a valid public
purpose.
(2) Whether there is potential to make a desirable addition to an
existing public or school district recreation area or to create a
greenway along a creek.
(3) Whether the proposed land would meet the objectives and
requirements of this section and any relevant policies of the
Township Comprehensive Plan and any recreation plan.
(4) Whether the area surrounding the proposed development has
sufficient existing recreation and open space land and whether it is
possible for pedestrians and bicyclists to reach those lands.
(5) Any recommendations that may be received from the Planning
Commission, the Township Engineer, the local school board or
school district staff and the Township Parks and Recreation Board.
G. Recreation land to be preserved.
(1) Suitability. Recreation land shall be suitable for its intended
purpose, in the determination of the Board of Supervisors. The
applicant shall state, in writing, what improvements, if any, he/she
will commit to make to the land to make it suitable for its intended
purpose, such as grading, landscaping, or development of trails.
Such land shall be free of construction debris at the time of
dedication. Proposed recreation land shall be suitable to meet the
needs of the residents of the development.
§ 113-65 JACKSON CODE § 113-65
99:366
(2) Ownership. Required recreation land shall be dedicated to the
Township, unless the Board of Supervisors agrees to accept a
dedication to any of the following: the school district, the county,
the Bureau of State Parks, the State Fish and Boat Commission, the
State Game Commission, a similar governmental agency, an
incorporated property owners' association (such as a homeowners'
or condominium association) or an established environmental
organization acceptable to the Board of Supervisors. In the case of
a rental development, the Township may permit the recreation land
to be retained by the owner of the adjacent principal buildings.
(a) If recreation land is to be owned by a property owners'
association, the developer shall be required to establish such
association in a form that requires all property owners within
the development to annually contribute to the maintenance of
the recreation land.
[1] Any property owners' association agreements regarding
required recreation land shall be subject to acceptance by
the Board of Supervisors, based upon review by the
Township Solicitor.
[2] Prior to the sale of any dwelling unit or lot, all deeds shall
require each property owner to pay fees on a regular basis
for the maintenance and other expenses of owning such
land. The property-owners shall be incorporated with
covenants and bylaws providing for the filing of
assessments. After providing notice to affected owners,
the Township shall have the authority to establish
municipal liens upon all properties in the association to
fund maintenance of the land and Township legal costs if
the property owners' association does not fulfill its
responsibilities.
[3] An orderly process shall be established for the transfer of
the land to the association. The dedication of maintenance
responsibilities by a developer to a property owners'
association shall not occur until such association is
incorporated and able to maintain such land.
(b) Transfer to another entity. If the approved plan states that
ownership of and/or responsibility to maintain the recreation
land are given to a particular entity, then any transfer of
ownership or responsibilities to another entity shall require
preapproval by the Board of Supervisors. Where land is to be
owned by a conservation organization, a process shall be
established for the land to transfer to a different organization if
the first organization is not able to fulfill its obligations.
(c) The Board of Supervisors shall have the authority to refuse to
accept an offer of dedication of recreation land to the Township
§ 113-65 SEWERS § 113-65
99:367
and/or to determine that an offer does not meet Township
requirements.
(3) Easements. Any required recreation land dedication shall include a
conservation easement to permanently prevent its development for
buildings, except buildings for approved types of noncommercial
recreation or to support maintenance of the land. Such
conservation easements shall, at a minimum, be enforceable by the
Board of Supervisors. The Supervisors may require that the
easements also authorize their enforcement by a suitable third
party.
(4) Priorities. Priority shall be given to dedication of land that would be
suitable for:
(a) Additions to existing public schools and public parks;
(b) Preservation of woods, steep slopes or other important natural
features or land along a creek; or
(c) For centralized active recreation.
(5) Suitability. Land that is not suitable for active or passive recreation
shall not be permitted to meet the requirements of this section. Any
land area used to meet the requirements of this § 113-65 shall meet
the definition of "recreation land." Portions intended for active
recreation shall be well-drained, of less than 6% average slope and
not require filling in of a wetland for use.
(6) Access and contiguousness. Recreation land within a subdivision or
land development shall be contiguous, except as may be specifically
exempted by the Board of Supervisors, if necessary considering the
unique features of the site, and shall have a minimum of 20 feet of
road frontage at a location that allows access for maintenance and
access by pedestrians.
(7) Other ordinances. Any required land dedication or fees under this
section shall be in addition to any land dedication or improvement
requirements of any other Township ordinance. However, the
Board of Supervisors may allow common open space provided
under a Zoning Ordinance provision to also count towards the
recreation land requirement if the land will be improved for
recreation, capable of meeting all of the requirements of this
section, and be available without charge on a daily basis to the
public.
(8) Residual lands. If only a portion of a larger parcel(s) of land is
currently proposed to be subdivided, or the applicant owns one or
more adjacent parcel(s) that are not currently proposed to be
subdivided, the applicant shall provide a sketch of a possible future
land dedication on these adjacent lands. The intent is to coordinate
current plans with any future development, even in the long-term.
§ 113-65 JACKSON CODE § 113-65
99:368
§ 113-66. Stormwater management and floodplain protection policy.
See the provisions of Chapter 107, Stormwater Management, and Chapter
69, Floodplain Management.
(9) Coordination with future adjacent dedication. The Board of
Supervisors may require that a required land dedication within a
property currently being subdivided be placed along an edge of the
property so that it may, in the future, be combined with a recreation
land/open space dedication on the edge of an adjoining property
when that adjoining property is subdivided or developed.
H. Combination of land and fees. Upon mutual agreement of the Board of
Supervisors and the applicant, the Township may accept a combination
of recreation land and fees in lieu of land to meet the requirements of
this section for a subdivision or land development. This combination
shall be based upon the recreation land requirement applying for a
certain number of dwelling units and the fee in lieu of land requirement
applying for the remaining development. For example, if a development
included 25 dwelling units, recreation land could be required for 15
dwelling units and fees could be required for 10 dwelling units.
I. Timing of residential fees. Fees required by this section for all of the
dwelling units shall be paid prior to approval of the final plan.
J. Facilities in place of land or fees. An applicant may submit a written
request for a modification of the requirements of this section by offering
to construct substantial permanent recreation facilities within the
proposed subdivision or land development or on public parkland. Such
modification shall only be approved if the applicant clearly proves to the
satisfaction of the Board of Supervisors that the facilities will serve a
valid public purpose, will be designed following modern standards in a
durable manner and will have a higher market value than the land or
fees that would otherwise be required.
(1) An exemption to these requirements may also be approved by the
Board of Supervisors if the applicant donates or sells at a reduced
price appropriate public recreation land to the Township or the
school district. In such case, the applicant shall provide a written
appraisal from a qualified professional that the market value of the
donation or price reduction is greater than the value of the fee or
land requirement that is exempted. In such case, the land shall be
determined to be suitable for public recreation by the Board of
Supervisors.
A. Detention basins.
(1) Areas of stormwater basins shall be maintained by mowing,
dredging and debris removal.

§ 113-67. Sanitary sewage disposal systems.
(1) Where required. Where a subdivision or land development is
traversed by a watercourse, drainageway, channel or stream that
the Township Engineer determines is subject to significant
stormwater flows, there shall be provided a drainage easement
established along the following:
(a) The one-hundred-year floodway, where that is defined;
(b) Where a one-hundred-year floodway is not defined, a width
shall be used that includes a minimum of 50 feet on each side
of the top of the primary bank of the waterway.
(2) The drainage easements required by the above Subsection B(1) are
intended to preserve the unimpeded flow of natural drainage and to
provide for future possible widening, deepening, relocating,
improving or protecting of such drainage facilities. The Township
Engineer may require up to a five-tenths-foot freeboard and/or an
additional ten-foot building setback if deemed necessary along
newly constructed watercourses.
(3) The applicant shall prove that he/she notified adjacent downstream
property owners of the discharge onto their property.

(1) All subdivisions and land developments shall be served with an
approved and adequate sewage disposal system (either on-lot or
public) that will meet state and Township regulations.
(2) Public sewage connections. Any principal building or use within a
subdivision or land development that generates wastewater and
that, in the determination of the Board of Supervisors, based upon
the advice of any applicable municipal authority and the Township
Engineer, could reasonably connect into a public sewage system
shall be required to connect into that system.
(a) In general, a subdivision or land development shall be
expected to connect to a public sewage system if a suitable line
is available for connection within 1,000 feet from the
subdivision or land development. This requirement shall not
apply to land within the AP or RC Zoning District.
§ 113-66 JACKSON CODE § 113-67
99:370
(b) The applicant shall be responsible to pay such reasonable
capital expenses that are necessary for such connection.
B. Central sewage service.
(1) If a municipality or a municipal authority is to provide the central
sewage service, such agency shall have the authority to approve or
reject the proposed sewage collection system.
(2) Nonpublic sewage service. If nonpublic central sewage service is
proposed, the Board of Supervisors shall have the authority to
permit or not permit such service to meet the sewage requirements
of this section based upon:
(a) Whether public sewage service is expected to be available
within five years of the date of preliminary plan approval;
(b) Whether the proposed system would be consistent with the
Township's Official Sewage Facilities Plan; and
(c) Whether the system would include an appropriate permanent
system for professional operation and maintenance.
C. On-lot sewage disposal system.
(1) If connection to a public sewage system is not required at the time
of occupancy, and if a nonpublic central sewage system is not
approved by the Township under the Township Sewage Facilities
Plan, then each lot shall be required to be served by an on-lot
sewage disposal system that will meet all applicable state
regulations. Each such proposed location shall be tested and
approved by Township Sewage Enforcement Officer prior to
approval of the final plan. See the requirements of the DEP for a
planning module.
(2) Portable chemical toilets allowed as per DEP regulation or other
approved privies shall not be used as a primary method of sewage
service for a subdivision or land development that operates more
than 10 days in any calendar year, other than publicly owned
outdoor recreation uses and construction sites.
(3) Each new lot using on-lot septic service shall include a tested
alternate septic system location meeting all DEP regulations, which
shall be kept available for use if needed.
(4) The applicant shall submit results or a summary of the results of
required on-lot septic tests and shall show approved test locations
on the preliminary plans in accordance with DEP planning module
requirements.
D. Laterals. Each lot with central sewage service shall be served by a
separate sewage lateral.
§ 113-67 SEWERS § 113-68
99:371
§ 113-68. Water supply systems, fire hydrants and fire protection.
A. In general.
(1) All subdivisions and land developments shall be served with an
adequate on-lot or central water supply system that will meet DEP
and Township requirements.
(2) Required connections to central water systems.
(a) The Board of Supervisors, after requesting any
recommendations of the Planning Commission, the Township
Engineer and the appropriate water supplier, shall require all
lots and principal uses within a subdivision or land
development to be connected to an existing public or
Township-approved central water system where the Board of
Supervisors determines that such connection would be feasible
and cost-effective, considering the distances that the lines
would need to be extended and the average cost per dwelling
or lot. In general, a subdivision or land development shall be
expected to connect to a public water system if a suitable line
is available for connection within 1,000 feet from the
subdivision or land development. This requirement shall not
apply within the AP or RC Zoning District.
(b) If an applicant does not wish to extend central water service,
then the Township may require the applicant to provide a
comparison of the estimated total costs of extending the
central water service vs. the total costs of developing wells.
Such cost comparison shall be prepared by a professional and
be provided to the water supplier and the Township Engineer
for review. This analysis is intended to assist the Township in
determining whether a water extension would be reasonable.
The Township shall also have the authority to require a
subdivision or land development to include an extension of
central water service if such service is needed to resolve a
significant public health or safety hazard or where such
extension is required by another ordinance or utility
agreement.
(3) Private water system.
(a) The Board of Supervisors, based upon recommendations of the
Township Engineer, may require or permit the development of
a new private central water system if such system can
reasonably be expected to be connected into an extension of an
existing central water supplier within 10 years.
(b) Such system in that case shall be constructed following official
standards of the water supplier to which it is intended to be
connected.
§ 113-68 JACKSON CODE § 113-68
99:372
§ 113-69. Waste dumpsters, utilities and utility easements.
(c) In such case, the approved plan should include a specific
provision offering dedication of such system to the central
water supplier in the future, without any purchase cost by such
central water supplier.
B. Central water supply system.
(1) Water supplier approval. Proposed extensions of central water
systems shall meet all applicable procedures, reviews and
requirements of any appropriate municipal authority or water
company. Such extension shall be approved by such agency prior to
final plan approval, although specific detailed service agreements
are not required to be signed until prior to recording.
(2) Nonpublic supplier. Any new central water system that is not
owned by a public authority or municipality shall be found to be
acceptable in capacity, pressure, design and construction by the
Board of Supervisors, based upon review of the Township Engineer.
The Board of Supervisors may deny permission for a subdivision or
land development to be served by a nonpublic central water system
if such system cannot guarantee sufficient water pressure and
capacity and would not include a suitable process for long-term
operation and maintenance. The applicant may be required by the
Township to establish a test well prior to recording of any lots to
show that adequate water will be available and that there is
provision for a backup well.
C. On-lot water system (wells).
(1) Well locations. When a subdivision or land development is not
required to connect to a central water system, acceptable locations
for wells shall be shown on plans, and each well shall be set back a
minimum of 100 feet from any on-lot septic system.
(2) Setback. Wells should be located no closer than 15 feet from any
future street right-of-way.
D. Fire hydrants. All subdivisions and land developments that will be
served by central water service shall provide fire hydrants as needed
with appropriate water pressure so that hydrants are spaced a
maximum of 750 feet apart, measured along vehicle travel distance.
(1) The fire hydrants shall have connections compatible with those
used by the Township fire companies.
(2) Fire flows shall not be less than 500 gallons per minute in singlefamily
detached residential areas and 1,000 gallons per minute in
other developed areas, at 20 pounds per square inch residual
pressure.

lines) and all telephone, cable television (where available) and natural
gas service lines within a new subdivision or land development shall be
placed underground.
B. Dumpsters. All apartment developments shall include conveniently
located refuse collection facilities for the residents. All uses within
nonresidential land developments and subdivisions shall include
appropriate refuse collection facilities. All bulk refuse collection
dumpsters shall be screened on three of four sides by walls or
evergreen landscaping from view of public streets and as required by
§ 133-46 of Chapter 133, Zoning. Dumpster areas should not be placed
in areas of the site where garbage trucks can block access drives or
parking spaces.
C. Easements. Easements shall be provided as follows:
(1) Stormwater drainage, sanitary sewage, central water, emergency
access and other types of easements shall be provided as
determined to be needed by the Township and as indicated on the
plans.
(2) Locations. All lots shall include a stormwater drainage and utility
easement around the perimeter of each lot, including adjacent to
the street right-of-way. However, such easements shall not be
required where buildings are to be attached at a lot line.
(3) Width. The standard minimum width of a stormwater drainage or
underground utility easement shall be 15 feet, which may be
reduced to 10 feet for each lot if a ten-foot minimum easement
exists on the abutting side of the abutting lot.
(4) See also drainage easement provisions in § 113-66 of this chapter.
(5) Additional width of easements shall be provided if required by the
utility provider or the Board of Supervisors, based upon advice of
the Township Engineer. The easement widths along side lot lines
may be reduced if Chapter 133, Zoning, allows a principal building
setback that is more narrow than the width of the easement that
would otherwise be required.
(6) Separation. Minimum separation distances between utility lines
shall be as required by the applicable utility or as deemed
necessary by the Township Engineer.
(7) Pipelines. If any activity is proposed within the right-of-way of an
underground fuel or gas pipeline, the applicant shall provide
written evidence from the operator of such pipeline that such
activity is acceptable under its safety standards and the terms of
that right-of-way.

monuments shall be located at each intersection of rights-of-way of
street(s) constructed by the developer, at the beginning and ending
of all street curves, and at exterior corners of the subdivision or
land development. For a minor subdivision, two permanent
monuments shall be required, preferably at the street right-of-way
line. Alternative monument requirements may be approved by the
Board of Supervisors upon recommendation of the Township
Engineer if an alternate arrangement still permits a surveyor to
stake out accurately any building lot shown on the record plan.
(2) Type. Reference monuments shall be constructed of steelreinforced
Portland cement concrete or other materials
preapproved by the Township Engineer and should have a
minimum size of 4 x 4 inches at the ground level and shall have the
top flush with the grade level.
B. Markers. All lot corner markers shall be permanently located and shall
be at least a three-fourths-inch metal pin or pipe with a minimum length
of 20 inches, located in the ground to existing grade. Such markers
shall be located prior to the lot being offered for sale.
A. Ground cover and topsoil. After completion of construction on a lot, all
exposed ground surfaces that are not paved and that are not covered by
approved gravel areas or decorative stones or similar material shall be
covered by a minimum of four inches of topsoil and a vegetative ground
cover that will prevent soil erosion and the raising of dust.
B. Erosion control.

the current year and January 15 of the succeeding year,
respectively.

the current year, shall make and file the declaration required on or

under this subsection anticipates additional net profits not
previously declared or has overestimated anticipated net profits.

§ 117-60. Exemptions.
C. The situs of the tax shall be the place of employment on the first day the
person becomes subject to the tax during each payroll period. It is the
intent of this section that no person shall be subject to the payment of
the local services tax by more than one political subdivision during each
payroll period.
A. The local services tax shall be no more than $52 on each person for
each calendar year, irrespective of the number of political subdivisions
within which a person may be employed.
B. The Local Tax Enabling Act, as amended, requires municipalities and
school districts who levy the local services tax at a combined rate
exceeding $10 to exempt any person from the local services tax whose
total earned income and net profits from all sources within the
Township is less than $12,000 for the calendar year in which the local
services tax is levied.
C. The Township hereby exempts the following persons from the local
services tax:
(1) Any person whose total earned income and net profits from all
sources within the Township is less than $12,000 for the calendar

declared by the United States Veterans' Administration or its

mean the United States Army Reserve, United States Navy
Reserve, United States Marine Corps Reserve, United States Coast

D. A person seeking to claim an exemption from the local services tax must
annually file an exemption certificate with the collector of the tax for
the Township levying the tax and file a copy of the certificate with the
person's employer, affirming that the person reasonably expects to
receive earned income and net profits from all sources within the
Township of less than $12,000 in the calendar year for which the
exemption certificate is filed. The exemption certificate shall have
attached to it a copy of all of the employee's last pay stubs or W-2 forms
from employment within the Township for the year prior to the fiscal
§ 117-59 SEWERS § 117-60
99:411
year for which the employee is requesting to be exempted from the
local services tax.
E. Upon receipt of the exemption certificate and until otherwise instructed
by the collector of the tax for the Township, the employer shall not
withhold the tax from the person during the calendar year or remainder
of the calendar year for which the exemption certificate applies. With
respect to a person who claimed an exemption from the local services
tax, upon notification to an employer by the person or by the collector of
the tax for the Township that the person has received earned income
and net profits from all sources within the Township equal to or in
excess of $12,000 in that calendar year or that the person is otherwise
ineligible for the tax exemption for that calendar year, or upon an
employer's payment to the person of earned income within the
Township in an amount equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that calendar
year, an employer shall withhold the local services tax from the person
as follows:
(1) If a person who claimed an exemption for a given calendar year
from the local services tax becomes subject to the tax for the
calendar year, the employer shall withhold the tax for the
remainder of that calendar year.
(2) The employer shall withhold from the person, for the first payroll
period after receipt of the notification under Subsection E above, a
lump sum equal to the amount of the tax that was not withheld from
the person due to the exemption certificate filed by the person, plus
the per-payroll amount due for that first payroll period.
(3) The amount of tax withheld per payroll period for the remaining
payroll periods in that calendar year shall be the same amount
withheld for other employees.
F. In the event the employment of a person subject to withholding of the
local services tax under this exception is severed in that calendar year,
the person shall be liable for any outstanding balance of tax due, and
the Township may pursue collection under this article.
G. Except as provided for in Subsection E above, employers shall not be
responsible for investigating exemption certificates, monitoring tax
exemption eligibility or exempting any employee from a local services
tax.
H. Employers shall be responsible for retaining a copy of all exemption
certificates filed by employees within a given calendar year for a
minimum of three years. Employers who have failed to withhold the
local services tax from an employee or employees and do not have
copies of the employee exemption certificate or certificates will be held
responsible for the payment of the local services tax as if the tax had
been originally levied against the employer.

99:412
§ 117-61. Self-employed individuals.
All self-employed individuals and individuals whose employer is not

paid by the date indicated on such billing. If such taxpayer qualifies for a
low-income exemption, the taxpayer may complete the required exemption
certificate or make application for a refund of the tax paid.
§ 117-62. Employees and self-employed individuals residing beyond
the limits of the Township.
All employers and self-employed individuals residing or having their place
of business outside the Township but who engage in any occupation within
the Township do, by virtue thereof, agree to be bound by and subject
themselves to the provisions, penalties and regulations promulgated under
this article with the same force and effect as though they were residents of

of this article, be considered a self-employed person; and in the event this
tax is not paid, the collector shall have the option of proceeding against
either the employer or employee for collection of this tax as hereinafter
provided.
§ 117-63. Administration of tax.

enforcement of this article and is hereby empowered to prescribe,
adopt, promulgate and enforce rules and regulations relating to any
matter pertaining to the administration and enforcement of this article,
including provisions for the examination of the payroll records of any

have occurred. Any person aggrieved by any decision of the collector
shall have the right to appeal to the Court of Common Pleas of York
County as in other cases provided.

records of any employer in order to verify the accuracy of any return

file any return required by this article or fails or refuses to pay the tax
herein levied shall, upon conviction, be sentenced to pay a fine of not more
than $600 plus costs and, in default of payment of said fine and costs, be

A. In the event any of the tax under this article remains due or unpaid 30
days after the due date set forth above, the collector may sue for the
recovery of such tax due or unpaid, together with interest and penalty.
B. If for any reason the tax is not paid when due, interest at the rate of 6%
per annum on the amount of said tax, and an additional penalty of 10%,
shall be added to the flat rate of said tax for nonpayment thereof. Where
suit is brought for the recovery of this tax, the individual liable therefor
shall, in addition, be responsible and liable for the costs of collection,
including but not limited to attorneys' fees.
A. Refunds are to be paid within 75 days of a refund request or 75 days
after the last day the employer is required to remit the local services tax
for the last quarter of the calendar year, under Section 9 of Act 7,
whichever is later, and shall not be subject to interest if paid within the

$52. The proper refund request form must be completed and signed by
the taxpayer, and necessary documentation must be included. These
refunds may be processed at the time they are received, unless there is
reason to believe we will not receive the tax from the employer.

§ 117-81. Excluded transactions.
A. The tax imposed by this article shall not be imposed upon:
(1) A transfer to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or to any of its
instrumentalities, agencies or political subdivisions by gift,
dedication or deed in lieu of condemnation or deed of confirmation
in connection with condemnation proceedings or a reconveyance

pursuant to acquisition by the municipality, township, school
district or county of a tax delinquent property at a Sheriff sale or
tax claim bureau sale.
(4) A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration which corrects or
confirms a transfer previously recorded but which does not extend
or limit existing record legal title or interest.
(5) A transfer or division in kind for no or nominal actual consideration
of property passed by testate or intestate succession and held by
covenants; however, if any of the parties take shares greater in
value than their undivided interest, tax is due on the excess.
(6) A transfer between husband and wife; between persons who were
previously husband and wife who have since been divorced,
provided that the property or interest therein subject to such
transfer was acquired by the husband and wife or husband or wife
prior to the granting of the final decree in divorce; between parent
and child or the spouse of such child, between brother and sister or
spouse of a brother or sister and brother or sister or the spouse of a

ordinary trust where the transfer of the same property would be
exempt if the transfer was made directly from the grantor to all of

contingent or specifically named. No such exemption shall be
granted unless the Collector is presented with a copy of the trust
instrument that clearly identifies the grantor and all possible

be imposed under this article. Where the document by which title is
acquired by a grantee or statement of value fails to set forth that
the property was acquired by the grantee from or for the benefit of
his principal, there is a rebuttable presumption that the property is
the property of the grantee in his individual capacity if the grantee
claims an exemption from taxation under this subsection.
(12) A transfer made pursuant to the statutory merger or consolidation
of a corporation or statutory division of a nonprofit corporation,
except where the municipality reasonably determines that the

minerals and assignments thereof.

value may be limited to an explanation of the reason such document is

§ 123-1. Permit required.
The placing, leaving and abandoning of personal property, including
unlicensed or uninspected motor vehicles, upon private property in excess
of 30 days without securing a permit for storage shall be illegal. The storage
of such articles in excess of 30 days promotes the infestation of rodents and
insects which jeopardizes the health, aesthetics, safety and well-being of the
citizens of Jackson Township.
§ 123-2. Issuance of permit; posting.
Upon application for each thirty-day period, a permit fee of $250 shall
be paid. Before issuing the permit, the Zoning Enforcement Officer shall
inspect the site and, if the storage does not promote the infestation of
rodents, insects, obnoxious odors or interfere with the aesthetics of the
surrounding properties, he shall issue said permit subject to such control
restrictions as he shall deem necessary in the interest of the safety and wellbeing
of the citizens of Jackson Township. The permit shall be conspicuously
posted upon the property.
§ 123-3. Appeals.
The Zoning Officer's failure to issue a permit or the restrictions imposed
may be appealed within 30 days to the Board of Supervisors by notification
in writing.
§ 123-4. Violation. [Amended 12-5-1995 by Ord. No. 83-95;

A. Any person, firm or corporation who shall fail to secure a permit within
15 days of written notification to do so or who fails to adhere to the
control restrictions on the permit shall, upon being found liable therefor
in a civil enforcement proceeding commenced by the Township, pay a
judgment of not more than $600 plus all court costs, including
reasonable attorney fees incurred by the Township as a result thereof. If
the defendant neither pays nor timely appeals the judgment, the
Township may enforce the judgment pursuant to the applicable rules of
civil procedure. Each day that a violation continues shall constitute a
separate violation.

§ 127-3.1. Establishing parking for handicapped persons and

Parking for physically challenged persons and severely disabled veterans
may be approved by resolution of the Township Board of Supervisors. Such
resolution shall only be considered upon written requests by or on behalf of
such persons or veterans to the Township Manager. The request shall fully
set forth the reasons or circumstances that prompted the request and shall
be accompanied by a letter from a physician supporting such application.
The Township Manager shall review all such requests and forward those
meriting resolution consideration to the Board of Supervisors. If the Board
of Supervisors approves a resolution to establish a restricted parking space,
§ 127-3 JACKSON CODE § 127-3.1
123:442
the Township will erect an appropriate "reserved parking" sign with the
standard wheelchair symbol along the public street as close as possible to
the affected person's residence. The Township will also paint the concrete
curbing (if it exists) along the space for a length of 20 feet to help identify
the reserved space. The cost of the sign, post, installation and replacement,
and curb painting, if necessary, shall be the responsibility of the person
requesting the reserved parking space. It is also the responsibility of the
person requesting the space, or their heir or designee, to notify the
Township office when the reserved space is no longer justified or needed
so that the sign and restriction can be removed, which removal shall also
be ordered by resolution of the Board of Supervisors. It should be noted
that the posting of such a restricted space reserves it for use by any vehicle
displaying a valid severely disabled registration, veteran registration plate,
handicapped registration plate or handicapped placard. All other vehicles
parked in the reserved space will be subject to penalties as provided for
herein.
§ 127-4. Enforcement. [Amended 5-7-1996 by Ord. No. 87-96;

Snow Emergencies
[Amended 6-6-2000 by Ord. No. 121-00]
§ 127-6. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
SNOW EMERGENCY  Any time snow removal is conducted by the
Township either by plowing or by the spreading of cinders, salt or antiskid
materials.
§ 127-7. Parking or obstructing roadway prohibited.
During a snow emergency as defined in this article, it shall be unlawful
to park motor vehicles, boats, campers, trailers or otherwise obstruct the
roadway so as to prevent snow removal to the edge of the roadway. Parking
along the roadway is only permitted after a snow emergency is no longer in
effect.
§ 127-8. Violations and penalties.
Obstructions to snow removal during a snow emergency may be towed,
in which case the owner of the obstruction shall be liable to pay all costs
associated with towing and storage. In addition, the owner of the offending
obstruction may be ticketed for violating the provisions of this article and,
upon the issuance of a citation and conviction by a District Justice, shall
be guilty of a summary offense and shall pay a fine of not less than $25
nor more than $600. Each day a violation exists shall be considered a
separate violation, subject to the same fines as set forth above. It shall
not be necessary to issue a separate citation for each day of violation, but
one citation shall be sufficient to cover multiple days of obstructions. The
Board of Supervisors hereby authorizes the Township Manager, Township
Roadmaster, Assistant Township Roadmaster and Township police officers
to issue citations for violations of this article.

meets the standards.
A. Casing.
§ 131-9 WELLS § 131-10
131:457
(1) The well shall have a watertight and durable wrought iron, steel,
plastic, or other type of approved casing with a nominal thickness
of 3/16 (0.1875) inches and 6 5/8 inches outside diameter. The
sections shall be joined together by threaded couplings, welded
joints or other watertight approved joint or coupling.
(2) The casing shall be carried to a minimum depth of 20 feet from the
finished grade and in all cases shall be extended 10 feet into
bedrock or other competent strata. Driven wells shall be provided
with a drive shoe or other effective casing seal.
(3) An annular space shall be provided between the well casing and the
earth formation of a radius at least 1 1/2 inches greater than the
casing radius, excluding couplings. The annular space shall be
completely filled with impervious cement grout or equivalent
sealing material from bottom of the casing to within five feet of the
ground surface. External grouting shall be accomplished utilizing a
tremic pipe grout pump to force out any standing water on the
outside of the well casing.
(4) The casing shall be sealed effectively against entrances of water
from water bearing formations, which are subject to pollution,
through which the casing may pass. If casings of small diameter are
used in the lower portions of the well, effective watertight seals
shall be provided between the casings where they telescope. In
such instances, a section of casing shall telescope for a minimum
distance of four feet.
(5) The top of the well casing shall extend a minimum of 24 inches
above the finished grade of the lot so that contaminated water or
other substances cannot enter the well through the annular
opening at the top of the well casing, wall or pipe sleeve.
B. Well covers. Every potable water well shall be equipped with an
overlapping cover at the top of the well casing or pipe sleeve. Covers
shall extend downward at least two inches over the outside of the well
casing or wall. All well caps shall indicate well driller's name, depth of
well and depth of casing.
C. Pitless adapter. Where pump sections or discharge pipes enter or leave
a well through the side of the casing, the circle of contact shall be
watertight. The use of plastic/nylon adapters for this purpose is not
acceptable. A brass pitless adapter with brass connectors or equivalent
shall be required.
D. Electrical wiring. Electrical wiring for well purposes shall be encased in
conduit from the bottom of the water supply line trench to the well cap.
E. Drainage. All potable water wells shall be constructed so that surface
drainage will be diverted away from the well.
§ 131-10 JACKSON CODE § 131-10
131:458
§ 131-11. Sealing of abandoned wells.
The owner of any well shall, upon abandonment of any existing well or
test hole, effectively seal and fill such abandoned wells or test holes. All
abandoned wells and test holes must be filled with portland/sand grout,
and the placement of the grout must be observed by the Zoning Officer. A
well not in operation for three or more years or improperly maintained to
prevent contamination shall be considered abandoned.
§ 131-12. Violations and penalties.
Any person violating any of the terms or provisions in this chapter shall
upon conviction thereof before a District Justice be subject to a penalty
in the amount of $500 for each offense. Each day that a violation of any
provision of this chapter continues shall constitute a separate and distinct
offense and distinct penalties hereunder. Any such fines collected will be
used for general Township purposes.
§ 131-13. Liability.
No responsibility or liability for the construction of any well and amount and
potability of the resultant water supply shall be deemed to be placed upon
Jackson Township or its officers, agents, or employees by virtue of the terms
of this chapter or otherwise.
Chapter 133
F. Pumping equipment. All pumps installed in wells drilled to a depth
greater than 300 feet, but not to exceed 450 feet, shall be installed with
two-hundred-pound-per-square-inch plastic pipe. Well depths
exceeding 450 feet shall have pumps installed with Schedule 80 PVC
threaded pipe or galvanized steel pipe to support the increased
pumping pressure. The pressure rating on plastic pipe shall be at least
160 pounds per square inch, regardless of water supply depth.
G. Pump enclosures. Any pump room or any enclosure around a well pump
shall be drained and protected from freezing by heating or other
approved means. Where pumps are installed in basements, they shall
be mounted on a block or shelf not less than 18 inches above the
basement floor.
H. Service. The size of water service pipe shall be a minimum diameter of
3/4 inch.
I. Source. The source of the supply shall be from a water bearing
formation drawn not less than 100 feet from the ground surface, unless
it can be demonstrated that there is a flow of at least six gallons per
minute at a lesser depth. There shall be at least 20 feet of properly
grouted well casing, and the supply source must not be subject to

114. Editor's Note: The Zoning Map is on file in the Township offices.
§ 133-7 WELLS § 133-7
131:489
§ 133-8. Use regulations.
(6) Boundaries indicated as approximately following the center lines of
streams, rivers, or other bodies of water shall be construed to
follow such center lines.
(7) Boundaries indicated as parallel to, or extensions of, features
indicated in Subsection B(1) through (5) shall be so construed.
Distances not specifically indicated on the Official Zoning Map shall
be determined by the scale of the map.
(8) Where physical or cultural features existing on the ground are at
variance with those shown on the Official Zoning Map, or in
circumstances not covered by Subsection B(1) through (7), the
Zoning Hearing Board shall interpret the district boundaries.
C. Lots split by boundaries of zones. If a lot is split by a zoning boundary,
the minimum lot area and lot width for the zone in which the principal
building, structure, or use is to be located shall be applicable to the
entire lot.
D. Federal- and state-owned property. Whenever federally or state-owned
property is included in one or more zoning districts, it shall be subject
to the provisions of this chapter only insofar as permitted by the
Constitutions and laws of the United States of America and the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
A. Uses permitted. The uses permitted in the zones established by this
chapter and the permitted extent of these uses are as shown in §§ 133-9
through 133-19. The uses shown as permitted in each zone are the only
uses permitted in that zone. Unless otherwise noted, the use or
dimensional standards are the requirements for each use. However,
(1) Additional general provisions are set forth in Article IV.
(2) Modifications to the use or dimensional requirements are set forth
in Article IV.
(3) Supplemental regulations for selected uses permitted by right are
set forth in Article VII.
(4) Standards for special exception uses are set forth in Article VI and
§ 133-54F.
B. All other uses. Any use not specifically allowed elsewhere in this
chapter shall be allowed by special exception in the zone or zones
where, and to the extent that, similar uses are permitted or allowed by
special exception, provided that said use meets the requirements for a
special exception and does not constitute a public or private nuisance.
C. Accessory uses and structures. Accessory uses and structures shall be
permitted in conjunction with the principal uses permitted by this
§ 133-7 JACKSON CODE § 133-8
131:490
§ 133-9. Agricultural Protection Zone (AP).
chapter and shall be further subject to the requirements for accessory
uses and structures as set forth in Article IV.
D. Uses with nuisance effect. In no case is a use permitted that, by reason
of noise, dust, odor, appearance, or other objectionable factor, creates a
nuisance, hazard, or other substantial adverse effect upon the
reasonable enjoyment of the surrounding property, unless otherwise
allowed by law, as in the case of agricultural security areas.
E. Existing and proposed uses. Where a proposed use is to be located
adjacent to or near an existing use, the existing use, as long as such
existing use is determined to be legal, shall not be considered a
nuisance.
A. Purpose. The primary purpose of the Agricultural Protection Zone is to
maintain and promote the rural character of the land within this zone.
This zone is composed of those areas in the Township whose
predominant land use is rural residential and agricultural. The
regulations of this zone are designed to protect and stabilize the
essential characteristics of these areas, to minimize conflicting land
uses detrimental to agricultural enterprises and to limit development
which requires highways and other public facilities in excess of those
required by rural land uses.
B. Uses by right. The following uses, limited to one principal use per lot,
are permitted by right in the AP Zone, subject to applicable regulations
of Articles IV and VII of this chapter:
(1) Single-family detached dwellings or group homes, subject to the
following regulations:
(a) There may be permitted on each parcel, defined by a deed or
plat of record as it existed on February 5, 2008 (regardless of
the number of individual "tracts" contained therein), the
following number of dwellings or group homes, excluding the
prime farmstead:
Size of Parcel of Land
(acres)
Number of Dwellings or
Group Homes Permitted
0 - 4.99 1
5 - 14.99 2
15 - 29.99 3
30 - 44.99 4
45 - 59.99 5
60 - 74.99 6
75 -- 124.99 7
§ 133-8 WELLS § 133-9
131:491
Size of Parcel of Land
(acres)
Number of Dwellings or
Group Homes Permitted
125 -- 174.99 8
175 -- 224.99 9
225 or more 1 additional for each 50 acres
over 225 acres
(b) Where two or more contiguous parcels that existed as of
February 5, 2008, have been combined to form a single parcel
contained in the same deed, this combination shall be
considered to be a new parcel and shall be entitled to the total
number of building rights allowable under the scale set forth
above or the total number of building rights attributable to the
two smaller parcels that were defined by a deed or plat of
record as they existed on February 5, 2008, whichever number
of dwelling rights is less.
(c) New dwellings or group homes shall be located on lots on lands
which cannot feasibly be farmed due to existing features of the
site, such as rock outcroppings, swamps, the fact that the area
is heavily wooded, or the fact that the slope of the area exceeds
15%, or due to the fact that the size or shape of the area
suitable for farming is insufficient to permit efficient use of
farm machinery. In all cases, however, such residential lots
should be located on the least-agriculturally-productive land
feasible to minimize interference with agricultural production
as identified in the current applicable Jackson Township
Comprehensive Plan.
(d) A lot on which a new dwelling or group home is to be located
shall not contain more than 1 1/2 acres (65,340 square feet)
unless the physical characteristics of the land itself require a
lot size in excess of 1 1/2 acres. In the event that additional
land is required, the amount of land in excess of 1 1/2 acres
shall be the minimum amount necessary to make the lot
suitable for the location of the proposed dwelling or group
home and any on-site sewage disposal and water supply
systems serving that dwelling or group home. The Board of
Supervisors shall determine the propriety of any such
oversized lot, provided that the maximum lot size approved by
the Board of Supervisors shall not exceed two acres in the case
of a single-family detached dwelling or group home. The Board
of Supervisors may approve lots larger than this size in cases of
unsubdividable residual land with no dwelling rights, where
unique circumstances exist, such as topography, location,
roads, and the like, which otherwise cause the acreage to be
unusable, and allow it to be included with the last subdivided
lot of a subdivision. In all other cases, any application
§ 133-9 JACKSON CODE § 133-9
131:492
requesting a lot size in excess of this amount shall be
submitted as a variance to the Jackson Township Zoning
Hearing Board rather than to the Board of Supervisors.
Furthermore, a decision adverse to an applicant by the Jackson
Township Board of Supervisors with respect to lot size changes
within the jurisdiction of the Board of Supervisors shall not
extinguish the applicant's right to make an application to the
Jackson Township Zoning Hearing Board for the same relief.
(e) A property owner submitting a subdivision plan will be
required to specify on his plan which lot or lots shall carry with
them the right to erect or place any unused quota of dwellings
or group homes his parcel may have.
(f) All lots contained on one subdivision plan, including all new
lots and the residual lot, shall carry with such lot a building
right or dwelling right granted by § 133-9B. The residual lot
shall contain a building envelope not to exceed two acres, in
which shall be placed all residential construction and
accessory buildings and structures.
(2) Agriculture.
(3) Animal hospital.
(4) Communications antennas mounted on an existing public utility
transmission tower, building or other structure, including existing
communications towers and communications equipment buildings,
provided that the proposed addition does not exceed the existing
public utility transmission tower, building or other structure by
more than 20 feet, or unless the additional height would create the
need for lighting of the structure.
(5) Farm buildings.
(6) Farm produce stand.
(7) Forestry.
(8) No-impact home-based business.
(9) Slaughtering, processing, rendering and packaging of food
products.
(10) Stable, riding academy.
(11)Wildlife preserve.
C. Uses by special exception. The following uses shall be permitted as
special exceptions, limited to one principal use per lot, when authorized
by the Zoning Hearing Board. The Zoning Hearing Board shall hear and
decide requests for such uses according to criteria established in
Articles V and VI of this chapter.
§ 133-9 WELLS § 133-9
131:493
(1) Bed-and-breakfast inn.
(2) Cemetery.

(14) Public utility building or service structure.
(15) Regulated shooting grounds.
(16) Sawmill operation.
D. Lot area and width. Lot area and lot width not less than the following
dimensions shall be provided for each principal use hereafter
established in this zone:
(1) Minimum lot area: one acre (43,560 square feet).
(2) Minimum lot width: 200 feet.
E. Setbacks. Each lot shall provide front, side and rear setbacks not less
than the following:
(1) Front setback: 50 feet.
(2) Each side setback: 25 feet.
(3) Rear setback: 40 feet.

I. Subdivision. When land is transferred from a first parcel to a second
parcel, the second parcel after transfer will contain as many acres as
were contained in the first parcel. Land transferred to a second parcel
shall not subsequently be separated from the second parcel unless
subdivision approval is procured from the Township. Land added on to
another parcel for agricultural purposes does not need to carry a
dwelling right, and such additional land does not serve to increase the
road frontage or dwelling rights of the receiving property for any
further subdivision.
J. A property owner submitting a subdivision plan shall be required to
specify on the plan which lot or lots shall carry with them the right to
erect or place any unused quota of dwelling units the parcel may have.

J. Traditional neighborhood development.
(1) Purpose and intent. The purpose of this section is to allow the
optional development and redevelopment of land consistent with
§ 133-14 WELLS § 133-14
131:513
the design principles of traditional neighborhoods. A traditional
neighborhood development (TND):
(a) Is compact;
(b) Is designed for the human scale;
(c) Provides a mix of uses, including complementary residential,
commercial, civic, and open space uses, in close proximity to
one another within the neighborhood in order to facilitate
human interactions and opportunities to meet daily retail,
office, and service needs within walking distance of residences;
(d) Provides a mix of housing styles, types, and sizes to
accommodate households of all ages, sizes, and incomes;
(e) Incorporates a system of interconnected streets with
sidewalks, bikeways, and/or transit that offer multiple routes
for motorists, pedestrians, and bicyclists and provides for the
connections of those streets to existing and future
developments;
(f) Retains existing buildings with historical features or
architectural features that enhance the visual character of the
community;
(g) Incorporates significant environmental features into the design
and provides green space and recreational opportunities;
(h) Contains buildings which are oriented toward and define the
streetscape; and
(i) Is consistent with the Jackson/Paradise Joint Comprehensive
Plan.
(2) Applicability.
(a) Traditional neighborhood development may be developed on
10 acres or more of contiguous land under single ownership at
any location within the Village District.
(b) A TND shall contain a minimum of 30 acres in order to contain
listed commercial uses. The Board of Supervisors may allow
commercial uses within smaller TNDs via the land
development plan approval process if the site of the TND is
considered appropriate for commercial development by
location, access, and market analysis. The Supervisors may
also deny commercial uses in a TND 30 acres or larger via the
land development plan review if the commercial uses proposed
would have a detrimental effect on the TND, surrounding
neighborhoods or properties, or streets abutting the TND and/
or such commercial development is not supported by market
analysis.
§ 133-14 JACKSON CODE § 133-14
131:514
(c) Whenever TND is proposed, a sketch plan of the development
as it would appear if designed conventionally must be
presented with the TND development plan.
(3) Design standards.
(a) Mix of uses. In order to achieve the proximity necessary to
make neighborhoods walkable, it is important to mix land uses.
A traditional neighborhood development shall consist of a mix
of residential uses, a community center, and open space as
listed below:
[1] Residential uses. A mix of residential dwelling types shall
be provided.
[a] The following types can occur anywhere within the
traditional neighborhood development:
[i] Single-family detached dwellings.
[ii] Single-family semidetached dwellings.
[iii] Multifamily dwellings.
[iv] Townhouses.
[v] Residential accessory uses.
[b] The minimum and maximum percentage of dwelling
unit types in the TND is as follows, according to the
size of the TND:
TND Greater
than 30 Acres
(percentage of
total dwelling
units in TND)

131:515
[2] A community center, composed of a mix of commercial,
residential, civic or institutional, and open space uses as
identified below, must be provided in a traditional
neighborhood development of 50 acres or more in size.
[a] The development shall be planned so that dwelling
units are within 1/2 mile of the community center. The
community center is intended as a mixed-use area to
provide uses which meet the retail and service needs
of residents within the TND and surrounding
residential development and provide compatible
public and institutional uses of community-wide
importance. Drive-through facilities and drive-in
service are not permitted. Mixed-use buildings and
live/work buildings are permitted.
[b] The location of commercial uses is subject to land
development plan approval by the Board of
Supervisors and may be allowed on the periphery of
the TND site if designed to serve other residential
developments in addition to the TND. Such periphery
commercial uses shall be buffered from surrounding
residential areas in a manner subject to approval by
the Board of Supervisors. Nonresidential uses
intended to serve an area beyond the TND itself shall
be located to permit vehicular access from outside the
TND to minimize traffic passing through
neighborhood residential areas.
[i] Commercial uses in the community center.
Individual businesses shall not exceed 2,500
square feet in size. The following pedestrianoriented
uses are permitted:
[A] Food services (neighborhood grocery stores,
butcher shops, bakeries, restaurants,
delicatessens, cafes, confectionery, coffee
shops, and neighborhood bars or pubs).
[B] Retail uses (florists, hardware stores, news
and stationery stores, bookstores, studios and
shops of artists and artisans, pharmacies,
music or video stores, and neighborhood
retail store without gasoline service).
[C] Services (day-care centers; music, dance or
exercise studios; health salons; professional
and medical offices; barber; hair salon; drycleaning
shop; self-service laundry; and bank
or other financial institution).

131:516
[D] Accommodations (bed-and-breakfast
establishments, small hotels or inns).
[ii] Residential uses in the community center:
[A] Single-family semidetached dwellings.
[B] Multifamily dwellings.
[C] Townhouses.
[D] Residential units located on upper floors
above commercial uses or to the rear of
storefronts.
[E] Live/work units that combine a residence and
the resident's workplace.
[iii] Civic or institutional uses in the community
center. Civic or institutional uses shall abut or be
visible from a common open space area or park.
[A] Municipal offices, fire stations, libraries,
museums, community meeting facilities, and
post offices.
[B] Transit shelters.
[C] Places of worship.
[D] Educational facilities.
[iv] Open space uses in the community center:
[A] Central common open space area.
[B] Neighborhood parks and common open space
areas.
[C] Playground.
[c] In addition to the open spaces within the community
center, open spaces shall be incorporated elsewhere in
the traditional neighborhood development. The TND
shall contain a central common open space area of a
minimum of 20,000 square feet in size and smaller
common open space areas of a minimum of 5,000
square feet in size. In no case shall the central
common open space area be less than 1.5% of the
gross acreage of the TND, provided that in the case of
a TND substantially larger than the minimum required
size, the Board of Supervisors may allow a lesser
percentage. Each neighborhood shall contain as its
central focus at least one common open space area or
§ 133-14 WELLS § 133-14
131:517
park. The size, distribution, and number of greens are
subject to approval by the Board of Supervisors.
[3] Open space uses identified below shall be incorporated in
the traditional neighborhood development as appropriate.
Large outdoor recreation areas should be located at the
periphery of neighborhoods rather than central locations.
The design of the TND shall maximize the visibility of open
spaces as vistas and perimeter greenbelts.
[a] Environmental corridors.
[b] Protected natural areas.
[c] Community parks.
[d] Streams, ponds, lakes, and other water bodies.
[e] Significant tree stands and trees of high quality.
(b) TND standards.
[1] Common open space. At least 30% of the gross acreage of
the traditional neighborhood development must be
common open space. At least 25% of the common open
space must be common open space devoted to usable
parks, greens, playgrounds, and tot lots. Ninety percent of
the lots within the areas devoted to residential uses shall
be within 1/4 mile from common open space. Large
outdoor recreation areas should be located at the
periphery of neighborhoods rather than central locations.
[2] Density. The overall density of the development shall not
exceed 5.5 dwelling units per acre. For each affordable
housing unit as defined herein, one additional dwelling
unit shall be permitted up to a maximum density of 6.5
dwelling units per acre. The applicant shall demonstrate
that the affordable housing units will be sold or rented at a
market rate for the target population and shall provide
acceptable arrangements for retaining those units for the
target population at the time of resale or rerenting.
Affordable housing units shall blend into the neighborhood
in design and appearance and be interspersed throughout
the neighborhood rather than concentrated in a particular
section.
[3] Commercial space. Where commercial uses are permitted
by the Township Supervisors, the minimum and maximum
total ground floor areas of commercial uses, as a
percentage of the traditional neighborhood development,
are as follows:

minimum setback. Commercial and civic or
institutional buildings should abut the sidewalks in the
community center area.
[6] Setbacks from tract boundaries. All buildings shall be set
back a minimum of 50 feet from tract boundaries. Where a
road forms a tract boundary, the 50 feet shall be measured
from the street right-of-way line. All common parking
areas shall be set back a minimum of 20 feet from tract
boundaries and screened from view of surrounding
properties. When townhouses and apartments are located

exceed 45% of the gross tract area.
(c) Architectural standards.
[1] Guidelines for existing structures. If existing structures
have been determined to be historic or architecturally
significant, they shall be protected from demolition or
encroachment by incompatible structures or landscape
development. The United States Secretary of the Interior's
Standards for Rehabilitation of Historic Properties shall be
used as the criteria for renovating historic or
architecturally significant structures.
[2] Guidelines for new structures.
[a] Height. New structures within a traditional
neighborhood development shall be no more than
three stories and 35 feet for single-family detached
dwellings, single-family semidetached dwellings, and
townhouses, or three stories and 45 feet for

articulation of a façade of a building shall be
continued on all sides visible from a public street,
courtyard, common open space area, or park.
[ii] The front façade of the principal building on any
lot in a traditional neighborhood development
shall face onto a street, or a common open space
area, courtyard, or park, or other common area if
rear access is provided.
[iii] The front façade shall not be oriented to face
directly toward a parking lot, except when
commercial uses are permitted to do so by the
Board of Supervisors.
[iv] Architectural elements shall define the front
entrance to all residences.
[v] New structures on the same street shall have
compatible architecture.
[vi] All residential, commercial, live/work and mixeduse
buildings in a neighborhood shall be
compatible and form an integrated streetscape.
§ 133-14 WELLS § 133-14
131:521
[vii] Garages shall be placed along alleys, unless an
alternative is approved by the Board of
Supervisors such as: garages not served by an
alley shall have an architectural treatment or
placement, such as being set back from the front
of the house or rotated so that the garage doors
do not face any adjacent streets, to minimize the
visual impact of the garage.
[viii] The façade of any building or row of buildings
facing a street shall incorporate windows and
contain surface treatments to create visual
interest and break up visual massing of building
facades.
[3] Preparation and approval of architectural standards. Prior
to final approval of the subdivision plan for a TND by the
Township, the applicant shall prepare architectural
standards which will apply within the TND. These
standards are subject to approval by the Board of
Supervisors. The applicant shall also create and
permanently maintain a town architect's office (TAO). The
TAO shall approve all building design pursuant to the
approved architectural standards prior to the issuance of a

architectural details, such as but not limited to window
fenestration, roof pitch, door style, porch design, and
façade materials and colors, shall be subject to Township
approval.
[4] Exterior signage. A comprehensive sign program subject
to the approval of the Board of Supervisors is required for
the entire TND in order to establish a uniform theme.
Signs shall share a common style (such as shape or
material). In the community center area, signs shall be
wall signs, projecting signs, or awning signs. Projecting
signs shall be mounted perpendicular to the building face
and shall not exceed eight square feet. Wall signs shall be
sized and placed to fit within the architectural elements
but shall not exceed 16 square feet. Awning signs shall
maintain a clear height of at least 10 feet and a maximum
of six feet in depth out in front of the building. Material

plastic, or glass be permitted. Lettering shall be limited to
12 inches vertically. Illumination of any sign shall be from
a concealed indirect source only.
§ 133-14 JACKSON CODE § 133-14
131:522
(d) Circulation standards. The circulation system shall provide for
different modes of transportation. The circulation system shall
provide functional links within the residential neighborhoods,
community center area, and open space and shall be connected
to existing and proposed external development when required
by the Township. The circulation system shall provide adequate
traffic capacity, provide connected pedestrian and bicycle
routes (especially off-street bicycle or multi-use paths or
bicycle lanes on the streets), and promote safe and efficient
mobility through the traditional neighborhood development.
[1] Pedestrian circulation. Convenient pedestrian circulation
systems that minimize pedestrian -- motor vehicle conflicts
shall be provided continuously throughout the traditional
neighborhood development. Where feasible and
appropriate, any existing pedestrian routes through the
site shall be preserved and enhanced. All streets, except
for alleys, shall be bordered by sidewalks on both sides
unless otherwise permitted by the Board of Supervisors.
The following provisions also apply:
[a] Residential sidewalks. Clear and well-lighted
sidewalks, three to five feet in width, depending on
projected pedestrian traffic, shall connect all dwelling
entrances to the adjacent public sidewalk.

walkways shall connect building entrances to the
adjacent public sidewalk and to associated parking
areas. Such walkways shall be a minimum of five feet
in width.
[c] Disabled accessibility. Sidewalks shall comply with the
applicable requirements of the Americans with
Disabilities Act.
[d] Crosswalks. Intersections of sidewalks with streets
shall be designed with clearly defined edges.
Crosswalks shall be well-lit and clearly marked with
contrasting paving materials at the edges or with
other method approved by the Board of Supervisors.
[2] Bicycle circulation. Bicycle circulation shall be
accommodated on streets and/or on dedicated bicycle
paths. Where feasible and appropriate, any existing
bicycle routes through the site shall be preserved and
enhanced. Facilities for bicycle travel may include offstreet
bicycle paths (generally shared with pedestrians
and other nonmotorized users) and separate, striped, fourfoot
bicycle lanes on streets. If a bicycle lane is combined
§ 133-14 WELLS § 133-14
131:523
with a lane for parking, the combined width shall be 12
feet.
[3] Public transit access. Where public transit service is
available or planned, convenient access to transit stops
shall be provided. Where transit shelters are provided,
they shall be placed in highly visible locations that
promote security through surveillance and shall be welllighted.
[4] Motor vehicle circulation. Motor vehicle circulation shall
be designed to minimize conflicts with pedestrians and
bicycles. Traffic-calming features may be used to
encourage slow traffic speeds.
[5] Street hierarchy. Each street within a traditional
neighborhood development shall be classified according to
the following (arterial streets should not bisect a
traditional neighborhood development):
[a] Collector. This street provides access to commercial or
mixed-use buildings, but it is also part of the major
street network. On-street parking, whether diagonal
or parallel, helps to slow traffic. Additional parking is
provided in lots to the side or rear of buildings.
[b] Local street. This street provides primary access to
individual residential properties. Traffic volumes are
relatively low.
[c] Alley. These streets provide secondary access to
residential properties. Alleys may also provide
delivery access or alternate parking access to
commercial properties.

NOTES:
1 The Board of Supervisors may allow variation or
relief from these standards. The Board of Supervisors
may also allow alternative roadway concepts, such as
one-way streets and yield streets.
*Planting strips are not required in community center
areas when permission is granted by the Board of
Supervisors.
[6] Street layout. The traditional neighborhood development
should maintain the existing street grid, where present,
and restore any disrupted street grid where feasible, and
shall propose an interconnected street grid pattern. Culsde-
sac are prohibited, unless specific permission is
granted by the Board of Supervisors.
[a] Street orientation.
[i] The orientation of streets should enhance the
visual impact of common open spaces and
prominent buildings. All streets shall terminate at
other streets or at public lands, public streetscape
features, specifically designed building façades,
or gateways to public space, except local streets
may terminate in stub streets when such streets
act as connections to future phases of the
development. Local streets may terminate other
than at other streets or public lands when there is
§ 133-14 WELLS § 133-14
131:525
a connection to the pedestrian and bicycle path
network at the terminus.
[ii] Alleys shall not form the boundary of a park,
common open space area, or greenbelt unless
approved by the Board of Supervisors. If
approved, the Supervisors may require that a wall
or other screen a minimum of six feet in height be
used for separation.
[iii] Generally, there shall be a continuous network of
alleys to the rear of lots within the TND, unless
otherwise permitted by the Board of Supervisors.
[iv] To prevent the buildup of vehicular speed,
disperse traffic flow, and create a sense of visual
enclosure, long, uninterrupted segments of
straight streets shall be avoided. Streets shall be
interrupted by intersections, a vista, or a notable
street curve, or other traffic-calming means
acceptable to the Board of Supervisors.
[7] Parking requirements.
[a] In the community center, any parking lot shall be
located at the rear or side of a building. If located at
the side, landscaping acceptable to the Board of
Supervisors shall be provided along the perimeter of
the parking lot.
[b] A parking lot or garage may not be adjacent to or
opposite a street intersection, be adjacent to greens or
parks, or occupy lots which terminate at a vista.
[c] Parking lots or garages must provide not less than one
bicycle parking space for every 10 motor vehicle
parking spaces.
[d] Adjacent on-street parking to a lot or building may
apply toward the minimum parking requirements.
[e] Adjacent parking lots shall have vehicular
connections.
[f] Off-street parking may be located within 600 feet
(measured along a publicly accessible route) from the
lot containing the use to which the parking is
accessory. The lot containing the parking shall be
owned or leased by the owner of the principal use, or
the lot containing the parking shall be dedicated to
parking as long as the use to which it is accessory
§ 133-14 JACKSON CODE § 133-14
131:526
shall continue and it is owned by an entity capable of
assuring its maintenance as accessory parking.
[8] Service access. Access for service vehicles should provide
a direct route to service and loading dock areas, while
avoiding movement through parking areas. Loading areas
shall not be visible from public streets. Trash disposal
areas shall be located within buildings or an opaque
screened area which hides the trash and is located to the
side or rear of the building.
[9] Outdoor lighting.
[a] Streetlighting shall be provided along all streets in a
manner acceptable to the Township Supervisors.
Generally, more, smaller lights, as opposed to fewer,
high-intensity lights, should be used, and streetlights
shall be installed on both sides of the street at
intervals of no greater than 75 feet, unless alternative
schemes are approved by the Supervisors. The design
of lighting shall be compatible with the architecture of
the TND.
[b] Exterior lighting shall not cast glare onto adjacent
properties, and the design of such lighting is subject
to the approval of the Board of Supervisors.
(e) Landscaping and screening standards. The composition and
location of landscaping shall complement the scale of the
development and its surroundings. An overall landscaping
scheme shall be prepared and is subject to approval by the
Board of Supervisors. Earthen berms may be incorporated into
the landscaping scheme. The following are minimum
standards:
[1] General screening. Where screening is required by this
chapter, it shall be at least three feet in height, unless
otherwise specified. Required screening shall be at least
50% opaque throughout the year. Required screening shall
be satisfied by one or some combination of a decorative
fence not less than 50% opaque behind a continuous
landscaped area, a masonry wall, or a hedge.
[2] Street trees. A minimum of one deciduous canopy tree per
40 feet of street frontage, or fraction thereof, shall be
required. Spacing will be determined by the species type.
Large maturing trees shall generally be planted along
residential streets and along parks, greens, greenbelts,
and civic structures. Small maturing trees shall generally
be planted along nonresidential and mixed-use streets.
Trees can be clustered and do not need to be evenly
spaced. Trees should preferably be located between the
§ 133-14 WELLS § 133-14
131:527
sidewalk and the curb, within the landscaped area of a
boulevard, or in tree wells installed in pavement or
concrete. If placement of street trees within the right-ofway
will interfere with utility lines, or if required by the
Board of supervisors, trees may be planted within the front
yard setback adjacent to the sidewalk.
[3] Parking area landscaping and screening.
[a] All parking and loading areas fronting public streets
or sidewalks and all parking and loading areas
abutting residential uses shall provide:
[i] A landscaped area at least five feet wide along the
public street or sidewalk.
[ii] Screening at least three feet in height and not less
than 50% opaque.
[iii] One tree for each 25 linear feet of parking lot
frontage.
[b] Parking area interior landscaping. The corners of
parking lots, islands, and all other areas not used for
parking or vehicular circulation shall be landscaped.
Vegetation can include turf grass, native grasses or
other perennial flowering plants, vines, shrubs or
trees. Such spaces may include architectural features
such as benches, kiosks or bicycle parking.
[4] Installation and maintenance of landscaping materials.
[a] All landscape materials shall be installed to current
industry standards.
[b] Maintenance and replacement of landscape materials
shall be the responsibility of the property owner,
homeowners' association, or condominium
association. Landscape maintenance should
incorporate environmentally sound management
practices, including the use of water- and energyefficient
irrigation systems such as drip irrigation,
pruning primarily for plant health and public safety,
and replacing dead materials annually.
[c] Plantings in immediate proximity to buildings shall
respect architectural design. Plantings toward the
street shall not obscure important buildings and shall
respect views to and from streets, porches, walks, and
public open spaces.
(f) Stormwater management. The design and development of the
traditional neighborhood development should minimize off-site
§ 133-14 JACKSON CODE § 133-14
131:528
§ 133-15. Commercial Zone (C).
stormwater runoff, promote on-site filtration, and minimize the
discharge of pollutants to ground- and surface water. Natural
topography and existing land cover shall be maintained/
protected to the maximum extent practicable and desirable.
A. Purpose. The purpose of the Commercial Zone is to provide reasonable
standards for the development of commercial uses in areas where such
uses already exist and where, due to the character of undeveloped land,
the development of commercial uses is feasible. This district and its
standards are designed to allow for a cluster of commercial uses while
avoiding congestion and to provide buffer yards, screen plantings, and
other such protection necessary to separate residential from
commercial areas.

encourage industries that will be so located and designed as to
constitute harmonious and appropriate development, contribute to the
soundness of the economic base, and otherwise further the purposes of
this chapter. In promoting these and the general purposes of this
chapter, the specific intent of this section is:
(1) To encourage the development of and continued use of land for
industrial purposes.
(2) To prohibit any use that would substantially interfere with the
development, continuation, or expansion of industrial uses in the
district.

§ 133-17. Floodplain Overlay Zones: Floodway (FW), Flood Fringe
(FF), and General Floodplain Area (FA).
*NOTE: Additional lot area may be required if well testing, soil
limitations for on-site sewage disposal, or other factors require the
need for a larger lot.
E. Setbacks. Each lot shall provide front, side, and rear setbacks not less
than the following:
(1) Front setback: 50 feet.
(2) Side setback: 25 feet.
(3) Rear setback: 35 feet.
F. Building height. The height limit for a principal building or structure
shall be 50 feet. The height limit for an accessory building or structure

I. Access. Adequate access to all industrial uses shall be provided. Traffic
entrances and exits shall be at a sufficient distance or appropriately
buffered from residential dwellings so that truck noise and vibration
will be minimized.
J. Screens and buffers: see § 133-32.
K. Harmful or unpleasant effects. Satisfactory provisions shall be made to
minimize harmful or unpleasant effects (noise, odors, fumes, glare,
vibration, smoke, vapors or gases, electrical emissions, and industrial
wastes) associated with industrial uses.
A. Purpose. The purpose of these zones is to prevent the loss of property
and life, creation of health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce
and governmental services, extraordinary and unnecessary expenditure
of public funds for flood protection and relief, and the impairment of the
tax base by:
(1) Regulating uses, activities, and development which, acting alone or
in combination with other existing or future uses, activities and
development, will cause unacceptable increases in flood heights,
velocities, and frequencies.
(2) Restricting or prohibiting certain uses, activities, and development
from being located within areas subject to flooding.
§ 133-16 JACKSON CODE § 133-17
131:534
(3) Requiring all those uses, activities, and developments that do occur
in flood-prone areas to be protected and/or floodproofed against
flooding and flood damage.
(4) Protecting individuals from buying lands and structures that are
unsuited for intended purposes because of flood hazards.
B. Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection
sought by the provisions of this chapter is considered reasonable for
regulatory purposes and is based on acceptable engineering methods of
study. Larger floods may occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be
increased by man-made or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge
openings restricted by debris. This chapter does not imply that areas
outside the floodplain zones, or that land uses permitted within such
zones, will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall
not create liability on the part of Jackson Township or any officer or
employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on
this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
C. Establishment of floodplain zones.
(1) Description of zones.
(a) Basis of zones. The various floodplain zones shall include areas
subject to inundation by waters of the one-hundred-year flood.
The basis of a delineation of these zones shall be the Flood
Insurance Study (FIS) and the accompanying Flood Insurance
Rate Maps (FIRMs), dated December 16, 2015, and issued by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), or such
FIS and FIRMs (including supplements and amendments)
subsequently approved by Jackson Township. [Amended
6-7-2016 by Ord. No. 210-16]
[1] The Floodway Zone (FW) is delineated, for purposes of this
chapter, using the criteria that a certain area within the
floodplain must be capable of carrying the waters of the
one-hundred-year flood without increasing the water
surface elevation of that flood more than one foot at any
point. The areas included in this zone are specifically
defined in Table 1 of the above-referenced Flood Insurance
Study and shown on the accompanying Flood Boundary
and Floodway Map.
[2] The Flood Fringe Zone (FF) shall be that area of the onehundred-
year floodplain not included in the Floodway
Zone. The basis for the outermost boundary of this zone
shall be the one-hundred-year flood elevations contained
in the flood profiles of the above-referenced Flood
Insurance Study (FIS) and as shown on the Flood
Boundary and Floodway Map.
§ 133-17 WELLS § 133-17
131:535
[3] The General Floodplain Zone (FA) shall be that floodplain
area for which no detailed flood profiles or elevations have
been provided. Such areas are shown on the Flood
Boundary and Floodway Map accompanying the Flood
Insurance Study prepared for the Flood Insurance
Administration. Where the specific one-hundred-year flood
elevation cannot be determined for this area using other
sources of data such as the United States Army Corps of
Engineers' Floodplain Information Reports, United States
Geological Survey Flood-Prone Quadrangles, and the like,
then the applicant for the proposed use, development, and/
or activity shall determine this elevation in accordance
with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering techniques.
Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken
only by professional engineers or others of demonstrated
qualifications, who shall certify that the technical methods
used correctly reflect currently accepted technical
concepts. Studies, analyses, computations, and the like
shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough
technical review by the Township.
(b) Overlay concept
[1] The aforementioned floodplain zones shall be overlays to
the existing underlying zones as shown on the Official
Zoning Map, and as such, the provisions for the floodplain
zones shall serve as a supplement to the underlying zone
provisions.
[2] Where there exists any conflict between the provisions or
requirements of any of the floodplain zones and those of
any underlying zone, the more-restrictive provision of the
two shall apply.
(2) Inclusion of Zoning Map. The boundaries of the floodplain zones
are established as shown on the FIS and FIRMs, dated December
16, 2015, and issued by FEMA, or such FIS and FIRMs (including
supplements and amendments) subsequently approved by Jackson
Township. [Amended 6-7-2016 by Ord. No. 210-16]
(3) Zone boundary changes. The delineation of any of the floodplain
zones may be revised by the Board of Supervisors where natural or
man-made changes have occurred and/or more detailed studies
conducted or undertaken by the United States Army Corps of
Engineers or another qualified agency or individual documents the
advisability for such change. However, prior to any such change,
approval must be obtained from the Federal Insurance
Administration (FIA) or its successor agency.
(4) Interpretation of zone boundaries. Initial interpretations of the
boundaries of the floodplain zones shall be made by the Zoning
§ 133-17 JACKSON CODE § 133-17
131:536
§ 133-18. Underground Mining Overlay Zone (UM).
Officer. Should a dispute arise concerning the boundaries of any
of the zones, the person questioning or contesting the location
of the zone boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to
present his or her case to the Township Zoning Hearing Board and
to submit his own technical evidence if he so desires. Should the
person choose to have the zone boundary changed to reflect moreaccurate
flooding data, he must follow the procedures to present
his case to the Board of Supervisors for a zoning amendment.
D. Zone provisions. All uses, activities, land filling, and development
occurring within a flood hazard area shall be undertaken only in strict
compliance with the provisions of this chapter, Chapter 69, Floodplain
Management, and with all other applicable codes and ordinances, such
as Chapter 47, Article I, Building Permits, and Chapter 107,
Stormwater Management, where applicable, and the Department of
Environmental Protection.
A. Purpose. The purpose of the Underground Mining Overlay District is to
permit the continued underground mining of a unique mineral which
will continue to contribute to the sound economic base of Jackson
Township and the residents thereof without adversely impacting the
continued use of surface as presently zoned.
B. Uses by right. The following uses are permitted by right in the UM
Zone:
(1) Underground mining.
(2) Heavy storage (in the underground mine only).
(3) Accessory uses customarily incidental to underground mining or
heavy storage.
C. Permits and approvals. All uses, activities and mining occurring within
the Underground Mining District shall be undertaken only in strict
compliance with the provisions of the mining permit issued by the
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection. A copy of the
permit shall be delivered to the Township prior to any mining occurring
in the Underground Mining District.
D. Access. Adequate access to all underground mining uses shall be
provided. The entrance and exit to an Underground Mining District
shall only occur from the Industrial District. In addition, prior to mining,
the applicant shall provide evidence of approval from the Pennsylvania
Department of Transportation to tunnel under any state road necessary
to obtain access to the subject area and to utilize such tunnels to access
the underground mining.
E. Heavy storage. The heavy storage use in the Underground Mining
Overlay District may only occur in the underground mine.
§ 133-17 WELLS § 133-18
131:537
§ 133-19. Airport Safety Zones (AIR-1, AIR-2, AIR-3).
F. The Zoning Map of Jackson Township is hereby amended to designate
the following York County tax assessment parcels subject to the
Underground Mining Overlay District (UM):
33000HF00130000000
33000HF00150000000
33000HF00160000000

33000HF00770000000
33000HF00940000000
33000HF01140000000
33000HF01180000000
G. All activities on the surface of the ground shall be conducted strictly in
accordance with the restrictions of the underlying zoning district in
which the land is located.
H. All provisions of this chapter unaffected by this article shall remain in
full force and effect.
A. Purpose and intent.
(1) State and federal laws require the limitation of building and
structural height in airport hazard areas. State guidelines set forth
recommendations for compatible land uses within airport hazard
areas as well.
(2) Properties within Jackson Township have been identified as being
within the airport hazard area of the York Airport, as defined in the
Pennsylvania Aviation Code, and require special height controls
and are therefore also subject to Township land use regulations.
(3) The height restrictions are aimed at preventing the erection of
structures that would interfere with or obstruct normal aircraft
approaches or airport operations. Such interference or obstruction
would pose a threat to the health, safety, welfare, and convenience
of the residents of the Township, as well as passengers aboard
aircraft.
(4) Airport safety zones within the hazard area are also used to impose
reasonable regulations providing for compatible land uses in
addition to needed height restrictions, thereby enhancing public
safety.
B. Lands in airport safety zones defined.
(1) The Township's airport hazard area includes areas within Jackson
Township depicted on the Airport Hazard Area for York Airport
§ 133-18 JACKSON CODE § 133-19
131:538
Plan. These areas have been plotted on a Jackson Township Zoning
Map, a copy of which may be viewed at the Township offices.
(2) Three separate zones within the airport hazard area have been
identified:
(a) Airport Safety Zone 1 (AIR-1) includes areas at either end of
the runway that are most seriously affected by the airport
operations. Areas contained within Airport Safety Zone 1 are
located in such close proximity to the airport that this chapter's
normal permitted structural height of 35 feet could pose a
safety hazard. Accordingly, height restrictions are very strict.
In addition, approval of proposed development land uses is
carefully controlled as well.
(b) Airport Safety Zone 2 (AIR-2) includes areas also seriously
affected by the airport operations. Areas contained within
Airport Safety Zone 2 are located in such close proximity to the
airport that this chapter's normal permitted structural height
(35 feet) could pose a safety hazard. Accordingly, height
restrictions are strict.
(c) Airport Safety Zone 3 (AIR-3) includes areas just beyond
Airport Safety Zone 2 and outlying areas that have particularly
high elevations. These areas include those that cannot support
structures that are higher than 35 feet up to the maximum
permitted structural height of 50 feet in § 133-16. Within this
zone, regulations permit the placement of thirty-five-foot-high
structures but require special review for structures higher
than 35 feet.
C. Relationship to other articles. The airport safety zones represent
overlay zoning districts that are concerned with permitted heights and
land uses. The underlying zoning district shall prescribe all other
zoning-related standards and uses. In those instances where the airport
safety zone prescribes a height and/or land use restriction different
than that imposed by the underlying zoning district, the mostrestrictive
standard shall apply.
D. Height regulations within Airport Safety Zones 1, 2, and 3.
(1) The property owner/applicant shall submit plans to the Township as
are reasonably necessary to determine the height of any proposed
building or structure. The Township shall forward the documents to
the York Airport owner, who shall, in turn, forward them to the
Pennsylvania Bureau of Aviation for a review by the Bureau and, if
required, to be sent by the Bureau to the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) to determine compliance with FAA guidelines
regarding objects affecting navigable airspace. The Bureau of
Aviation shall have 10 working days to issue a report to the
Township indicating whether or not a hazard/no hazard
determination by the Federal Aviation Administration is necessary.
§ 133-19 WELLS § 133-19
131:539
(2) If the York Airport owner recommends that the application does not
require a hazard/no hazard determination by the Federal Aviation
Administration and the application complies with all other
applicable provisions of Township ordinances, a building permit
application can be approved.
(3) If the York Airport owner determines that the proposed use
requires a hazard/no hazard determination by the Federal Aviation
Administration, then the York Airport owner will assist the
applicant in completing an FAA Form 7460, which is available at
the Township offices, and submit it to the Federal Aviation
Administration for determination. If the Federal Aviation
Administration issues a "no hazard" determination and the
application complies with all other applicable provisions of
Township ordinances, the Township can issue a building permit. If
the Federal Aviation Administration issues a "hazard"
determination, the application will be denied.
(4) No variances circumventing the York Airport owner's review and
hazard determination by the Federal Aviation Administration shall
be granted by the Zoning Hearing Board without expressed written
consent thereto from the Federal Aviation Administration, such
consent to be obtained by the property owner/applicant.
E. Land use regulations within Airport Safety Zones 1, 2, and 3.
(1) Uses permitted by right in AIR-1. The following uses, limited to one
principal use per lot, are permitted by right in the AIR-1 Zone:
(a) Parking lots and access drives thereto.
(b) Agriculture.
(c) Golf course.
(d) Passive open space/park facility.

Chapter 47, Building Construction, shall be applicable.
§ 133-22. Access to structures.
Every building and structure hereafter erected or moved shall be on a lot
adjacent to a public street or a private street approved by the Township
Supervisors or on a lot for which a legally recorded right-of-way access to a
public street or approved private street existed prior to the effective date of
this chapter. After the effective date of this chapter, no lot shall be created
unless it abuts a public street or a private street approved by the Township
Supervisors; except that, in the case of a structure related to public sanitary
sewer and water systems, such structure may be placed on a lot which is
not adjacent to a public or private street as long as a legally recorded rightof-
way access to such a street will exist. For the purposes of this section, a
service street (alley) shall not constitute a public street or highway.
§ 133-23. Accessory uses and structures.
A. Attached structures. Any accessory structure attached to a principal
structure is considered a part of the principal structure for all
regulatory purposes.
B. Nonattached structures. Any accessory structure, standing apart from a
principal structure, is permitted in the rear yard but shall not be located
closer than five feet to any side or rear property line, except for
structures larger than 150 square feet, which shall comply with
principal structure setback requirements. In the AP and RC Zone, a
nonattached accessory structure shall be permitted in the front or side
yard, provided 1) the lot is five acres or more, 2) the nonattached
structure has a minimum front setback of 100 feet and 3) the
nonattached structure shall be at least 100 feet from any residence on
adjoining properties. [Amended 9-6-2011 by Ord. No. 190-11;
6-7-2016 by Ord. No. 210-16]
(1) Utility sheds may be located within a required side setback area
but shall not be located closer than five feet to any side property
line.

131:541
(2) No apartment(s) or living quarters shall be located in an accessory
structure.
(3) Farm produce stands may be placed in a front yard area, but shall
not be placed within a street right-of-way. When located in a zone
other than an AP or RC Zone, such stands must be removed when
products are no longer on sale. (See § 133-44.)
(4) The maximum height of an accessory structure in a particular zone
shall be as required in the height regulations of that zone.
(5) The combined maximum size of the building area of all accessory
structures on a lot (measured in square feet) is regulated by the
size of the lot on which they are located multiplied by 0.025 (2.5%).
(6) Other than as listed above, for all other requirements, a
nonattached structure is considered the same as a principal
structure.
C. Fences and walls. No fence or wall (except a retaining wall or a wall of a
building permitted under the terms of this chapter) shall be erected to a
height of more than four feet in a front or side yard area or more than
six feet in any rear yard area in any residential zone or upon any lot
used for residential purposes in any other zone. In a C or I Zone, a fence
may be erected to eight feet in height in any yard area but no higher.
The above fencing height restrictions apply universally, except as
modified in Article VI of this chapter.
(1) Fences may be located up to but shall not be located on the lot line.
(2) No fencing may be erected that inhibits sight distance at a street
intersection.
(3) In the case of a fence or wall erected adjacent to a driveway in any

shall be such that adequate sight distance between the driveway
and the street or road is provided as required for driveways in
§ 133-34D.

131:542
§ 133-24. Outdoor swimming pools.
(6) Such devices must be appropriately screened or fenced so as not to
be visually obtrusive to neighboring properties.
E. Satellite dish antennas 36 inches or less in diameter are permitted by
right in all zoning districts, subject to the following criteria:
(1) Demonstration by the applicant that compliance with the
applicable yard, setback, and height restrictions would result in the
obstruction of the antenna's reception window, if it were groundmounted;
furthermore, that such obstruction involves factors
beyond the applicant's control.
(2) The satellite dish antenna must be set back at least the horizontal
distance equal to its maximum height above ground, from all
property lines.
(3) The allowance of a satellite dish antenna(s) shall in no way place
liability upon the Township for the obstruction of the antenna's
reception window due to permitted construction on adjoining or
nearby properties. Any arrangements made to protect the
antenna's reception window shall be between private parties and
not the Township.
(4) To protect aesthetics, such devices must be placed so that the dish
is not visible from the front of the property. If this results in the
obstruction of the satellite's reception window, every effort should
be made to install the satellite dish in a way that is least visually
obtrusive to surrounding properties.
(5) A maximum of two satellite dishes per structure are permitted.
Installation of any additional dishes may be permitted in the case of
multiple-family dwellings when approved by the Township.
A. Every outdoor swimming pool shall conform to all applicable
requirements of state law.

C. Every outdoor swimming pool, spa, or hot tub, if not covered by a rigid,
secure cover which eliminates potential access by children and
unauthorized persons, must be completely surrounded by a fence or
wall that has a height of not less than four feet above the ground. The
fence or wall shall be constructed so as not to have openings, holes, or
gaps larger than two inches in any dimension. All gates or doors
opening through such enclosure shall be equipped with a self-closing
and self-latching device for keeping the gate or door securely closed at
all times when not in actual use, except that the door of any dwelling
which forms a part of the enclosure need not be so equipped.

D. An outdoor aboveground pool that has a water-containing wall of at
least four feet in height serving in lieu of the fencing requirement in
Subsection C shall have access by a removable or retractable ladder,
which must be removed or retracted when not in use. In the event that
an outdoor swimming pool that has a part or all of its water-containing
wall or barrier above the level of the surrounding ground and does not
have a retractable or removable ladder that is accessible at ground
level at a height less than four feet or has a fixed ladder or steps, said
wall or barrier shall not be construed to satisfy fencing requirements,
and a separate fence meeting all of the requirements of Subsection C
above must be provided. In such cases, the fence may be affixed to or
upon the water-containing wall of a swimming pool or may be entirely
separate from it, as long as all other requirements of this section are
met.
E. Water shall not be discharged from any swimming pool onto any
adjoining property.
A. Vehicle storage.
(1) Except as provided in § 133-63 of this chapter, in all zones,

building and the rear setback line. Such vehicles may not be placed
within a side setback area.
B. Outdoor stockpiling. In a Residential, Village, or Agricultural Zone, tire
stockpiles, metal pipes, automobile parts, and similar objects and
materials must be stored in a garage or an enclosed storage structure.
In a commercial or industrial zone, such items must be stored in a
garage or enclosed storage structure or be completely shielded by
landscaping, walls, or fencing so as to screen the object(s) in all seasons
of the year from the street or adjoining properties. All such storage
must be accessory to an existing principal building, except as provided
in § 133-63 of this chapter.
C. Trash or junk. Except as provided in § 133-63 of this chapter and in

restrict major thoroughfares to their traffic function, buildings
(including residential and nonresidential buildings) along these
thoroughfares must be set back at least 50 feet from the right-of-way
line of the thoroughfare. Major thoroughfares are or will be any arterial
streets and collector streets specified in the Jackson/Paradise Joint
Comprehensive Plan.
C. Sight distance. Proper sight lines must be maintained at all street
intersections. Corner lots must have a clear sight triangle with sides at
least 75 feet in length measured along the center line of the street. This

131:557
§ 133-36. Illumination.
Where a use involves exterior lighting, the lighting must be so located and
shielded that no objectionable illumination or glare is cast upon adjoining
properties or any adjacent public street.
A. Applicability.
(1) Outdoor lighting shall be required for safety and personal security
for uses that operate or have activity during hours of darkness
where there is public assembly and traverse, including but not
limited to the following uses: residential developments containing
lot sizes of less than 20,000 square feet, residential developments
of greater than 10 lots, multifamily residential developments, and
commercial, industrial, municipal, recreational and institutional
uses.
(2) The Township Supervisors may require that lighting be
incorporated for other uses or locations or restrict lighting in any of
the above uses when deemed necessary to accomplish the purposes
of this chapter.
(3) The glare-control requirements herein contained apply to lighting
in all above-mentioned uses as well as but not limited to sign,
architectural, landscape, recreational and residential lighting.
(4) Temporary decorative lighting may be exempted from the
requirements of this chapter when approved by the Zoning Officer
for periods of short duration.
B. Criteria.
(1) Illumination levels
(a) Lighting, where required or permitted by this chapter, shall
have intensities and uniformity ratios in accordance with the
current recommended practices of the Illuminating
Engineering Society of North America (IESNA) as contained in
the IESNA Lighting Handbook or separately in IESNA
Recommended Practices.
(b) Future amendments to said recommended practices shall
become a part of this chapter without further action of the
Township.
(c) Examples of intensities for typical outdoor applications, as
extracted from the Lighting Handbook, are presented below

NOTES:
1. Illumination levels are maintained horizontal footcandles
on the task, e.g., pavement or area surface.
2. Uniformity ratios dictate that average illuminance values
shall not exceed minimum values by more than the
product of the minimum value and the specified ratio, e.g.,
for high-activity commercial parking, the average
illuminance shall not exceed 3.6 footcandles (0.9 x 4).
* In no case shall the maximum to minimum uniformity ratio
for parking be in excess of 20:1.
(2) Lighting fixture design.
(a) Fixtures shall be of a type and design appropriate to the
lighting application and aesthetically acceptable to the
Township Supervisors.
(b) For the lighting of predominantly horizontal surfaces, such as
but not limited to, roadways, areas of vehicular and pedestrian
passage, loading areas, and parking areas, fixtures, whether
freestanding, wall-mounted, or any other type, shall be aimed
straight down and shall meet IESNA full-cutoff criteria.
(c) Where the use of fixtures meeting IESNA full-cutoff criteria is
not practical or possible, fixtures shall be equipped with
aiming and/or light-redirecting devices, such as shields, visors,
baffles, skirts or hoods, when necessary to direct or redirect
offending light distribution.
(d) The use of floodlighting, spotlighting, noncutoff wall-mounted
fixtures, internally illuminated decorative globes and spheres,
lanterns and other fixtures not meeting IESNA full-cutoff
criteria shall be permitted only with the approval of the
Township, based upon acceptable justification and
achievement of adequate glare control.
(e) NEMA-head fixtures, also known as "barn lights" or "dusk-todawn
lights," shall not be permitted where they are visible
from other uses, unless fitted with a reflector or shield to
render them full-cutoff.
(3) Control of nuisance and disabling glare.
(a) All outdoor lighting, whether or not required by this chapter,
on private, residential, commercial, industrial, municipal,
recreational or institutional property shall be aimed, located,
designed, fitted and maintained so as not to present a hazard
to drivers or pedestrians by impairing their ability to safely
traverse and so as not to create a nuisance by projecting or

131:560
§ 133-37. Demolition.
Demolition of any structure must be completed within 12 months of the
start of such demolition. Completion consists of tearing the structure down
to grade, filling any resulting cavity to grade and removing all resulting
debris from the lot. A structure may be partly demolished only if a building
remains and the demolition of the part is completed as required in the
previous sentence.
§ 133-38. Buildings under construction.
A building, the foundation of which was completed before the effective
date of this chapter, may be constructed without being bound by the
reflecting objectionable light onto a neighboring use or
property.
(b) The use of floodlights and spotlights shall be so installed or
aimed that they do not project their output beyond the
boundaries of the property on which they are located.
(c) Unless otherwise permitted by the Township Supervisors, e.g.,
for safety or security or businesses that operate all night or
past 11:00 p.m., lighting for commercial, industrial, municipal,
recreational and institutional applications shall be controlled
by automatic switching devices, such as time clocks or
combination motion detectors and photocells, to permit
reducing or extinguishing outdoor lighting fixtures between
11:00 p.m. and dawn to mitigate light trespass, nuisance glare
and skylighting consequences.
(d) Lighting proposed for use after 11:00 p.m., or after normal
hours of operation of a business, whichever is earlier, for
commercial, industrial, institutional or municipal applications
shall be reduced by at least 50% from then until dawn, unless
supporting a specific purpose and approved by the Township
Supervisors.
(e) All illumination for advertising signs, buildings and/or
surrounding landscapes for decorative, advertising or esthetic
purposes is prohibited between 11:00 p.m. and sunrise, except
that such lighting situated on the premises of a commercial
establishment may remain illuminated while the establishment
is actually open for business and until one hour after closing.
(f) Vegetation screens shall not be employed to serve as the
primary means for controlling glare. Rather, glare control shall
be achieved primarily through the use of such means as cutoff
fixtures, shields and baffles, and appropriate application of
fixture-mounting height, wattage, aiming angle and fixture
placement.

remaining portion of the original lot and each newly created lot will meet all
the applicable provisions of this chapter and Chapter 113, Subdivision and
Land Development.
§ 133-40. Lots of record.
On a lot held in single and separate ownership on the effective date of this
chapter or any amendment thereto that does not fulfill the regulations for
the minimum lot area or lot width for the zone in which it is located, a
building may be erected, altered, and used and the lot may be used for a
conforming (permitted) use, provided that the setback requirements are not
less than the minimum specified herein for the lots in that zone.
§ 133-41. Nonconformities.
A. Continuance.
(1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the lawful use of land
or buildings existing at the date of the adoption of this chapter may
be continued, even though such use of land or building does not
conform to the use regulations specified by this chapter for the
zone in which such land or building is located.
(2) Any nonconforming lot or structure lawfully existing at the date of
the adoption of this chapter may be continued.
B. Expansion or alteration.
(1) Upon application for a special exception, and in accordance with
the provisions of Articles V and VI, the Zoning Hearing Board may
approve the expansion of a use of land or building that is not in
conformance with the provisions of this chapter.
(2) Any alteration that will reduce the extent of a nonconformity shall
not require the approval of a special exception.
C. Replacement.

131:562
§ 133-42. Lot width modification.
The minimum lot width for residential properties abutting the turnaround
circle of a cul-de-sac street may be calculated at the minimum front setback
line rather than the street line, but in no case shall the lot width at the street
line be less than 50 feet.
§ 133-43. Status of subdivision or land development plan.
D. Restoration. If any nonconformity is destroyed by reason of windstorm,
fire, explosion or other act of God or a public enemy to an extent of
more than 75% of the market value as appraised for tax assessment
purposes, then such destruction shall be deemed complete destruction,
and the nonconformity may not be rebuilt, restored, or repaired except
upon issuance of a variance in accordance with § 133-53 of this chapter.
Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the strengthening or restoring to a
safe condition of any wall, floor or roof that has been declared unsafe.
E. Discontinuance or abandonment. A nonconforming use shall be
adjudged as discontinued or abandoned when there occurs a cessation
of any such use or activity by an apparent act or failure to act on the
part of the tenant or owner to reinstate such use within a period of one
year from the date of cessation or discontinuance. Such use shall not
thereafter be reinstated and the structure shall not be reoccupied
except in conformance with this chapter.
F. Reversion. No nonconformity shall, if once changed to conform to the
regulations of this chapter, be changed back again to a nonconformity.
G. Zone changes. Whenever the boundaries of a zone shall be changed so
as to transfer an area from one zone to another zone of a different
classification, the foregoing provisions shall also apply to any
nonconforming uses or dimensional nonconformities existing therein or
created thereby.
H. Identification and registration. Nonconforming uses and
nonconforming structures may be identified and registered by the
Zoning Officer.
A. From the time an application for approval of a subdivision or land
development plan, whether preliminary or final, is duly filed as provided

to Title 75 of the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes, Chapter 49; and
Title 67 Pennsylvania Code, Chapter 189, the landowner and the
operator shall be responsible for repairing any damage to municipal
roads caused by traffic associated with the timber harvesting operation
to the extent the damage is in excess of that caused by normal traffic
and may be required to furnish a bond to guarantee the repair of such
damages. No mud or debris shall remain on public roads.
G. Enforcement.
§ 133-47 WELLS § 133-47
131:567
§ 133-48. Private mailboxes.
(1) The Zoning Officer or other party designated by the Township
Supervisors shall be the enforcement officer for this section.
(2) Inspections. The Zoning Officer or other designated party may go
upon the site of any timber harvesting operation before, during, or
after active logging to:
(a) Review the logging plan or any other required documents for
compliance with this section; and
(b) Inspect the operation for compliance with the logging plan and
other on-site requirements of these regulations.
A. Private mailboxes and/or newspaper tubes are permitted, provided that
no portion of the mailbox and/or newspaper tube or supporting
structure shall extend beyond the back edge of the street curb where
curbs are installed. Along streets with no curb, no portion of the
mailbox and/or newspaper tube shall extend to within two feet of the
cartway edge.
B. If a property utilizes a curbside mailbox for mail delivery, said mailbox
must comply with the manufacturer's specifications under the United
States Postal Service (USPS) Standard 7 (Mailboxes, City and Rural
Curbside). The box should bear the Township-designated street address
and may bear the owner's name and street name. Advertising on the

regulations are prohibited. A pole or post providing the equivalent
support or size of a wood 6 x 6 inch post shall represent the maximum
support allowed for a mailbox. Box supports designed to prevent
vandalism by providing protection from destruction rather than support
of the box are not permitted on the right-of-way of streets, roads, and
highways within the Township.
D. Any existing mailbox structure otherwise prohibited that is located in
the right-of-way of any road in the Township shall be permitted to
remain if found not to be a traffic hazard by the Township Engineer. A
mailbox structure shall be classified as a traffic hazard if one or more of
the following conditions apply:
(1) It is located so to obstruct any part of a clear sight triangle at or
within 75 feet of any intersection.
§ 133-47 JACKSON CODE § 133-48
131:568
§ 133-49. Alternative energy requirements.
(2) It is located in the vicinity of a road curve so that the inertia of a
motor vehicle that fails to negotiate the curve could cause it to
collide with the structure.
(3) If the structure impairs the view of approaching traffic or of any
traffic signs, markings, or signals.
(4) The structure is so close to the cartway to present a threat of
collision to oversize loads and bicyclists traveling along the road or
berm of the road.
A. Intent. The alternative energy requirements are designed to recognize
the need for conservation of energy and natural resources to facilitate
the utilization of renewable resources. These regulations are designed
to allow the installation of renewable energy devices and provide the
opportunity for individuals to reduce energy dependence by
encouraging the productive use of solar and wind energy components.
B. Definitions. The following terms are specifically designed for use within
this section:
ACTIVE SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM  A solar energy system that
requires external mechanical power to move collected heat.
ENERGY STORAGE FACILITY  Equipment consisting of containers,
heat exchangers, piping, and other transfer mechanisms (including
fluids, gases, or solids), controls, and related structural support for
transporting and storing collected energy (from solar energy systems),
including structural elements designed for use in passive solar energy
systems.
PASSIVE SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM  A solar energy system that uses
natural and architectural components to collect and store energy
without using any external mechanical power.
SOLAR COLLECTOR  A freestanding or fixed device, or combination
of devices, structures, or part of a device or structure that transforms
direct solar energy into thermal, chemical, or electrical energy that
contributes significantly to a structure's energy supply.
SOLAR ENERGY  Radiant energy (direct, diffused and reflected)
received from the sun.
SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM  A complete design or assembly consisting
of a solar energy collector, an energy storage facility (where used), and
components for the distribution of transformed energy.
SKYSPACE  The open space between a solar or wind collector and the
sun or prevailing wind that must be free of obstructions that may shade
or impede the collector to an extent that would reduce its cost-effective
operation.
§ 133-48 WELLS § 133-49
131:569
WIND ENERGY CONVERSION SYSTEM  A device that converts wind
energy to mechanical or electrical energy; commonly referred to as
"windmills."
WIND ROTOR  The blades, and hub to which the blades are attached,
that are used to capture wind for the purpose of energy conversion.
The wind rotor is used on a pole or tower along with other generating
and electrical storage equipment and forms a wind energy conversion
system.
C. Solar, wind and alternate energy standards. The use of solar, wind and
alternate energy systems is encouraged within these regulations and
permitted within any zoning district. Although the installation of such
systems is not mandatory, where they are utilized, the following shall
apply:
(1) Active and passive solar systems, wind energy systems and similar
alternate energy systems, including customary energy storage
accessories, shall be permitted for the production, collection,
movement, distribution or storage of heated water, air or other
medium that is intended for conveyance to a principal or accessory
building. Systems may include the following, subject to the
requirements contained herein:
(a) Solar panels with a combined glazing area of 65 square feet or
less may be placed in any required yard but shall not be closer
than two feet from any property line.
(b) Solar panels with a combined glazing area in excess of 65
square feet, provided that:
[1] Solar panels attached to a principal structure shall comply
with the zoning setbacks prescribed for a principal
structure in the applicable zoning district.
[2] Solar panels that are freestanding or attached to an
accessory structure shall comply with the accessory
structure requirements of this chapter.
(c) Solar greenhouses attached to principal structures shall meet
all yard requirements for a principal structure in the applicable
zoning district. Solar greenhouses attached to accessory
structures shall meet all yard requirements specified for
accessory structures in this chapter.
(d) Detached solar greenhouses shall meet all yard requirements
specified for accessory structures in this chapter.
(e) Wind energy conversion systems, provided that:
[1] The structure supporting the wind rotor unit shall be
located a minimum distance of 1,500 feet from any
§ 133-49 JACKSON CODE § 133-49
131:570
residential structure. The height of such structures shall
not exceed 75 feet.
[2] Towers may be ground- or roof-mounted and shall be
securely fastened as per manufacturer's specifications or a
demonstrable equivalent to achieve maximum safety and
prevent collapse or fall. Any propeller or turning device
that reacts to wind velocity shall have a governor to
control the speed of revolutions. Such governor may
include a rudder that turns the propeller away from the
wind, individually spring-mounted paddles that turn away
from the wind, or other suitable manufacturer's device.
Towers shall be locked or secured to prevent unauthorized
access, and in no case shall a permanently mounted ladder
be affixed less than 10 feet from grade level.
D. Protection and maintenance. The improvements required and
permitted within this section shall be protected and maintained to
ensure the environmental benefits of nonpolluting, replenishable
alternate energy. The following requirements shall apply:
(1) Protection.
(a) Where a solar or wind energy system has been installed to
serve an existing structure, it shall be the responsibility of the
property owner to secure any easements or restrictive
covenants necessary to protect the skyspace affecting the solar
or wind energy system. Such an agreement shall be negotiated
between owners of affected properties, but it is not a
requirement for approval of a building and zoning permit for
the solar or wind energy system.
(b) Maximum height requirements of this chapter shall not apply
to roof-mounted solar collector systems.
(2) Maintenance.
(a) Energy systems shall be maintained in a safe manner. Broken

necessary for the efficient operation of a solar or wind energy
device.
(2) Building and proposed use permits. A building and proposed use
permit shall be required for installation of, expansion of or
alteration to any of the energy systems described within this
section. Applicable procedures of this chapter shall apply during
the processing of such permit applications. Where desired, the
Zoning Officer may refer plans to any other applicable agencies for
review and comment prior to formal action on the permit
application.
A. No building or structure may be erected, altered, or used and no lot or
premises may be used for any activity which is noxious, injurious, or
offensive by reason of dust, smoke, odor, fumes, noise, vibration, gas,
effluent discharge, illumination, or similar substances or conditions.
B. No land or structures in any zoning district shall be used or occupied in
any manner that creates any nuisance in a manner or an amount that
will adversely affect the reasonable use or value of the surrounding
area or adjoining premises or be dangerous to public health or safety.
C. No building or structure may be erected within a street right-of-way
except for official traffic signs, utility poles, streetlights, street signs,

extension of time. Each subsequent hearing before the Board or
hearing officer shall be held within 45 days of the prior hearing,
unless otherwise agreed to by the applicant in writing or on the
record. An applicant shall complete the presentation of his case-inchief
within 100 days of the first hearing. Upon the request of the
applicant, the Board or hearing officer shall ensure that the
applicant receives at least seven hours of hearings within the 100
days, including the first hearing. Persons opposed to the
application shall complete the presentation of their opposition to
the application within 100 days of the first hearing held after the
completion of the applicant's case-in-chief. An applicant may, upon
request, be granted additional hearings to complete the case-inchief,
provided that the persons opposed to the application are
granted an equal number of additional hearings. Persons opposed
to the application may, upon the written consent or consent on the
record by the applicant and Township, be granted additional
hearings to complete their opposition to the application, provided
that the applicant is granted an equal number of additional
hearings for rebuttal.
(4) The hearings shall be conducted by the Board, or the Board may
appoint any member as a hearing officer. The decision or, where no
decision is called for, the findings shall be made by the Board;
however, the appellant or the applicant, as the case may be, in
addition to the Township, may, prior to the decision of the hearing,
waive decision or findings by the Board and accept the decision of
the hearing officer as final. Formal rules of evidence shall not apply,
but irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence may be
excluded.
(5) The Board or the hearing officer shall not communicate, directly or
indirectly, with any party or his representatives in connection with
any issue involved except upon notice and opportunity for all
parties to participate; shall not take notice of any communication,
reports, staff memoranda, or other materials, except advice from

(1) The Board or the hearing officer, as the case may be, shall render a
written decision or, when no decision is called for, make written
findings on the application within 45 days after the last hearing
before the Board or hearing officer. Where the application is
contested or denied, each decision shall be accompanied by
findings of fact and conclusions based thereon, together with the
reasons therefor. Conclusions based on any provisions of this
chapter or of any ordinance, rule, or regulation shall contain a
reference to the provision relied on and the reasons why the
conclusion is deemed appropriate in light of the facts found. If the
hearing is conducted by a hearing officer, and there has been no
stipulation that his decision or findings are final, the Board shall
make its report and recommendations available to the parties
within 45 days, the parties shall be entitled to make written
representations thereon to the Board prior to the final decision or
entry of findings, and the Board's decision shall be entered no later
than 30 days after the report of the hearing officer. Except for
challenges filed under Section 916.1 of the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code,125 where the Board fails to render
the decision within the period required by this subsection or fails to
commence, conduct, or complete the required hearing as provided
in § 133-52A of this chapter, the decision shall be deemed to have
125. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10916.1.
§ 133-52 WELLS § 133-52
131:577
§ 133-53. Variances.
been rendered in favor of the applicant, unless the applicant has
agreed in writing or on the record to an extension of time
(2) When a decision has been rendered in favor of the applicant
because of the failure of the Board to meet or render a decision as
hereinabove provided, the Board shall give public notice of said
decision within 10 days from the last day it could have met to
render a decision in the same manner as provided in Subsection A
of this section. Nothing in this subsection shall prejudice the right
of any party opposing the application to appeal the decision to a
court of competent jurisdiction.
(3) A copy of the final decision of the findings shall be delivered to the
applicant personally or mailed to him or her, even if no decision is
called for, not later than the day following the date of the decision.
A copy of said decision shall also be delivered or mailed to the
Township Zoning Officer in the same manner as noted for the
applicant. To all other persons who have filed their name and
address with the Board not later than the last day of the hearing,
the Board shall provide, by mail or otherwise, brief notice of the
decision or findings and a statement of the place at which the full
decision or findings may be examined.
(4) Whenever the Board imposes a condition or conditions with respect
to the granting of an application or appeal, this condition must be
stated in the order of the Board and in the permit issued pursuant
to the order by the Zoning Officer. This permit remains valid only as
long as the condition or conditions upon which it was granted or
the conditions imposed by this chapter are adhered to.
E. Records. The Board or the hearing officer, as the case may be, shall
keep a stenographic record of the proceedings. The appearance fee for
a stenographer shall be shared equally by the applicant and the Board.
The cost of the original transcript shall be paid by the Board if the
transcript is ordered by the Board or hearing officer, or shall be paid by
the person appealing from the decision of the Board if such appeal is
made; and in either event, the cost of additional copies shall be paid by
the person requesting such copy or copies. In other cases, the party
requesting the original transcript shall bear the cost thereof.
A. Filing of variance.
(1) An application may be made to the Zoning Hearing Board for a
variance where it is alleged that the provisions of this chapter
inflict unnecessary hardship upon the applicant. The application
must be made on a form provided for that purpose by the Zoning
Officer. It must be filed with the Board and copies given to the
Zoning Officer and Township Planning Commission. The applicant
must provide all the information requested on the form, together
§ 133-52 JACKSON CODE § 133-53
131:578
§ 133-54. Special exceptions.
with any other information and data that may be required to advise
the Board of the variance, whether such information is called for by
the official form or not.
(2) Unless otherwise specified or extended by the Board, a variance
authorized by it expires if the applicant fails to obtain a building
permit or use certificate within six months from the date of the
decision authorizing the variance.
B. Referral to Planning Commission. All applications for a variance shall
be referred to the Planning Commission for a report.
C. Standards for variance. Where there is unnecessary hardship, the
Board may grant a variance in the application of the provisions of this
chapter, provided that the following findings are made:
(1) There are unique physical circumstances or conditions, including
irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or shape or
exceptional topographical or other physical conditions peculiar to
the particular property and that the unnecessary hardship is due to
such conditions and not the circumstances or conditions generally
created by the provisions of this chapter in the neighborhood or
zone in which the property is located.
(2) Because of such physical circumstances or conditions, no
possibility exists that the property can be developed in strict
conformity with the provisions of this chapter and that the
authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to enable the
reasonable use of the property.
(3) The unnecessary hardship has not been created by the appellant.
(4) The variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential character of
the neighborhood or zone in which the property is located or
substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or
development of adjacent property or be detrimental to the public
welfare.
(5) The variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum variance
that will afford relief and represent the least modification possible
of the regulation in issue.
D. Conditions. In granting any variance, the Board may attach such
reasonable conditions and safeguards as it may deem necessary to
implement the purposes of this chapter.
A. Filing of special exceptions.
