Preface
The Mount Pleasant Municipal Code contains the codification and
revision of the ordinances of the City of Mount Pleasant, Tennessee. By
referring to the historical citation appearing at the end of each section, the user
can determine the origin of each particular section. The absence of a historical
citation means that the section was added by the codifier. The word "modified"
in the historical citation indicates significant modification of the original
ordinance.
The code is arranged into titles, chapters, and sections. Related matter
is kept together, so far as possible, within the same title. Each section number
is complete within itself, containing the title number, the chapter number, and
the section of the chapter of which it is a part. Specifically, the first digit,
followed by a hyphen, identifies the title number. The second digit identifies the
chapter number, and the last two digits identify the section number. For
example, title 2, chapter 1, section 6, is designated as section 2-106.
By utilizing the table of contents and the analysis preceding each title and
chapter of the code, together with the cross references and explanations included
as footnotes, the user should locate all the provisions in the code relating to any
question that might arise. However, the user should note that most of the
administrative ordinances (e.g. Annual Budget, Zoning Map Amendments, Tax
Assessments, etc...) do not appear in the code. Likewise, ordinances that have
been passed since the last update of the code do not appear here. Therefore, the
user should refer to the city's ordinance book or the city recorder for a
comprehensive and up to date review of the city's ordinances.
Following this preface is an outline of the ordinance adoption procedures,
if any, prescribed by the city's charter.
The code has been arranged and prepared in loose-leaf form to facilitate
keeping it up to date. MTAS will provide updating service under the following
conditions:
(1) That all ordinances relating to subjects treated in the code or which
should be added to the code are adopted as amending, adding, or deleting
specific chapters or sections of the code (see section 7 of the adopting ordinance).
(2) That one copy of every ordinance adopted by the city is kept in a
separate ordinance book and forwarded to MTAS annually.
(3) That the city agrees to pay the annual update fee as provided in the
MTAS codification service charges policy in effect at the time of the update.
iii
When the foregoing conditions are met MTAS will reproduce replacement
pages for the code to reflect the amendments and additions made by such
ordinances. This service will be performed at least annually and more often if
justified by the volume of amendments. Replacement pages will be supplied
with detailed instructions for utilizing them so as again to make the code
complete and up to date.
The able assistance of the codes team, Emily Keyser, Linda Winstead,
Nancy Gibson, and Doug Brown, is gratefully acknowledged.

or that would lead a reasonable person to infer that it affects the exercise of the
discretion shall disclose, before the exercise of the discretion when possible, the
interest on a form provided by and filed with the recorder. In addition, the

accept, directly or indirectly, any money, gift, gratuity, or other consideration or
favor of any kind from anyone other than the municipality:
(1) For the performance of an act, or refraining from performance of
an act, that he would be expected to perform, or refrain from performing, in the
regular course of his duties; or

his action, or reward him for past action, in executing municipal business.
(Ord. #2006-864, Sept. 2006)
1-406. Use of information. (1) An official or employee may not disclose
any information obtained in his official capacity or position of employment that
is made confidential under state or federal law except as authorized by law.
(2) An official or employee may not use or disclose information
obtained in his official capacity or position of employment with the intent to

municipality. (Ord. #2006-864, Sept. 2006)

not make or attempt to make private purchases, for cash or otherwise, in the

by the charter, general law, or ordinance or policy of the municipality.
(Ord. #2006-864, Sept. 2006)
1-409. Outside employment. An official or employee may not accept
or continue any outside employment if the work unreasonably inhibits the
performance of any affirmative duty of the municipal position or conflicts with
any provision of the municipalitys charter or any ordinance or policy.
(Ord. #2006-864, Sept. 2006)
1-9
1-410. Ethics complaints. (1) The city attorney is designated as the
ethics officer of the municipality. Upon the written request of an official or
employee potentially affected by a provision of this chapter, the city attorney
may render an oral or written advisory ethics opinion based upon this chapter
and other applicable law.
(2) (a) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the city
attorney shall investigate any credible complaint against an appointed
official or employee charging any violation of this chapter, or may
undertake an investigation on his own initiative when he acquires
information indicating a possible violation, and make recommendations
for action to end or seek retribution for any activity that, in the attorneys
judgment, constitutes a violation of this code of ethics.
(b) The city attorney may request the governing body to hire
another attorney, individual, or entity to act as ethics officer when he has
or will have a conflict of interests in a particular matter.
(c) When a complaint of a violation of any provision of this
chapter is lodged against a member of the municipalitys governing body,
the governing body shall either determine that the complaint has merit,
determine that the complaint does not have merit, or determine that the
complaint has sufficient merit to warrant further investigation. If the
governing body determines that a complaint warrants further
investigation, it shall authorize an investigation by the city attorney or
another individual or entity chosen by the governing body.
(3) The interpretation that a reasonable person in the circumstances
would apply shall be used in interpreting and enforcing this code of ethics.
(4) When a violation of this code of ethics also constitutes a violation
of a personnel policy, rule, or regulation, the violation shall be dealt with as a
violation of the personnel provisions rather than as a violation of this code of
ethics. (Ord. #2006-864, Sept. 2006)
1-411. Violations. An elected official or appointed member of a
separate municipal board, commission, committee, authority, corporation, or
other instrumentality who violates any provision of this chapter is subject to
punishment as provided by the municipalitys charter or other applicable law,
and in addition is subject to censure by the governing body. An appointed
official or an employee who violates any provision of this chapter is subject to
disciplinary action. (Ord. #2006-864, Sept. 2006)

responsible for the enforcement of the travel rules, regulations, and procedures.
(Ord. #93-753, Dec. 1993, as replaced by Ord. #2017-1013, Nov. 2017)
4-602. Travel policy. (1) In the interpretation and application of this
policy, the term "traveler" or "authorized traveler" means any elected or
appointed municipal officer or employee, including members of municipal boards
and committees appointed by the mayor or the municipal governing body, and
the employees of such boards and committees who are traveling on official
municipal business and whose travel was authorized in accordance with this
policy. "Authorized traveler" shall not include the spouse, children, other
relatives, friends, or companions accompanying the authorized traveler on city
business, unless the person(s) otherwise qualifies as an authorized traveler
under this policy.
(2) Authorized travelers are entitled to reimbursement of certain
expenditures incurred while traveling on official business for the city.
Reimbursable expenses shall include expenses for transportation; lodging;
meals; registration fees for conferences, conventions, and seminars; and other
actual and necessary expenses related to official business as determined by the
city manager. Under certain conditions, entertainment expenses may be eligible
for reimbursement.
(3) Authorized travelers can request either a travel advance for the
projected cost of authorized travel, and/or advance billing directly to the city for
registration fees, air fares, meals, lodging, conference, and similar expenses.
Travel advance requests are not considered documentation of travel expenses.
If travel advances exceed documented expenses, the traveler must immediately
Change 3, December 19, 2017 4-12
reimburse the city. It will be the responsibility of the city manager to initiate
action to recover any undocumented travel advances.
(4) Travel advances are available only for special travel and only after
completion and approval of the travel authorization form.
(5) The travel expense form will be used to document all expense
claims.
(6) To qualify for reimbursement, travel expenses must be:
(a) Directly related to the conduct of the city business for which
travel was authorized; and
(b) Actual, reasonable, and necessary under the circumstances.
The city manager may make exceptions for unusual circumstances.
Expenses considered excessive will not be allowed.
(7) Claims of five dollars ($5.00) dollars or more for travel expense
reimbursement must be supported by the original paid receipt for lodging,
vehicle rental, phone call, public carrier travel, conference fee, and other
reimbursable costs.
(8) Any person attempting to defraud the city or misuse city travel
funds is subject to legal action for recovery of fraudulent travel claims and/or
advances, as well as disciplinary action up to and including termination.
(9) Mileage and motel expenses incurred within the city are not
ordinarily considered eligible expenses for reimbursement. (Ord. #93-753, Dec.
1993, as replaced by Ord. #2017-1013, Nov. 2017)
4-603. Travel reimbursement rate schedule. Authorized travelers
shall be reimbursed according to the State of Tennessee travel regulation rates.
The city's travel reimbursement rates will automatically change when the rates
are adjusted. The city may pay directly to the provider for expenses such as
meals, lodging, and registration fees for conferences, conventions, seminars, and
other education programs. (Ord. #93-753, Dec. 1993, as replaced by Ord. #2017-
1013, Nov. 2017)
4-604. Travel requests. To ensure reimbursement for official travel, an
approved travel authorization form is required. Lack of pre-approval does not
prohibit reimbursement, but it does assure reimbursement within the limits of
the city travel policy. All costs associated with the travel should be reasonably
estimated and shown on the authorization for travel form. An approved
authorization form is needed before advanced expenses are paid or travel
advances are authorized. A copy of the conference program, if applicable, should
be attached to the authorization form. If the program is not available prior to
the travel, you must attach it to your statement of expense claims form. (Ord.
#93-753, Dec. 1993, as replaced by Ord. #2017-1013, Nov. 2017)
4-605. Travel documentation. It is the responsibility of the authorized
traveler to:
Change 3, December 19, 2017 4-13
(1) Prepare and accurately describe the travel;
(2) Certify the accuracy of the reimbursement request;
(3) Note on the reimbursement form all direct payments and travel
advances made by the city; and
(4) File the expense form with the necessary supporting documents
and original receipts. The expense form should be filed with the finance
department within ten (10) days of return or at the end of the month, whichever
is more practical. (as added by Ord. #2017-1013, Nov. 2017)
4-606. Mode of transportation. (1) All potential costs should be
considered when selecting the modes of transportation. For example, airline
travel may be cheaper than automobile when time away from work and
increased meal and lodging costs are considered. When time is important, or
when the trip is so long that other modes of transportation are not
cost-beneficial, air travel is encouraged. If the traveler goes outside the state by
means other than air, the reimbursement will be limited to air fare at tourist or
economy class, ordinary expenses during the meeting date, and one (1) day's
meals and motel before and after the meeting. The traveler will be required to
take annual leave for any additional time taken beyond the day before and the
day after the meeting dates.
(2) Exceptions. When the traveler extends his or her trip with personal
time to take advantage of discount fares, the reimbursement will be limited to
the lesser of the:
(a) Actual expenses incurred; or
(b) The amount that would have been incurred for the business
portion only. The calculations for the business portion of the trip must be
made using the least expensive rates available. All expenses and savings
associated with extending the trip must be submitted with the expense
reimbursement form.
(3) Air. When possible, the traveler should make full use of discounts
for advance airline reservations and advance registration. The traveler should
request conference, government, or weekend rates, whichever is cheaper, when
making lodging or rental car reservations. The city will pay for tourist or
economy class air travel. The traveler should get the cheapest reasonable fare
and take advantage of discount fares. Airline travel can be paid by direct billing
to the city. Mileage credits for frequent flyer programs accrue to the individual
traveler. However, the city will not reimburse for additional expenses - such as
circuitous routing, extended stays, layovers to schedule a particular carrier,
upgrading from economy to first class - for travelers to accumulate additional
mileage or for other personal reasons. The city will not reimburse travel by
private aircraft unless authorized in advance by the city manager.
(4) Rail or bus. The city will pay for actual cost of ticket.
(5) Vehicles. (a) Automobile transportation may be used when a
common carrier cannot be scheduled, when it is more economical, when
Change 3, December 19, 2017 4-14
a common carrier is not practical, or when expenses can be reduced by
two (2) or more city employees traveling together.
(b) Personal vehicle. Employees should use city vehicles when
possible. Use of a private vehicle must be approved in advance by the city
manager. The city manager may require that the employee use the city
credit card for purchase of vehicle expenses, otherwise the city will pay
a mileage rate not to exceed the rate allowed by the state schedule. The
miles for reimbursement shall be paid from origin to destination and back
by the most direct route. Necessary vicinity travel related to official city
business will be reimbursed. If an indirect route is taken, a mapping
application will be used to determine the mileage to be reimbursed. If a
privately owned automobile is used by two (2) or more travelers on the
same trip, only the traveler who owns or had custody of the automobile
will be reimbursed for mileage. It is the responsibility of the traveler to
provide adequate insurance to hold harmless the city for any liability
from the use of the private vehicle. In no event will mileage
reimbursement, plus vicinity travel and associated automobile costs,
exceed the lowest reasonable available air fare and associated air fare
travel costs. Travelers will not be reimbursed for automotive repair or
breakdowns when using their personal vehicle.
(c) City vehicle. The city manager may require the employee to
drive a city vehicle. If a city vehicle is provided, the traveler is responsible
for seeing that the vehicle is used properly and only for acceptable
business. The employee will be reimbursed for expenses directly related
to the actual and normal use of the city vehicle when proper
documentation is provided. Out-of-town repair cost to the city vehicle in
excess of one hundred dollars ($100.00) must be cleared with the proper
city official before the repair is authorized.
(d) Rental cars. Use of a rental care is not permitted unless it
is less expensive or otherwise more practical than public transportation.
Approval of car rental is generally required in advance by the city
manager. Always request the government or weekend rate, whichever is
cheaper. Anyone who uses a rental car for out of-state travel must obtain
liability coverage from the vendor.
(e) Fines. Fines for traffic or parking violations will not be
reimbursed by the city.
(f) Tolls. Reasonable tolls will be allowed when the most direct
travel route requires them. (as added by Ord. #2017-1013, Nov. 2017)
4-607. Taxi, limousine, and other transportation fares. When an
individual travels by common carrier, reasonable fares will be allowed for
necessary ground transportation. Bus or limousine service to and from airports
should be used when available and practical. The city will reimburse mileage for
travel to and from the local airport and parking fees, provided such costs do not
Change 3, December 19, 2017 4-15
exceed normal taxi/limousine fares to and from the airport. Receipts are
required. For travel between lodging quarters and meetings, conference, or
meals, reasonable taxi fares will be allowed. Remember, original receipts are
required for claims of five dollars ($5.00) or more. Transportation to and from
shopping, entertainment, or other personal trips is the choice of the traveler and
not reimbursable. Reimbursement claims for taxis, limousines, or other ground
transportation must be listed separately on the expense form, claiming the
destination and amount of each fare. (as added by Ord. #2017-1013, Nov. 2017)
4-608. Lodging. (1) The amount allocated for lodging shall not ordinarily
exceed the maximum per diem rates authorized by the state rate schedule.
(2) Tennessee's reimbursement rate varies according to location
and does not include appropriate taxes. State rates for travel
reimbursement can be found in the state regulations online at
https://www.tn.gov/assets/entities/finance/attachments/policy8.pdf.
(3) Original lodging receipts must be submitted with the expense form.
Photocopies are not acceptable.
(4) If a traveler exceeds the maximum lodging per diem, excess costs
are the responsibility of the traveler.
(5) If the best rate is secured, and it still exceeds the maximum lodging
per diem, the supervisor may authorize a higher reimbursement amount. Even
if it costs more, travelers may be allowed to stay at the officially designated
hotel of the meeting; however, more moderately priced accommodations must
be requested whenever possible. It will be the traveler's responsibility to provide
documentation of the "officially designated meeting site" room rates, if these
rates are higher than the normal reimbursable amounts.
(6) If two (2) or more city employees travel together and share a room,
the lodging reimbursement rate will be the maximum of two (2) single rooms.
If an employee shares a room with non-employee, the actual cost will be allowed
up to the maximum reimbursable amount. The receipt for the entire amount
must be submitted with the expense form.(as added by Ord. #2017-1013, Nov.
2017)
4-609. Meals and incidentals. Receipts are not required for meals and
incidentals. The authorized traveler may be reimbursed the daily amount based
on the rate schedule and the authorized length of stay. The per diem meal
amounts are expected to cover meals, tips, porters, and incidental expenses. The
authorized traveler will not be reimbursed more than this. Whether meals may
be claimed depends on when the traveler leaves and returns to the official
station. The traveler's official station is home or work, whichever produces the
least cost to the city. If lunch or dinner is provided as part of a class/training,
but the employee chooses to go on their own, the meal will not be reimbursed.
Change 3, December 19, 2017 4-16
Regardless of which reimbursement rate the city uses, the amounts include tip,
gratuity, not to exceed fifteen (15%) of cost of meal. (as added by Ord.
#2017-1013, Nov. 2017)
4-610. Miscellaneous expenses. (1) Registration fees for approved
conferences, conventions, seminars, meetings, and other educational programs
will be allowed and will generally include the cost of official banquets, meals,
lodging, and registration fees. Registration fees should be specified on the
original travel request form and can include a request for preregistration fee
payment.
(2) An allowance as defined in State of Tennessee guidelines and city
travel policy will be reimbursable for hotel/motel check-in and baggage handling
expenses. (as added by Ord. #2017-1013, Nov. 2017)
4-611. Travel reconciliation. (1) Within ten (10) days of return from
travel, or by the end of the month, the traveler is expected to complete and file
the expense claims form. It must be certified by the traveler that the amount
due is true and accurate. Original lodging, if the city provided a travel advance
or made advanced payment, the traveler should include that information on the
expense form. In the case of advances, the form should have reconciliation
summary, reflecting total claimed expenses with advances and city
pre-payments indicated. The balance due the traveler or the refund due the city
should be clearly shown below the total claim on the form or in a cover memo
attached to the front of the form.
(2) If the traveler received a travel advance and spent less than the
advance, the traveler should attach a check made payable to the city for that
difference.
(3) The city manager will address special circumstances and issues not
covered in this policy on a case-by-case basis. (as added by Ord. #2017-1013,
Nov. 2017)
4-612. Travel violations. Violation of the travel rules can result in
disciplinary action for employees. Travel fraud can result in criminal
prosecution of officials and/or employees. (as added by Ord. #2017-1013, Nov.

9-601. Purpose and findings. 1. Purpose. It is the purpose of this
chapter to regulate sexually oriented businesses and related activities to
promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of the
city, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the
deleterious location and concentration of sexually oriented businesses within the
city. The provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of
imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative
materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the intent
9-21
nor effect of this chapter to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented
materials protected by the first amendment, or to deny access by the
distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended
market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of this chapter to condone or
legitimize the distribution of obscene materials.
2. Findings. Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary
effects of adult uses on the community presented in hearings and in reports
made available to the city commission, and on findings incorporated in the cases
of City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986); Young v.
American Mini Theatres, 426 U.S. 50 (1976); and Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc.,
501 U.S. 560 (1991); Arcara v. Cloud Books, Inc., 478 U.S. 697, (1986); California
v. LaRue, 409 U.S. 109 (1972); Iacobucci v. City of Newport, Ky, 479 U.S. 92
(1986); United States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367 (1968); DLS, Inc.v. City of
Chattanooga, 107 F.3d 403 (6th Cir. 1997); Kev, Inc. v Kitsap County, 793 F 2nd
1053 (9th Cir. 1986); Hang On, Inc. v. City of Arlington, 65 F.3d 1248 (5th Cir.
1995); and South Florida Free Beaches, Inc. v. City of Miami, 734 F.2d 608 (11th
Cir. 1984); as well as studies conducted in other cities including, but not limited
to, Phoenix, Arizona; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Houston, Texas; Indianapolis,
Indiana; Amarillo, Texas; Garden Grove, California; Los Angeles, California;
Whittier, California, Austin, Texas; Seattle, Washington; Oklahoma City,
Oklahoma; Cleveland, Ohio; and Beaumont, Texas; and findings reported in the
Final Report of the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (1986), the
Report of the Attorney General's Working Group on the Regulation of Sexually
Oriented Businesses (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota), and statistics obtained
from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, the city commission finds that:
a. Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary
unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the
operators of the establishments. Further, there is presently no
mechanism to make owners of these establishments responsible for the
activities that occur on their premises.
b. Crime statistics show that all types of crimes, especially sexrelated
crimes, occur with more frequency in neighborhoods where
sexually oriented businesses are located. See, e.g., Studies of the cities
of Phoenix, Arizona; Indianapolis, Indiana; and Austin, Texas.
c. Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex,
occur at sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide
private or semi-private booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live
sex shows. See e.g. California v. LaRue, 409 U.S. 109, 111 (1972); See
also Final Report of the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography
(1986) at 377.
d. Offering and providing such booths and/or cubicles
encourages such activities, which creates unhealthy conditions. See, e.g.,
9-22
Final Report of the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography
(1986) at 376-77.
e. Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades, and
other sexually oriented businesses, for the purpose of engaging in sex
within the premises of such sexually oriented business. See e.g., Arcara
v. Cloud Books, Inc., 478 U.S. 697, 698 (1986); see also Final Report of the
Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (1986) at 376-77.
f. At least fifty (50) communicable diseases may be spread by
activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses including, but not
limited to, syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection
(HIV-AIDS), genital herpes, hepatitis B, Non A, Non B amebiasis,
salmonella infections, and shigella infections. See e.g. Study of Fort
Meyers, Florida.
g. For the period of 1985 through 1995, the total number of
reported cases of AIDS in the United States caused by immunodeficiency
virus (HIV) was 523,056. See e.g., Statistics of the U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
h. As of February 28, 1993, there have been 2,521 reported
cases of AIDS in the State of Tennessee.
i. Since 1981 and to the present, there has been an increasing
cumulative number of persons testing positive for HIV antibody test in
Tennessee.
j. The total number of cases of early (less than one year)
syphilis in the United States reported during the ten year period 1985-
1995 was 367,796. See e.g. Statistics of the U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
k. The number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States
reported annually remains at a high level, with a total of 1,250,581 cases
reported during the period 1993-1995. See e.g., Statistics of the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention.
l. The surgeon general of the United States in his report of
October 22, 1986, advised the American public that AIDS and HIV
infection may be transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug
use, exposure to infected blood and blood components, and from an
infected mother to her newborn.
m. According to the best scientific evidence available, AIDS and
HIV infection, as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally
transmitted by sexual acts. See, e.g., Findings of the U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
n. Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are
unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy,
and, in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the
failure of the owners and operators of the facilities to self-regulate those
9-23
activities and maintain those facilities. See, e.g., Final Report of the
Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (1986) at 377.
o. Numerous studies and reports have determined that bodily
fluids, including semen and urine, are found in the areas of sexually
oriented businesses where persons view "adult" oriented films. See, e.g.,
Final Report of the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography
(1986) at 377.
p. Nude and semi-nude dancing in adult establishments
encourages prostitution, increases sexual assaults, and attracts other
criminal activity. See, e.g., Barnes v. Glen Theatre, 501 U.S. 560, 583
(1991).
q. Nude and semi-nude dancing in adult establishments
increases the likelihood of drug-dealing and drug use. See, e.g. Kev, Inc.
v. Kitsap County, 793 F.2d 1053, 1056 (9th Cir. 1986).
r. The findings noted in subsections (a) through (q) raise
substantial governmental concerns.
s. Sexually oriented businesses have operational
characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect
those substantial government concerns.
t. A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate
mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the
owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses. Further,
such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore non-existent incentive
on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a
manner consistent with the health, safety, and welfare of its patrons and
employees, as well as the citizens of the city. It is appropriate to require
reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the
sexually oriented business, fully in possession and control of the premises
and activities occurring therein.
u. Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient
lighting on the premises with adult booths advances a substantial
governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual
activity occurring in adult establishments.
v. The disclosure of certain information by those persons
ultimately responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of
the sexually oriented business, where such information is substantially
related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such
uses, will aid in preventing the spreading of sexually transmitted
diseases and criminal activity.
w. It is desirable in the prevention of the spread of
communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information
regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct this chapter
is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity.
9-24
x. The fact than an applicant for a sexually oriented business
license has been convicted of a sex-related crime leads to the rational
assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in
contravention to this chapter.
y. The barring of such individuals from operation or
employment in sexually oriented businesses for a period of ten (10) years
for a previous felony conviction serves as a deterrent to and prevents
conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases.
z. The general welfare, health, morals, and safety of the
citizens of this city will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter.

disconnection is made, a notice shall be attached to the piping, fixture, or
appliance disconnected by the inspector, which notice shall state that the same
has been disconnected by the inspector, together with the reason or reasons
therefor, and it shall be unlawful for any person to remove said notice or
reconnect said gas piping or fixture or appliance without authorization by the
inspector and such gas piping or fixture or appliance shall not be put in service
or used until the inspector has attached his certificate of approval in lieu of his
prior disconnection notice.

by the permit has been installed and after all portions thereof which are to be
12-10
concealed by plastering or otherwise have been so concealed, and before any
fixtures or gas appliances have been attached thereto. This inspection shall
include a pressure test, at which time the piping shall stand an air pressure
equal to not less than the pressure of a column of mercury twelve (12) inches in
height, and the piping shall hold this air pressure for a period of at least fifteen
(15) minutes without any perceptible drop. A mercury column gauge shall be
used for the test. All tools, apparatus, labor, and assistance necessary for the
test shall be furnished by the installer of such piping. (1984 Code, § 4-408)

property or is a utility transmitting communications, electricity, gas, liquids,
13-3
steam, sewage, or other materials), excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal
holidays. The notice shall be sent by registered or certified United States Mail,
addressed to the last known address of the owner of record. The notice shall
state that the owner of the property is entitled to a hearing, and shall, at the
minimum, contain the following additional information:
(a) A brief statement that the owner is in violation of § 13-104
of the Mount Pleasant Municipal Code, which has been enacted under the
authority of Tennessee Code Annotated, § 6-54-113, and that the property

(b) The person, office, address, and telephone number of the
department or person giving the notice;
(c) A cost estimate for remedying the noted condition, which
shall be in conformity with the standards of cost in the city; and
(d) A place wherein the notified party may return a copy of the
notice, indicating the desire for a hearing.

section shall immediately cause the condition to be remedied or removed at a

costs shall be a lien on the property in favor of the municipality, second only to
liens of the state, county, and municipality for taxes, any lien of the municipality
for special assessments, and any valid lien, right, or interest in such property
duly recorded or duly perfected by filing, prior to the filing of such notice. These
costs shall be placed on the tax rolls of the municipality as a lien and shall be
added to property tax bills to be collected at the same time and in the same

designated by the board of commissioners to enforce the provisions of this
section shall immediately cause the condition to be remedied or removed at a
cost in accordance with reasonable standards in the community, with these costs
to be assessed against the owner of the property. The provisions of subsection
(4) shall apply to the collection of costs against the owner of an owner-occupied
residential property except that the municipality must wait until cumulative
charges for remediation equal or exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00) before
filing the notice with the register of deeds and the charges becoming a lien on
the property. After this threshold has been met and the lien attaches, charges
for costs for which the lien attached are collectible as provided in subsection (4)
for these charges.
(6) Appeal. The owner of record who is aggrieved by the determination
and order of the public officer may appeal the determination and order to the
board of commissioners. The appeal shall be filed with the city recorder within
ten (10) days following the receipt of the notice issued pursuant to subsection (3)
above. The failure to appeal within this time shall, without exception, constitute
a waiver of the right to a hearing.
(7) Judicial review. Any person aggrieved by an order or act of the
board of commissioners under subsection (4) above may seek judicial review of
the order or act. The time period established in subsection (3) above shall be
stayed during the pendency of judicial review.
(8) Supplemental nature of this section. The provisions of this section
are in addition and supplemental to, and not in substitution for, any other
provision in the municipal charter, this municipal code of ordinances or other
applicable law which permits the city to proceed against an owner, tenant or
occupant of property who has created, maintained, or permitted to be

allow these items to accumulate upon public property immediately adjacent to

and the public streets or alleyways upon which the property fronts. It is the
responsibility of all owners and occupants of private property to keep abutting

accumulation upon the property of garbage, trash, rubbish or other refuse in any
form or nature, other than as authorized for city pick-up and disposal. All such

commission, a plat of which is of record with the register of deeds) or tracts that
are being used for current agricultural purposes. Property not exempt due to its
size or the active practice of agriculture which is contiguous to parcel(s) of land
that front on public streets or roadways, or contain any improvements shall be

rights-of-way as to obstruct the view of a person driving in the roadway or
otherwise constitute a hazard to vehicular and/or pedestrian traffic. Failure of
owners of property adjoining the rights-of-way or owners of property upon which
the vegetation exists to trim or remove it is guilty of a violation of this chapter.
(Ord. #2009-898, Oct. 2009)

streets, ingress and egress, off-street parking and loading
space, and other requirements and amenities.

commission may suggest changes in the preliminary plan as a condition
for planning commission approval.

8.400 M-3, SPECIAL IMPACT INDUSTRIAL.
A. District Description and Purpose.
This district is designed to provide suitable areas for those uses
which have some special impact or uniqueness such that their
effect on the surrounding area and environment cannot be
determined in advance of the use being proposed for a particular
location. At the time the application is filed, a review of the
14-100
location, design configuration and its impact will be conducted by
comparing the proposed use, the preliminary development plan,
the operational data, and the environmental assessments to the
site location criteria. This review will evaluate whether the
proposed use should be permitted through a rezoning to the M-3,
Special Impact Industrial District, by weighing public need for and
benefit to be derived from against the local impacts which it may
cause.
The review considers the proposal in terms of existing zoning and
land use in the vicinity of the site, planned and proposed public
and private developments which may be adversely affected by the
proposed use, whether the proposed location is the most desirable
site for this type of use, and to what extent the public health,
safety, and general welfare of the citizens of Mount Pleasant will
be affected.
B. Site Location Criteria.
1. The proposed site will be located in areas apart from
concentrations of residential developments and community
facilities where concentrations of people will be present.
2. The proposed use will not pollute or deteriorate air quality,
surface or subterranean water, or any other natural
features.
3. The proposed site will not be located in an area that could
contaminate the source of an existing public water supply.
4. The proposed site will be free of sinkholes, caves, caverns,
or other karst features that would present significant
potential for surface collapse or significant degradation to
local ground water resources.
5. The proposed site will be adequately served by public
utilities and services to ensure a safe operation.
6. The proposed use will not result in the transportation of
dangerous products or wastes through areas of population

9.102 Findings of Fact.
The City of Mount Pleasant, Tennessee Board of Commissioners wishes to
establish eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) and in
order to do so must meet the NFIP regulations found in title 44 of the Code of
Federal Regulations (CFR), ch. 1, section 60.3.
Areas of the City of Mount Pleasant, Tennessee are subject to periodic
inundation which could result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
Flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains,
causing increases in flood heights and velocities; by uses in flood hazard areas
which are vulnerable to floods; or construction which is inadequately elevated,
flood proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
Change 3, December 19, 2017 14-113
9.103 Statement of Purpose.
It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions
in specific areas. This ordinance is designed to:
9.103.1 Restrict or prohibit uses which are vulnerable to flooding or
erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
erosion, flood heights, or velocities;
9.103.2 Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including community
facilities, be protected against flood damage at the time of
initial construction;
9.103.3 Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream
channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved
in the accommodation of floodwaters;
9.103.4 Control filling, grading, dredging and other development
which may increase flood damage or erosion;
9.103.5. Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase
flood hazards to other lands.
9.104 Objectives.
The objectives of this ordinance are:
9.104.1 To protect human life, health, safety and property;
9.104.2 To minimize expenditure of public funds for costly flood
control projects;
9.104.3 To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated
with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of
the general public;
9.104.4 To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
9.104.5 To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as
water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines,
streets and bridges located in flood prone areas;
Change 3, December 19, 2017 14-114
9.104.6 To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the
sound use and development of flood prone areas to minimize
blight in flood areas;
9.104.7 To ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that
property is in a flood prone area;

construction and substantial improvement of any commercial,
industrial, or non-residential building, shall have the lowest floor,
including basement, elevated or floodproofed to no lower than
three feet (3') above the highest adjacent grade (as defined in
§ 9.200).
Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a
structure, openings sufficient to facilitate equalization of flood
hydrostatic forces on both sides of exterior walls shall be provided
in accordance with the standards of this section: "enclosures."
Non-residential buildings located in all A Zones may be flood
proofed, in lieu of being elevated, provided that all areas of the
building below the required elevation are watertight, with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and are built
with structural components having the capability of resisting
hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy.
A Tennessee registered professional engineer or architect shall
certify that the design and methods of construction are in
accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the
provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the
administrator as set forth in § 9.402.
9.502.3 Enclosures
All new construction and substantial improvements that include
fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls
below the lowest floor that are subject to flooding, shall be
designed to preclude finished living space and designed to allow for
the entry and exit of flood waters to automatically equalize
hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls.
a. Designs for complying with this requirement must either be
certified by a Tennessee professional engineer or architect
or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria.
1) Provide a minimum of two (2) openings having a total
net area of not less than one (1) square inch for every
square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
2) The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than
one foot (1') above the finished grade;
Change 3, December 19, 2017 14-132
3) Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers,
valves or other coverings or devices provided they
permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both
directions.
b. The enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow
for parking of vehicles, storage or building access.
c. The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be
finished or partitioned into separate rooms in such a way as
to impede the movement of floodwaters and all such
partitions shall comply with the provisions of § 9.502.
9.502.4 Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles
a. All manufactured homes placed, or substantially improved,
on: (1) individual lots or parcels, (2) in expansions to
existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or (3) in
new or substantially improved manufactured home parks or
subdivisions, must meet all the requirements of new
construction.
b. All manufactured homes placed or substantially improved
in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision must
be elevated so that either:
1) In AE Zones, with base flood elevations, the lowest
floor of the manufactured home is elevated on a
permanent foundation to no lower than one foot (1')
above the level of the base flood elevation or
2) In approximate A Zones, without base flood
elevations, the manufactured home chassis is
elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other
foundation elements of at least equivalent strength)
that are at least three feet (3') in height above the
highest adjacent grade (as defined in § 9.200).
c. Any manufactured home, which has incurred "substantial
damage" as the result of a flood, must meet the standards of
§§ 9.501 and 9.502.
Change 3, December 19, 2017 14-133
d. All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an
adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation,
collapse and lateral movement.
e. All recreational vehicles placed in an identified special flood
hazard area must either:
1) Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty
(180) consecutive days;
2) Be fully licensed and ready for highway use (a
recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is
licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to
the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and
security devices, and has no permanently attached
structures or additions), or;
3) The recreational vehicle must meet all the
requirements for new construction.
9.503 Standards for subdivisions and other pro-posed new development
proposals.
Subdivisions and other proposed new developments, including
manufactured home parks, shall be reviewed to determine whether such
proposals will be reasonably safe from flooding.
a. All subdivision and other proposed new development
proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize
flood damage.
b. All subdivision and other proposed new development
proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as
sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and
constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage.
c. All subdivision and other proposed new development
proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce
exposure to flood hazards.
d. In all approximate A Zones require that all new subdivision
proposals and other proposed developments (including
proposals for manufactured home parks and subdivisions)
greater than fifty (50) lots or five (5) acres, whichever is the
Change 3, December 19, 2017 14-134
lesser, include within such proposals base flood elevation
data (see § 9.505).
9.504 Standards for special flood hazard areas with established base flood
elevations and with floodways designated
Located within the special flood hazard areas established in § 9.302, are
areas designated as floodways. A floodway may be an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, debris or erosion
potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in
order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood
heights and velocities. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply:
9.504.1 Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill
material, new construction, substantial improvements or
other development within the regulatory floodway.
Development may be permitted however, provided it is
demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses
performed in accordance with standard engineering
practices that the cumulative effect of the proposed
encroachments or new development shall not result in any
increase in the water surface elevation of the Base Flood
Elevation, velocities, or floodway widths during the
occurrence of a base flood discharge at any point within the
community. A Tennessee registered professional engineer
must provide supporting technical data, using the same
methodologies as in the effective flood insurance study for
the City of Mount Pleasant, Tennessee and certification,
thereof.
9.504.2 New construction and substantial improvements of
buildings, where permitted, shall comply with all applicable
flood hazard reduction provisions of §§ 9.501 and 9.502.
9.505 Standards for areas of special flood hazard zones AE with established
base flood elevations but without floodways designated
Located within the special flood hazard areas established in § 9.302,
where streams exist with base flood data provided but where no
floodways have been designated (Zones AE), the following provisions
apply:
9.505.1 No encroachments, including fill material, new construction
and substantial improvements shall be located within areas
Change 3, December 19, 2017 14-135
of special flood hazard, unless certification by a Tennessee
registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating
that the cumulative effect of the proposed development,
when combined with all other existing and anticipated
development, will not increase the water surface elevation
of the base flood more than one foot (1') at any point within
the community. The engineering certification should be
supported by technical data that conforms to standard
hydraulic engineering principles.
9.505.2 New construction and substantial improvements of
buildings, where permitted, shall comply with all applicable
flood hazard reduction provisions of §§ 9.501 and 9.502.
9.506 Standards for streams without established base flood elevations and
Floodways (A Zones)
Located within the special flood hazard areas established in § 9.302,
where streams exist, but no base flood data has been provided and where
a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions shall apply:
9.506.1 The administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably
utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available
from any federal, state, or other sources, including data
developed as a result of these regulations (see 9.502 below),
as criteria for requiring that new construction, substantial
improvements, or other development in approximate A
Zones meet the requirements of §§ 9.501 and 9.502.
9.506.2 Require that all new subdivision proposals and other
proposed developments (including proposals for
manufactured home parks and subdivisions) greater than
fifty (50) lots or five (5) acres, whichever is the lesser,
include within such proposals base flood elevation data.
9.506.3 Within approximate A Zones, where base flood elevations
have not been established and where such data is not
available from other sources, require the lowest floor of a
building to be elevated or flood proofed to a level of at least
three feet (3') above the highest adjacent grade (as defined
in § 9.200). All applicable data including elevations or
floodproofing certifications shall be recorded as set forth in
§ 9.402. Openings sufficient to facilitate automatic
equalization of hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls
Change 3, December 19, 2017 14-136
shall be provided in accordance with the standards of
§ 9.502.
9.506.4 Within approximate A Zones, where base flood elevations
have not been established and where such data is not
available from other sources, no encroachments, including
structures or fill material, shall be located within an area
equal to the width of the stream or twenty feet (20'),
whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream
bank, unless certification by a Tennessee registered
professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the
cumulative effect of the proposed development, when
combined with all other existing and anticipated
development, will not increase the water surface elevation
of the base flood more than one foot (1') at any point within
the City of Mount Pleasant, Tennessee. The engineering
certification should be supported by technical data that
conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles.
9.506.5 New construction and substantial improvements of
buildings, where permitted, shall comply with all applicable
flood hazard reduction provisions of §§ 9.501 and 9.502.
Within approximate A Zones, require that those subsections
of § 9.502 dealing with the alteration or relocation of a
watercourse, assuring watercourse carrying capacities are
maintained and manufactured homes provisions are
complied with as required.
9.507 Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO and AH Zones)
Located within the special flood hazard areas established in § 9.302, are
areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have special flood
hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet
(1' - 3')where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path
of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; therefore, the following
provisions, in addition to those set forth in §§ 9.501 and 9.502, apply:
9.507.1 All new construction and substantial improvements of
residential and non-residential buildings shall have the
lowest floor, including basement, elevated to at least one
foot (1') above as many feet as the depth number specified
on the FIRMs, in feet, above the highest adjacent grade. If
no flood depth number is specified on the FIRM, the lowest
floor, including basement, shall be elevated to at least three
Change 3, December 19, 2017 14-137
feet (3') above the highest adjacent grade. Openings
sufficient to facilitate automatic equalization of hydrostatic
flood forces on exterior walls shall be provided in accordance
with standards of § 9.502.
9.507.2 All new construction and substantial improvements of
non-residential buildings may be floodproofed in lieu of
elevation. The structure together with attendant utility and
sanitary facilities must be floodproofed and designed
watertight to be completely flood proofed to at least one foot
(1') above the flood depth number specified on the FIRM,
with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of
water and with structural components having the capability
of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the
effects of buoyancy. If no depth number is specified on the
FIRM, the structure shall be floodproofed to at least three
feet (3') above the highest adjacent grade. A Tennessee
registered professional engineer or architect shall certify
that the design and methods of construction are in
accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting
the provisions of this ordinance and shall provide such
certification to the administrator as set forth above and as
required in accordance with § 9.402.
9.507.3 Adequate drainage paths shall be provided around slopes to
guide floodwaters around and away from proposed
structures.
9.508 Standards for areas protected by flood protection system (A-99 Zones)
Located within the Areas of Special Flood Hazard established in § 9.302,
are areas of the 100-year floodplain protected by a flood protection system
but where base flood elevations have not been determined. Within these
areas (A-99 Zones) all provisions of §§ 9.400 and 9.500 shall apply.
9.509 Standards for unmapped streams
Located within the City of Mount Pleasant, Tennessee, are unmapped
streams where areas of special flood hazard are neither indicated nor
identified. Adjacent to such streams, the following provisions shall apply:
9.509.1 No encroachments including fill material or other
development including structures shall be located within an
area of at least equal to twice the width of the stream,
Change 3, December 19, 2017 14-138
measured from the top of each stream bank, unless
certification by a Tennessee registered professional engineer
is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the
proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, will not increase the
water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot
(1') at any point within the locality.
9.509.2 When a new flood hazard risk zone, and base flood elevation
and floodway data is available, new construction
and substantial improvements shall meet the standards
established in accordance with §§ 9.400 and 9.500.

granting of variances, as it deems necessary to
effectuate the purposes of this ordinance.
5) Variances shall not be issued within any designated
floodway if any increase in flood levels during the
base flood discharge would result.
9.602 Conditions for variances
9.602.1 Variances shall be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum relief necessary, considering the
flood hazard and the factors listed in § 9.601.
9.602.2 Variances shall only be issued upon: a showing of good and
sufficient cause, a determination that failure to grant the
variance would result in exceptional hardship; or a
determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public
safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with
existing local laws or ordinances.
9.602.3 Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the issuance of a variance to construct a
structure below the base flood elevation will result in
increased premium rates for flood insurance (as high as
twenty five dollars ($25.00) for one hundred dollars
($100.00)) coverage, and that such construction below the
base flood elevation increases risks to life and property. The

having first obtained a permit as herein required, and without complying with
the provisions of this chapter; and it shall also be unlawful to violate, or vary
from, the terms of any such permit; provided, however, any person maintaining
pipes, lines, or other underground facilities in or under the surface of any street

practicably be obtained beforehand. The person shall thereafter apply for a

date when the work was begun. (1984 Code, § 12-201)
16-202. Applications. Applications for such permits shall be made to

388, 340 S.W.2d 885 (1960).
16-5
16-203. Fee. The fee for such permits shall be two dollars ($2.00) for
excavations which do not exceed twenty-five (25) square feet in area or tunnels
not exceeding twenty-five (25) feet in length; and twenty-five cents ($.25) for
each additional square foot in the case of excavations, or lineal foot in the case

(1984 Code, § 12-203)
16-204. Deposit or bond. No such permit shall be issued unless and
until the applicant therefor has deposited with the recorder a cash deposit. The
deposit shall be in the sum of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) if no pavement is
involved or seventy-five dollars ($75.00) if the excavation is in a paved area and
shall insure the proper restoration of the ground and laying of the pavement, if
any. Where the amount of the deposit is clearly inadequate to cover the cost of
restoration, the recorder may increase the amount of the deposit to an amount
considered by him to be adequate to cover the cost. From this deposit shall be
deducted the expense to the city of relaying the surface of the ground or
pavement, and of making the refill if this is done by the city or at its expense.
The balance shall be returned to the applicant without interest after the tunnel
or excavation is completely refilled and the surface or pavement is restored.
In lieu of a deposit the applicant may deposit with the recorder a surety
bond in such form and amount as the recorder shall deem adequate to cover the
costs to the city if the applicant fails to make proper restoration. (1984 Code,
§ 12-204)

excavation or tunnel shall do so according to the terms and conditions of the
application and permit authorizing the work to be done. Sufficient and proper
barricades and lights shall be maintained to protect persons and property from
injury by or because of the excavation being made. If any sidewalk is blocked
by any such work, a temporary sidewalk shall be constructed and provided
which shall be safe for travel and convenient for users. (1984 Code, § 12-205)
16-206. Restoration of streets, etc. Any person, firm, corporation,
association, or others making any excavation or tunnel in or under any street,
alley, or public place in this city shall restore said street, alley, or public place
to its original condition except for the surfacing, which shall be done by the city,
but shall be paid for by such person, firm, corporation, association, or others
promptly upon the completion of the work for which the excavation or tunnel
was made. In case of unreasonable delay in restoring the street, alley, or public
place, the recorder shall give notice to the person, firm, corporation, association,
or others that unless the excavation or tunnel is refilled properly within a
specified reasonable period of time, the city will do the work and charge the
expense of doing the same to such person, firm, corporation, association, or
others. If within the specified time the conditions of the above notice have not
16-6
been complied with, the work shall be done by the city, an accurate account of
the expense involved shall be kept, and the total cost shall be charged to the
person, firm, corporation, association, or others who made the excavation or tunnel.
(1984 Code, § 12-206)
16-207. Insurance. In addition to making the deposit or giving the bond
hereinbefore required to insure that proper restoration is made, each person
applying for an excavation permit shall file a certificate of insurance indicating
that he is insured against claims for damages for personal injury as well as
against claims for property damage which may arise from or out of the
performance of the work, whether such performance be by himself, his
subcontractor, or anyone directly or indirectly employed by him. Such insurance
shall cover collapse, explosive hazards, and underground work by equipment on
the street, and shall include protection against liability arising from completed
operations. The amount of the insurance shall be prescribed by the recorder in
accordance with the nature of the risk involved; provided, however, that the
liability insurance for bodily injury shall not be less than three hundred
thousand dollars ($300,000.00) for bodily injury or death of any one (1) person
in any one (1) accident, occurrence or act, and not less than seven hundred
thousand dollars ($700,000.00) for bodily injury or death of all persons in any
one (1) accident, occurrence or act, and one hundred thousand dollars
($100,000.00) for injury or destruction of property of others in any one (1)
accident, occurrence, or act. (1984 Code, § 12-207, modified)
16-208. Time limits. Each application for a permit shall state the
length of time it is estimated will elapse from the commencement of the work
until the restoration of the surface of the ground or pavement, or until the refill
is made ready for the pavement to be put on by the city if the city restores such
surface pavement. It shall be unlawful to fail to comply with this time
limitation unless permission for an extension of time is granted by the recorder.
(1984 Code, § 12-208)
16-209. Supervision. The recorder shall from time to time inspect all
excavations and tunnels being made in or under any public street, alley, or other
public place in the city and see to the enforcement of the provisions of this
chapter. Notice shall be given to him at least ten (10) hours before the work of
refilling any such excavation or tunnel commences. (1984 Code, § 12-209)
16-210. Driveway curb cuts. No one shall cut, build, or maintain a
driveway across a curb or sidewalk without first obtaining a permit from the
recorder. Such a permit will not be issued when the contemplated driveway is
to be so located or constructed as to create an unreasonable hazard to pedestrian
and/or vehicular traffic. No driveway shall exceed thirty-five (35) feet in width
at its outer or street edge and when two (2) or more adjoining driveways are
provided for the same property a safety island of not less than ten (10) feet in
16-7
width at its outer or street edge shall be provided. Driveway aprons shall not
extend out into the street. (1984 Code, § 12-210)

sidewalk improvement and maintenance program set forth in §§ 16-301 and
16-302 hereof wherein the city identifies, on an annual basis, sidewalk

percent (100%) of the costs for the labor associated with said repairs and/or
improvement. Material costs must be paid in full by the property owner prior to

by case basis, regarding requested improvements and/or repairs. In the event

same for bids. Upon receipt of bids and prior to the acceptance of the lowest
qualified bid, the material cost from property owner will be due. (Ord. #90-718,

premise, duplex unit, apartment or other multiple dwelling unit served. The
water charge of each such dwelling, premise, duplex unit, apartment or other
multiple dwelling unit thus served shall be computed just as if each such
dwelling, premise, duplex unit, apartment or other multiple dwelling unit had
received through a separately metered service the amount of water so allocated
to it, such computation to be made at the city's applicable water rates schedule,
including the provisions as to minimum bills. The separate charges for each
dwelling, premise, duplex unit, apartment or other multiple dwelling unit

(2) The customer's bill should be paid on or before the fifteenth day of
each month in order to receive the net price on the monthly bill. Payments
received after the fifteenth of each month, but prior to the twenty-fifth of each
month, will incur a ten percent (10%) late penalty charge.
(3) If a customer fails to make payment by the twenty-fifth of each

Change 2, September 17, 2017 18-6
weeks from said date. A request for a payment extension is limited to two (2) per
year if based upon justifiable cause and a second request may not be made while
an extension is in effect. Failure to abide with the terms and conditions of a
payment extension request shall disqualify a customer from receiving another
extension.
(6) If a meter fails to register properly, or if a meter is removed to be
tested or repaired, or if water is received other than through a meter, the city
reserves the right to render an estimated bill based on the best information

requirements for the disposal of wastewater in the service area of the City of
Mount Pleasant, Tennessee wastewater treatment system. The objectives of this
chapter are:
(1) To protect the public health;
(2) To provide problem free wastewater collection and treatment
service;
(3) To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the municipal
wastewater treatment system, which will interfere with the system operation,
which will cause the system discharge to violate its National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit or other applicable state
requirements, or which will cause physical damage to the wastewater treatment
system facilities;
(4) To provide for full and equitable distribution of the cost of the
wastewater treatment system;
(5) To enable the city to comply with the provisions of the Federal
Water Pollution Control Act, the General Pretreatment Regulations (40 C.F.R.
part 403), and the Tennessee Water Quality Control Act, Tennessee Code
Annotated, § 69-3-123, et seq.;
(6) To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewaters and
sludges from the wastewater treatment system.
In meeting these objectives, this chapter provides that all persons in the
service area of the city must have adequate wastewater treatment either in the
form of a connection to the municipal wastewater treatment system or, where
Change 1, September 20, 2011 18-14
the system is not available, an appropriate private disposal system. The chapter
also provides for the issuance of permits to system users, for the regulations of
wastewater discharge volume and characteristics, for monitoring and
enforcement activities, and for the setting of fees for the full and equitable
distribution of costs resulting from the operation, maintenance, and capital
recovery of the wastewater treatment system and from other activities required
by the enforcement and administrative program established herein.

degrees (104E) Fahrenheit).
(m) In regards to slug discharges, 40 C.F.R. part 403.8(t)(2)(vi)
requires all POTWs to evaluate each industry's need to develop a slug
control plan. The pretreatment coordinator will determine this need for
each individual industry during his annual inspection of industries, and
for new industries during his initial inspection of the new industry.
Mount Pleasant POTW will accept non-routine batch discharges as long
as the user gets approval from the system manager prior to discharging
and controls the release. See "slug discharge" definition in § 18-202(50).

POTW developing a POTW pretreatment program pursuant to Tennessee
Rule 1200-4-14-.08 shall develop and enforce specific limits to implement
the prohibitions listed in § 18-207(1). Each POTW with an approved
pretreatment program shall continue to develop these limits as necessary
and effectively enforce such limits.
(b) All other POTWs shall, in cases where pollutants
contributed by user(s) result in interference or pass through, and such
violation is likely to recur, develop and enforce specific effluent limits for
industrial user(s), and all other users, as appropriate, which together
with appropriate changes in the POTW treatment plant's facilities or
operation, are necessary to ensure renewed and continued compliance
with the POTW's NPDES permit or sludge use or disposal practices.
Change 1, September 20, 2011 18-34
(c) Specific effluent limits shall not be developed and enforced
without individual notice to persons or groups who have requested such
notice and an opportunity to respond.
(d) POTWs may develop Best Management Practices (BMPs) to
implement subsections (a) and (b) of this section. Such BMPs shall be
considered local limits and pretreatment standards for the purposes of
this rule chapter.
(3) Local limits. Where specific prohibitions or limits on pollutant
parameters are developed by a POTW in accordance with § 18-207(2), such
limits shall be deemed pretreatment standards for the purposes of this rule
chapter. See Table A - User Discharge Restrictions for current local limits.
(4) Restrictions on wastewater strength. No person or user shall
discharge wastewater which exceeds the set of standards provided in § 18-207,
Table B - Plant Protection Criteria, unless specifically allowed by their discharge
permit local limits (§ 18-207, Table A - User Discharge Restrictions). Dilution
of any wastewater discharge for the purpose of satisfying these requirements
shall be considered in violation of this chapter.
(5) Fats, oils and grease traps and interceptors. (a) Fat, Oil, and
Grease (FOG), waste food, and sand interceptors. FOG, waste food and
sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion of the system
manager, they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes
containing fats, oils, and grease, any flammable wastes, ground food
waste, sand, soil, and solids, or other harmful ingredients in excessive
amount which impact the wastewater collection system. Such
interceptors shall not be required for single family residences, but may
be required on multiple family residences. All interceptors shall be of a
type and capacity approved by the system manager, and shall be located
as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection.
(b) Fat, oil, grease, and food waste. (i) New construction and
renovation. Upon construction or renovation, all restaurants,
cafeterias, hotels, motels, hospitals, nursing homes, schools,
grocery stores, prisons, jails, churches, camps, caterers, plants and
any other sewer users who discharge applicable waste shall submit
a FOG and food waste control plan that will effectively control the
discharge of FOG and food waste.
(ii) Existing structures. All existing restaurants,
cafeterias, hotels, motels, hospitals, nursing homes, schools,
grocery stores, prisons, jails, churches, camps, caterers,
manufacturing plants and any other sewer users who discharge
applicable waste shall be required to submit a plan for control of
FOG and food waste, if and when the system manager determines
that FOG and food waste are causing excessive loading, plugging,
damage or potential problems to structures or equipment in the
public sewer system.
Change 1, September 20, 2011 18-35
(iii) Implementation of plan. After approval of the FOG
plan by the system manager the sewer user must:
(A) Implement the plan within a reasonable
amount of time;
(B) Service and maintain the equipment in order
to prevent adverse impact upon the sewer collection system
and treatment facility. If in the opinion of the system
manager the user continues to impact the collection system
and treatment plan, additional pretreatment may be
required, including a requirement to meet numeric limits
and have surcharges applied.
(c) Sand, soil, and oil interceptors. All car washes, truck
washes, garages, service stations and other sources of sand, soil, and oil
shall install effective sand, soil, and oil interceptors. These interceptors
shall be sized to effectively remove sand, soil, and oil at the expected flow
rates. The interceptors shall be cleaned on a regular basis to prevent
impact upon the wastewater collection and treatment system. Owners
whose interceptors are deemed to be ineffective by the system manager
may be asked to change the cleaning frequency or to increase the size of
the interceptors. Owners or operators of washing facilities will prevent
the inflow of rainwater into the sanitary sewers.
(d) Laundries. Commercial laundries shall be equipped with an
interceptor with a wire basket or similar device, removable for cleaning,
that prevents passage into the sewer system of solids one-half inch (1/2")
or larger in size such as strings, rags, buttons, or other solids detrimental
to the system.
(e) Control equipment. The equipment of facilities installed to
control FOG, food waste, sand and soil, must be designed in accordance
with the International Plumbing Code and Tennessee Department of
Environment and Conservation engineering standards. Underground
equipment shall be tightly sealed to prevent inflow of rainwater and
easily accessible to allow regular maintenance. Control equipment shall
be maintained by the owner or operator of the facility so as to prevent a
stoppage of the public sewer, and the accumulation of FOG in the lines,
pump stations and treatment plant. If the city is required to clean out the
public sewer lines as a result of a stoppage resulting from poorly
maintained control equipment, the property owner shall be required to
refund the labor, equipment, materials and overhead costs to the city.
Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prohibit or restrict any
other remedy the city has under this chapter, or state or federal law.
The city retains the right to inspect and approve installation of
control equipment.
Change 1, September 20, 2011 18-36
(f) The system manager may use industrial wastewater
discharge permits under § 18-206 to regulate the discharge of fat, oil and
grease.

(7) Federal categorical pretreatment standards. Upon the
promulgation of the federal categorical pretreatment standards for a particular
Change 1, September 20, 2011 18-39
industrial subcategory, the federal standard, if more stringent than limitations
imposed under this chapter for sources in that subcategory, shall immediately
supersede the limitations imposed under this chapter. The pretreatment
coordinator shall notify all affected users of the applicable reporting
requirements under 40 C.F.R., section 403.12.
(8) Right to establish more restrictive criteria. No statement in this
chapter is intended or may be construed to prohibit the pretreatment
coordinator from establishing specific wastewater discharge criteria more
restrictive where wastes are determined to be harmful or destructive to the
facilities of the POTW or to create a public nuisance, or to cause the discharge
of the POTW to violate effluent or stream quality standards, or to interfere with
the use or handling of sludge, or to pass through the POTW resulting in a
violation of the NPDES permit, or to exceed industrial pretreatment standards
for discharge to municipal wastewater treatment systems as imposed or as may
be imposed by the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation
and/or the United States Environmental Protection Agency.
(9) Accidental discharges. (a) Protection from accidental discharge.
All industrial users shall provide such facilities and institute such
procedures as are reasonably necessary to prevent or minimize the
potential for accidental discharge into the POTW of waste regulated by
this chapter from liquid or raw material storage areas, from truck and
rail car loading and unloading areas, from in-plant transfer or processing
and materials handling areas, and from diked areas or holding ponds of
any waste regulated by this chapter. Detailed plans showing the facilities
and operating procedures shall be submitted to the pretreatment
coordinator before the facility is constructed. The review and approval of
such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user from
the responsibility of modifying the facility to provide the protection
necessary to meet the requirements of this chapter.
(b) Notification of accidental discharge. Any person causing or
suffering from any accidental discharge shall immediately notify the
pretreatment coordinator in person, or by the telephone to enable
countermeasures to be taken by the pretreatment coordinator to
minimize damage to the POTW, the health and welfare of the public, and
the environment. This notification shall be followed, within five (5) days
of the date of occurrence, by a detailed written statement describing the
cause of the accidental discharge and the measures being taken to
prevent future occurrence. Such notification shall not relieve the user of
liability for any expense, loss, or damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any
other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the
user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed
by this chapter or state or federal law. As required by Tennessee Rule
1200-4-14.12(6), industrial customers are required to notify the POTW
and pretreatment coordinator of any potential problems, including slug
Change 1, September 20, 2011 18-40
loading. All categorical and non-categorical industrial users shall notify
the POTW and pretreatment coordinator immediately of all discharges
that could cause problems to the POTW, including any slug loadings.
(c) Notice to employees. A notice shall be permanently posted
on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees
whom to call in the event of a dangerous discharge. Employers shall
ensure that all employees who may cause or suffer such a dangerous
discharge to occur are advised of the emergency notification procedure.
In lieu of placing notices on bulletin boards, the users may submit an
approved SPIC. Each user shall annually certify to the pretreatment
coordinator compliance with this section. (Ord. #2006-865, Oct. 2006, as
amended by Ord. #2007-875, Sept. 2007, and replaced by Ord. #2009-899,

governmental agency without restriction unless the user specifically requests
Change 1, September 20, 2011 18-45
and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the pretreatment coordinator
that the release of such information would divulge information, processes, or
methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets of the users.
When requested by the person furnishing the report, the portions of a
report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made
available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available to
governmental agencies for use related to this chapter or the city's or user's
NPDES permit. Provided, however, that such portions of a report shall be
available for use by the state or any state agency in judicial review or
enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater
constituents and characteristics will not be recognized as confidential
information.
Information accepted by the pretreatment coordinator as confidential
shall not be transmitted to any governmental agency or to the general public by
the pretreatment coordinator until and unless prior and adequate notification
is given to the user. The user must clearly and permanently mark each item of
information that is being claimed as confidential at the time of submission.
(4) Legal authority, POTW pretreatment requirements. A POTW
pretreatment program must be based on the following legal authority and
include the following procedures. These authorities and procedures shall at all
times be fully and effectively exercised and implemented.
Legal authority. The POTW shall operate pursuant to legal authority
enforceable in federal, state or local courts, which authorizes or enables the
POTW to apply and to enforce the requirements of this rule chapter. Such
authority may be contained in a statute, ordinance, or series of contracts or joint
powers agreements which the POTW is authorized to enact, enter into or
implement, and which are authorized by state law. At a minimum, this legal
authority shall enable the POTW to: Control through permit, order, or similar
means, the contribution to the POTW by each industrial user to ensure
compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. In the
case of industrial users identified as significant under definition of "significant
industrial user" in rule 1200-4-14-.03(1), this control shall be achieved through
individual permits or equivalent individual control mechanisms issued to each
user except as follows: Both individual and general control mechanisms (all
permits) must be enforceable and contain, at a minimum, the following
conditions:
(a) Statement of duration (in no case more than five (5) years);
(b) Statement of non-transferability without, at a minimum,
prior notification to the POTW and provision of a copy of the existing
control mechanism to the new owner or operator;
(c) Effluent limits, including best management practices, based
on applicable general pretreatment standards as shown in Tennessee
Rule 1200-4-14-.03(1), categorical pretreatment standards, local limits,
and state and local laws;
Change 1, September 20, 2011 18-46
(d) Self-monitoring, sampling, reporting, notification, and
recordkeeping requirements, including an identification of the pollutants
to be monitored (including the process for seeking a waiver for a pollutant
neither present nor expected to be present in the discharge in accordance
with Tennessee Rule 1200-4-14.12(5)(b), or a specific waived pollutant in
the case of an individual control mechanism), sampling location, sampling
frequency, and sample type, based on the applicable general pretreatment
standards as shown in Tennessee Rule 1200-4-14-.03(1), categorical
pretreatment standards, local limits, and local laws;
(e) Statement of applicable civil and criminal penalties for
violation of pretreatment standards and requirements and any applicable
compliance schedule. Such schedules may not extend the compliance date
beyond applicable federal deadlines; and
(f) Requirements to control slug discharges, if determined by
the POTW to be necessary. (Ord. #2006-865, Oct. 2006, as replaced by
Ord. #2010-917, Oct. 2010)
18-209. Industrial user monitoring, inspection reports, records
access, and safety. (1) Monitoring facilities. The installation of a monitoring
facility shall be required for all industrial users when necessary in the opinion
of the system manager. A monitoring facility shall be a manhole or other
suitable facility approved by the pretreatment coordinator. The monitoring
facility may be required to:
(a) Contain a primary device for accurate flow measurement of
all flow ranges of the industry;
(b) Provide for electrical service to the primary device; and
(c) Be located at a point outside of the security fencing, or if
none, outside the discharging source building(s) of the industry at a point
accessible by the city for monitoring so as to be monitored by the city
without entry through the gate of the plant. All designs for primary
devices and monitoring facilities shall be stamped and dated by a
professional engineer licensed to practice in Tennessee.
When in the judgment of the pretreatment coordinator, there is a
significant difference in wastewater constituents and characteristics produced
by different operations of a single user the pretreatment coordinator may
require that separate monitoring facilities be installed for each separate source
of discharge.
Monitoring facilities that are required to be installed shall be constructed
and maintained at the user's expense. The purpose of the facility is to enable
inspection, sampling and flow measurement of wastewater produced by a user.
If sampling or metering equipment is also required by the pretreatment
coordinator, it shall be provided and installed at the user's expense. The
monitoring facility will normally be required to be located on the user's premises
outside of the building and all facility fencing, if any. The pretreatment
Change 1, September 20, 2011 18-47
coordinator may, however, when such a location would be impractical or cause
undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public
street right-of-way with the approval of the public agency having jurisdiction of
that right-of-way and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or
parked vehicles. There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole
or facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis.
The facility, sampling, and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all
times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expenses of the user.
(2) Inspection and sampling. The city may inspect the facilities of any
user to ascertain whether the purpose of this chapter is being met and all
requirements are being complied with. Persons or occupants of premises where
wastewater is created or discharged shall allow the city or their representative
ready access at all reasonable times to all parts of the premises for the purpose
of inspection, sampling, records examination or in the performance of any of
their duties. The city, approval authority and EPA shall have the right to set up
on the user's property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling
inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering operations. Where a user has
security measures in force which would require proper identification and
clearance before entry into their premises, the user shall make necessary
arrangements with their security guards so that upon presentation of suitable
identification, personnel from the city, approval authority and EPA will be
permitted to enter, without delay, for the purposes of performing their specific
responsibility. Industrial users shall be required to conduct representative
sampling as required in Tennessee Rule 1200-4-14-.12(7)(c). All industrial users
are required to submit all monitoring data as required in Tennessee Rule
1200-414-.12(7)(f).
(3) Compliance date report. Report on compliance with categorical
pretreatment standard deadline. Within ninety (90) days following the date for
final compliance with applicable categorical pretreatment standards or in the
case of a new source following commencement of the introduction of wastewater
into the POTW, any industrial user subject to pretreatment standards and
requirements shall submit to the control authority a report containing the
information described in Tennessee Rule 1200-4-14-.12(2)(d-f). For industrial
users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established by the
control authority in accordance with the procedures in Tennessee Rule
1200-4-14-.06(3), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's
long-term production rate. For all other industrial users subject to categorical
pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per
unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the
user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period.
(4) Baseline reports. (a) Reporting requirements for industrial users
upon effective date of categorical pretreatment standard --- baseline
report. Within one hundred eighty (180) days after the effective date of
a categorical pretreatment standard, or one hundred eighty (180) days
Change 1, September 20, 2011 18-48
after the final administrative decision made upon a category
determination submission under Tennessee Rule 1200-4-14-.06(1)(d),
whichever is later, existing industrial users subject to such categorical
pretreatment standards and currently discharging to or scheduled to
discharge to a POTW shall be required to submit to the control authority
a report which contains the information listed in subsections (i) - (vii) of
this section. At least ninety (90) days prior to commencement of
discharge, new sources, and sources that become industrial users
subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable categorical standard,
shall be required to submit to the control authority a report which
contains the information listed in subsections (i) through (v) of this
section. New sources shall also be required to include in this report
information on the method of pretreatment the source intends to use to
meet applicable pretreatment standards. New sources shall give
estimates of the information requested in subsections (iv) and (v) of this
section:
(i) Identifying information. The user shall submit the
name and address of the facility, including the name of the
operators and owners;
(ii) Permits. The user shall submit a list of any
environmental control permits held by or for the facility;
(iii) Description of operations. The user shall submit a
brief description of the nature, average rate of production, and
standard industrial classification of the operation(s) carried out by
such industrial user. This description should include a schematic
process diagram which indicates points of discharge to the POTW
from the regulated processes;
(iv) Flow measurement. The user shall submit
information showing the measured average daily and maximum
daily flow, in gallons per day, to the POTW from each of the
following:
(A) Regulated process streams; and
(B) Other streams as necessary to allow use of the
combined wastestream formula as shown in Tennessee Rule
1200-4-14.06(5). (See subsection (v)(D) of this section.) The
control authority may allow for verifiable estimates of these
flows where justified by cost or feasibility considerations.
(v) Measurement of pollutants. (A) The user shall
identify the pretreatment standards applicable to each
regulated process;
(B) In addition, the user shall submit the results
of sampling and analysis identifying the nature and
concentration (or mass, where required by the standard or
control authority) of regulated pollutants in the discharge
Change 1, September 20, 2011 18-49
from each regulated process. Both daily maximum and
average concentration (or mass, where required) shall be
reported. The sample shall be representative of daily
operations. In cases where the standard requires compliance
with a best management practice or pollution prevention
alternative, the user shall submit documentation as
required by the control authority or the applicable
standards to determine compliance with the standard;
(C) The user shall take a minimum of one (1)
representative sample to compile that data necessary to
comply with the requirements of this section;
(D) Samples should be taken immediately
downstream from pretreatment facilities if such exist or
immediately downstream from the regulated process if no
pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed with
the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment the user
should measure the flows and concentrations necessary to
allow use of the combined wastestream formula of
Tennessee Rule 1200-4-14-.06(5) in order to evaluate
compliance with the pretreatment standards. Where an
alternate concentration or mass limit has been calculated in
accordance with Tennessee Rule 1200-4-14.06(5) this
adjusted limit along with supporting data shall be
submitted to the control authority;
(E) Sampling and analysis shall be performed in
accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 C.F.R. part
136 and amendments thereto. Where 40 C.F.R. part 136
does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the
pollutant in question, or where the administrator
determines that the part 136 sampling and analytical
techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question,
sampling and analysis shall be performed by using
validated analytical methods or any other applicable
sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures
suggested by the POTW or other parties, approved by the
administrator;
(F) The control authority may allow the
submission of a baseline report which utilizes only historical
data so long as the data provides information sufficient to
determine the need for industrial pretreatment measures;
(G) The baseline report shall indicate the time,
date and place of sampling, and methods of analysis, and
shall certify that such sampling and analysis is
Change 1, September 20, 2011 18-50
representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant
discharges to the POTW.
(vi) Certification. A statement, reviewed by an authorized
representative of the industrial user (as defined in Tennessee Rule
1200-4-14-.12(12)) and certified to by a qualified professional,
indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met on a
consistent basis, and, if not, whether additional Operation and
Maintenance (O&M) and/or additional pretreatment is required for
the industrial user to meet the pretreatment standards and
requirements; and
(vii) Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment
and/or O&M will be required to meet the pretreatment standards,
the shortest schedule by which the industrial user will provide
such additional pretreatment and/or O&M. The completion date in
this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date
established for the applicable pretreatment standard.
(A) Where the industrial user's categorical
pretreatment standard has been modified by a removal
allowance (as shown in Tennessee Rule 1200-4-14-.07), the
combined wastestream formula (as shown in Tennessee
Rule 1200-4-14-.06(5)), and/or a fundamentally different
factors variance (as shown in Tennessee Rule 1200-4-14-.13)
at the time the user submits the report required by
paragraph (a) of this rule, the information required by
subsections (vi) and (vii) of this section shall pertain to the
modified limits.
(B) If the categorical pretreatment standard is
modified by a removal allowance (as shown in Tennessee
Rule 1200-4-14.07), the combined wastestream formula (as
shown in Tennessee Rule 1200-4-14-.06(5)), and/or a
fundamentally different factors variance (as shown in
Tennessee Rule 12004- 14-.13) after the user submits the
report required by paragraph (a) of this rule, any necessary
amendments to the information requested by subsections
(vi) and (vii) of this section shall be submitted by the user to
the control authority within sixty (60) days after the
modified limit is approved.
(5) Periodic compliance reports. (a) Any user subject to a
pretreatment standard, after the compliance date of such pretreatment
standard, or, in the case of a new source, after commencement of the
discharge into the POTW, shall submit to the pretreatment coordinator
by the end of the months of March and September, or according to permit
requirements, unless required more frequently in the pretreatment
standard or by the pretreatment coordinator, a report indicating the
Change 1, September 20, 2011 18-51
nature and concentration of pollutants in the effluent which are limited
by such pretreatment standards and requirements. In accordance with
40 C.F.R. 403.12 (g)(2), the user's report shall contain a record of the
measured or estimated average daily flows for the reporting period.
In addition, this report shall include a record of all daily flows
which during the reporting period exceeded the average daily flow. At the
discretion of the pretreatment coordinator and in consideration of such
factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, etc., the
pretreatment coordinator may agree to alter the months during which the
above reports are to be submitted.
(b) The pretreatment coordinator may impose mass limitations
on users where the imposition of mass limitations are appropriate. In
such cases, the report required by subsection (a) of this section shall
indicate the mass of pollutants regulated by pretreatment standards in
the effluent of the user.
(c) The reports required by this section shall contain the results
of sampling and analysis of the discharge, including the flow and the
nature and concentration or production and mass where requested by the
pretreatment coordinator of pollutants contained therein which are
limited by the applicable pretreatment standards. The frequency of
monitoring shall be prescribed in the wastewater discharge permit or the
pretreatment standard. All analysis shall be performed in accordance
with procedures established by the administrator pursuant to
section 304(h) of the Act and contained in 40 C.F.R. part 136, and
amendments thereto. Sampling shall be performed in accordance with the
sampling requirements as outlined in Tennessee Rule 1200-414-.12(7)(c)
and (d).
(6) Maintenance of records. Any industrial user subject to the
reporting requirements established in this section shall maintain records of all
information resulting from any monitoring activities required by this section.
Such records shall include for all samples:
(a) The date, exact place, method, and time of sampling and the
names of the persons taking the samples;
(b) The dates analysis were performed;
(c) Who performed the analysis;
(d) The analytical techniques/methods used; and
(e) The results of such analyses.
Any industrial user subject to the reporting requirement established in
this section shall be required to retain for a minimum of three (3) years all
records of monitoring activities and results (whether or not such monitoring
activities are required by this section) and shall make such records available for
inspection and copying by the pretreatment coordinator, Director of the Division
of Water Pollution Control, Tennessee Department of Environment and
Conservation or the Environmental Protection Agency. This period of retention
Change 1, September 20, 2011 18-52
shall be extended during the course of any unresolved litigation regarding the
industrial user or when requested by the pretreatment coordinator, the approval
authority, or the Environmental Protection Agency.
(7) Safety. While performing the necessary work on private properties,
the pretreatment coordinator or duly authorized employees of the city shall
observe all safety rules applicable to the premises established by the company
and the company shall be held harmless for injury or death to the city employees
and the city shall indemnify the company against loss or damage to its property
by city employees and against liability claims and demands for personal injury
or property damage asserted against the company and growing out of the
monitoring and sampling operation, except as such may be caused by negligence
or failure of the company to maintain safe conditions.
(8) New sources. New sources of discharges to the POTW shall have
in full operation all pollution control equipment at start up of the industrial
process and be in full compliance with effluent standards within ninety (90)
days of start up of the industrial process or such other time frame as established
by the system manager.
(9) Reporting violations. If sampling performed by the industrial user
indicates a violation, the user shall notify the control authority within
twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also
repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis
to the control authority within thirty (30) days after becoming aware of the
violation. Where the control authority has performed the sampling and analysis
in lieu of the industrial user, the control authority must perform the repeat
sampling and analysis unless it notifies the user of the violation and requires
the user to perform the repeat analysis. Resampling is not required if:
(a) The control authority performs sampling at the industrial
user at a frequency of at least once per month; or
(b) The control authority performs sampling at the user between
the time when the initial sampling was conducted and the time when the
user or the control authority receives the results of this sampling.
(10) Slug discharges. Significant industrial users are required to notify
the POTW immediately of any changes at its facility affecting potential for a
slug discharge. If the POTW decides that a slug control plan is needed, the plan
shall contain, at a minimum, the following elements:
(a) Description of discharge practices, including non-routine
batch discharges;
(b) Description of stored chemicals;
(c) Procedures for immediately notifying the POTW of slug
discharges, including any discharge that would violate a prohibition
under 1200-4-14-.05(2), with procedures for follow-up written notification
within five (5) days;
(d) If necessary, procedures to prevent adverse impact from
accidental spills, including inspection and maintenance of storage areas,
Change 1, September 20, 2011 18-53
handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations,
control of plant site run-off, worker training, building of containment
structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants
(including solvents), and/or measures and equipment for emergency
response.
(11) Significant noncompliance. Comply with the public participation
requirements of 40 C.F.R. part 25 in the enforcement of national pretreatment
standards. These procedures shall include provision for at least annual public
notification, in a newspaper(s) of general circulation that provides meaningful
public notice within the jurisdiction(s) served by the POTW, of industrial users
which, at any time during the previous twelve (12) months, were in significant
noncompliance with applicable pretreatment requirements. For the purposes of
this provision, a significant industrial user (or any industrial user which violates
subsections (c), (d) or (h) of this section) is in significant noncompliance if its
violation meets one (1) or more of the following criteria:
(a) Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined
here as those in which sixty-six percent (66%) or more of all of the
measurements for each pollutant parameter taken during a six (6) month
period exceed (by any magnitude) a numeric pretreatment standard or
requirement, including instantaneous limits, as defined by
1200-4-14-.03(1);
(b) Technical Review Criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as
those in which thirty-three percent (33%) or more of all of the
measurements for each pollutant parameter taken during a six (6) month
period equal or exceed the product of the numeric pretreatment standard
or requirement, including instantaneous limits, as defined by
1200-4-14-.03(1) multiplied by the applicable TRC (TRC = 1.4 for BOD,
TSS, fats, oil, and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH). TRC
calculations for pH are not required by this rule;
(c) Any other violation of a pretreatment standard or
requirement as defined by 1200-4-14-.03 (daily maximum, long-term
average, instantaneous limit, or narrative standard) that the POTW
detetmines has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges,
interference or pass through (including endangering health of POTW
personnel or the general public);
(d) Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent
endangerment to human health, welfare or to the environment or has
resulted in the POTW's exercise of its emergency authority under subpart
(6)(a)6(ii) of this rule to halt or prevent such a discharge;
(e) Failure to meet, within ninety (90) days after the schedule
date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in a local control
mechanism or enforcement order for starting construction, completing
construction, or attaining final compliance;
Change 1, September 20, 2011 18-54
(f) Failure to provide, within forty-five (45) days after the due
date, required reports such as baseline monitoring reports, ninety (90)
day compliance reports, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on
compliance with compliance schedules;
(g) Failure to accurately report noncompliance; and/or
(h) Any other violation or group of violations, which may include
a violation of best management practices, which the POTW determines
will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local
pretreatment program.
(12) Periodic reports on continued compliance. (a) Any industrial user
subject to a categorical pretreatment standard (except a non-significant
categorical industrial user as defined in subparagraph (b) in the
definition of "Significant Industrial User" as shown in Tennessee Rule
1200-4-14-.03(1)), after the compliance date of such pretreatment
standard, or, in the case of a new source, after commencement of the
discharge into the POTW, shall submit to the control authority during the
months of June and December, unless required more frequently in the
pretreatment standard or by the control authority or the approval
authority, a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants
in the effluent which are limited by such categorical pretreatment
standards. In addition, this report shall include a record of measured or
estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period for
the discharge reported in Tennessee Rule 1200-4-14.12(2)(d) except that
the control authority may require more detailed reporting of flows. In
cases where the pretreatment standard requires compliance with a best
management practice (or pollution prevention alternative), the user shall
submit documentation required by the control authority or the
pretreatment standard necessary to determine the compliance status of
the user. At the discretion of the control authority and in consideration
of such factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, etc.,
the control authority may agree to alter the months during which the
above reports are submitted.
(b) The control authority may authorize the industrial user
subject to a categorical pretreatment standard to forego sampling of a
pollutant regulated by a categorical pretreatment standard if the
industrial user has demonstrated through sampling and other technical
factors that the pollutant is neither present nor expected to be present in
the discharge, or is present only at background levels from intake water
and without any increase in the pollutant due to activities of the
industrial user. This authorization is subject to the following conditions:
(i) The control authority may authorize a waiver where
a pollutant is determined to be present solely due to sanitary
wastewater discharged from the facility provided that the sanitary
Change 1, September 20, 2011 18-55
wastewater is not regulated by an applicable categorical standard
and otherwise includes no process wastewater.
(ii) The monitoring waiver is valid only for the duration
of the effective period of the permit or other equivalent individual
control mechanism, but in no case longer than five (5) years. The
user must submit a new request for waiver before the waiver can
be granted for each subsequent control mechanism.
(iii) In making a demonstration that a pollutant is not
present, the industrial user must provide data from at least one (1)
sampling of the facility's process wastewater prior to any
treatment present at the facility that is representative of all
wastewater from all processes. The request for a monitoring
waiver must be signed in accordance with subsection (a) of this
section, and include the certification statement in Tennessee Rule
1200-414-. 06(1)(b)2. Non-detectable sample results may only be
used as a demonstration that a pollutant is not present if the EPA
approved method from 40 C.F.R. part 136 with the lowest
minimum detection level for that pollutant was used in the
analysis.
(iv) Any grant of the monitoring waiver by the control
authority must be included as a condition in the user's control
mechanism. The reasons supporting the waiver and any
information submitted by the user in its request for the waiver
must be maintained by the control authority for three (3) years
after expiration of the waiver.
(v) Upon approval of the monitoring waiver and revision
of the user's control mechanism by the control authority, the
industrial user must certify on each report with the statement
below, that there has been no increase in the pollutant in its
wastestream due to activities of the industrial user:
Based on my inquiry of the person or persons
directly responsible for managing compliance
with the pretreatment standard for 40 C.F.R.
(specify applicable National Pretreatment
Standard part(s)), I certify that, to the best of
my knowledge and belief, there has been no
increase in the level of (list pollutant(s) in the
wastewaters due to the activities at the facility
since filing of the last periodic report under
Tennessee Rule 1200-4-14-.12(5)(a)).
(vi) In the event a waived pollutant is found to be present
or is expected to be present based on changes that occur in the
user's operations, the user must immediately: comply with the
monitoring requirements of subsection (a) of this section or other
Change 1, September 20, 2011 18-56
more frequent monitoring requirements imposed by the control
authority, and notify the control authority.
(vii) This provision does not supersede certification
processes and requirements established in categorical
pretreatment standards, except as otherwise specified in the
categorical pretreatment standard.
(c) Where the control authority has imposed mass limitations
on industrial users as provided for by Tennessee Rule 1200-4-14-.06(4),
the report required by subsection (a) of this section shall indicate the
mass of pollutants regulated by pretreatment standards in the discharge
from the industrial user.
(d) For industrial users subject to equivalent mass or
concentration limits established by the control authority in accordance
with the procedures in Tennessee Rule 1200-4-14-.06(3), the report
required by subsection (a) of this section shall contain a reasonable
measure of the user's long-term production rate. For all other industrial
users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed only in
terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other
measure of operation), the report required by subsection (a) of this section
shall include the user's actual average production rate for the reporting
period.
(13) Monitoring and analysis, violations and repeat sampling and
analysis. If sampling performed by an industrial user indicates a violation, the
user shall notify the control authority within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming
aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and
submit the results of the repeat analysis to the control authority within thirty
(30) days after becoming aware of the violation. Where the control authority has
performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the industrial user, the control
authority must perform the repeat sampling and analysis unless it notifies the
user of the violation and requires the user to perform the repeat analysis.
Resampling is not required if:
(a) The control authority performs sampling at the industrial
user at a frequency of at least once per month; or
(b) The control authority performs sampling at the user between
the time when the initial sampling was conducted and the time when the
user or the control authority receives the results of this sampling.
(14) Monitoring and analysis to demonstrate continued compliance.
The reports required in paragraphs (2), (4), (5), and (8) as shown in Tennessee
Rule 1200-4-14-.12 must be based upon data obtained through appropriate
sampling and analysis performed during the period covered by the report, which
data are representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period. The
control authority shall require that frequency of monitoring necessary to assess
and assure compliance by industrial users with applicable pretreatment
standards and requirements. Grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total
Change 1, September 20, 2011 18-57
phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organic compounds. For all other
pollutants, twenty-four (24) hour composite samples must be obtained through
flow-proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time-proportional
composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the control authority.
Where time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by
the control authority, the samples must be representative of the discharge and
the decision to allow the alternative sampling must be documented in the
industrial user file for that facility or facilities. Using protocols (including
appropriate preservation) specified in 40 C.F.R. part 136 and appropriate EPA
guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a twenty-four (24) hour period
may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: For cyanide, total phenols,
and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for
volatile organics and oil and grease the samples may be composited in the
laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the
compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be
authorized by the control authority, as appropriate.
(15) Specifying the number of grab samples required by control
authority. For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and ninety
(90) day compliance reports required in paragraphs (2) and (4) of Tennessee
Rule 1200-4-14-.12, a minimum of four (4) grab samples must be used for pH,
cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for
facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which
historical sampling data are available, the control authority may authorize a
lower minimum. For the reports required by paragraphs (5) and (8) of Tennessee
Rule 1200-4-14-.12, the control authority shall require the number of grab
samples necessary to assess and assure compliance by industrial users with
applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.
(16) Significant industrial users must submit documentation to show
compliance with best management practices, reporting requirements for
industrial users not subject to categorical pretreatment standards. The control
authority must require appropriate reporting from those industrial users with
discharges that are not subject to categorical pretreatment standards.
Significant noncategorical industrial users must submit to the control authority
at least once every six (6) months (on dates specified by the control authority)
a description of the nature, concentration, and flow of the pollutants required
to be reported by the control authority. In cases where a local limit requires
compliance with a best management practice or pollution prevention alternative,
the user must submit documentation required by the control authority to
determine the compliance status of the user. These reports must be based on
sampling and analysis performed in the period covered by the report, and in
accordance with the techniques described in 40 C.F.R. part 136 and
amendments thereto. This sampling and analysis may be performed by the
control authority in lieu of the significant noncategorical industrial user.
Change 1, September 20, 2011 18-58
(17) Signatory requirements for industrial user reports. The reports
required by Tennessee Rule 1200-4-14-.12, paragraphs (2), (4), and (5) shall
include the certification statement as set forth in 1200-4-14-.06(1)(b)2, and shall
be signed as follows:

recommendations, and initiate and direct other comprehensive
measures to assure long-term environmental compliance with
environmental laws and regulations; can ensure that the necessary
systems are established or actions taken to gather complete and
accurate information for control mechanism requirements; and
where authority to sign documents has been assigned or delegated
to the manager in accordance with corporate procedures.
(b) By a general partner or proprietor if the industrial user
submitting the reports required by Tennessee Rule 1200-4-14-.12,
paragraphs (2), (4), and (5) is a partnership or sole proprietorship
respectively.
(c) By a duly authorized representative of the individual
designated in subsections (a) or (b) of this section if:
(i) The authorization is made in writing by the

(ii) The authorization specifies either an individual or a
position having responsibility for the overall operation of the
facility from which the industrial discharge originates, such as the
position of plant manager, operator of a well, or well field
superintendent, or a position of equivalent responsibility, or
having overall responsibility for environmental matters for the
company; and
(iii) The written authorization is submitted to the control
authority.
(d) If an authorization under subparagraph (16)(c) of this rule
is no longer accurate because a different individual or position has
responsibility for the overall operation of the facility, or overall
Change 1, September 20, 2011 18-59
responsibility for environmental matters for the company, a new
authorization satisfying the requirements of subparagraph (16)(c) of this
rule must be submitted to the control authority prior to or together with
any reports to be signed by an authorized representative.
(18) Documentation associated with best management practices must
be retained for at least three (3) years. The following recordkeeping
requirements apply: any industrial user or POTW subject to the reporting
requirements established in this rule (including documentation associated with
best management practices) shall be required to retain for a minimum of three
(3) years any records of monitoring activities and results (whether or not such
monitoring activities are required by this rule) and shall make such records
available for inspection and copying by the director and the regional
administrator (and POTW in the case of an industrial user). This period of
retention shall be extended during the course of any unresolved litigation
regarding the industrial user or POTW or when requested by the director or the
regional administrator.
(19) Notification of changed discharge. All industrial users shall
promptly notify the control authority (the POTW) in advance of any substantial
change in the volume or character of pollutants in their discharge, including the
listed or characteristic hazardous wastes for which the industrial user has
submitted initial notification under Tennessee Rule 1200-4-14-.12(6).
(20) The industrial users shall notify the POTW, the EPA Regional
Waste Management Division Director, and state (TDEC) hazardous waste
authorities in writing of any discharge into the POTW of a substance, which, if
otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under Tennessee
Rule 1200-1-11.
(a) Such notification must include the name of the hazardous
waste as set forth in Tennessee Rule 1200-1-11, the EPA hazardous waste
number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the
industrial user discharges more than one hundred (100) kilograms of such
waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification shall also
contain the following information to the extent such information is known
and readily available to the industrial user: an identification of the
hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the
mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream
discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of
constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the
following twelve (12) months. All notifications must take place within one
hundred eighty (180) days of the effective date of this rule. Industrial
users who commence discharging after the effective date of this rule shall
provide the notification no later than one hundred eighty (180) days after
the discharge of the listed or characteristic hazardous waste. Any
notification under this section need be submitted only once for each
hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed
Change 1, September 20, 2011 18-60
discharges must be submitted under Tennessee Rule 1200-4-14-.12(10).
The notification requirement in this rule does not apply to pollutants
already reported under the self-monitoring requirements of Tennessee
Rule 1200-4-14-.12 (2), (4), and (5).
(b) Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of
subsection (a) of this section during a calendar month in which they
discharge no more than fifteen (15) kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless
the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in Tennessee Rule
1200-1-11-.02(4)(a) and (d). Discharge of more than fifteen (15) kilograms
of non-acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of
acute hazardous wastes as specified in Tennessee Rule
1200-1-11-.02(4)(a) and (4)(d), requires a one (1) time notification.
Subsequent months during which the industrial user discharges more
than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional
notification.
(c) In the case of any new regulations under section 3001 of
RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing
any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the industrial user must
notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division
Director, and state (TDEC) hazardous waste authorities of the discharge
of such substance within ninety (90) days of the effective date of such
regulations.
(d) In the case of any notification made under this section, the
industrial user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the
volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has
determined to be economically practical. (Ord. #2006-865, Oct. 2006, as
replaced by Ord. #2010-917, Oct. 2010)
18-210. Enforcement and abatement. (1) Complaints; notification of
violation; orders.
(a) (i) Whenever the local administrative officer has reason
to believe that a violation of any provision of the pretreatment
program of the City of Mount Pleasant or orders of the local
hearing authority issued pursuant thereto has occurred, is
occurring, or is about to occur, the local administrative officer may
cause a written complaint to be served upon the alleged violator or
violators.
(ii) The complaint shall specify the provision or
provisions of the pretreatment program or order alleged to be
violated or about to be violated and the facts alleged to constitute
a violation thereof, may order that necessary corrective action be
taken within a reasonable time to be prescribed in such order, and
shall inform the violators of the opportunity for a hearing before
the local hearing authority.
Change 1, September 20, 2011 18-61
(iii) Any such order shall become final and not subject to
review unless the person or persons named therein request by
written petition a hearing before the local hearing authority as
provided in § 18-210(2), no later than thirty (30) days after the
date such order is served; provided, that the local hearing
authority may review such final order on the same grounds upon
which a court of the state may review default judgments.
(iv) Notification of violation. Notwithstanding the
provisions of subsections (i) through (iii), whenever the
pretreatment coordinator finds that any user has violated or is
violating this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment requirements, the
city or its agent may serve upon said user a written notice of
violation. Within fifteen (15) days of the receipt of this notice, an
explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory
correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required
actions, shall be submitted by the user to the pretreatment
coordinator. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of
liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the
notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority
of the city to take any action, including emergency actions or any
other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation.
(b) (i) When the local administrative officer finds that a user
has violated or continues to violate this chapter, wastewater
discharge permits, any order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, he may issue one (1) of the
following orders. These orders shall not be prerequisite to taking
any other action against the user.
(A) Compliance order. An order to the user
responsible for the discharge directing that the user come
into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not
come into compliance within the specified time stated, sewer
service shall be discontinued unless adequate treatment
facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are
installed and properly operated. Compliance orders may
also contain other requirements to address the
noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring, and
management practices designed to minimize the amount of
pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may
not extend the deadline for compliance established for a
federal pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a
compliance order release the user of liability for any
violation, including any continuing violation.
Change 1, September 20, 2011 18-62
(B) Cease and desist order. An order to the user
directing it to cease all such violations and directing it to
immediately comply with all requirements and take such
remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly
address a continuing or threatened violation, including
halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.
(C) Consent order. Assurances of voluntary
compliance, or other documents establishing an agreement
with the user responsible for noncompliance, including
specific action to be taken by the user to correct the
noncompliance within a time period specified in the order.
(D) Emergency order. Whenever the local
administrative officer finds that an emergency exists
imperatively requiring immediate action to protect the
public health, safety, or welfare, the health of animals, fish
or aquatic life, a public water supply, or the facilities of the
POTW, the local administrative officer may, without prior
notice, issue an order reciting the existence of such an
emergency and requiring that such action be taken as the
local administrative officer deems necessary to meet the
emergency.
(E) If the violator fails to respond or is unable to
respond to the order, the local administrative officer may
take such emergency action as the local administrative
officer deems necessary, or contract with a qualified person
or persons to carry out the emergency measures. The local
administrative officer may assess the person or persons
responsible for the emergency condition for actual costs
incurred by the local administrative officer in meeting the
emergency.
(ii) Appeals from orders of the local administrative
officer. (A) Any user affected by any order of the local
administrative officer in interpreting or implementing the
provisions of this chapter may file with the local
administrative officer a written request for reconsideration
within thirty (30) days of such order, setting forth in detail
the facts supporting the user's request for reconsideration.
(B) If the ruling made by the local administrative
officer is unsatisfactory to the person requesting
reconsideration, he may, within thirty (30) days, file a
written petition with the local hearing authority as provided
in subsection (2). The local administrative officer's order
shall remain in effect during the period of reconsideration.
Change 1, September 20, 2011 18-63
(C) Except as otherwise expressly provided, any
notice, complaint, order or other instrument issued by or
under authority of this section may be served on any person
affected thereby personally, by the local administrative
officer or any person designated by the local administrative
officer, or such service may be made in accordance with
Tennessee statutes authorizing service of process in civil
action. Proof of service shall be filed in the office of the local
administrative officer.
(2) Hearings. (a) Any hearing or rehearing brought before the local
hearing authority shall be conducted in accordance with the following:
(i) Upon receipt of a written petition from the alleged
violator pursuant to this subsection, the local administrative
officer shall give the petitioner thirty (30) days' written notice of
the time and place of the hearing, but in no case shall such hearing
be held more than sixty (60) days from the receipt of the written
petition, unless the local administrative officer and the petitioner
agree to a postponement;
(ii) The hearing herein provided may be conducted by the
local hearing authority at a regular or special meeting. A quorum
of the local hearing authority must be present at the regular or
special meeting in order to conduct the hearing herein provided;
(iii) A verbatim record of the proceedings of such hearings
shall be taken and filed with the local hearing authority, together
with the findings of fact and conclusions of law made pursuant to
subsection (a)(vi). The transcript so recorded shall be made
available to the petitioner or any party to a hearing upon payment
of a charge set by the local administrative officer to cover the costs
of preparation;
(iv) In connection with the hearing, the chair shall issue
subpoenas in response to any reasonable request by any party to
the hearing requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses
and the production of evidence relevant to any matter involved in
the hearing. In case of contumacy or refusal to obey a notice of
hearing or subpoena issued under this section, the chancery court
of the county in which the pretreatment agency is located shall
have jurisdiction upon the application of the local hearing
authority or the local administrative officer to issue an order
requiring such person to appear and testify or produce evidence as
the case may require, and any failure to obey such order of the
court may be punished by such court as contempt;
(v) Any member of the local hearing authority may
administer oaths and examine witnesses;
Change 1, September 20, 2011 18-64
(vi) On the basis of the evidence produced at the hearing,
the local hearing authority shall make findings of fact and
conclusions of law and enter such decisions and orders as, in its
opinion, will best further the purposes of the pretreatment
program and shall give written notice of such decisions and orders
to the alleged violator. The order issued under this subsection shall
be issued no later than thirty (30) days following the close of the
hearing by the person or persons designated by the chair;
(vii) The decision of the local hearing authority shall
become final and binding on all parties unless appealed to the
courts as provided in subsection (b); and
(viii) Any person to whom an emergency order is directed
pursuant to § 18-210(1) shall comply therewith immediately, but
on petition to the local hearing authority shall be afforded a
hearing as soon as possible, but in no case shall such hearing be
held later than three (3) days from the receipt of such petition by
the local hearing authority.
(b) An appeal may be taken from any final order or other final
determination of the local hearing authority by any party, including the
pretreatment agency, who is or may be adversely affected thereby, to the
chancery court pursuant to the common law writ of certiorari set out in
Tennessee Code Annotated, § 27-8-101, within sixty (60) days from the
date such order or determination is made.
(c) Show cause hearing. Notwithstanding the provisions of
subsections (a) or (b), the pretreatment coordinator may order any user
which causes or contributes to violation(s) of this chapter, wastewater
discharge permits, or orders issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment
standard or requirements, to appear before the local administrative
officer and show cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be
taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for
the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such
action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed
enforcement action should be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be
served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt
requested) at least ten (10) days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be
served on any authorized representative of the user. Whether or not the
user appears as ordered, immediate enforcement action may be pursued
following the hearing date. A show cause hearing shall not be
prerequisite for taking any other action against the user. A show cause
hearing may be requested by the discharger prior to revocation of a
discharge permit or termination of service.
(3) Violations--civil penalty. See the attached Enforcement Response
Guide for specific penalties and fines for twenty-eight (28) types of
noncompliance. The Enforcement Response Guide consists of nine (9) pages
Change 1, September 20, 2011 18-65

(G) Falsifies information; or
(H) Tampers with or knowingly renders inaccurate
monitoring devices.
(ii) Any civil penalty shall be assessed in the following
manner:
(A) The local administrative officer may issue an
assessment against any person or industrial user
responsible for the violation;
(B) Any person or industrial user against whom an
assessment has been issued may secure a review of such
assessment by filing with the local administrative officer a
written petition setting forth the grounds and reasons for
the violator's objections and asking for a hearing in the
matter involved before the local hearing authority and, if a
petition for review of the assessment is not filed within
thirty (30) days after the date the assessment is served, the
violator shall be deemed to have consented to the
assessment and it shall become final;
(C) Whenever any assessment has become final
because of a person's failure to appeal the assessment, the
local administrative officer may apply to the appropriate
court for a judgment and seek execution of such judgment
and the court, in such proceedings, shall treat a failure to
appeal such assessment as a confession of judgment in the
amount of the assessment;
(D) In assessing the civil penalty the local
administrative officer may consider the following factors:
Change 1, September 20, 2011 18-66
(1) Whether the civil penalty imposed will
be a substantial economic deterrent to the illegal
activity;
(2) Damages to the pretreatment agency,
including compensation for the damage or
destruction of the facilities of the publicly owned
treatment works, and also including any penalties,
costs and attorneys' fees incurred by the
pretreatment agency as the result of the illegal
activity, as well as the expenses involved in enforcing
this section and the costs involved in rectifying any
damages;
(3) Cause of the discharge or violation;
(4) The severity of the discharge and its
effect upon the facilities of the publicly owned
treatment works and upon the quality and quantity
of the receiving waters;
(5) Effectiveness of action taken by the
violator to cease the violation;
(6) The technical and economic
reasonableness of reducing or eliminating the
discharge; and
(7) The economic benefit gained by the
violator.
(E) The local administrative officer may institute
proceedings for assessment in the chancery court of the
county in which all or part of the pollution or violation
occurred in the name of the pretreatment agency.
(iii) The local hearing authority may establish by
regulation a schedule of the amount of civil penalty which can be
assessed by the local administrative officer for certain specific
violations or categories of violations. See Enforcement Response
Guide, Schedule C.
(iv) Assessments may be added to the user's next
scheduled sewer service charge and the local administrative officer
shall have such other collection remedies as may be available for
other service charges and fees.
(b) Any civil penalty assessed to a violator pursuant to this
section may be in addition to any civil penalty assessed by the
commissioner for violations of Tennessee Code Annotated,
§ 69-3-115(a)(1)(F). However, the sum of penalties imposed by this section
and by Tennessee Code Annotated, § 69-3-115(a) shall not exceed ten
thousand dollars ($10,000.00) per day for each day during which the act
or omission continues or occurs.
Change 1, September 20, 2011 18-67
(3) Violations--criminal penalty. (a) In addition and supplemental to
any other remedy provided herein, the city or its authorized
representative may seek criminal penalties for a violation of the
provisions of this chapter in a court of appropriate jurisdiction. Any
violation subject to the jurisdiction of the City Court of the City of Mount
Pleasant shall be cited into city court and upon conviction be subject to
a fine of fifty dollars ($50.00) per day for each day of violation, and as to
any prosecution sought in the general sessions or circuit court, such
violator upon conviction shall be subject to such penalty as may be
provided by law.
(4) Assessment for noncompliance with program permits or orders.
(a) The local administrative officer may assess the liability of
any polluter or violator for damages to the city resulting from any
person's or industrial user's pollution or violation, failure, or neglect in
complying with any permits or orders issued pursuant to the provisions
of the pretreatment program or this section.
(b) If an appeal from such assessment is not made to the local
hearing authority by the polluter or violator within thirty (30) days of
notification of such assessment, the polluter or violator shall be deemed
to have consented to the assessment, and it shall become final.
(c) Damages may include any expenses incurred in
investigating and enforcing the pretreatment program or this section, in
removing, correcting, and terminating any pollution, and also
compensation for any actual damages caused by the pollution or violation.
(d) Whenever any assessment has become final because of a
person's failure to appeal within the time provided, the local
administrative officer may apply to the appropriate court for a judgment,
and seek execution on such judgment. The court, in such proceedings,
shall treat the failure to appeal such assessment as a confession of
judgment in the amount of the assessment.
(5) Judicial proceedings and relief. The local administrative officer
may initiate proceedings in the chancery court of the county in which the
activities occurred against any person or industrial user who is alleged to have
violated or is about to violate the pretreatment program, this section, or orders
of the local hearing authority or local administrative officer. In such action, the
local administrative officer may seek, and the court may grant, injunctive relief
and any other relief available in law or equity.
(6) Termination of discharge. In addition to the revocation of permit
provisions in § 18-208(2)(h) of this chapter, any user that violates the following
conditions, wastewater discharge permits, or orders issued hereunder, is subject
to discharge termination:
(a) Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions.
(b) Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge.
Change 1, September 20, 2011 18-68
(c) Failure to report significant changes in operations or
wastewater volume, constituents and characteristics prior to discharge.
(d) Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the
purpose of inspection, monitoring or sampling.
(e) Violation of the pretreatment standards in the general
discharge prohibitions in § 18-207 of this chapter.
(f) Failure to properly submit an industrial waste survey when
requested by the pretreatment coordination superintendent. Such user
will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered
an opportunity to show cause, as provided in subsection (2)(c) above, why
the proposed action should not be taken.
(7) Disposition of damage payments and penalties--special fund. All
damages and/or penalties assessed and collected under the provisions of this
section shall be placed in a special fund by the pretreatment agency and
allocated and appropriated for the administration of its wastewater fund or
combined water and wastewater fund. (Ord. #2006-865, Oct. 2006, as replaced
by Ord. #2010-917, Oct. 2010)
18-211. Fees and billing. (1) Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter

Water and sewer system administration: title 18.
Wastewater treatment: title 18.
18-70
sewage or other waste or liquid which would be capable of imparting
contamination to the public water supply.
(6) "Person." Any and all persons, natural or artificial, including any
individual, firm, or association, and any municipal or private corporation
organized or existing under the laws of this or any other state or country.
(Ord. #2006-865, Oct. 2006)
18-302. Standards. The municipal public water supply is to comply
with Tennessee Code Annotated, §§ 68-221-701 through 68-221-720 as well as
the Rules and Regulations for Public Water Supplies, legally adopted in
accordance with this code, which pertain to cross connections, auxiliary intakes,
bypasses, and interconnections, and establish an effective ongoing program to
control these undesirable water uses. (Ord. #2006-865, Oct. 2006)
18-303. Construction, operation, and supervision. It shall be
unlawful for any person to cause a cross connection, auxiliary intake, bypass, or
interconnection to be made, or allow one to exist for any purpose whatsoever,
unless the construction and operation of same have been approved by the
Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation and the operation of
such cross connection, auxiliary intake, bypass or interconnection is at all times
under the direct supervision of the water department superintendent or his
representative. (Ord. #2006-865, Oct. 2006)
18-304. Statement required. Any person whose premises are supplied
with water from the public water supply and who also has on the same premises
a separate source of water supply, or stores water in an uncovered or unsanitary
storage reservoir from which the water stored therein is circulated through a
piping system, shall file with the water department superintendent a statement
of the non-existence of unapproved or unauthorized cross connections, auxiliary
intakes, bypasses, or interconnections. Such statement shall also contain an
agreement that no cross connection, auxiliary intake, bypass, or interconnection
will be permitted upon the premises. (Ord. #2006-865, Oct. 2006)
18-305. Inspections required. It shall be the duty of the water
department superintendent to cause inspections to be made of all properties
served by the public water supply where cross connections with the public water
supply are deemed possible. The frequency of inspections and reinspection,
based on potential health hazards involved, shall be established by the water
department superintendent and as approved by the Tennessee Department of
Environment and Conservation. (Ord. #2006-865, Oct. 2006)
18-306. Right of entry for inspections. The water department
superintendent or his authorized representative shall have the right to enter,
at any reasonable time, any property served by a connection to the public water
18-71
supply for the purpose of inspecting the piping system or systems therein for
cross connections, auxiliary intakes, bypasses, or interconnections. On request,
the owner, lessee, or occupant of any property so served shall furnish to the
inspection agency any pertinent information regarding the piping system or
systems on such property. The refusal of such information or refusal of access,
when requested, shall be deemed evidence of the presence of cross connections.
(Ord. #2006-865, Oct. 2006)
18-307. Correction of existing violations. Any person who now has
cross connections, auxiliary intakes, bypasses, or interconnections in violation
of the provisions of this chapter shall be allowed a reasonable time within which
to comply with the provisions of this chapter. After a thorough investigation of
existing conditions and an appraisal of the time required to complete the work,
the amount of time shall be designated by the water department
superintendent.
The failure to correct conditions threatening the safety of the public water
system as prohibited by this chapter and the Tennessee Code Annotated,
§ 68-221-711, within a reasonable time and within the time limits set by the
water department superintendent shall be grounds for denial of water service.
If proper protection has not been provided after a reasonable time, the water
department superintendent shall give the customer legal notification that water
service is to be discontinued and shall physically separate the public water
supply from the customer's on-site piping system in such a manner that the two
systems cannot again be connected by an unauthorized person.
Where cross connections, interconnections, auxiliary intakes, or bypasses
are found that constitute an extreme hazard of immediate concern of
contaminating the public water system, the management of the water supply
shall require that immediate corrective action be taken to eliminate the threat
to the public water system. Immediate steps shall be taken to disconnect the
public water supply from the on-site piping system unless the imminent
hazard(s) is (are) corrected immediately. (Ord. #2006-865, Oct. 2006)
18-308. Use of protective devices. Where the nature of use of the
water supplied a premises by the water department is such that it is deemed:
(1) Impractical to provide an effective air-gap separation.
(2) That the owner and/or occupant of the premises cannot, or is not
willing, to demonstrate to the water department superintendent, or his
designated representative, that the water use and protective features of the
plumbing are such as to propose no threat to the safety or potability of the water
supply.
(3) That the nature and mode of operation within a premises are such
that frequent alterations are made to the plumbing.
(4) There is a likelihood that protective measures may be subverted,
altered, or disconnected, the water department superintendent or his designated
18-72
representative, shall require the use of an approved protective device on the
service line serving the premises to assure that any contamination that may
originate in the customer's premises is contained therein. The protective device
shall be a reduced pressure zone type backflow preventer approved by the
Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation as to manufacture,
model, and size. The method of installation of backflow protective devices shall
be approved by the water department superintendent prior to installation and
shall comply with the criteria set forth by the Tennessee Department of
Environment and Conservation. The installation shall be at the expense of the
owner or occupant of the premises.
Personnel of the municipal public water supply shall have the right to
inspect and test the device or devices on an annual basis or whenever deemed
necessary by the water department superintendent or his designated
representative. Water service shall not be disrupted to test the device without
the knowledge of the occupant of the premises.
Where the use of water is critical to the continuance of normal operations
or protection of life, property, or equipment, duplicate units shall be provided to
avoid the necessity of discontinuing water service to test or repair the protective
device or devices. Where it is found that only one unit has been installed and
the continuance of service is critical, the water department superintendent shall
notify, in writing, the occupant of the premises of plans to discontinue water
service and arrange for a mutually acceptable time to test and/or repair the
device. The water department superintendent shall require the occupant of the
premises to make all repairs indicated promptly, to keep the unit(s) working
properly, and the expense of such repairs shall be borne by the owner or
occupant of the premises. Repairs shall be made by qualified personnel
acceptable to the water department superintendent.
The failure to maintain backflow prevention devices in proper working
order shall be grounds for discontinuing water service to a premises. Likewise,
the removal, bypassing, or altering of the protective devices or the installation
thereof so as to render the devices ineffective shall constitute grounds for
discontinuance of water service. Water service to such premises shall not be
restored until the customer has corrected or eliminated such conditions or
defects to the satisfaction of the water department superintendent.
(Ord. #2006-865, Oct. 2006)
18-309. Unpotable water to be labeled. In order that the potable
water supply made available to premises served by the public water supply shall
be protected from possible contamination as specified herein, any water outlet
which could be used for potable or domestic purposes and which is not supplied
by the potable system must be labeled in a conspicuous manner as:
18-73
WATER UNSAFE
FOR DRINKING
The minimum acceptable sign shall have black letters at least one-inch high
located on a red background. (Ord. #2006-865, Oct. 2006)
18-310. Violations. The requirements contained herein shall apply to
all premises served by the city water system whether located inside or outside
the corporate limits and are hereby made a part of the conditions required to be
met for the city to provide water services to any premises. Such action, being
essential for the protection of the water distribution system against the entrance
of contamination which may render the water unsafe healthwise, or otherwise
undesirable, shall be enforced rigidly without regard to location of the premises,
whether inside or outside the corporate limits.
Any person who neglects or refuses to comply with any of the provisions
of this chapter shall be subject to a penalty under the general penalty clause of
this code. Each day a violation is allowed to occur shall be a separate offense.

part of all contracts for receiving gas service from the city and shall apply
whether the service is based upon contract, agreement, signed application, or
otherwise. (Ord. #85-662, April 1985)
19-302. Obtaining service. A formal application for either original or
additional service must be made and be approved by the city before connection
or meter installation orders will be issued and work performed. (Ord. #85-662,
April 1985)
19-303. Application and contract for service. Each prospective
customer desiring gas service will be required to sign a standard form of
contract before service is supplied. If, for any reason, a customer, after signing
a contract for service, does not take such service by reason of not occupying the
premises or otherwise, he shall reimburse the city for the expense incurred by
reason of its endeavor to furnish said service.
The receipt of a prospective customer's application for service, regardless
of whether or not accompanied by a deposit, shall not obligate the city to render
the service applied for. If the service applied for cannot be supplied in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter and general practice, the liability
of the city to the applicant shall be limited to the return of any deposit made by
such applicant.
Effective September 1, 2012, a Residential Gas Incentive Program is
established for customers obtaining natural gas pursuant to the program.
Pursuant to the program the city will provide a free tap and up to five hundred
feet (500') of any new service line without charge for any customer within the
Change 2, September 17, 2013 19-6
current gas system service area. After the first five hundred feet (500') the
service line cost is one dollar fifty cents ($1.50) per foot. Any customer
participating in the program must have a natural gas appliance properly and
permanently installed in the residence or accessory structure, complete the
proper application and post the appropriate deposit and connection fee. In
addition, the customer must maintain gas service for twelve (12) consecutive
months. Discontinuing service prior to the expiration of twelve (12) consecutive
months will result in the customer being charged for the cost of the service line
at a prorated monthly rate. This gas incentive program is in addition to and
supplemental of the Standard Application and Contract for Service which
remains available at the customer's option. (Ord. #85-662, April 1985, as
amended by Ord. #2012-947, Sept. 2012)
19-304. Meter deposit. A deposit per meter connection will be required
of all domestic customers. Deposits required of customers other than residential
customers shall be determined by the city manager and gas inspector, based on
an estimate of the monthly use of gas. Deposits shall be returned to the
customer upon cessation of services and payment in full of bills. (Ord. #85-662,
April 1985)
19-305. Connection charges. Customers who apply for gas service will
be charged a fee for the installation of any new service line up to one hundred
(100) feet. In all cases that part of a service line in excess of this allowable
distance to the meter installation shall be installed at the cost of the customer,
but shall become the property of the municipal natural gas system. Service
installation for old customers at new locations will be handled as a new
connection; however, no charge will be made if a service connection at the new
location exists.
Effective September 1, 2012, in addition to and supplementary to the
foregoing, a customer opting to utilize the city's residential gas incentive
program (§ 19-303), shall not be required to pay a tap fee nor will such customer
be charged for the new service line up to five hundred feet (500'); provided the
cost for any service line in excess of five hundred feet (500') is one dollar fifty
cents ($1.50) per foot. (Ord. #85-662, April 1985, as amended by Ord. #2012-947,
Sept. 2012)
19-306. Schedule of rates. All gas service including the meter deposit
referred to in § 19-304, and the connection charge referred to in § 19-405 or the
reconnection charge referred to in § 19-310, shall be furnished under such rate
schedules as the Board of Directors of the Mount Pleasant Gas Department may
adopt from time to time by appropriate ordinance or resolution. (Ord. #85-662,
April 1985)
Change 3, December 19, 2017 19-7
19-307. Access to facilities. The application for service shall include
a permit from the customer allowing access to the meter, regulator, and service
line by the officials or employees of the municipal natural gas system. All lines,
regardless of how installed, up to and including the meter, shall be the property
of the municipal natural gas system. (Ord. #85-662, April 1985)
19-308. Customer billing and payment policy. (1) Gas bills shall be
rendered monthly and shall designate a standard net payment period for all
customers of not less than ten (10) days after the date of the bill. Failure to
receive a bill will not release a customer from payment obligation. There is
established for all customers a late payment charge not to exceed ten percent
(10%) for any portion of the bill paid after the net payment period.
(2) The customer's bill should be paid on or before the fifteenth day of
each month in order to receive the net price on the monthly bill. Payments
received after the fifteenth of each month, but prior to the twenty-fifth of each
month, will incur a ten percent (10%) late penalty charge.
(3) If a customer fails to make payment by the twenty-fifth of each
month, then an automatic twenty-five dollar ($25.00) service fee will be added.
In addition thereto, the termination of services process as set forth in § 19-309,
termination or refusal of service, shall be commenced.
(4) Payment must be received no later than the due date. If the due
date falls on Saturday, Sunday or a city holiday, net payment will be accepted
if paid on the next business day.
(5) Customers may receive an extension to pay their monthly bill upon
written request to the city manager or the director of public works. To receive
an extension, the customer must make the request at least two (2) days prior to
the disconnect date and have justifiable cause. Further, the customer must pay
fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding bill at the time the payment extension
agreement is initiated and the remaining fifty percent (50%) within two (2)
weeks from said date. A request for a payment extension is limited to two (2) per
year if based upon justifiable cause and a second request may not be made while
an extension is in effect. Failure to abide with the terms and conditions of a
payment extension request shall disqualify a customer from receiving another
extension.
(6) If a meter fails to register properly, or if a meter is removed to be
tested or repaired, or if water is received other than through a meter, the city
reserves the right to render an estimated bill based on the best information
available. (Ord. #85-662, April 1985, as replaced by Ord. #2011-930, June
2011, and amended by Ord. #2012-942, March 2012, and Ord. #2017-1010, Oct.

(a) These rules and regulations, including the non-payment of
bills;
(b) The customer's application for service;
(c) The customer's contract for service.
The right to discontinue service shall apply to all gas services received through
collective single connections or services, even though more than one (1) customer
or tenant is furnished services therefrom, and even though the delinquency or
violation is limited to only one (1) such customer or tenant.
(2) Termination of service. Written notice shall be provided to the
customer before termination of gas service according to the following terms and
conditions:
(a) Written notice of the termination (cut off) of gas service shall
be conspicuously provided on customer's bills and shall include the
following information:
(i) Payment terms;
(ii) Late payment penalty;
(iii) Customer's right to hearing with information on how
to request a hearing; and
(iv) Clear language regarding cut off if not paid by a date
certain. In the event of a termination (cut off) of gas service for a
reason other than the non-payment of bills, a separate notice will
be provided to the customer directly, or if the customer is not
available, by notice left at a location conspicuous to the customer
at the place of service.
(b) Each customer has the right to a hearing prior to
termination of services. Customers shall be notified of their right to a
hearing as provided in the preceding section. Hearings for service
termination, including for non-payment of bills, will be held by
appointment at city hall between the hours of 8:00 A.M. and 4:00 P.M. on
any business day or by special request or appointment a hearing may be
scheduled outside those hours.
(c) Termination will not be made on any preceding day when
the water and/or sewer department is scheduled to be closed.
(d) If a customer does not request a hearing or in the case of
non-payment of a bill does not make payment of the bill or does not
otherwise correct the problem that resulted in the termination in a
manner satisfactory to the gas department, same shall proceed as noted
on the customer's billing.
(e) Service termination for any reason shall be reconnected only
after the payment of all charges due for all accounts the customer may
have with the city, plus the payment of a reconnection charge.
19-9
(f) With respect to any customer whose service has been
terminated and whose service has not been reinstated in accordance with
the provisions hereof on or by the twenty-fifth day of the month following
termination, the account for such customer shall be closed and any
deposit related to such account shall be applied to delinquent bills, late
penalty charges and service fees. (Ord. #85-662, April 1985, as replaced
by Ord. #2011-931, June 2011)
19-310. Reconnection charge. Customers who have their service
discontinued for any reason and make applications for reinstallation at the same
location within twelve (12) months will be charged a fee. No one other than the
gas inspector or his assistants shall be authorized to cut gas on or off.
(Ord. #85-662, April 1985)
19-311. Termination of service by customer. Customers who have
fulfilled their contract terms and wish to discontinue service must give at least
three (3) days notice to that effect unless the contract specifies otherwise.
Notice to discontinue service prior to the expiration of a contract term will not
relieve the customer from any minimum or guaranteed payment under such
contract or applicable rate schedule.
When service is being furnished to an occupant of premises under a
contract not in the occupant's name, the city reserves the right to impose the
following conditions on the right of the customer to discontinue service under
such a contract:
(1) Written notice of the customer's desire for such service to be
discontinued shall be required; and the city shall have the right to continue such
service for a period of not to exceed ten (10) days after receipt of such written
notice, during which time the customer shall be responsible for all charges for
such service. If the city should continue service after such ten (10) day period
subsequent to the receipt of the customer's written notice to discontinue service,
the customer shall not be responsible for charges for any service furnished after
the expiration of such ten (10) day period.
(2) During such ten (10) day period, or thereafter, the occupant of
premises to which service has been ordered discontinued by a customer other
than such occupant may be allowed by the city to enter into a contract for
service in the occupant's own name with respect to a new application for service.
(Ord. #85-662, April 1985)
19-312. Inspections. The city shall have the right, but shall not be
obligated, to inspect any installation or piping system before gas service is
furnished or at any later time. The city reserves the right to refuse service or
to discontinue service to any premises not meeting standards fixed by municipal
ordinances regulating building and plumbing, or not in accordance with any
special contract, these rules and regulations, or other requirements of the city.
19-10
Any failure to inspect or reject a customer's installation or piping system
shall not render the city liable or responsible for any loss or damage which
might have been avoided had such inspection or rejection been made.

any certificate, require a new application and examination of any gas installing
agency.

or imperfect or defective work done by such installing agency, or by any person
in the employ or under the supervision of such installing agency while acting in
the scope and course of their employment. Said bond shall be so conditioned as
to require the installing agency to comply with all of the provisions of the city's
gas code as herein defined and adopted or any provisions, revisions,
amendments, or supplements which might be made or added thereto, from time
to time. In such bond the qualified gas installing agency shall indemnify and
save harmless the City of Mount Pleasant, Tennessee and all persons therein
from loss, costs, or damages caused by negligence or inadequate, imperfect, or
defective work done by such installing agency or any of its employees. Said bond
shall be filed and remain on file with the City Recorder of the City of Mount
Pleasant, Tennessee.
(9) The bond hereinbefore provided shall contain a provision that the
surety company issuing the same shall not cancel the bond without notifying the
Recorder of the City of Mount Pleasant, Tennessee and the gas inspector as

five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000.00) property damage as to each
property owner, or one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) in the aggregate for all
damages to property, and which policy shall provide that in the event the same
is terminated or canceled for any reason, notice of such cancellation shall
simultaneously be given to the city recorder. Upon the termination or
cancellation of said insurance policy, the certificate of an installing agency,
which shall have been theretofore issued by the gas inspector, shall be
immediately revoked or in the discretion of the gas inspector, suspended.
The insurance policy hereinbefore provided shall be issued by some
insurance company authorized to do business in the State of Tennessee but shall
be subject to approval by the gas inspector and/or the Mount Pleasant Gas
System Board of Directors, and said insurance policy shall at all times as
hereinbefore provided, be kept on file in the office of the city recorder.

mixture thereof, unless such person, firm, or corporation holds a valid certificate
issued by the gas inspector as hereinbefore provided. The gas inspector or any
person designated by him or in his employ shall not connect the gas piping or

modification, change to, conversion or repair of any gas house piping or gas
appliances, as hereinabove provided, in the City of Mount Pleasant, Tennessee
or in its gas service territory or receiving gas from the gas system of the City of
Mount Pleasant, Tennessee unless such person, firm or corporation is a duly
qualified installing agency as herein provided and defined, and the fact that
such work has been done by other than an authorized installing agency,
qualified as herein provided, shall be sufficient to hold and render the property
owner responsible for the violation of this chapter and amenable to all
provisions of the same.
(13) Penalty. It is hereby declared a misdemeanor and punishable by
a fine of fifty dollars ($50.00) for each and every violation on a daily basis. (as

the meter has been turned off; the gas inspector shall be immediately notified
and after obtaining a permit and the repairs have been made and approved, the
meter shall be turned on and service restored, provided, however, that this
turning on and off of the gas may be done only by the gas inspector or any

natural gas distribution system or for any person to tap or interfere with any
gas line or gas pipe, constituting a part of the natural gas distribution system;
or for any person to turn on the gas to any premises at any time except as
directed by the gas inspector or his duly authorized representative.
It shall be unlawful and a misdemeanor for any person, firm, association
or corporation to violate any of the foregoing provisions of this chapter and each
day's violation shall be considered a separate offense. Upon conviction for the
violation of the foregoing provisions of this chapter, the offender or offenders
shall be fined fifty dollars ($50.00). (as added by Ord. #2010-911, June 2010)

upon the City of Mount Pleasant, Tennessee any liability or responsibility for
damages to any person injured by any defect in any gas piping or appliance
mentioned herein or by installation thereof, nor shall the City of Mount
Pleasant, Tennessee, or any official or employee thereof, be held as assuming

spend more than $500, and candidates for other offices that pay at least $100 a
month are required to file campaign financial disclosure reports. Civil penalties
of $25 per day are authorized for late filings. Penalties up to the greater of
$10,000 or 15 percent of the amount in controversy may be levied for filings
more than 35 days late. It is a Class E felony for a multicandidate political
campaign committee with a prior assessment record to intentionally fail to file
a required campaign financial report. Further, the treasurer of such a committee
may be personally liable for any penalty levied by the Registry of Election
Finance (T.C.A. § 2-10-101118).
Contributions to political campaigns for municipal candidates are limited to:
a. $1,000 from any person (including corporations and other
organizations);
b. $5,000 from a multicandidate political campaign committee;
c. $20,000 from the candidate;
d. $20,000 from a political party; and
e. $75,000 from multicandidate political campaign committees.
The Registry of Election Finance may impose a maximum penalty of $10,000 or
115 percent of the amount of all contributions made or accepted in excess of
these limits, whichever is greater (T.C.A. § 2-10-301310).
Each candidate for local public office must prepare a report of contributions that
includes the receipt date of each contribution and a political campaign
committees statement indicating the date of each expenditure (T.C.A.
§ 2-10-105, 107).
Candidates are prohibited from converting leftover campaign funds to personal
use. The funds must be returned to contributors, put in the volunteer public
education trust fund, or transferred to another political campaign fund, a
political party, a charitable or civic organization, educational institution, or an
organization described in 26 U.S.C. 170(c) (T.C.A. § 2-10-114).
2. Conflicts of Interest.
Municipal officers and employees are permitted to have an indirect interest in
contracts with their municipality if the officers or employees publicly
A-2
acknowledge their interest. An indirect interest is any interest that is not
direct, except it includes a direct interest if the officer is the only supplier of
goods or services in a municipality. A direct interest is any contract with the
official himself or with any business of which the official is the sole proprietor,
a partner, or owner of the largest number of outstanding shares held by any
individual or corporation. Except as noted, direct interests are absolutely
prohibited (T.C.A. § 6-2-402, T.C.A. § 6-20-205, T.C.A. § 6-54-107108,
T.C.A. § 12-4-101102).
3. Disclosure conflict of interests.
Conflict of interest disclosure reports by any candidate or appointee to a local
public office are required under T.C.A. §§ 8-50-501 et seq. Detailed financial
information is required, including the names of corporations or organizations in
which the official or one immediate family member has an investment of over
$10,000 or 5 percent of the total capital. This must be filed no later than 30 days
after the last day legally allowed for qualifying as a candidate. As long as an
elected official holds office, he or she must file an amended statement with the
Tennessee Ethics Commission or inform that office in writing that an amended
statement is not necessary because nothing has changed. The amended
statement must be filed no later than January 31 of each year
(T.C.A. § 8-50-504).
4. Consulting fee prohibition for elected municipal officials.
Any member or member-elect of a municipal governing body is prohibited under
T.C.A. § 2-10-124 from knowingly receiving any form of compensation for
consulting services other than compensation paid by the state, county, or
municipality. Violations are punishable as Class C felonies if the conduct
constitutes bribery under T.C.A. § 39-16-102. Other violations are prosecuted
as Class A misdemeanors. A conviction under either statute disqualifies the
offender from holding any office under the laws or Constitution of the State of
Tennessee.
Consulting services under T.C.A. § 2-10-122 means services to advise or assist
a person or entity in influencing legislative or administrative action, as that
term is defined in § 3-6-301, relative to the municipality or county represented
by that official. Consulting services also means services to advise or assist a
person or entity in maintaining, applying for, soliciting or entering into a
contract with the municipality represented by that official. "Consulting
services" does not mean the practice or business of law in connection with
representation of clients by a licensed attorney in a contested case action,
administrative proceeding or rule making procedure;
A-3
"Compensation" does not include an honorarium under T.C.A. § 2-10-116, or
certain gifts under T.C.A. § 3-6-305(b), which are defined and prohibited under
those statutes.
The attorney general construes "Consulting services" to include advertising or
other informational services that directly promote specific legislation or
specifically target legislators or state executive officials. Advertising aimed at
the general public that does not promote or otherwise attempt to influence
specific legislative or administrative action is not prohibited. Op. Atty.Gen. No.
05-096, June 17, 2005.
5. Bribery offenses.
a. A person who is convicted of bribery of a public servant, as defined in
T.C.A. § 39-16-102, or a public servant who is convicted of accepting a bribe
under the statute, commits a Class B felony.
b. Under T.C.A. § 39-16-103, a person convicted of bribery is disqualified
from ever holding office again in the state. Conviction while in office will not
end the persons term of office under this statute, but a person may be removed
from office pursuant to any law providing for removal or expulsion existing prior
to the conviction.
c. A public servant who requests a pecuniary benefit for performing an
act the person would have had to perform without the benefit or for a lesser fee,
may be convicted of a Class E felony for solicitation of unlawful compensation
under T.C.A. § 39-16-104.
d. A public servant convicted of buying and selling in regard to offices
under T.C.A. § 39-16-105, may be found guilty of a Class C felony. Offenses
under this statute relevant to public officials are selling, resigning, vacating, or
refusing to qualify and enter upon the duties of the office for pecuniary gain, or
entering into any kind of borrowing or selling for anything of value with regard
to the office.
e. Exceptions to 1, 3, and 4, above include lawful contributions to political
campaigns, and a trivial benefit that is incidental to personal, professional,
or business contacts in which there is no danger of undermining an officials
impartiality.
6. Official misconduct. official oppression, misuse of official information.
a. Public misconduct offenses under Tennessee Code Annotated § 39-16-
401 through § 39-16-404 apply to officers, elected officials, employees,
A-4
candidates for nomination or election to public office, and persons performing
a governmental function under claim of right even though not qualified to do so.
b. Official misconduct under Tennessee Code Annotated § 39-16-402
pertains to acts related to a public servants office or employment committed
with an intent to obtain a benefit or to harm another. Acts constituting an
offense include the unauthorized exercise of official power, acts exceeding ones
official power, failure to perform a duty required by law, and receiving a benefit
not authorized by law. Offenses under this section constitute a Class E felony.
c. Under Tennessee Code Annotated § 39-16-403, Official oppression,
a public servant acting in an official capacity who intentionally arrests, detains,
frisks, etc., or intentionally prevents another from enjoying a right or privilege
commits a Class E felony.
d. Tennessee Code Annotated § 39-16-404 prohibits a public servants use
of information attained in an official capacity, to attain a benefit or aid another
which has not been made public. Offenses under the section are Class B
misdemeanors.
e. A public servant convicted for any of the offenses summarized in
sections 2-4 above shall be removed from office or discharged from a position of
employment, in addition to the criminal penalties provided for each offense.
Additionally, an elected or appointed official is prohibited from holding another
appointed or elected office for ten (10) years. At-will employees convicted will
be discharged, but are not prohibited from working in public service for any
specific period. Subsequent employment is left to the discretion of the hiring
entity for those employees. Tennessee Code Annotated § 39-16-406.
7. Ouster law.
Some Tennessee city charters include ouster provisions, but the only general law
procedure for removing elected officials from office is judicial ouster. Cities are
entitled to use their municipal charter ouster provisions, or they may proceed
under state law.
The judicial ouster procedure applies to all officers, including people holding any
municipal office of trust or profit. (Note that it must be an office filled by an
officer, distinguished from an employee holding a position that does not
have the attributes of an office.) The statute makes any officer subject to such
removal who shall knowingly or willfully misconduct himself in office, or who
shall knowingly or willfully neglect to perform any duty enjoined upon such
officer by any of the laws of the state, or who shall in any public place be in a
state of intoxication produced by strong drink voluntarily taken, or who shall
A-5
engage in any form of illegal gambling, or who shall commit any act constituting
a violation of any penal statute involving moral turpitude (T.C.A. § 8-47-101).
T.C.A. § 8-47-122(b) allows the taxing of costs and attorney fees against the
complainant in an ouster suit if the complaint subsequently is withdrawn or
deemed meritless. Similarly, after a final judgment in an ouster suit,
governments may order reimbursement of attorney fees to the officer targeted
in a failed ouster attempt
(T.C.A. § 8-47-121).
The local attorney general or city attorney has a legal duty to investigate a
written allegation that an officer has been guilty of any of the mentioned
offenses. If he or she finds that there is reasonable cause for such complaint, he
shall forthwith institute proceedings in the Circuit, Chancery, or Criminal Court
of the proper county. However, with respect to the city attorney, there may be
an irreconcilable conflict between that duty and the city attorneys duties to the
city, the mayor, and the rules of professional responsibility governing attorneys.
Also, an attorney general or city attorney may act on his or her own initiative
without a formal complaint (T.C.A. § 8-47-101102). The officer must be
removed from office if found guilty (T.C.A. § 8-47-120).

1-105.201 Public Provisions
These regulations are not intended to interfere with,
abrogate, or annul any other ordinance, rule, or regulation,
statute, or other provision of law. Where any provision of

herein, such shall be considered a private contract between
the parties of interest, and as such is beyond the
jurisdiction of the planning commission.
1-105.3 Severability
If any part or provision of these regulations or application
thereof to any person or circumstances is adjudged invalid by any
court of competent jurisdiction, such judgment shall be confined

involved in the controversy in which such judgment shall have been
rendered and shall not affect or impair the validity of the
remainder of these regulations or the application thereof to other
persons or circumstances. The planning commission hereby declares
that it would have enacted the remainder of these regulations
without any such part, provision, or application.

These regulations shall not be construed as abating any action now
pending under, or by virtue of prior subdivision regulations; or as
discontinuing, abating, modifying, or altering any penalty accruing or
about to accrue; or as affecting the liability of any person; or as
waiving any right of the planning commission under any section or
provision existing at the time of adoption of these regulations; or as
vacating or annulling any rights obtained by any person by lawful action
of the planning commission, except as expressly provided otherwise in
these regulations.
1-106.1 Previously Approved Subdivisions
1-106.101 Unexpired Preliminary Approval
The approval granted on any plat prior to the effective date
of these regulations shall remain in force and effect for the
time stipulated by the regulations under which the
approval was first granted.
1-106.102 Expired Preliminary Approval
In any instance in which the period of preliminary approval
shall have passed with some portion of the subdivision not
having received final approval, and the applicant wishes an
5
extension of the preliminary approval, the planning
commission may:
(1) permit the remaining portion of the subdivision to be
constructed and to receive approval under provisions set
forth in the regulations whereby preliminary approval
was originally granted, or
(2) stipulate that the plat is null and void and that a new
plat be presented subject to the provisions of these
regulations.
In making this determination, the planning commission shall
consider all pertinent facts available to it. The current
state and active pursuit of construction and development
activities within the subdivision shall be given due
consideration in the course of the planning commissions
deliberation on this question.
1-107 Amendments
1-107.1 Enactment
For the purpose of providing for the public health, safety, and
general welfare the planning commission may from time to time amend
these regulations. Before the adoption of any amendment to these
regulations, a public hearing thereon shall be held by the planning
commission, as required by Chapter 3, Title 13, Tennessee Code
Annotated, the time and place of which shall be given in a newspaper
of general circulation.

or changed language. Each such new or replacement page
shall have the amendment number and shall be dated so as to
indicate the date of the last revision of the page.

shall be numbered consecutively and printed on pages
separate from any other amendment and in a manner which
fully states any language deleted from these regulations
6
and any language added and the place in the text of each
such change.
1-108 Resubdivision of Land
1-108.1 Procedures for Resubdivision
If any change in an approved or recorded subdivision plat would
affect the layout of any public street, alley, or road (hereinafter
referred to as public way) shown on such plat, or area reserved
thereon for public use, or any lot line, or if it would affect any
map, plan, or plat legally recorded before the adoption of any
subdivision regulations, such amendment shall be approved by the
planning commission by the same procedure, rules, and regulations
as for a subdivision.
1-108.2 Procedures for Subdivision Where Future Resubdivision
Is Foreseen
Whenever a parcel of land is subdivided and the subdivision plat
shows one or more lots containing more than one acre of land or
double the minimum required area for any zoning district in which
the lot is located, and the planning commission has reason to
believe that any such lot(s) will be subdivided into smaller
building sites, the planning commission may require that the
subdivision and development of such parcel of land allow for the
future opening of public ways and the ultimate extension of
adjacent public ways. The planning commission may also require that
dedications providing for the future opening and extension of such
public ways be indicated on the plat.
1-109 Conditions
Regulation of the subdivision of land and the attachment of reasonable
conditions to land subdivision are exercises of valid police power
delegated by the state to the planning commission. The developer has the
duty of compliance with reasonable conditions imposed by the planning
commission for design, dedication, improvement, and restrictive use of
the land so as to provide for the physical and economical development
of the jurisdictional area and for the safety and general welfare of
future plot owners in the subdivision and of the community at large.
1-110 Vacation of Plats
7
Any plat or any part of any plat may be vacated by the owner of the
premises, at any time before the sale of any lot described therein, by
a written instrument, to which a copy of such plat shall be attached,
declaring the plat or part of the plat to be vacated. The planning
commission shall follow the same procedure for approval of plats. The
planning commission may reject any such instrument which abridges or
destroys any public rights in any of its public uses, improvements, or
public ways. Such an instrument shall be executed, acknowledged, or
approved, and duly recorded or filed; the instrument shall operate to
void the recorded plat and divest all public rights in the public ways
and public grounds and all dedications laid out or described in such
plat. When any lot or lots have been sold the plat may be vacated in the
manner herein provided only if all of the owners of lots in such platted
area join in the execution of such writing.
1-111 Variances
1-111.1 General
If the planning commission finds that extraordinary hardships or
practical difficulties may result from strict compliance with these
regulations, a variance from these regulations may be granted;
provided, such variance shall not have the effect of nullifying
the general intent and purpose of these regulations and provided,
further, that the planning commission shall not recommend
variations unless it shall make findings based upon written
evidence presented to it in each specific case that:
1. the granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the
public safety, health, or welfare, or be injurious to other
property or improvements in the neighborhood in which the
property is located;
2. the conditions upon which the request for a variance is
based are unique to the property for which the variance is
sought and are not applicable generally to other property;
3. because of the particular physical surroundings, shape, or
topographical condition of the specific property involved,
a particular hardship (not self-imposed( to the owner would
result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the
strict letter of these regulations were carried out; and
8
4. the variance will not in any manner alter the provisions of
the land development plan, the major street or road plan,
or any zoning ordinance.
Where the planning commission concludes that the purpose of these
regulations may be specifically served to an equal or greater
extent by an alternative proposal, condition, or circumstance, if
may approve other variations to these regulations.
1-111.2 Procedures
Each and every variance or modification of these subdivision
regulations sought by a subdivider shall be specifically applied
for in the numerical order of the subdivision regulations, in
writing by the subdivider in letter form. Any condition shown on
the plat which would require a variance or modification shall
constitute a ground for disapproval of the plat unless such special
application for modification variance is made. In approving any
variation from these regulations the planning commission shall
state fully in the minutes the grounds for the variation and all
of the facts upon which the decision is made.
1-111.3 Conditions
In approving variations, the planning commission may impose such
conditions as in its judgment will secure substantially the
objectives, standards, and requirements of the regulations.

2-101.3 Official Submission Date
For the purpose of these regulations, for both major and minor
subdivisions, the date of the regular meeting of the planning
commission at which the public hearing on the final subdivision
plat, including any adjourned date thereof, is closed, shall
constitute the official submittal date of the plat at which the
statutory period required in Section 13-3-404 and 13-4-304,
Tennessee Code Annotated, for formal approval or disapproval of
the plat shall commence.
2-101.4 Policy of Flood-Prone Areas
In determining the appropriateness of land subdivision at any site
containing a flood-prone area, the planning commission, in
reviewing any plat, shall consider the policy and purpose set forth
in Section 1-104 of these regulations and, additionally:
1. the danger to life and property due to the increased flood
heights or velocities, either potential or actual, caused by
subdivision fill, roads, and intended uses;
2. the danger that intended uses or improvements may be swept
onto other lands or downstream to the injury of other;
3. the adequacy of proposed water supply, sanitation, and
drainage systems, and the ability of these systems to function
under flood conditions;
4. the susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effect of such damage upon the
individual owner;
16
5. the importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community at large;
6. the requirements of the subdivision for a waterfront
location;
7. the availability of alternative locations not subject to
flooding for the proposed subdivision and land uses;
8. the compatibility of the proposed uses with existing
development or development anticipated in the foreseeable
future;
9. the relationship of the proposed subdivision to the land
development plan and the floodplain management program for
the area;
10. the safety of access to the property for emergency vehicles
in times of flood;
11. the expected heights, duration, velocity, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site;
12. the costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public
utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and
water systems, public ways, and bridges; and
13. the effect of the proposed subdivision upon the planning
commissions participation in the National Flood Insurance
Program, if such planning commission is, or elects to be, in
the program.
No subdivision or part thereof shall be approved by the planning
commission if proposed levees, fills, structures, or other features
within the subdivision will individually or collectively, increase
flood flows, heights, duration, or damages. The regulatory limits
(the one hundred-year flood level) shall be determined from the
latest approved flood study for the jurisdictional area, and any
subsequent revisions thereto. Specific engineering studies are to
be formulated by the developer in those areas in which flood data
are not currently available, if deemed necessary by the planning
commission.
17
In any instance in which the planning commission determines that a
proposed subdivision may affect the flood height, velocity, or
duration in any flood-prone area outside its jurisdiction, the
commission shall take all actions necessary and proper to ensure
the coordinated review of the development with the appropriate
governmental agencies of the affected area.
In approving plans for subdivision of land containing flood-prone
areas, the planning commission shall ensure that development will
proceed in such a way that property lying within any floodway, as
defined by these regulations, will be maintained in a manner as
prescribed by any zoning ordinance. The planning commission shall
also ensure that development within any floodway fringe area
(within the one hundred-year flood level) will be protected
adequately against potential flood hazards by the methods
prescribed in Article IV of these regulations.
The planning commission shall disapprove the subdivision of any
land containing a flood-prone area when the commission determines
that subdivision plans are not consistent with the policy stated
in this section.
2-101.5 Special Provisions Governing Unit Ownership
(Condominium) Subdivisions
2-101.501 General Provisions
a. Intent  This section is intended to augment the general
legislation of Sections 66-27-101 through 66-27-123,

regulations.
2-102 Sketch Plat (Major Subdivisions Only)
2-102.1 Purpose of Sketch Plat
The applicant shall submit a sketch plat to the planning commission
for approval. The sketch plat is to be a concept plan for design
purposes and should be used to discover all factors which may have
an impact on the proposed development and to advise the subdivider
of various possibilities before substantial amounts of time and
money have been invested in a very detail proposal which may contain
elements contrary to these regulations.

disapproval of a preliminary plat. The preliminary plat shall be
prepared in accordance with Section 5-201 and:
1. be presented at the office of the enforcing officer at least
fourteen (14) days prior to a regular (officially opened)
meeting of the planning commission;

of such opposite land. The lot pattern of surrounding
development shall be shown within that area located within
two hundred (200) feet of the proposed development;
3. be accompanied by a minimum of ten (10) copies of the
preliminary plat as described herein; and
4. be accompanied by a minimum of four (4) copies of construction
plans as described in Section 5-103, of these regulations.
2-103.2 Administrative Review
An administrative review meeting shall be conducted on the
preliminary plat, construction plans, and any exhibits submitted
in conformance with these regulations. This review shall include
the staff assistant to the planning commission and any other
appropriate governmental representative. The review shall be held
prior to the regularly scheduled planning commission meeting at
20
which the plat is to be reviewed. The findings of the review
committee shall be presented to the planning commission.
With expert assistance, as necessary, the subdivider shall prepare
a report, on any proposed subdivision containing or abutting a
floodprone area. Such report shall estimate the discharge of the
regulatory flood; determine the specific flooding threat at the
site of the proposed subdivision; and indicate whether the
subdivision is located in a floodway or floodway fringe area by:
1. calculation of water surface elevations and regulatory flood
protections based upon a hydraulic analysis of the capacity
of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the
regulatory flood;
2. computation of the floodway required to convey the regulatory
flood without increasing natural flood heights of the
regulatory flood more than one foot at any point; and
3. unless otherwise established, computation of increase in
flood heights caused by any encroachment shall be based upon
the reasonable assumption that there will be an equal degree
of encroachment on both sides of the stream within that reach.
No increase in flood storage attributable to encroachments on
the floodplain of any river or stream shall be permitted in
any one reach or for the cumulative effect of several reaches.
2-103.3 Notice of Hearing
A planning commission shall hold a hearing as required by Chapter
3 and 4 of Title 13, Tennessee Code Annotated, on each plat brought
before it.
2-103.4 Preliminary Approval

construction plans, exhibits, and the results of administrative
review, the applicant shall be advised of any required changes.
The planning commission shall approve, conditionally approve, or
disapprove the preliminary plat within thirty (30) days after date
of the regular meeting of the planning commission at which the
hearing on preliminary approval, including adjourned date thereof,
is closed.
A certificate of preliminary approval shall be issued by the
secretary of the planning commission, upon demand, and the
21
applicant may proceed to apply for final subdivision plat approval
in the manner prescribed by Section 2-104 of these regulations.
After the planning commission approves, conditionally approves, or
disapproves the preliminary plat, one copy of the proposed
preliminary plat shall be returned to the developer with the date
of approval, conditional approval, or disapproval thereon. If a
preliminary plat is disapproved the planning commission shall state
specific reasons for disapproval which shall be entered into the
minutes of the meeting.
Before the planning commission approves a preliminary plat showing
land for any public use, the planning commission shall obtain
approval for the land reservation from the planning commission or
appropriate governmental agency.
2-103.5 Public Improvements
The planning commission may require that all public improvements
be installed and dedicated prior to the signing of the final
subdivision plat by the secretary of the planning commission. If
the planning commission does not require that all public
improvements be installed and dedicated prior to signing of the
final subdivision plat, an adequate performance bond shall be
approved. The amount of such bond shall be established by the
planning commission based upon the recommendation of the
appropriate governmental representative or by receipt of cost bids
from two (2) or more independent contracting firms equal to the
cost of all necessary improvements plus an additional fifteen (15)
percent to cover inflation shall be added. It is the subdividers
responsibility to furnish these estimates to the planning
commission.
Such bond shall be submitted by the applicant at the time of
application for final subdivision plat approval. The planning
commission shall require the applicant to indicate on the plat all
public ways and improvements to be dedicated; all districts for
water, fire, and utility improvements which shall be required to
be established or extended; and any other special requirements
deemed necessary by the planning commission in order for the
subdivision plat to conform to the major street or road plan and
the land development plan for the jurisdictional area.
2-103.6 Effective Period of Preliminary Approval
The approval of a preliminary plat shall be effective for a period
of twelve (12) months, at the end of which time final approval of
22
the subdivision plat must have been obtained from the planning
commission, although the plat need not have been signed and filed
with the county register. Any plat not receiving final approval
within the period of time set forth herein shall be null and void,
and the developer shall be required to submit a new plat for
approval subject to any zoning provisions and the subdivision
regulations currently in effect. Prior to the expiration of the
preliminary approval and upon proper request by the developer, the
approval may be extended for one (1) additional year if the
commission deems such to be advisable based upon progress made in
developing subdivision.

(30) days after submission of the plat, approve, modify, or
disapprove the final subdivision plat by resolution, which shall
set forth in detail any conditions to which the approval is subject,
or reasons for disapproval. In no event shall the period of time
stipulated by the planning commission for completion of required
improvements exceed one (1) year from the date of final resolution.
Failure of the planning commission to act upon a plat within the
prescribed time shall be deemed approval of the plat, and in such
event, a certificate of approval, entitling the subdivider to
proceed as specified in Subsection 2-104.4 and Section 2-105 of
these regulations shall be issued, upon demand, by the secretary
of the planning commission. The applicant, however, may agree to
an extension of the time for planning commission review.

the subdivider with the date of approval, conditional approval, or
disapproval noted thereon.
2-104.4 Vested Rights
No vested rights shall accrue to any plat be reason of preliminary
or final approval until the actual signing of the plat by the
secretary of the planning commission. All requirements, conditions,
or regulations adopted by the planning commission, applicable to
the particular subdivision or to all subdivision generally, shall
be deemed a condition of approval for any subdivision prior to the
time of the signing of the final plat by the secretary of the
planning commission. Where the planning commission has required
the installation of improvements prior to the signing of the final
plat, the planning commission shall not modify unreasonably the
conditions set forth in the resolution of final approval.
2-105 Signing and Recording of Subdivision Plat
25
2-105.1 Signing of Plat
1. When a bond is required, the secretary of the planning
commission shall endorse approval on the plat after the bond
has been approved by the planning commission and after all
the conditions of the resolution pertaining to the plat have
been satisfied.
2. When installation of improvements is required, the secretary
of the planning commission shall endorse approval on the plat
after all conditions of the resolution have been satisfied
and all improvements satisfactorily completed. There shall be
written evidence that the required public facilities have
been installed in a manner satisfactory to the planning
commission as shown on certifications by the appropriate
governmental representative(s) that necessary land
dedications and improvements have been accomplished.
3. When the conditions of this section are satisfied, the
secretary shall sign the permanent reproducible original of
the subdivision plat.
2-105.2 Recording of Plat
It shall be the responsibility of the enforcing officer to ensure
the plat is filed with the county registers office within ninety
(90) days of the date of signature. Simultaneously, with the filing

ASSURANCE FOR COMPLETION AND MAINTENANCE OF IMPROVEMENTS
3-101 Improvements and Performance Bond
3-101.1 Completion of Improvements
Before the final subdivision plat is signed by the planning
commission officer specified in Subsection 2-105.1 of these
regulations, all applicants shall complete, in accordance with the
planning commissions decision and to the satisfaction of the
appropriate governmental representative, all public way, sanitary,
and other improvements, including lot improvements on the
individual lots of the subdivision, as required in these
regulations and approved by the planning commission, and shall
dedicate such improvements to the planning commission free and
clear of all liens and encumbrances on the property and public
improvements thus dedicated.
3-101.2 Surety Instrument
The planning commission at its discretion may waive the requirement
that the applicant complete and dedicate all public improvements
prior to the signing of the final subdivision plat by providing
that, as an alternative, the applicant post a bond at the time of
submission for final subdivision approval in an amount estimated
by the planning commission as sufficient to guarantee to the
governing body the satisfactory construction, installation, and
dedication of the uncompleted portion of required improvements.
(See Subsection 2-103.5)
Such performance bond shall comply with all statutory requirements
and shall be satisfactory to legal counsel as to form, sufficiency,
and manner of execution, as set forth in these regulations. The
period within which required improvements must be completed shall
be specified by the planning commission in the resolution approving
the final subdivision plat and shall be incorporated in the bond
and shall not exceed two (2) years from date of the final approval.
Such bond shall be approved by the planning commission as to amount
and conditions. The planning commission may, upon proof of
difficulty, extend the completion date set forth in such bond for
a maximum period of one (1) additional year. The planning
commission may accept at any time during the period of such bond a
substitution of principal.
3-101.3 Temporary Improvements
28
The applicant shall build and pay for all costs of temporary
improvements required by the planning commission, and shall
maintain them to a reasonable satisfaction for the period specified

resolution or ordinance from officers or agencies authorized to
act on their behalf agreeing to comply with the provisions of this
article.
3-101.6 Failure to Complete Improvements
In subdivisions for which no performance bond has been posted, if
the improvements are not completed within the period specified by
the planning commission in the resolution approving the plat, the
approval shall be deemed to have expired. In those cases in which
a performance bond has been posted and required improvements have
not been installed within the terms of such performance bond, the
planning commission thereupon may declare the bond to be in default
and require that all the improvements be installed regardless of
the extent of the building development at the time the bond is
declared to be in default.
3-101.7 Acceptance of Dedication Offers
Acceptance of formal offers of dedication of public ways,
easements, and parks shall be by formal action of the governing
body. Such action shall be in the form of an ordinance recommended
by the planning commission to the governing body. The approval by
the planning commission of a subdivision plat shall not be deemed
to constitute or imply an acceptance by the local government of
any public way, easement, or other ground shown on the plat. The
29
planning commission may require the plat to be endorsed with
appropriate notes to this effect.
3-102 Inspection of Improvements
3l02.l General Procedure
The planning commission may provide for inspection of required
improvements during construction and ensure their satisfactory
completion. If the appropriate governmental representative finds
upon inspection that any of the required improvements has not been
constructed in accordance 7, with the governing body's construction
standards and specifications, the applicant shall be responsible
for completing the improvements to the required standards.
Whenever the cost of improvements is covered by a performance bond,
the applicant and the bonding company shall be liable severally
and jointly for completing said improvements according to
specifications.

required public improvements nor shall the planning
commission release nor reduce a performance bond until the
appropriate governmental representative submits a certificate
stating that all required improvements have been
satisfactorily completed, and until the applicant's engineer
or surveyor has certified to the planning commission and the
appropriate governmental representative (through submission
of a detailed "as built" survey of the subdivision indicating
location, dimensions, construction materials, and any other
information required by the planning commission) that the
layout and the line and grade of all public  ' improvements
are in accordance with the approved construction plans for
the subdivision. Upon such approval and recommendation, the
governing body, thereafter, may accept the dedicated
improvements in accordance with the procedures set forth in
Subsections l-112.107 and 3lOl.7 of these regulations.
3-l02.202 Reduction of Performance Bond

considered adequate by the appropriate governmental representative and
in a form satisfactory to legal counsel in order to assure the
satisfactory condition of the required improvements, including all lot
improvements, for a period of one year after the date of acceptance of
the public improvements by the planning commission.
3-104 Deferral or Waiver of Required Improvements
The planning commission may defer or waive at the time of final approval,
subject to appropriate conditions, the provision of any or all such
improvements as, in its judgment, are not requisite in the interest of
the public health, safety, and general welfare, or which are
inappropriate because of inadequacy or lack of connecting facilities. '
Whenever it is deemed necessary by the planning commission to defer the
construction of any improvement required herein because of incompatible
grades, future planning, inadequate or lack of connecting facilities,
or other reasons, the developer shall either pay his share of the costs
of the future improvements to - the planning commission prior to signing
of the final subdivision plat by the appropriate governmental
representative(s) or post a bond or other surety instrument ensuring
completion of said improvements upon demand of the planning commission.
3-105 Escrow Deposits for Lot Improvements
3l05.l Acceptance of Escrow Funds
Whenever, by reason of the season of the year, any lot improvements
required by these regulations cannot be performed, the enforcing
officer nevertheless may issue a certificate of occupancy upon
accepting a cash escrow deposit in an amount to be determined by
the appropriate governmental representative for the cost of such
improvements; provided, there otherwise is no danger to the health,
safety, or general welfare. The performance bond covering such lot
improvements shall remain in full force and effect.

have not been installed properly at the end of the time period,
the enforcing ~ officer shall provide written notice of two (2)
weeks to the developer requiring him to install the improvements,
and in the event they are not installed properly, in the judgment
of the enforcing officer, he may request the planning commission
to proceed to install or to contract for the installation of the
31
necessary improvements in a sum not to exceed the amount of the
escrow deposit.
At the time of the issuance of the certificate of occupancy for
which escrow moneys are being deposited, the applicant shall obtain
and file with the enforcing officer, prior to obtaining the
certificate of occupancy, a notarized statement from the
purchaser(s) of the premise authorizing the enforcing officer to
install the improvements at the end of the nine (9) month period
in the event the improvements have not been installed properly by
the developer.
3-106 Issuance of Building Permits and Certificates of Occupancy
A. Where a performance bond has been required for a subdivision, or
any section of a subdivision, no certificate of occupancy for any
building in the subdivision or section thereof shall be issued
prior to the completion and dedication of the improvements to the
appropriate governmental unit, as required in the planning
commission's resolution of final approval of the subdivision plat.
B. The extent of public way improvements shall be adequate for
vehicular access by the prospective occupant and by police and fire
equipment prior to the issuance of an occupancy certificate. The
developer shall at the time of the dedication submit monies in
escrow to the planning commission in a sum to be determined by the
appropriate governmental representative.
C. No building permit shall be issued for the final ten (10) percent
of lots in a subdivision, or if ten (10) percent be less than two

commission recommends approval of the final plat or release
of the bond where bond is made in lieu of improvements.
4l0l.4 Character of the Land
Land which the planning commission finds to be unsuitable for
subdivision or development due to flooding, improper drainage,
steep slopes, rock formations, adverse earth formations or
topography, utility easements, or other features which would be
harmful to the safety, health, and general welfare of inhabitants
of the land and surrounding areas shall not be subdivided or
developed unless adequate methods are formulated by the developer
and approved by the planning commission, upon recommendation of
34
any staff assistant serving the planning commission and/or other
governmental representative, if any, to solve the problems created
by the unsuitable land conditions. Such land shall be set aside
for such uses as will not involve such a danger.
Where protection against flood damage is necessary, in the opinion
of the planning commission, flood-damage protection techniques may
include, as deemed appropriate by the planning commission:
1. the imposition of any surety and deed restrictions
enforceable by the planning commission to regulate the future
type and design of uses within the flood-prone areas; and
2. flood protection measures designed so as not to increase,
either individually" or collectively, flood flows, height,
duration, or damages, and so as not to infringe upon the
regulatory floodway.
3. installation of flood warning systems.
4. the use of fill, dikes, levees, and other protective measures.
5. the use of floodproofing measures, which may include:
(a) anchorage to resist flotation and lateral movement.
(b) installation of watertight doors, bulkheads, shutters,
or other similar methods of closure.
(c) reinforcement of walls to resist water pressures.
(d) use of paints, membranes, or mortars to reduce seepage
through walls. *
(e) addition of mass or weight to structures to resist
flotation.
(f) installation of pumps to lower water levels in
structures.
(g) construction of water supply and waste treatment systems
so as to prevent the entrance of or contamination of
flood waters.
(h) installation of pumps or comparable facilities for
subsurface drainage systems to relieve external
foundation wall and basement flood pressures.
(i) building design and construction to resist rupture or
collapse caused by water pressure of floating debris.
(j) installation of valves or controls on sanitary and storm
drains which permit the drains to be closed to prevent
35
backup of sewage and stormwater into buildings or
structures.
(k) location and installation of all electrical equipment,
circuits, and appliances so that they are protected from
inundation by the regulatory flood.
(l) location of storage facilities for chemicals,
explosives, buoyant material, flammable liquids, or
other toxic materials which would be hazardous to the
public health, safety, and welfare at or above the
regulatory flood protection elevation, or design of such
facilities to prevent flotation of storage containers
or damage to storage containers which. could result in
the escape of toxic materials.
The acceptability of any flood protection methods formulated by
the subdivider or his agent shall be determined by the planning
commission, which shall be guided by the policies set forth in
Section 1-104 and Subsection 2-101.4, of these regulations and
Article IV, of the zoning ordinance.
All such flood protection measures shall be designed so as not to
increase, either individually or collectively, flood flows,
heights, duration, or damages so as not to infringe upon the
regulatory floodway.
4l0l.5 Subdivision Name
The proposed name of the subdivision shall not duplicate or too
closely approximate phonetically the name of any other subdivision
in the area covered by these regulations. The planning commission
shall have authority to designate the name of the subdivision which
shall be determined at sketch or preliminary plat approval.
4-102 Lot Requirements
4l02.l Lot Arrangement
4-102.101 General
The lot arrangement shall be such that there will be no
foreseeable difficulties, for reasons of topography, flood
hazards, or other conditions in securing building permits to
build on all lots in compliance with any zoning ordinance and
state and county public health department regulations and in
providing driveway access to buildings on such lots from an
approved public way.
4-102.102 Solar Access
Where a reasonably feasible lot arrangement shall be such
that building sites will afford maximum utilization of energy
36
conservation measures, such as providing for solar access
purposes.
4-102.103 Lots Subject to Flood
Where a lot in any flood-prone area must be improved to
provide a building site free from flooding, such improvements
shall be made outside the floodway by elevation or fill to at
least the regulatory flood protection elevation (one hundredyear
flood) for a distance extending at least twenty-five
(25) feet beyond the limits of intended structures and,
additionally, extending a sufficient distance to include
areas for subsurface sewage disposal if the lot is not to be
connected to a public sanitary sewer system. Any fill shall
be protected against erosion by riprap, vegetative cover, or
other methods deemed acceptable by the planning commission.
In nonresidential building sites outside a floodway but
subject to flooding, the use of structural floodproofing
methods specified in Subsection 4-101.4 of these regulations,
as an alternative to landfill, may be approved by the planning
commission, as provided in Subsection 2-101.4, of these
regulations.
4-102.104 Lots Located on Steep Slopes
Due to the potential threat to health and safety posed by
development located on lands with slopes in excess of fifteen
(15) percent, the following regulations shall apply:
a. Site Development Plan Required - No building permit
shall be issued for a building or any lot with slopes
fifteen (15) percent or over until a site plan meeting
the following requirements has been approved by the
planning commission. Said site plan shall show:
(i) The exact size, shape, and location of the lot.
(ii) The proposed location of all buildings, driveways,
drainageways, and utilities,
(iii) Proposed contours at vertical intervals of no more
than five (5) feet,
(iv) The extent of natural tree cover and vegetation,
(v) The location of any onsite soil absorption sewage
disposal systems,
(vi) The type and location of erosion control
methodology.
(vii) The surveyor's or engineer's stamp that prepared
the plan,
37
(viii) Certification as to the stability of the
structures and slope and compliance with sound
construction methods for areas with steep slopes
and landslide problems by a registered civil or
geotechnical engineer.
b. Site Development Standards  The following standards
shall be used as a guide in determining the suitability
of the construction proposed for the particular site in
question. The engineer's certification required in
Subsection 4l02.lO4, a, (viii), above, shall address
these standards.
(i) Natural vegetation shall be preserved to the
maximum extent possible,
(ii) Natural drainageways and systems shall be
maintained, except that surface water may be
diverted around a house or slope area to a natural
drain using acceptable construction techniques,
(iii) Development densities shall be limited to one (1)
dwelling unit per two (2) acres of land,
(iv) Operations that increase loads reduce slope
support, and cause instability of the slope shall
be prohibited to the maximum extent possible which
will permit reasonable development of the site.
These include filling, irrigation systems,
accessory buildings, and onsite soil absorption
sewage disposal systems,
(v) Where sanitary sewers are not available any onsite
sewage disposal system shall be shown on the site
plan and located to avoid slide- prone areas. Said
system shall be approved by the county health
department prior to the planning commission's
review taking into account these requirements,
(vi) Erosion control measures shall be employed to
prevent all soil material from leaving the site.
Additionally, soil from excavation on the site
shall not be disposed as fill on a potential slide
area,
(vii) No construction which would cut the top of the
slope shall be permitted. This shall apply as well
to subdivision roads constructed in compliance
with these regulations.
4102.2 Lot Dimensions
38
Lot dimensions shall comply with the minimum standards of any
zoning ordinance, where applicable. Where lots are more than double
the minimum area required by any zoning ordinance, the planning
commission may require that such lots be arranged so as to allow
further subdivision and the opening of future public ways where
they would be necessary to serve such potential lots, all in
compliance with any zoning ordinance and these regulations.
Generally side lot lines shall be at right angles to street lines
or radial to curving street lines.
The minimum lot frontage on a public way shall be fifty (50) feet
except for radius of a cul-de-sac which shall be forty (40) feet.
Dimensions of the corner lots shall be large enough to allow for
erection of buildings, observing the minimum front yard setback
requirements from both public way rights-of-way.
Depth and width of properties reserved or laid out for business,
commercial, or industrial purposes shall be adequate to provide
for the off-street parking and loading facilities required for the
type of use and development contemplated, and as established in
any zoning ordinance.
39
4l02.3 Building Setback Lines
In the case of electric transmission lines where easement widths
are not definitely established, a minimum building setback line
from the center of the transmission line shall be established as
follows:
Voltage of Line Building Setback
7.2 KV 15 feet
13 KV 25 feet
46 KV 37 l/2 feet
69 KV 50 feet
161 KV 75 feet
4l02.4 Double Frontage Lots and Access to Lots
4-102.401 Double Frontage Lots
Double frontage and reversed frontage lots shall be avoided
except where necessary to provide separation of residential
development from traffic arterials, or to overcome specific
disadvantages of topography and orientation.
4-102.402 Access from Arterial or Collector Public Ways
The planning commission may require that lots shall not derive
access exclusively from arterial or collector public ways.
Where driveway access from such public ways may be necessary
for several adjoining lots, the planning commission may
require that the lots be served by a combined access drive in
order to limit possible traffic hazards. Driveways shall be
designed and arranged so as to avoid requiring vehicles to
back onto arterial or collector public ways.
4-102.5 Soil Preservation, Grading, Erosion Control, and Seeding
4l02.50l Soil Preservation and Final Grading
No certificate of occupancy shall be issued until final
grading has been completed in accordance with the approved
construction plan and the lot precovered with soil having an
average depth of at least six (6) inches and containing no
particles over two (2) inches in diameter over the entire
area of the lot, except that portion covered by buildings or
included in streets or where the grade has not been changed
or natural vegetation seriously damaged.
40
Topsoil shall not be removed from residential lots or used as
spoil, but shall be redistributed so as to provide at least
six (6) inches of cover on the lots and at least four (4)
inches of cover between any sidewalks and curbs, and be
stabilized by seeding or planting.
4-102.502 Lot Drainage
Lots shall be laid out so as to provide positive drainage
away from all buildings, and individual lot drainage shall be
coordinated with the general storm drainage pattern for the
area which includes subsurface drainage. Drainage shall be
designed so as to avoid concentration of storm drainage water
from each lot to adjacent lots.
The planning commission reserves the right to set minimum
elevations on all floors, patios, and building equipment.
This prerogative to establish elevation exists in addition to
any ordinances that refer to floodplain elevation
requirements. The content of the preceding paragraph is to
give summary review powers over any calculated or historical
evidence of storm water presence in overland or channel
conditions.
The subdivision developer will insure that all artesian
ground waters of a permanent or temporary nature will be
intercepted and carried away to primary drainage conduits
along swaled ditches or in underground pipes on property line
easements. Regardless of the location of property lines,
intercept will be allowed by the planning commission at the
point of artesian surfacing.
The intent of this paragraph is to prevent flooding by
overland flow. The developer is obligated to perform this
work upon evidence of artesian water for a period of one (1)
year following acceptance of all roads and utilities.
Any sinkhole or natural channel served at any time as a means
of moving ground water into the subterranean will be protected
by structure as approved by the planning commission. The
allowed alternative to this is the construction of an
alternative means of storm water relief as approved by the
planning commission.
In any event, location and elevation of future construction
will be designated to allow for the worst possible conditions.
4102.503 Erosion and Sediment Control
There shall be a minimization of changes in the rate of
natural erosion and sedimentation which result from the
development process. An erosion and sediment control plan
shall be presented with the construction plans submitted in
41
conformance with Section 5-103 of these regulations. Such
plans shall incorporate the following principals:
a. clearing and grading shall be integrated with layout
design;
b. clearing shall be minimized and existing vegetation
shall be preserved to the maximum feasible degree;
c. grading shall be strictly limited to those areas
involved in current construction activities;
d. disturbed areas shall be protected and stabilized as
soon as possible;
e. structural and vegetative measures to control the
velocity and volume of runoff shall be required;
f. sediment basins and traps shall be required. As
necessary;
g. adequate maintenance of all planting and structures
measures shall be assured.
4-102.6 Debris and Waste
No cuts trees, timber, debris, junk, rubbish, or other waste
materials of any kind shall be buried in any land or left or
deposited on any lot or public way at the time of the issuance of
a certificate of occupancy for the lot, and removal of such waste
shall be required prior to issuance of any certificate of
occupancy. Neither shall any such waste be left nor deposited in
any area of the subdivision at the time of expiration of the
performance bond or dedication of public improvements, whichever
is sooner.
4-102.7 Fencing
Each subdivider or developer shall be required to furnish and
install all fences wherever the planning commission determines that
a hazardous condition exists. Such fences shall be constructed
according to standards established by the planning commission, as
appropriate, and shall be noted on the final plat as to height and
required materials. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued
for any affected lot until such fence improvements have been
installed.
4-102.8 Water Bodies and Watercourses
If a tract being subdivided contains a water body, or portion
thereof, lot lines shall be so drawn as to distribute the entire
ownership of the water body among the fees of adjacent lots. The
planning commission may approve an alternative plan whereby the
ownership of and responsibility for safe maintenance of the water
42
body is so placed that it will not become a governmental
responsibility.
No more than ten (10) percent of the minimum area of a lot required
under any zoning ordinance may be satisfied by land which is under
water. Where a watercourse separates a buildable area of a lots
from the public way by which it has access, provisions shall be
made for installation of culvert or other structure approved by
the planning commission and no certificate of occupancy shall be
issued for a structure on such a lot until the installation is
completed and approved by the planning commission and/or the
appropriate governmental representative.
43
4-103 Public Ways
4-103.1 General Requirements
4l03.l0l Frontage on Improved Public Ways
No subdivision shall be approved unless the area to be
subdivided shall meet the requirements for access set forth
in Subsection 11l2.l07 of these regulations. If any new
street construction or improvements are involved, such shall
be approved and, where public dedicated as provided in
Articles II and III of these regulations. Any such public way
must be suitably improved to the standards required by this
article or be bonded by a performance bond required under
these regulations, with the roadway and rightof-way widths
required by this article or the major street or road plan.
4l03.l02 Grading and Improvement Plan
Public ways shall be graded and improved to conform to the
standards required by this section and shall be approved as
to design and specification by the appropriate governmental
representative in accordance with the specifications required
herein. No surface shall be applied to the base of any
proposed public way prior to the approval of the final plat
of the subdivision or of the final approval of any section of
the subdivision in question without having been properly
inspected.
4-103.103 Improvements in Floodable Areas
The finished elevation of proposed public ways subject to
flood shall be no more than one foot below the regulatory
flood protection elevation. The planning commission may
require profiles and elevations of public ways to determine
compliance with this requirement. All drainage structures
shall be sufficient to discharge flood flows without
increasing flood height. Where fill is used to bring the
finished elevation of any public way to the required
elevation, such fill shall not encroach upon a floodway, and
the fill shall be protected against erosion by rip-rap,
vegetative cover, or other methods deemed acceptable by the
planning commission.
4-103.104 Private Streets
Where the ownership, control and maintenance of any street
are proposed to remain in private ownership such streets shall
be constructed to the design and construction standards for
public ways as herein provided. A permanent access easement
over such streets shall be provided to each and every parcel
or lot which is to gain access therefrom. All such private
improvements shall be maintained by the developer/owner or by
44
a legally established homeowners association or other
similar group approved by the planning commission. The legal
documents establishing ownership and maintenance of the
easement shall be submitted with the final plat for review
and approval and shall be recorded with the final plat.
4l03.l05 Topography and Arrangement
a. All public ways shall be arranged so as to obtain as
many of the building sites as possible at or above the
grades of the public ways Grades of public ways shall
conform as closely as possible to the original
topography. A combination of steep grades and curves
shall not be permitted. Specific design standards are
contained in Subsection 4-103.2 of these regulations.
b. The use of public ways running in an eastwest direction
and lots on a northsouth axis is encouraged for energy
conservation of developments.
c. All public ways shall be properly integrated with the
existing and proposed system of public ways and
dedicated rights-of-way as established on the major
street or road plan or the land development plan.
d. All public ways shall be properly related to special
traffic generators, such as industries, business
districts, schools, churches, and shopping areas or
centers; to population densities; and to the pattern of
existing and proposed land use.
e. Minor public ways shall be laid out to conform as much
as possible to the topography; to discourage use by
through traffic; to permit efficient drainage and
utility systems; and to require the minimum ways
necessary to provide convenient and safe access to
property.
f. The use of curvilinear streets, cul-de-sac, or "U"
shaped streets shall be encouraged where such use will
result in a more desirable layout.
g. Proposed public ways shall be extended to the boundary
lines of the tract to be subdivided, unless prevented
by topography or other physical conditions or unless,
in the opinion of the planning commission, such
extension is not necessary or desirable for the
coordination of the subdivision design with the existing
layout or the most advantageous future development of
adjacent tracts.
45
h. In business and industrial developments, public ways and
other access routes shall be planned in connection with
the grouping of buildings, location of rail facilities,
and the provision of alleys, truck loading and
maneuvering areas, and walks and parking areas, so as
to minimize conflict of movement between the various
types of traffic, including pedestrian traffic.
4-103.106 Blocks
a. Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for two
(2) tiers of lots of appropriate depth. Exceptions to
this prescribed block with may be permitted in blocks
adjacent to major public ways, railroads, or waterways.
b. The lengths, widths, and shapes of blocks shall be
determined with due regard to:
(i) provision of adequate building sites suitable to
the special needs of the type of use contemplated;
(ii) any zoning requirements as to lot sizes and
dimensions;
(iii) needs for convenient access, circulation, control,
and safety of vehicular and pedestrian traffic;
and
(iv) limitations and opportunities of topography.
c. Block lengths in residential areas shall not exceed
sixteen hundred (1,600) feet nor be less than four
hundred (400) feet, except as the planning commission
deems necessary to secure  efficient use of land or
desired features of the public way pattern. Wherever
practicable, blocks along arterial or collector routes
shall not be less than one thousand (1,000) feet in
length.
d. Blocks designed for industrial or commercial uses shall
be of such length and width as may be deemed suitable
by the planning commission.
e. In any long block, the planning commission may require
the reservation of an easement through the block to
accommodate utilities, drainage, facilities, and/or
pedestrian traffic. A pedestrian walkway, not less than
ten (10) feet wide, may be required by the planning
commission through the approximate center of any block
more than eight hundred (800) feet long, where deemed
essential to provide circulation or access to a school,
46
playground, shopping center, transportation facility,
or other community facility.
4-103.107 Access to Arterials and Collectors
Where a subdivision borders on or contains an exiting or
proposed arterial or collector route, the planning commission
may require that access to such public way be limited by:
a. the subdivision of lots so as to back on the arterial
or collector route and front on a f parallel minor route;
b. a series of culde-sac, "U" shaped public ways, or short
loops entered from and designed generally at right
angles t such a parallel public way, with the rear lines
of their terminal lots backing onto the arterial or
collector route; or
c. a marginal access or service public way, separated from
the arterial or collector route by a planting or grass
strip and having access thereto at suitable points.
The number of residential or local public ways entering on
arterial or collector routes shall be kept to a minimum.
4-103.108 Reserve Strips
The creation of reserve strips adjacent to a proposed public
way in such a manner as to deny access from adjacent property
to such public way shall generally not be permitted. However,
in. extraordinary circumstances the planning commission may
allow creation of a reserve strip to enable a more appropriate
pattern of lots or public ways. Where such is created the
planning commission must agree to any and all future
depositions of same.
A notation to this effect shall be entered on the final plat
or approved as an auxiliary instrument attached thereto.
47
4-103.109 Arrangement of Continuing and Dead-End
Public Ways
a. Arrangement of Continuing Public Ways - The arrangement
of public ways shall provide for the continuation of
major public ways between adjacent properties when such
continuation is necessary for convenient movement of
traffic, effective fire protection, efficient
provisions of utilities, and when such continuation is
in accordance with the major street or road plan. If
the adjacent property is undeveloped and the pubic way
must be a dead-end public way temporarily, the rightof-
way shall be extended to the property line. A
temporary cul-de-sac, temporary T-, or L-shaped
turnabout shall be provided on all temporary dead-end
pubic ways as required in the following turnabout
standards, with a notation on the subdivision plat that
land outside the normal public way right-of-way shall
revert to abutting property owners whenever the public
way is continued.
b. Dead-End Public Ways -- Where a public way does not
extend beyond the boundary of the subdivision and its
continuation is not required by the planning commission
for access to adjoining property, its terminus shall
normally not be nearer to such boundary than fifty (50)
feet. However, the planning commission may require the
reservation of an appropriate easement to accommodate
drainage facilities, pedestrian traffic, or utilities.
A cul-de-sac turnabout shall be provided at the end of
a dead-end public way in accordance with the design
standards of these regulations.
For greater convenience to traffic and more effective
police and fire protection, permanent dead-end public
ways shall, in general, be limited in length in
accordance with the design standards of these
regulations.
4-103.2 Design Standards
4l03.201 Purpose
In order to provide public ways of suitable location, width,
and improvement to accommodate prospective traffic and afford
satisfactory access to police, fire-fighting, sanitation, and
road-maintenance equipment, and to coordinate public ways so
as to compose a convenient and safe system and avoid undue
hardships to adjoining properties, the public way design
standards set forth in this section are hereby required.
(Public way classification shall be as indicated on the land
development plan or major street or road plan; otherwise, the
48
public way shall be classified by the planning commission
according to the definitions in Article VI of these
regulations.)
4-103.202 General Design
The general design of all public ways shall conform to the
standards in the tables entitled "General Design Standards
for Public Ways", which follow hereafter.
4-103.203 Intersections
a. Public ways shall be laid out so as to intersect as
nearly as possible at right angles. A proposed
intersection of two (2) new public ways at an angle of
less than seventy-five (75) degrees shall not be
permitted. An oblique public way should be curved
approaching an intersection and should be approximately
at right angles for at least one hundred (100) feet
therefrom. Not more than two (2) public ways shall
intersect at any one point unless specifically approved
by the planning commission.
b. Proposed new intersections along one side of an existing
public way shall coincide, wherever practicable, with
any existing intersections on the opposite side of such
public way. Jogs within public ways having center line
offsets of less than one hundred fifty (150) feet shall
not be permitted, except where the intersected public
ways have separated dual drives- without median breaks
at either intersection. Where public ways intersect
arterial or collector routes, their alignment shall be
continuous. Intersections of arterial or collector
public ways shall be at least eight hundred (800) feet
apart.
c. Minimum curb radius at the intersection of two (2) minor
public ways shall be twenty-five (25) feet, and minimum
curb radius at an intersection involving a collector
public way shall be thirty (30) feet. Alley
intersections and abrupt changes in alignment within a
block shall have the corners cut off in accordance with
standard engineering practice to permit safe vehicular
movement.
d. Where a pubic way intersection will involve earth banks
or existing vegetation inside any lot corner that would
create a traffic hazard by limiting visibility, the
subdivider shall cut such ground or vegetation
(including trees) in connection with the grading of the
public right-of-way to the extent necessary to provide
adequate site distance.
49
e. Intersection shall be designed with a flat grade
wherever practical, In hilly or rolling areas, at the
approach to an intersection, a leveling area shall be
provided having not greater than a two (2) percent grade
for a distance of sixty (60) feet, measured from the
nearest right-of-way line of the intersecting public
way.
f. The cross-slope on all public ways, including
intersections, shall be three (3) percent or less.
4-103.204 Excess RightofWay
A slope easement in excess of the right-of-way designated in
these regulations may be required whenever, due to
topography, additional width is necessary to provide adequate
earth slopes. Such slopes shall not be less than three to one
(3:1). Where solid rock is encouraged slopes shall be onehalf
to one (1/2:1).
4-103.205 Railroads and Limited Access Highways
Railroad right-ofway and limited access highways, where so
located as to affect the subdivision of adjoining lands, shall
be treated as follows:
a. In residential areas, a buffer -strip at least twentyfive
(25) feet in depth in addition to the normally
required depth of the lot may be required adjacent to
the railroad right-of-way or limited access highway.
This strip shall be part of the platted lots and shall
be designated on the plat: "This strip is reserved for
screening; the placement of structures hereon is
prohibited."
b. In commercial or industrial areas, the nearest public
way extending parallel or approximately parallel to the
railroad shall, wherever practicable, be at a sufficient
distance therefrom to ensure suitable depth for
commercial or industrial.
c. Public ways parallel to a railroad, when intersecting a
public way which crosses the railroad at grade, shall
to the extent practicable, be at a distance of at least
one hundred fifty (150) feet from the railroad rightof-
way. Such distance shall be determined with due
consideration of the minimum distance required for
future separation of grades by means of appropriate
approach gradients.

Bridges of primary benefit to the subdivider, as determined
by the planning commission, shall be constructed at the full
expense of the subdivider without reimbursement from the
planning commission.
The sharing of expenses for the construction of bridges not
of primary benefit to the subdivider, as determined by the
planning commission, shall be fixed by special agreement
between the planning commission and the subdivider. The cost
shall be charged to the subdivider pro rata as to the
percentage of his development so served.
4-103.3 Right-of-Way Width Dedication on Existing Public
Ways
Where a subdivision adjoins an existing narrow public way or where
the major street or road plan or any zoning setback provisions
indicate plans for realignment or widening of a public way that
would require use of some of the land in the subdivision, the
subdivider shall be required to dedicate, at his expense, areas
for widening or realigning such public way as set forth below:
1. the entire right-of-way shall be provided where any part of
the subdivision is on both sides of the existing public way;
or
2. when the subdivision is located on only one side of an
existing public way, onehalf (1/2) of the required rightof-
way measured from the center line of the existing pavement,
shall be provided.
4l03.4 Public Way Surfacing and Improvements
After underground utilities have been installed, the subdivider
shall construct curbs or curbs with gutters, where required, and
shall surface or cause to be surfaced public ways to the widths
prescribed in these regulations.
No public way shall be surfaced until preliminary approval of the
subdivision plat has been obtained. Surfacing shall be of such
character as is suitable for the expected traffic. Types and
methods of paving shall be according to the specifications of the
planning commission, but in no event shall such construction be
below the construction 4 specifications set forth in Appendix B,
of these regulations. Adequate provisions shall be made for
culverts or other drains, and bridges, as required.
All public ways pavements, shoulders, drainage improvements and
structures, any' curb turnabouts, and sidewalks shall conform to
53
all construction standards and. specifications I adopted by the
planning commission and shall be incorporated into the construction
plans required to be submitted by the developer for plat approval.
4-104 Road Construction Specifications
The road construction specifications are included in these l regulations
as Appendix B, and are adopted as a part hereof. These specifications
shall be the minimum standards for any subdivision within the
jurisdictional area.
4-105 Drainage and Storm Sewers
4-105.1 General Requirements
The planning commission shall not approve any plat of a subdivision
which does not make adequate provisions for stormwater or
floodwater run-off channels or basins. The stormwater drainage
system shall be separate and independent from any sanitary sewer
system.
4-105.2 Nature of Stormwater Facilities
4-105.201 Location
The subdivider may be required by the planning commission to
transport by pipe or open ditch any spring or surface water
that may exist prior to or as a result of the subdivision.
Such drainage facilities shall be located in the public way
rightof-way, where feasible, or in perpetual unobstructed
easements of appropriate width and shall be constructed in
accordance with the construction specifications contained in
these regulations.
4-105.202 Accessibility to Public Storm Sewers
a. Where a public storm sewer is accessible, the developer
shall install storm sewer facilities, or if no outlets
are within a reasonable distance, adequate provision
shall be made for the disposal of stormwaters, subject
to the specifications of the appropriate governmental
representative; inspection of facilities shall be
conducted to assure compliance. Inspection of facilities
shall be conducted by the enforcing officer.
b. If a connection to a public storm sewer will be provided
eventually, as determined by the planning commission,
the subdivider shall make arrangements for future
stormwater disposal by a public system at the time the
plat receives final approval.
54
Provisions for such connection shall be incorporated by
inclusion in the performance bond required for the final
subdivision plat.
4l05.203 Accommodation of Upstream Drainage Areas
A culvert or other drainage facility shall in each case be
large enough to accommodate potential runoff from its entire
upstream drainage area, whether inside or outside the
subdivision. Necessary facilities shall be sized based on the
construction specifications and assuming conditions of
maximum potential watershed development permitted by any
zoning ordinance.
4-105.204 Effect on Downstream Drainage Areas
The planning commission also shall study the effect of each
subdivision on existing downstream drainage facilities
outside the area of the subdivision. Where it is anticipated
that the additional runoff incident to the development of the
subdivision will overload an existing downstream drainage
facility, the planning commission may withhold approval of
the subdivision until provision has been made for adequate
improvement of such drainage facilities in such sum as the
planning commission shall determine. No subdivision shall be
approved unless adequate drainage will be provided to an
adequate drainage watercourse or facility.
55
4-105.205 Areas of Poor Drainage
Whenever a plat is submitted for an area which is subject to
flooding, the planning commission may approve such
subdivision; provided, that the applicant fills the affected
floodway fringe area of said subdivision to place public way
elevations at no more than twelve (12) inches below the
regulatory flood elevation and first floor elevations
(including basements) at no less than one (1) foot above the
regulatory flood elevation. The plat of such subdivision
shall provide for a floodway along the bank l of any stream
or watercourse of width sufficient to contain or move the
water of the regulatory flood, and no fill shall be placed in
the floodway; neither shall any building nor flood
restrictive structure be erected or placed therein. The
boundaries of the floodway and if floodway fringe area, and
the regulatory flood elevation, shall be determined by the
planning commission based upon the review specified in
Subsection 2103.2 of these regulations and the submission of
flood data in construction plans as specified in Section 5-
103 of these regulations.
4-105.206 Floodplain Areas
The planning commission may when it deems it necessary for
the health, safety, or welfare of the present and future
population of the area or necessary to the conservation of
water, drainage, and sanitary facilities, prohibit the
subdivision of any portion of the property which lies within
the floodplain of any stream or drainage course. The
regulatory floodway shall be preserved from any and all
destruction or damage resulting from clearing, grading, or
dumping of earth, waste material, or stumps. Any subdivision
which contains flood-prone land shall be subject to the
special provisions set forth in Subsections 2-101.4; 4-101.4;
Section 4-104; and Subsection 4-105.2, of these regulations.
4105.3 Dedication of Drainage Easements
4-105.301 General Requirements
Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse,
drainageway, channel, or stream, there shall be provided a
stormwater easement or drainage right-of-way conforming
substantially to the lines of such watercourse and of such
width and construction as will be adequate Where open
drainageways are utilized they shall be designed for the
twenty-five (25) year frequency flood.
56
4-105.302 Drainage Easements
a. Where topography or other conditions are such as to make
impracticable the inclusion of drainage facilities
within a public way right-ofway, perpetual unobstructed
easements at least ten (10) feet in width for such
facilities shall be provided across property outside the
public way lines and with satisfactory access to public
ways. Easements shall be indicated on the preliminary
and final plats. Drainage easements shall be carried
from the public way to a natural watercourse or to other
drainage facilities.
b. When a new drainage system is to be constructed
which will carry water across private land outside
the subdivision, appropriate drainage rights must
be secured and indicated on the plat.
c. The applicant shall dedicate, when required by the
planning commission, either in fee, or by drainage
or conservation easement, the land on both sides of
an existing watercourse to a distance to be
determined by the planning commission.
d. Along watercourses, lowlying lands within any
floodway, as determined by the planning commission
pursuant to Section 2-103 of these regulations,
whether or not included in areas for dedication,
shall be preserved and retained in their natural
state as drainage ways.
4-105.303 Ditching, Concrete Ditch Paving, and
Culverts and Storm Drains
The design and construction details of drainage
facilities shall be in accordance with the provisions of
these regulations. The design and construction details
of all such facilities shall be approved by the
appropriate governmental representative.
4-106 Water Facilities
4-l06.1 General Requirements
1. Necessary action shall be taken by the developer to
extend a water supply system capable of providing
domestic water use and fire protection.
57
2. Where a public water main is within reasonable access of
the subdivision, as determined by the planning
commission, the subdivider shall install adequate water
facilities, including fire hydrants, subject to
construction and material specifications, approval of
the planning commission, the Tennessee Department of
Health and Environment and these regulations.
3. Where required for fire protection water mains shall not
be less than six (6) inches in diameter; where water
mains are not to be utilized for fire protection, the
planning commission may approve smaller lines, as
necessary, to meet potable water demand.
4. All water systems, whether public or private, located in
a flood-prone area shall be floodproofed to the
regulatory flood protection elevation. All water supply
facilities located below the regulatory flood protection
elevation shall be designed to prevent the infiltration
of floodwaters into the water supply system and
discharges from the system into floodwaters.
4-106.2 Fire Hydrants
Fire hydrants shall be required in all subdivisions; they
shall be located no more than one thousand (1,000) feet apart
and be within five hundred (500) feet of any residential,
commercial, or industrial lot. However, the planning
commission may require closer spacing where physical
conditions or types of structures so warrant. To eliminate
future public way butting or openings, all underground

public use, as indicated on the land development plan and/or
major street or road plan, or any portion thereof, such tract
shall be suitably incorporated by the developer into his plat
when first presented for review by the planning commission.
After proper determination of its necessity by the planning
commission and the appropriate governmental representative(s)
involved in the acquisition and use of such site, and after
a determination has been made to acquire the site by the
61
public agency, the site shall be suitably incorporated by the
developer into the plat prior to final approval by the
planning commission and recording of the plat.
4-110.2 Referral to the Governmental Agency Concerned
The planning commission shall refer any plat presented in
accordance with Subsection 4-110.1 to the governmental agency
concerned with acquisition of the land. The planning

public acquisition, when the commission deems it appropriate
and consistent with the policies and purposes set forth in
these regulations, is any land within a floodway or floodway
fringe determined according to the procedure outlined herein.
The acquiring agency's recommendation, if affirmative, shall
include a map showing the boundaries and area of the parcel
to be acquired and an estimate of the time required to
complete the acquisition.
4-110.3 Notice to Property Owner
Upon receipt of an affirmative report, the planning
commission shall notify the property owner and shall
designate on all plats any areas proposed to be acquired by
any governmental agency. Upon such designation by the
planning commission, any reserved portion of any floodway or
floodway fringe shall not be altered from its natural state
by the development in any manner whatsoever, except upon
written approval of the planning commission.
4-110.4 Duration of Land Reservation
The acquisition of land reserved by a governmental agency on
the final plat shall be initiated within twenty-four (24)
months of notification, in writing, from the owner that he
intends to develop the land. Such letter of intent shall be
accompanied by a plat of a proposed development and a
tentative schedule of construction. Failure on the part of
the governmental agency to initiate acquisition within the
prescribed twenty four (24) months shall result in the removal
of the "reserved" designation from the property involved and
62
the freeing of the property for development in accordance
with these regulations.
4-lll Preservation of Natural Features and Amenities
Existing features which would add value to residential development
or to the area as a whole, such as trees, watercourses and falls,
historic spots, and similar irreplaceable assets, shall be
preserved in the design of the subdivision, as required by the
planning commission. No change of grade of the land shall be
affected nor shall any natural features be removed or relocated
until a preliminary subdivision plat has been approved by the
planning commission.
4-112 Nonresidential Subdivisions
41l2.l General

nonresidential subdivision also shall be subject to all the
requirements of site plan approval set forth in any zoning
ordinance. Site plan approval may proceed simultaneously at
the discretion of the planning commission. A nonresidential
subdivision shall be subject to all the requirements of these
regulations, as well as such additional standards set forth
by the planning commission, and shall conform to the proposed
land development plan, major street or road plan, and any
zoning ordinance.
4-112.2 Standards
In addition to the principles and standards in the
regulations, which are appropriate to the planning of all
subdivisions, the subdivider shall demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the planning commission that the public way,
parcel, and block pattern proposed is specifically adapted to
the uses anticipated and takes into account other uses in the
vicinity. The following principles and standards shall be
observed:
1. proposed industrial parcels shall be suitable in areas
and dimensions to the types of nonresidential
development anticipated;
63
2. public way rights-of-way and pavements shall be adequate
to accommodate the type and volume of traffic
anticipated;

SECTION III
TYPICAL SECTIONS
113
SECTION IV
MATERIALS SPECIFICATION
AND CONSTRUCTION PROCEDURES
A. PRELIMINARY WORK
1. Location and Protection of Underground Utilities
Prior to beginning excavation or grading, the subdivider
shall determine, insofar as possible, the actual
locations of all underground utilities in the vicinity
of his operations and shall clearly mark them so that
they can be avoided by equipment operators. Where such
utility lines or services appear to lie in the path of
construction, they shall be uncovered in advance to
determine their exact location and depth and to avoid
damage due to excavation or grading operations. Existing
facilities shall be protected during construction or
removed and replaced in equal condition, as necessary.
Should any existing utility line or service be damaged
during or as a result of the subdivider's operations,
the subdivider shall take such emergency measures as may
be necessary to minimize damage and shall immediately
notify the utility agency involved. The subdivider shall
then repair the damage to the satisfaction of the utility
agency or shall pay the utility agency for making the
repairs. In all cases the damaged structure shall be in
as good or better condition as before the damage
occurred.
2. Surveying and Staking
The subdivider shall be responsible for his own surveys
and establish his own grades unless otherwise directed
by the enforcing officer.
3. Removal of Obstructions
The subdivide shall be responsible for the removal,
safeguarding, and replacement of fences, walls,
114
structures, culverts, street signs, billboards, shrubs,
mailboxes, or other obstructions which must be moved to
facilitate construction. Such obstructions shall be
restored to at least their original condition.
4. Clearing and Grubbing
The subdivider shall be responsible for cutting,
removing, and disposing of all trees, brush, stumps,
roots, and weeds within the construction area. Disposal
shall be by means of chippers, landfills, or other
approved methods not in conflict with state or local
ordinances.
Care shall be taken to avoid unnecessary cutting or
damage to trees not in the construction area. The
subdivider shall be responsible for loss or damage to
trees outside the permanent easement or rights-of-way.
5. Traffic Control and Safety
The subdivider shall provide and maintain access to and
from all properties along the line of his work. The
subdivider shall also provide temporary bypasses and
bridges where necessary to route traffic and shall
maintain them in a safe and usable condition whenever,
in the opinion of the enforcing officer, detouring of
traffic to parallel routes cannot be done without
hardship or excessive increase in travel by the public.
Where single-lane bypasses are provided the subdivider
shall furnish signalmen to control traffic operations
and minimize delays.
The subdivider shall provide, erect, and maintain
adequate barricades, warning signs, and lights at all
excavations, closures, detours, points of danger, and
uncompleted pavement.
B. ROADWAY CONSTRUCTION
115
1. Stripping, Stockpiling, and Placing Topsoil
All topsoil shall be stripped within the street rightof
way and from any other area designated by the
enforcing officer. Topsoil shall be stored in
stockpiles. All organic matter within the right-of-way
shall be stripped and disposed of unless directed
otherwise by the enforcing officer.
A two (2) or three (3) inch layer of topsoil shall be
placed where seeding is required or where required by
the enforcing officer.
After the stockpiled topsoil has been placed as
specified above, the area where the topsoil was
stockpiled shall be neatly graded and dressed.
2. Excavation
Excavation shall conform to limits indicated on the
plans. Excavation materials shall be removed in such
manner that the slopes can be neatly trimmed. Excavation
shall not be made below grade except where rock or stone
masonry is encountered or undercutting of unstable
materials is required. Materials removed below grade
shall be replaced with approved materials thoroughly
compacted. Where borrow materials are required to
complete embankments or fills the subdivider shall be
responsible for providing them.
Rock excavation shall be removed to a minimum depth of
twelve (12) inches below the subgrade and backfilled
with approved materials which shall be thoroughly
compacted.
Where a spring or seepage water is encountered that is
not provided for on drainage plans it shall be reported
to the enforcing officer.
3. Fills and Embankments
116
Embankment and fill materials shall be free from frost,
stumps, trees, roots, sod, or muck. Only materials from
excavation or borrow pits, or other materials approved
by the enforcing officer shall be used. Materials shall
not be placed on frozen ground.
Where excavated materials are used in fill construction
and the materials consist of earth and various grades of
rock, the fills shall be carefully constructed with the
larger or hard rock on the bottom followed by the smaller
or soft rock and finally the earth fill to provide a
well-compacted and voidfree embankment.
All depressions or holes below the natural ground
surface, whether caused by grubbing, rock removal,
undercutting, or otherwise, shall be filled with
suitable materials and compacted to ground surface
before fill construction is started.
Backfilling around a structure shall have been completed
and thoroughly compacted to ground surface before any
embankment materials are placed thereon.
Embankments shall be so constructed that adequate
surface drainage will be provided at all times.
Fill areas shall be compacted by a sheep's foot roller,
to a density of not less than ninety-five (95) percent
of optimum density and within three (3) percent of
optimum moisture content per ASTM D 698 and each lift of
fill materials shall be rolled until the roller walk
out".
The finished grade shall be test rolled with a truck to
be selected by the enforcing officer. Any areas found to
be soft or "pumping" shall be cut out and replaced with
suitable materials in lifts, each lift shall be
compacted until the excavation has been brought back to
finish grade.
117
Fill materials shall be placed in eight (8) inch lifts,
maximum thickness. Where excavated materials consist
mainly of rock too large to be placed in the normal eight
(8) inch thickness without crushing or further breaking
down the pieces, such materials shall be placed in the
fill in layers not exceeding three (3) feet in depth. No
rock larger than eighteen (18) inches in dimension shall
be placed in fill. Care shall be taken to fill all voids
between large rock and to assure that fill materials are
compacted such that settling is minimized. Compaction of
the top six (6) inches of cuts or fills shall be
accomplished with pneumatic-tire rollers.
Backfill around structures shall be of crushed stone or
earth meeting the approval of the enforcing officer; and
the fill shall be placed and compacted in eight (8) inch
lifts and brought up evenly on all sides of the
structure.
4. Undercutting
This work shall consist of the removal and disposal of
unsatisfactory materials below grade in cut sections or
areas upon which embankments are to be placed. It shall
also include undercutting for pipes and box culverts
where required.
Known areas to be undercut shall be designated on the
materials approved by the enforcing officer. The
backfill materials shall be placed in eight (8) inch
lifts and compacted as specified for fill construction.
Disposal of unsatisfactory materials shall be approved
by the enforcing officer.
5. Subgrade Construction and Preparation
The subgrade shall be prepared in reasonably close
conformity with the lines and grades as shown on the
plans.
118
Grading of subgrade shall be performed in such manner as
to provide ready drainage of water. Ditches and drains
shall be maintained to provide proper drainage during
construction.
Hauling over finished subgrade shall be limited to that
which is essential for construction purposes, and all
ruts or rough places that develop in a completed subgrade
shall be smoothed and recompacted. Soft areas shall be
removed and replaced with crushed stone or as directed
by the enforcing officer.
The subgrade shall be checked and approved by the
enforcing officer for adherence to the plans before any
base materials are placed.
6. Shoulders and Slopes
All shoulders and slopes shall be trimmed and shaped to
conform with the cross sections shown on the plans and
as specified in Section C-5, below. Rock cuts shall be
sealed of all loose fragments, projecting points, etc.,
so as to leave a clean and neat appearance. Shoulders
shall be completed where required as shown on the plans
and shall be double bituminous surface treated, with
care being taken to protect the surface and edges of
pavement. Shoulder materials shall be placed in uniform
layers and compacted by overlapped rolling of both base
course and pavement. The finished shoulder shall be firm
against the pavement.
C. BASE AND PAVING
1. Base Stone
The base course of stone shall be placed and compacted
in layers or lifts upon the prepared subgrade to a finish
thickness as described and shown on the plans. No single
layer or lift shall exceed four (4) inches in depth.
119
The base course shall be a pugmill mix of mineral
aggregate conforming to the technical specifications set
forth in Section 303, Standard Specifications. The
aggregate base shall not be spread on a subgrade that is
frozen or that contains frost. The base shall be placed
and spread in uniform layers or lifts without
segregation of size; each layer shall be compacted to a
thickness no greater than four (4) inches. The stone
shall be mixed with graders or other equipment until a
uniform mixture is obtained. Each layer shall be
compacted by rolling with alternate blading until a
smooth, even, and uniformly compacted finish is
obtained.
The base stone shall be graded and rolled while it is
still moist from the pugmill mix. If the enforcing
officer determines that the mix is too dry, water shall
be added with a distributor tank truck while the stone
is being graded and rolled. Compaction shall be uniform
for the entire width of the roadway until a density of
eighty (80) percent of the solid volume has been
achieved. Placement and compaction of each layer shall
be approved by the enforcing officer before materials
for the next successive layer are placed.
No pavement shall be placed until the stone base has
been approved by the enforcing officer.
2. Prime Coat
After the base stone has been prepared as outlined above,
a bituminous prime coat shall be applied uniformly over
the surface of the base by the use of an approved
bituminous distributor. The prime coat shall be applied
at the rate of the three-tenths (3/10) gallon per square
yard, using Grade RC70 or RC250, or refined tar Grade
RT-2, RT-3, or emulsified asphalt, Grade AEP. If, after
the bituminous materials have been applied, they fail to
penetrate before the time that the roadway is to be used
by traffic, dry cover materials shall be spread at a
rate established by the enforcing officer, (between
120
eight (8) and twelve (12) pounds per square yard) to
prevent damage to the primed surface. An excess of cover
materials shall be avoided. No succeeding state of
construction shall be placed upon the prime coat until
it has properly cured. Aggregate for cover materials
shall be Size No. 78 or 8.
In addition to these general requirements, unless
otherwise stipulated, all materials and methods of
installation shall conform to the technical
specifications set forth in Section 402, Standard
Specifications.
3. Tack Coat
A tack coat shall be applied to old or existing pavement
surface or to a previously prepared base or surface to
provide bond for an overlaid course. The tack coat shall
be applied at the rate of one-tenth (1/10) gallon per
square yard using materials and methods of installation
set forth in Section 403, Standard Specifications.
4. Wearing Surface
Upon completion of the application of the prime coat, or
tack coat, an asphaltic concrete surface (hot mix) shall
be applied. The wearing surface shall be the thickness
shown on the detail sheet for that class street. All
materials and methods of installation shall conform to
the technical specifications set forth in Section 411,
Standard Specifications for asphaltic concrete surface.
The wearing surface shall be constructed of Grade D or
E materials described in
Section 903.11, Standard Specifications, and shall
utilize asphaltic cement Grade RT-4 or 5, or TRCB-5 or
6, as set forth in Section 904, Standard Specifications.
5. Shoulders
Shoulder construction shall be completed by bleeding,
moistening as necessary, and by thoroughly compacting.
121
The shoulders shall be the width and thickness shown on
the typical section as required herein and covered with
the typical section as required herein and covered with
a double bituminous surface treatment. The surface shall
be prepared as directed in advance of the surface
construction. Upon completion of the prime coat, a
double bituminous surface treatment shall be applied
with the first course being at a rate of between 0.38
and 0.42 gallons per square yard. If the width of
application is wider than the distributor, each width of
spread shall not be less than one-half (1/2) the surface
to be treated. Areas inaccessible to the distributor
shall be treated either with hand sprays or pouring pots,
Immediately after each application of bituminous
materials has been made, it shall be covered uniformly
with Size No. 6, mineral aggregate. The aggregate shall
be spread at a rate of between thirty (30) and forty
(40) pounds per square yard. This first application
shall be allowed to cure for a length of time to be
determined by the enforcing officer before the second
application is begun.
The second application of bituminous materials shall be
applied in the same manner as the first application, at
a uniform rate between 0.30 and 0.35 gallons per square
yard. Mineral aggregate, Size No. 7, shall then be spread
in the same manner as for the first spread at a rate
between twenty (20) and twentyfive (25) pounds per
square yard.
Immediately after each spread of cover aggregate,
uniform coverage shall be achieved by hand brooming.
Additional aggregate shall be placed by hand on thin or
bare areas.
Immediately after spreading and brooming the cover
aggregate, the entire surface shall be rolled, beginning
at the edges and progressing to the edge of the pavement.
Rolling shall begin within thirty (30) minutes after the
aggregate has been spread. The same rolling and curing
122
procedures required in making the first application
shall be repeated in making the Cy second application.
In addition to these general requirements, unless
otherwise stipulated, all materials and methods of
installation shall conform to the technical
specifications set forth in Section 404, Standard
Specifications.
D. DRAINAGE SYSTEM DESIGN

no case shall the slope of the ditch be less than one
(1) percent (a fall of 1.00 foot in 100 feet). All
drainage ditches shall be stabilized, as indicated in
these specifications.
9. Changes in Water Channels
Where the subdivider rechannelizes through a subdivision
he will be responsible for replacing cross drains under
streets, as directed by the enforcing officer. This work
shall be done at the expense of the subdivider.
10. Curb and Gutter (Formed)
Concrete curbs and gutter shall conform to the standard
drawings as detailed herein. Concrete for curbs and
gutter shall be Class A, at 35000 psi.
Curb and gutter shall be constructed to the lines and
grades shown on the plans, or as designated by the
enforcing officer. The final subgrade for curb and
gutter shall be carefully graded and compacted to an
even density and shall be smooth and true to grade. Curb
and gutter shall be constructed with materials and
126
methods which conform to the technical specifications
set forth in Section 702, Standard Specifications.
Concrete driveway ramps shall be required on all curb
and gutter streets. The ramps shall extend a minimum of
five (5) feet behind the curb. Materials for the
remaining portion of the driveway shall be determined by
the subdivider. Driveway ramp construction shall conform
to detailed standard drawings included herein.
Any driveway ramp to be placed after initial laying of
curb shall require a permit and shall be installed in
accordance with the standard drawings included herein.
Any ramp not conforming to the foregoing requirements
shall be removed and replaced by the subdivider at his
expense and shall be enforced under provision of the
maintenance bond.
E. FINAL DRESSING, SEEDING, AND SODDING
1. Final Dressing
This work shall consist of dressing all slopes and areas
to within reasonable close conformity to the lines and
grades indicated on the plans, or as directed by the
enforcing officer. Final dressing shall be performed by
hand or machine to produce a uniform finish to all parts
of the roadway including embankments, ditches, etc. Rock
cuts shall be cleaned of all loose fragments; side slopes
shall be laid back to a three to one (3:1) slope and
seeded as described in these specifications.
The entire right-of-way shall be cleaned of all weeds
and brush and all structures both old and new shall be
cleared of all brush, rubbish, sediment, or other
objectionable materials.
2. Seeding
127
In all areas damaged or disturbed by the construction
operation where established ground cover was present
before beginning of construction, the subdivider shall
be responsible for restoring the ground cover after
completion of construction, unless noted otherwise on
drawings. All areas seeded shall be graded smooth prior
to seeding and the subdivider shall be responsible for
maintenance of the smooth finished grade until grass is
established.
After designated areas have been carefully hand graded,
soil shall be prepared for fertilizing and seeding.
Fertilizer shall be a standard commercial fertilizer
Grade 15-15-15 or equivalent, and shall be applied at a
rate of not less than ten (l0) pounds per one thousand
(1,000) square feet. The fertilizer shall be lightly
harrowed, raked, or otherwise incorporated into the soil
for a depth of approximately one half (1/2) inch. The
subdivider shall be responsible for any regrading or
reseeding required to produce an acceptable grass cover.
Rutting and washing shall be restored by reseeding and
strawing; in areas of extreme erosion sodding may be
required.
The seed shall be as follows:
Name Percent by Weight
Lespedeza 20
Sericea Lespedeza 15
Kentucky 31 Fescue 40
English Rye 15
White Dutch Clover 5
Weeping Love Grass 5
or
Kentucky 31 Fescue 55
Redtop 15
English Rye 20
White Dutch Clover 5
Weeping Love Grass 5
128
The seed shall be sown uniformly at the rate of one and
onehalf (1 1/2) pounds per one thousand (1,000) square
feet.
3. Sodding
Sodding shall consist of furnishing and placing sod at
all locations shown on the plans, or as directed by the
enforcing officer. Work shall include the furnishing and
placing of new sod, consisting of live, dense, well
rooted growth of permanent grasses free from johnson
grass and other obnoxious grasses or weeds, well suited
for the soil on which it is placed. All sod shall be
cleanly cut in strips having a uniform thickness of not
less than two and one-half (2 1/2) inches. Sod shall be
set when the soil is moist and favorable to growth. No
setting shall be done between October 1 and April 1,
without permission of the enforcing officer. The area to
be sodded shall be brought to the lines and grades shown
on the plans, or as directed by the enforcing officer.
The surface of the ground to be sodded shall be loosened
to a depth of not less than one (1) inch with a rake or
other device. If necessary, it shall be sprinkled until
saturated for a minimum depth of one (1) inch and kept
moist until the sod is placed. Immediately before
placing the sod, fertilizer and lime shall be applied
uniformly to the prepared surface of the ground.
Fertilizer shall be applied at the rate of eight pounds
of Grade 15-15-15, or equivalent, per one thousand
(1,000) square feet.
Sod shall be placed as soon as practical after removal
from the point of origin, it shall be kept in a moist
condition during the interim. Sod shall be carefully
placed by hand on the prepared ground surface with the
edges in close contact and, as far as possible, in a
position to break joints. Each strip of sod laid shall
be fitted into place and tamped. Immediately after
placing, the sod shall be thoroughly wetted and rolled
with an approved roller. On slopes of two to one (2:1)
129
or steeper, pinning or pegging may be required to hold
the sod in place.
The sod shall be watered as directed by the enforcing
officer for a period of two (2) weeks. The subdivider
shall not permit any equipment or materials to be placed
on any planted area and shall erect suitable barricades
and guards to prevent equipment, labor, or the public
from traveling on or over any area planted with sod.
