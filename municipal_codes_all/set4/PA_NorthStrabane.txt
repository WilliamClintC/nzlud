premises in the performance of duties under the applicable technical
code and/or ordinance where requested.
4. Coordination of Enforcement. Whenever, in the opinion of the Code
Enforcement Officer, initiating an inspection under the applicable
technical codes and/or ordinances, it is deemed necessary or desirable
to have inspections by any other department, the Code Enforcement
Officer shall make reasonable effort to arrange for the coordination of

issued pursuant to this section shall be subject to such penalties as may
be authorized by law for violation of a court order.
7. Modifications. Whenever there are practical difficulties involved in
carrying out the provisions of the technical codes, the Code
Enforcement Officer may grant modifications for individual cases,

conformity with the intent and purpose of the technical code, and that
such modification does not lessen health, life and fire safety
§ 104 NORTH STRABANE CODE § 104
1:40
requirements or any degree of structural integrity. The details of
actions grading modifications shall be recorded and entered in the

material, method or work offered is, for the purpose intended, at
least the equivalent of that prescribed in the technical codes in
suitability, strength, effectiveness, fire resistance, durability, safety
and sanitation.

A. Abatement of the Blighted Property Violations. In the event a
property is found to be in violation of a state or Township code by a
Magistrate and the owner has failed to remedy the problem or
appeal the decision, the Township shall have the right to repair,
tear down, abate, or otherwise remove the violations occurring on
the property, with the costs thereof being charged against the
owner. Failure of the owner to pay the costs may result in a lien
being placed against the property.
B. Conservatorship. The Township may initiate court proceedings
against an owner of a blighted property who is unable or unwilling
to abate the problems for the court to appoint a conservator to take
possession of the property and take the necessary actions to bring
it out of violation. Possession can be restored by the property
owner upon reimbursement for all of the accrued costs and fees.
C. Asset Attachment. A property owner found guilty of substantial
violations shall have six months to remedy the violations. Upon
reinspection by the Code Enforcement Officer confirming a failure
to remedy the violations, the Township may file an action in the
Court of Common Pleas against the owner to secure a judgment
against the owner. Upon failure by the owner to satisfy said
judgment, the Township may submit a writ of attachment to collect
the judgment, requesting the court issue a levy of attachment
directing the Sheriff to serve copy of the order on the owner and to
seize property equal in value to the writ.
D. Extradition. A person who lives or has a principal place of
residence outside this commonwealth, who owns real estate
property in this commonwealth against which code violations have
been cited under 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 7510 (relating to municipal housing
code avoidance) and the person is charged under 18 Pa.C.S.A.
(relating to crimes and offenses) and who has been been properly
notified of the violations may be extradited to this commonwealth

which fines or other penalties or a judgment to abate or
correct were imposed by a Magisterial District Judge or
municipal court, or a judgment at law or in equity was
imposed by a Court of Common Pleas. However, no denial
shall be permitted on the basis of a property for which the
judgment, order or decree is subject to a stay or
supersedeas by an order of a court of competent
jurisdiction or automatically allowed by statute or rule of
court until the stay or supersedeas is lifted by the court or
a higher court or the stay or supersedeas expires as
otherwise provided by law. Where a stay or supersedeas is
in effect, the property owner shall so advise the
municipality seeking to deny a municipal permit.

municipal corporation and county in which the property is
located and the court and docket number for each parcel cited
as a basis for the denial. The denial shall also state that the
applicant may request a letter of compliance from the
appropriate state agency, municipality or school district, in a
form specified by such entity, as provided in this section.

provisions are more restrictive. If there is any conflict between any of the
provisions of this chapter, the more restrictive shall apply.
§ 204. Severability. [Ord. 365, 9/22/2015]
If any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause, or phrase of this

floodplain areas. [Ord. 365, 9/22/2015]
1. The identified floodplain area shall be:
A. Any areas of Township of North Strabane classified as special flood
hazard areas (SFHAs) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and the
accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs), dated
September 30, 2015, and issued by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA), or the most-recent revision thereof,
including all digital data developed as part of the Flood Insurance
Study.
2. The above-referenced FIS and FIRMs, and any subsequent revisions
and amendments, are hereby adopted by Township of North Strabane
and declared to be a part of this chapter.
1. The identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific
areas:
A. The Floodway Area shall be those areas identified in the FIS and
the FIRM as floodway and which represent the channel of a
watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in
order to discharge the base flood without increasing the water
surface elevation by more than one foot at any point. This term
shall also include floodway areas which have been identified in
other available studies or sources of information for those special
flood hazard areas where no floodway has been identified in the FIS
and FIRM.
(1) Within any Floodway Area, no encroachments, including fill,
new construction, substantial improvements, or other
development, shall be permitted unless it has been
demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
performed in accordance with standard engineering practice
that the proposed encroachment would not result in any
increase in flood levels within the community during the
occurrence of the base flood discharge.
(2) Within any Floodway Area, no new construction or
development shall be allowed, unless the appropriate permit is
obtained from the Department of Environmental Protection's
regional office.
§ 401 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 402

§ 403. Changes in Identification of Area. [Ord. 365, 9/22/2015]
The identified floodplain area may be revised or modified by the Board of
Supervisors where studies or information provided by a qualified agency
or person documents the need for such revision. However, prior to any
such change to the special flood hazard area, approval must be obtained
from FEMA. Additionally, as soon as practicable, but not later than six
months after the date such information becomes available, a community
shall notify FEMA of the changes to the special flood hazard area by
submitting technical or scientific data. See § 501, Subsection 2, for
situations where FEMA notification is required.
§ 404. Boundary Disputes. [Ord. 365, 9/22/2015]

initial determination shall be made by the floodplain administrator; and any
party aggrieved by this decision or determination may appeal to the Board
of Supervisors. The burden of proof shall be on the appellant.
B. The AE Area/District shall be those areas identified as an AE Zone
on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base
flood elevations have been provided.
(1) The AE Area adjacent to the floodway shall be those areas
identified as an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS
prepared by FEMA for which base flood elevations have been
provided and a floodway has been delineated.
C. The A Area/District shall be those areas identified as an A Zone on
the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no
base flood elevations have been provided. For these areas,
elevation and floodway information from other federal, state, or
other acceptable sources shall be used when available. Where
other acceptable information is not available, the base flood
elevation shall be determined by using the elevation of a point on
the boundary of the identified floodplain area which is nearest the
construction site.
In lieu of the above, the municipality may require the applicant to
determine the elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering
techniques. Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be
undertaken only by professional engineers or others of
demonstrated qualifications, who shall certify that the technical
methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical
concepts. Studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted
in sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by the
municipality.

made to any watercourse unless it can be shown that the activity
will not reduce or impede the flood-carrying capacity of the
watercourse in any way.
C. In addition, FEMA and the Pennsylvania Department of Community
and Economic Development shall be notified prior to any alteration
or relocation of any watercourse.
2. When the Township of North Strabane proposes to permit the following
encroachments: any development that causes a rise in the base flood
elevations within the floodway; or any development occurring in Zones
A1-30 and Zone AE without a designated floodway, which will cause a
rise of more than one foot in the base flood elevation; or alteration or
relocation of a stream (including, but not limited to, installing culverts
and bridges), the applicant shall (as per 44 CFR Part 65.12):
A. Apply to FEMA for conditional approval of such action prior to
permitting the encroachments to occur.
B. Upon receipt of the Administrator's conditional approval of map
change and prior to approving the proposed encroachments, a
community shall provide evidence to FEMA of the adoption of
floodplain management ordinances incorporating the increased
base flood elevations and/or revised floodway reflecting the postproject
condition.
C. Upon completion of the proposed encroachments, a community
shall provide as-built certifications. FEMA will initiate a final map
revision upon receipt of such certifications in accordance with 44

performed. The term does not, however, include any project for
improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local
health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary
to assure safe living conditions.
UNIFORM CONSTRUCTION CODE (UCC)  The statewide building code
adopted by the Pennsylvania General Assembly in 1999 applicable to new

will be permitted in a slope that is greater than 3:1.
7. Storm Sewer. The applicant must have all roof drains and foundation
drains connected to the storm sewer system as set forth in Chapter 22,
§ 513. No piping of stormwater will be allowed onto a slope greater
than 3:1.
1. The Administrator shall require that a geotechnical engineering report
be submitted by the applicant if the site is, has been, or is likely to
become hazardous to persons or property. The overlay maps such as the
Coal Resource Maps prepared by USGS, 1975, for the Greater
Pittsburgh Region shall be used to locate hazardous areas. The report
shall contain a detailed description of the geological conditions of the
site and shall include conclusions and recommendations that will
demonstrate the relationship of the geological conditions to the
proposed development, including hazardous conditions, water
resources, mineral resources and environmental impact.
2. In special cases, when grading occurs in areas of landslide-prone soil,
or rock-fall-prone areas as recognized by the Soil Survey, or other
standard surveys, the Administrator may require special precautions
§ 9-105 NORTH STRABANE CODE § 9-106
1:144
prior to issuing a permit from the applicant. The results of all soil tests
and core borings made relative to the site shall be submitted to the
Administrator.
3. The Administrator may deny a grading permit if the use of land to be
graded, either excavation or filling, is not specifically known except for
the intent of improving the site. The Administrator shall review the
application, plans specifications and reports and determine whether the

is not detrimental to the environment. The applicant may appeal the
Administrator's decision to the Board of Supervisors by preparing and
submitting to the Board of Supervisors a site plan showing the
development of the land in accordance with the Subdivision and Land
Development Ordinance.19
4. When the requirements of this Part for obtaining a permit have been
met, the Administrator shall approve the application and proposed plan
and grant a grading permit to the applicant.
5. The Administrator may waive the requirement of any or all plans and
specifications listed in this Part, if he finds that the information on the
application is sufficient to show that the work will conform to the
provisions of this Part. The said agreement may be incorporated in the
developer's agreement as required in the Subdivision and Land
Development Ordinance.
6. The administrator will require a slope stability analysis based on the
following guidelines:
A. Slope greater than 3H:1V are considered to be a steep slope and
will require a slope stability analysis as defined herein.
B. Ground areas having a slope of three (horizontal) to one (vertical)
(3H:1V) or flatter are generally considered inherently stable and do
not generally require a slope stability analysis; however, the
administrator may require the analysis based on the following:
(1) Fill slope that do not support structures with side slopes of
3H:1V or flatter will not require a project specific slope
stability evaluation. Exceptions would include embankments
constructed from highly plastic soils, soft subgrade conditions
(deep organics, peat, diatomaceous soils, etc.), slopes subject
to inundation, or other cases where, in the Township
Administrator's judgement, analysis is warranted.
(2) Cut slopes, excavations at 3H:1V or flatter in uniform native
soils will not require site-specific evaluation. Layered
formations, over consolidated clay soils, and colluvium
(landslide debris) would be notable exceptions, or other cases

toe bench, together with a drain pipe and suitable discharge pipe to
the existing nonerosive surface beyond and below the toe of the
proposed fill.
G. Overfilling of slopes is desirable to permit final shaping of surface
to proposed grade without the addition of loose fill over the surface
of the slope, provided that no fill shall be higher than 10 feet
vertically before the slope is shaped to proper grade.
H. At the end of each work day, the horizontal surface of the fill shall
be shaped, compacted and rolled to provide for drainage.
I. All fills shall be compacted to provide stability of materials and to
prevent undesirable settlement. The fill shall be spread in a series
of layers, each not exceeding six inches in thickness, and shall be
compacted by a sheeps foot roller or other approved method after
each layer is spread. Fill shall be placed at the optimum moisture
content for the specified degree of compaction. The Administrator
may require tests or other information if, in his opinion, the
conditions or materials are such that additional information is
needed. Where fills are to have streets, structures, or public
utilities placed in or on them, a Modified Proctor Density of 95%
shall be achieved (ASTM test designation D 1557).

A. This requirement may be waived by the Administrator if it can be
satisfactorily demonstrated that such an exception is necessary to
insure normal use of the property.
B. This requirement may also be waived when the proposed retaining
wall is a joint venture between adjacent property owners, and
documents evidencing the same are filed with the application for
the permit.
5. A fence not less that four feet in height, of a design approved by the
Administrator and meeting requirements of the Zoning Ordinance, shall
be placed at the top of all new cuts and fills made when the cuts or fill
slopes are steeper than two horizontal to one vertical and also
elsewhere where public safety dictates.

1. All transmission and distribution structures, lines and equipment
erected by the Grantee within the Township shall be so located as to
cause minimum interference with the proper use of streets, alleys and
other public ways and places, and to cause minimum interference with
the rights and reasonable convenience of property owners who join any
of the said streets, alleys or other public ways and places.
2. In case of disturbance of any street, sidewalk, alley, public way or paved
area, the Grantee shall, at its own cost and expense and in a manner

3. The Grantee shall have the authority to trim trees upon and
overhanging streets, alleys, sidewalks, and public ways and places of
the Township so as to prevent the branches of such trees from coming
in contact with the wires and cables of the Grantee, except that at the
option of the Township, such trimming may be done by it or under its
supervision and direction at the expense of the Grantee.
1. No Franchise shall be deemed to expressly or impliedly authorize the
Grantee to construct or install poles or wireholding structures within
streets for the purpose of placing cables, wires, line or otherwise,
without the written consent of the Township. Such consent shall be
given upon such terms and conditions as the Board of Supervisors in its
sole direction may prescribe. The Grantee shall perform, at its sole
expense, all tree trimming required to maintain the poles clear of
obstructions.
2. With respect to any poles or wire-holding structures which a Grantee is
authorized to construct and install within streets, a public utility
serving the Township may, if denied the privilege of utilizing such poles
or wire-holding structures by the Grantee, apply for such permission to
the Board of Supervisors. If the Board of Supervisors finds that such use
would enhance the public convenience and would not unduly interfere
with Grantee's operations, the Board of Supervisors may authorize such
use subject to such terms and conditions as it deems appropriate. Such
authorization shall include the condition that the public utility pay to
the Grantee any and all actual and necessary costs incurred by the

located as not to be unsightly or unsafe. In any area of the Township
where there are certain cables, wires and other like facilities of a public
utility underground and at least one operable cable, wire or like facility
of a public utility suspended above the ground from poles a Grantee
may construct and install its cables, wires and other facilities from the
same pole.

entity or authority elects to alter, repair, realign, abandon, improve, vacate,
reroute or change the grade of any street or to replace, repair, install,
maintain, or otherwise alter any above ground or underground cable, wire
conduit, pipe, line, pole, wireholding structure, structure, or other facility
utilized for the provision of utility or other services or transportation of
drainage, sewage or other liquids, the Grantee has, except as otherwise
hereinafter provided, at its sole expense, remove or relocate as necessary
its poles, wires, cable, underground conduits, manholes and any other
facilities which it has installed. The entities may decide among themselves
who is to bear the cost of relocation; provided, that the Township shall not
be liable to a Grantee for such costs. Regardless of who bears the costs, a
Grantee shall take action to remove or relocate at such time or times as are
directed by the entity of company undertaking the work.

Grantee shall be authorized to require such payment in advance. A Grantee
shall be given not less than 48 hours oral or written notice to arrange for
such temporary wire changes.

1. A Franchise shall not be sold, assigned or transferred, either in whole
or in part, or leased, sublet, or mortgaged in any manner, nor shall title
thereto, either legal or equitable or any right, interest or property
therein, pass to or vest in any person without the prior written consent
of the Township. Such consent shall not be withheld unreasonably.
No such consent shall be required for a transfer to or among affiliated
companies or to related parties, nor a transfer in trust, mortgage, or
other hypothecation as a whole or in part to secure an indebtedness,
except that when such hypothecation shall exceed 50% of the market
value of the property used by the Grantee in conducting the business
of the franchise.
The proposed assignee must show technical ability, financial capability,
legal qualifications and general character qualifications as determined
by the Township and must agree to comply with all provisions of the
Franchise and such conditions as may be prescribed by the Board of
Supervisors expressed by resolution. The Township shall be deemed
to have denied a proposed transfer or assignment in the event that
its consent is not communicated in writing to Grantee within 120
days following receipt of written notice of the proposed transfer or
assignment.
2. The Grantee shall promptly notify the Township of any actual or
proposed change in, or transfer of, or acquisition by any other party of,
control of the Grantee. The word "control" as used herein is not limited

§ 419 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 420
1:185
§ 421. Performance Bond. [Ord. 167, 8/8/1989]

the Grantee shall make the Franchise subject to cancellation unless and
until the Township shall have consented thereto, which consent will not
be unreasonably withheld. However, a transfer of control shall not be

control, the Township may inquire into the qualifications of the
prospective controlling party and the Grantee shall assist the Township

arise upon the acquisition or accumulation by any unrelated person or
group of persons of 10% of the voting control of the Grantee.
4. The consent or approval of the Board of Supervisors to any transfer of
the Franchise shall not constitute a waiver or release of the right of the
Township in and to the streets, and any transfer shall by its terms, be

jointly damages and costs of repairing or completing the Cable
Television System, and cost of removal or abandonment of property and
repair of streets and other public or private improvements, up to the
full amount of the bond; said condition to be a continuing obligation
until the Grantee has satisfied all of its construction obligations which
may have arisen from the acceptance of the Franchise or from its
exercise of any privileges thereunder. The bond shall not be cancelled
by the surety, whether for failure to pay a premium or otherwise,
without 30 calendar days advance written notice mailed by the surety to
the Township Secretary by certified mail. The form of the bond and
surety shall be subject to the approval by the Township Solicitor.

§ 422. Letter of Credit. [Ord. 167, 8/8/1989]
2. Neither the provisions of this Section, nor any bond presented pursuant
thereto, nor any damages recovered thereunder shall be construed to

Grantee under the Franchise or for damages.
1. Within 30 days of the effective date of the Ordinance awarding a
Franchise or Franchise Renewal, a Grantee shall cause to be
established and issued by a Federally insured commercial lending
institution an irrevocable letter of credit in favor of the Township in an
amount as specified in the Franchise Agreement or Franchise Renewal
Agreement. The Grantee shall be required to maintain a letter of credit
throughout the term. The form and substance of said letter of credit are
subject to the approval of the Township Solicitor. The purpose of the
aforesaid letter of credit is to insure the faithful performance by a
Grantee of all provisions of this Part and the Grantee's Franchise
Agreement, and compliance with all orders, permits and directions of
any agency, commission, board, department, division or office of the
Township having jurisdiction over a Grantee's acts or defaults under a
Franchise and the payment by the Grantee of any penalties, liquidated
damages, claims, liens and taxes due the Township which arise by
reason of the construction, operation or maintenance of the system,
including cost of removal or abandonment of any property of Grantee.

of a draft at sight on the lending institution, accompanied by a written
certificate on Township letterhead signed by the Township Manager
certifying that the Grantee has failed to comply with this Part, the
Franchise or Franchise Agreement, stating the specific reasons
therefor, and stating the basis for the amount being drawn. Examples of
a basis for drawing upon the letter of credit include but are not limited
to the following:
A. Failure of the Grantee to pay the Township any taxes after 10 days
written notice of delinquency.
B. Failure of the Grantee to pay to the Township after 10 days written
notice, any amounts due and owing the Township by reason of the
indemnity provisions of this Part.

within 10 days of the Township's draw-down under a letter of credit,
increase its letter of credit or provide a new letter of credit so that the

liability and judgments for damages or otherwise:
§ 424. Grantee Insurance. [Ord. 167, 8/8/1989]
Township will have available the full amount stated in the Franchise
Agreement.
4. The rights reserved to the Township with respect to the letter of credit
are in addition to all other right of the Township, whether reserved by a
Franchise or authorized by law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of
a right with respect to such letter of credit shall affect any other right
the Township may have.
1. For actual or alleged injury to persons or property, including loss of use
of property due to an occurrence, whether or not such property is
physically damaged or destroyed, in any way arising out of or through
the acts or omissions of the Grantee or its officers, agents, employees,
or contractors or to which the Grantee's or its officers, agents,
employees or contractors acts or omissions in any way contribute.
2. Arising out of or alleged to arise out of any claim for damages for
invasion of the right of privacy, defamation of any person, firm or
corporation, or the violation or infringement of any copyright,
trademark, trade name, service mark or patent, or of any other right of
any person, firm or corporation.
3. Arising out of or alleged to arise out of Grantee's failure to comply with
the provisions of any statute, regulation or ordinance of the United
States, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or any local agency applicable
to the Grantee in its business.
Nothing herein shall be deemed to prevent the parties indemnified and
held harmless from participating in the defense of any litigation by
their own counsel at the Grantee's sole expense. Such participation
shall not under any circumstances relieve the Grantee from its duty
of defense against liability or of paying any judgment entered against
such party.
1. As a part of the indemnification provided by § 423, but without limiting
the foregoing, each Grantee shall file with the application, and at all
times thereafter maintain in full force and effect at its sole expense, an
acceptable policy or policies of liability insurance, including

§ 425. Alternative Remedies. [Ord. 167, 8/8/1989]
No provision of this Part shall be deemed to bar the right of the Township
to seek or obtain judicial relief from a violation of any provision of the
Franchise or any rule, regulation, requirement or directive promulgated
thereunder. Neither the existence of other remedies identified in this Part
not the right of the Township to recover monetary damages (except where
liquidated damages are otherwise prescribed) for such violation the
Grantee, or judicial enforcement of the Grantee's obligations by means of
specific performance, injunction relief or mandate, or any other judicial
remedy at law or in equity.
§ 426. Non-Enforcement. [Ord. 167, 8/8/1989]
A Grantee shall not be relieved of any obligation to comply with any of the
provisions of the Franchise or any rule, regulation, requirement or directive
promulgated thereunder by reason of any failure of the Township or its
officers, agents or employees to enforce prompt compliance.
§ 427. Communication With Regulatory Agencies. [Ord. 167, 8/8/
1989]
On request, the Grantee shall provide to the Township copies of all petitions,
applications, communications and reports submitted by the Grantee to the
FCC or any other Federal or State regulatory commission or agency having
jurisdiction in respect to any matters affecting construction or operation
of a Cable Television System or services provided through such a system.
Copies of responses or any other communications from the regulatory
agencies to a Grantee likewise shall be provided on request to the Township.
compensation and employer liability. The Grantee and the Township
and its officers, agents, and employees shall be named as additional
insureds, and the policy or policies shall contain cross-liability
endorsements. Policies of insurance shall be in the single limit amount
of $1,000,000 per occurrence. The insurance policy or policies shall
insure against the types of liabilities covered by the indemnification and
hold harmless provisions of § 423.
2. The form and substance of the policy or policies of insurance shall be
subject to approval by the Township Solicitor.
3. The policy or policies of insurance shall be maintained by the Grantee in
full force and effect during the entire term of the Franchise. Each policy

of premium, or otherwise, and whether at the request of the
Grantee or for other reasons, except after 30 calendar days advance
written notice mailed by the insurer to the Township Secretary by
certified mail.

§ 428. Rates. [Ord. 167, 8/8/1989]
The Township Board of Supervisors expressly reserves the right to approve
the rates which the Grantee charges its subscribers for basic cable service
to the extent the Board of Supervisors is permitted to do so by law. Such
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. "Basic cable service" shall
mean any tier of service which includes the retransmission of local
broadcast signals. The Grantee shall not deny, delay, interrupt or terminate
Cable Communications Services to subscribers or users because the Board
of Supervisors denies a request for a rate increase, provided, however,
that nothing herein shall be construed to limit the Grantee's right to seek
judicial review of such action. Grantee shall notify the Township of any
proposed rate increase at least 60 days in advance of the effective date of
said increase. The increase shall take place automatically unless denied by
the Board of Supervisors at a public meeting, after public hearing, during
the sixty-day period.

Township and signed under penalty of perjury by an officer of the
Grantee, which identifies the sources and amounts of gross revenues
received by a Grantee during the quarter for which payment is made.
2. No acceptance of any payment shall be construed as an accord that the
amount paid is, in fact, the correct amount, nor shall such acceptance of
payment be construed as a release of any claim which the Township
may have for further or additional sums payable under the provisions of
this Section.

paid Franchise Fees in the amounts prescribed by § 430. The audit may be
conducted by an independent certified public accounting firm retained by
the Township, and shall be conducted at the sole expense of the Township.
The party conducting the audit shall prepare a written report containing its
findings, and the report shall be filed with the Township, and mailed to the
Township and Grantee.
§ 435. Liquidated Damages. [Ord. 167, 8/8/1989]
1. By acceptance of the Franchise granted by the Township, a Grantee
understands and shall agree that failure to comply with any time and
performance requirements as stipulated in this Part and the Franchise

Part 8
SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESS
§ 801. Short Title. [Ord. 259, 6/22/1999, § 1]
This Part shall be referred to as the "Sexually Oriented Business" regulation
provisions.
§ 802. Purpose and Findings. [Ord. 259, 6/22/1999, § 2]
1. Purpose.
A. Pursuant to the authority granted in the Second Class Township
Code to prohibit nuisances, to promote the health, welfare,
cleanliness, comfort and safety of the citizens of North Strabane
Township (hereinafter "Township") and to regulate the time of
opening and closing and the conduct of places of public
entertainment, amusement and recreation, the Township of North
Strabane enacts this Part to minimize and control the adverse
secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses and thereby
protect the health, safety and welfare of its citizens, to protect the
citizens from increased crime, to preserve the quality of life, to
preserve the property values and character of surrounding
neighborhoods and to deter the spread of blight.
B. The Board of Supervisors (hereinafter "Supervisors") has
determined that licensing is a legitimate and reasonable means of
accountability to insure that operators of sexually oriented
businesses comply with reasonable regulations and to insure that
operators do not knowingly allow their establishments to be used
as places of illegal sexual activity or solicitation.
C. The Supervisors do not intend by this Part to suppress any speech
or expression activities protected by the First Amendment, but to
enact a content neutral ordinance which addresses the secondary
effects of sexually oriented businesses.
2. Legislative Findings. The Supervisors find that:
A. Sexually oriented businesses have adverse secondary effects which
should be regulated to protect the public health, safety and
welfare. These secondary effects include, but are not limited to, the
spread of communicable diseases, performance of sexual acts in
public places, presence of discarded sexually oriented materials on
public and private property, sexual harassment, obscenity,
prostitution and other illegal sexual activities, crime and
neighborhood deterioration.
B. A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to
place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and
the operators of the sexually oriented businesses. Further, such a
§ 801 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 802
1:213
licensing procedure will place a hereto fore nonexistent incentive
on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run
in a manner consistent with the health, safety and welfare of its
patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the Township. It
is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee
is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business, fully in
possession and control of the premises and activities occurring
therein.
C. Removal of doors on viewing booths and requiring sufficient
lighting on premises with viewing booths advances a substantial
governmental interest in discouraging illegal and unsanitary sexual
activity occurring in adult theaters.
D. Requiring licenses of sexually oriented businesses to keep
information regarding current employees and certain past
employees will help reduce the incident of certain types of criminal
behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or
suspects and by preventing minors from working in such
establishments.
E. The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately
responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the
sexually oriented businesses will help limit and control the adverse
secondary effects of such businesses.
F. It is desirable, for the prevention of the spread of communicable
diseases, to obtain a limited amount of information regarding
certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this Part
is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such
activity.
G. The fact that an applicant for a sexually oriented business license
has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational
assumption that the applicant is likely to engage in that conduct in
contravention of this Part.
H. The barring of such individuals from the management of sexually
oriented businesses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to
and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually
transmitted diseases.
I. The general welfare, health and safety of the citizens of the
Township will be promoted by the enactment of this Part.
J. The limitation of operating hours of sexually oriented businesses to
10:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. Mondays through Saturdays, and closure
of such businesses on Sundays and holidays reduces the adverse
secondary effects of such businesses, including particularly, but not
limited to, late night noise levels, crime and sexually offensive
materials and activities in public areas, and promotes the public
health, safety and welfare.

available.
§ 119 NORTH STRABANE CODE § 119.1
1:306
1. A property owner who constructs or causes to be constructed at his
expense any extension of the Municipal Authority's public wastewater
system shall be entitled to apply to the Municipal Authority for
reimbursement of part of such expense if, within 10 years of the date of
dedication to the Municipal Authority of the extension constructed by
the property owner, the owner(s) of another property or properties not
situated in the development for which the extension was originally
constructed, connect(s) a building sewer directly to the extension. This
reimbursement program shall apply only with respect to those lines for
which the Authority has not previously paid.
2. The amount of reimbursement shall be equal to, but not in place of, the
collection part of each tapping fee collected as a result of the
subsequent connection(s), less a five-percent fee to be retained by the
Municipal Authority for administrative expenses and services rendered
in calculating, collecting, monitoring and disbursing the
reimbursement payments to the property owner(s) entitled thereto.
3. The total reimbursement to which a property owner shall be entitled
shall not exceed the cost of all labor, material, engineering design,
performance and maintenance bonds, Authority review and inspection
charges, and flushing and televising charges, and any and all charges
involved in the acceptance and dedication of such facilities by the
Authority, less the amount which would be chargeable to such property
owner based upon the collection part of the Authority's tapping fee
which would be applicable to all lands of the property owner served
directly or indirectly through such extensions, if the property owner did
not fund the extension.
4. Within 30 calendar days of the Authority's receipt of a tapping fee
resulting from a subsequent connection to the line constructed by the
property owner, and with respect to which the property owner is
eligible to receive a reimbursement in accordance with this Section, the
Authority shall notify the property owner, by certified mail addressed to
the property owner's last known address, of the payment of the tapping
fee which entitles the property owner to such reimbursement. If the
property owner does not claim the reimbursement within 120 calendar
days of the date of mailing of the notice, the reimbursement to which
the property owner would otherwise be entitled, shall revert to, and
become the sole property of, the Municipal Authority, and the Municipal
Authority shall have no further obligation to reimburse the property
owner vis-a-vis payment of that tapping fee. Nothing set forth herein
shall obligate the Authority to notify such property owner of the
payment of a tapping fee with respect to a connection to the line
constructed by the property owner, where said connection occurs on a
date more than 10 years after the date of dedication of the line to the
Municipal Authority.

shall establish mass limits of comparable stringency for an individual
industrial user at the request of such user.
1. No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged to the public
wastewater system, any wastewaters containing substances subject to
an applicable Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standard promulgated
by the EPA in excess of the quantity prescribed in such applicable
pretreatment standards except as otherwise provided in this Section.
Compliance with such applicable pretreatment standards shall be
achieved within three years of the date the standard is promulgated;
provided however, compliance with a categorical pretreatment
standard for new discharges shall be required upon promulgation.
2. Upon application by a Class III user, the Authority Manager shall revise
any limitations on substances specified in the CHJA pretreatment
standards to reflect removal of the substances by the wastewater
treatment facility. The revised discharge limit for specified substances
shall be derived in accordance with Federal law.
3. Upon application by a Class III user, the Authority Manager shall adjust
any limitation on substances specified in the applicable pretreatment

§ 134. Determination of Wastewater Characteristics. [Ord. 160, 6/7/
1988, § 134; as amended by Ord. 318, 5/29/2007]
1. When required by the Authority Manager, the owner of any property
serviced by a building sewer carrying Class III wastewater discharges
shall provide suitable access and such necessary meters and other
appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling,
and measurement of the wastewater. Such access shall be in a readily
and safely accessible location and shall be provided in accordance with
plans approved by the Authority Manager. The access shall be provided
and maintained at the owner's expense so as to be safe and accessible
at reasonable times.
2. The Authority Manager shall consider such factors as the volume and
strength of discharge, rate of discharge, quantities of toxic materials in
the discharge, wastewater treatment facility removal capabilities, and
cost effectiveness in determining whether or not access and equipment
for monitoring Class III wastewater discharges shall be required.
3. Where the Authority Manager determines access and equipment for
monitoring or measuring Class III wastewater discharges is not
practical, reliable, or cost effective, the Authority Manage may specify
alternative methods of determining the characteristics of the
wastewater discharge which will, in the Authority Manager's judgment,
provide an equitable measurement of such characteristics.
1. Measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of wastewater
to which reference is made in this Part shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of "Standard Methods of the
Examination of Water and Wastewater," published by the American
Public Health Association or such alternate methods approved by the
Authority Manager, and which comply with state and federal law.
Sampling methods, locations, times, durations and frequencies are to
be determined on an individual basis subject to approval by the
Authority Manager. The discharger shall have the option to use, at his
own expense, more complete sampling methods, locations, times,
durations and frequencies than those specified by the Authority
Manager.
2. Measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of wastewater
required by this Part shall be performed by a National Environmental
Laboratory Accreditation Program/DEP certified laboratory. When such
analyses are required of a discharger, the discharger may, in lieu of
using the Canonsburg-Houston Joint Authority laboratory, make
arrangements with any National Environmental Laboratory
Accreditation Program/DEP certified laboratory, including that of the
discharger, to perform such analyses.
3. Monitoring of wastewater characteristics necessary for determination
of compliance with applicable pretreatment standards shall be
conducted on the basis of the following schedule, unless more frequent
§ 133 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 134
1:313

Ord. 318, 5/29/2007]
If the drainage or discharge from any establishment causes a deposit,
obstruction or damage to the Municipal Authority's public wastewater
system, the Authority Manager shall cause the deposit or obstruction to be
promptly removed or cause the damage to be promptly repaired. The cost
for such work, including materials, labor, and supervision shall be borne by
the person causing such deposit, obstruction or damage.
§ 136. Wastewater, Service Charges and Industrial Cost Recovery.
[Ord. 160, 6/7/1988, § 136; as amended by Ord. 318, 5/29/2007]
monitoring is required by authority other than this Part, or if the
Authority Manager, in his judgment, determines that the characteristics
of the specific discharge warrant a different frequency monitoring:
Average Actual Daily User
Discharge Monitoring Frequency
Less than 100,000 gpd Semiannually
100,000 to 999,999 gpd Quarterly
More than 999,999 gpd Monthly
4. Monitoring of wastewater characteristics for any purpose other than
the determination of compliance with pretreatment standards shall be
conducted on a frequency deemed necessary by the Authority Manager.
5. Upon demonstration by any person that the characteristics of the
wastewater discharged by that person are consistent, the Authority
Manager may reduce the frequency as may be required by authority
other than this Part, except in no case shall the frequency of monitoring
be less than semi-annual for the determination of compliance with
pretreatment standards.
6. In determining the discharge characteristics, factors such as
continuous or batch operation, seasonal operation, and the information
requirements of other provisions of this Part shall be considered by the
Authority Manager. The Authority Manager may obtain wastewater
samples as required to verify the consistence of discharge
characteristics.
7. Fees for any given measurement, test, or analysis of wastewater
required by this Part and performed by the CHJA shall be the same for
all classes or dischargers, regardless of the quantity or quality of the
discharge and shall reflect only direct cost. Costs of analyses performed
by an independent laboratory at the option of discharger shall be borne
directly by the discharger. All other costs shall be borne by the
discharger.

Any person, firm or corporation who shall violate any provision of this Part,
upon conviction thereof in an action brought before a district justice in
the manner provided for the enforcement of summary offenses under the
Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure, shall be sentenced to pay a fine
of not more than $1,000 plus costs and, in default of payment of said fine
and costs, to a term of imprisonment not to exceed 90 days. Each day that
a violation of this Part continues or each Section of this Part which shall be
found to have been violated shall constitute a separate offense.
1. Wastewater Service Charge. Charges and fees for the use of the public
wastewater system shall be based upon the actual use of such system or
upon contractual obligations for a level of use in excess of current
actual use. Property value may be used to collect the amount due as
permitted by Federal law.
2. Industrial Cost Recovery. Users of the Municipal Authority's public
wastewater system will also be assessed surcharges if, after the
requirements of the Part are met, the discharge from the industrial user
is considered to be different from normal domestic sewage.
3. Determination System Use.
A. The use of the Municipal Authority's public wastewater system
shall be based upon actual measurement and analysis of each
user's wastewater discharge, in accordance with the applicable
provisions of this Part, to the extent such measurement and
analysis is considered by the Authority Manager to be feasible and
cost-effective.
B. Where measurement and analysis is considered not feasible,
determination of each user's use of the public wastewater system
shall be based upon the quantity of water used, whether purchased
from a public water utility or obtained from a private source or
alternative means as provided by Subsection C below.
C. The Authority Manager, when determining actual use of the
Municipal Authority's public wastewater system based on water
use, shall consider consumptive, evaporative or other use of water
which results in a significant difference between a discharger's
water use and wastewater discharge. Where appropriate, such
consumptive water use may be metered to aid in determining
actual use of the wastewater facilities. The meters used to measure
such water shall be of a type and installed in a manner approved by
the Authority Manager. The actual average water use by each
residential user (Class I) during the three months of January,
February, and March shall be used as the measure of each
respective residential user's actual use of the sewer system
through the year. The cost of materials shall be borne by the user.

by Ord. 262, 8/24/1999, § 1; and by Ord. 308, 4/18/2006]
The Schedule of Sewer User Rates and Charges for North Strabane
Township, as mandated by the Canonsburg-Houston Joint Authority is set
forth on Schedule A attached hereto and made a part hereof. Said Schedule
is hereby adopted by the Township.

§ 304.1. Consolidation of sewer districts for sewer rate and charge
purposes. [Ord. 152, 9/29/1987; as added by Ord. 174, 3/27/1990,
§ 4; and amended by Ord. 178, 3/12/1991, § 4]
North Strabane Sewer Districts A, B, and C are hereby consolidated for
sewer rate and charge purposes. Sewer rates and charges are now uniform
throughout North Strabane Township.
§ 305. Collection, Deposit and Use of Rates and Charges. [Ord. 152,
9/29/1987, § 305; as amended by Ord. 178, 3/12/1991, § 5]
§ 306. Calculation of Rates and Charges. [Ord. 152, 9/29/1987,
§ 306; as amended by Ord. 174, 3/27/1990, § 5; by Ord. 179, 3/12/
1991, § 6; and by Ord. 318, 5/29/2007]
1. The Authority or its designated agent shall collect and receive any and
all sewer rates and charges set forth in this Part.
2. The revenue collected shall be deposited into the North Strabane
Township Municipal Authority Operating Fund.
3. Fiscal year-end balances in the account shall be used for no other
purposes than those authorized.
1. Each user shall pay for the services provided by the Authority based on
use of the sewerage system.
2. For residential, industrial, institutional, governmental and commercial
users, quarterly user charges will be based on actual water usage as
recorded by water meters.
3. Where water meters are not in use, the quarterly user charge for a
residential user will be based on a fixed rate of 15,000 gallons of water
used per quarter. Where water meters are not in use, the quarterly user
charge for a nonresidential user shall be based on estimated water
usage as determined by the Authority's consulting engineer.
4. If a residential, commercial, institutional or industrial user uses water
that is not discharged into the collection system, the user may request
that his/its user charges be based on readings of a deduct meter(s)
installed and maintained at the user's expense on water lines to uses
which will not discharge to the sanitary sewer. If the Authority agrees to
such use of a deduct meter, the quarterly use charge shall initially be
based on use as reflected in the water meter readings, but shall be
subject to adjustment based on the deduct meter readings. The
Authority shall nonetheless retain the right to independently monitor:
A. The accuracy of operation of the deduct meters.
B. The accuracy of the use of such deduct meters in determining
amounts discharged into the sanitary sewerage system.
§ 304.1 NORTH STRABANE CODE § 306
1:324
C. The placement of deduct meters to measure only water consumed
that does not and cannot enter the sanitary sewer.
In the event that the Authority determines that said deduct meters
are not positioned correctly or operating accurately, or are not
accurate in determining amounts of discharge into the sanitary
sewerage system, the Authority shall return to calculating the
user's quarterly user charges on the basis of water meter
readings, until such time as the condition(s) affecting the accuracy
of the deduct meters or the accuracy of use of such meters in
determining amounts discharged into the sanitary sewerage
systems has been determined, and is mutually agreed upon by the
Authority and the user to be satisfactory.
5. A large commercial, industrial or institutional user which uses water
that is not discharged into the collection system may request that
calculation of its water usage for purposes of this Part be based on
readings of specified water meters installed or to be installed on only
those specific lines through which flows water which will be discharged
into the collection system. Upon request of such a large commercial,
industrial or institutional user, the Authority may (but shall not be
required to) agree to calculation of water usage for purposes of this
Part based on the readings of such specified water meters. In the event
that the Authority agrees to this alternated method of calculation of
sewage discharge, the Authority shall nonetheless retain the right to
independently monitor:
A. The accuracy of operation of the water meters.
B. The accuracy of the use of such water meters to determine or
estimate amounts of discharge into the sanitary sewage system.
C. The accuracy, position, and designation of specified water meters
to calculate sewage discharge into the sanitary sewerage system
pursuant to this Part.
In the event that the Authority determines that said meters are not
opening accurately, or are not accurate in determining amounts of
discharge into the sanitary sewerage system, the Authority shall
return to calculating the user's quarterly user charges on the
basis of master meter readings, until such time as the condition(s)
affecting the accuracy of the wastewater meters or the accuracy
of use of such meters in determining amounts discharged into the
sanitary sewerage system has been determined, and is mutually
agreed upon by the Authority and the user to be satisfactory.
6. Each user shall pay the rates as set forth in the Schedule of User Rates
and Charges attached to this Part as Schedule A,23 recommended by the
23.Editor's Note: Schedule A is included at the end of this Part.

Authority and as approved by the Township, as amended and made a
part hereof.
7. For those users whose wastewater requires more treatment than
normal domestic wastewater sewage, an extra-strength sum, in
addition to the normal charges, will be collected. The additional charge
for operation and maintenance, including replacement, shall be the
rates charged by the Canonsburg-Houston Joint Authority, or the
following rates, whichever are greater.
A. One dollar per pound of BOD.
B. One dollar and $0.10 per pound of SS.
C. Fifty cents per pound of NH3N and PO4.
8. Any user who discharges any toxic pollutants (as defined in Part I of this
chapter) which cause an increase in the cost of managing the effluent or
the sludge from the treatment plant(s), or any user who discharges any
substance which singly or by interaction with other substances causes
identifiable increases in the cost of operation, maintenance or
replacement of the sewerage systems shall pay for such increased
costs. The charge to each such user shall be as determined by the
Township upon recommendation by the Authority.
1. For each EDU identified with an expired tap permit, a nonuser shall pay
a quarterly nonuser charge, calculated by multiplying the rate set forth
in the prevailing schedule of sewer user rates as established by duly
adopted ordinances of the Township of North Strabane by 14.5, as
follows:
(Sewer rate per 1,000 gallons) x (number of EDUs identified in expired
tap permit) x 14.5 quarterly nonuser charge
2. This charge shall be a nonrefundable charge, as it represents a
reservation, on the part of the nonuser, of a certain level of capacity in
the Municipal Authority's public wastewater system after expiration of
the natural two-year life of a tap permit. Payment of such charge shall
extend the life of the permit beyond that period during which it
otherwise would have existed, for such period of time that said nonuser
charges are timely paid; provided, however, that:
A. On or before the original expiration date of the tap permit, the
nonuser has provided written notification to the Authority of his/its
interest in extending the life of the tap permit; and
B. The nonuser agrees in writing to, and does in fact, pay to the
Authority such difference, if any, between the cost of a tap at the

property is actually physical connected to the Municipal Authority's
public wastewater system and appropriate inspections on behalf
of the Authority have been concluded, as otherwise required by
Township ordinance.
3. Each EDU identified within 150 feet of a public sewer system required
to connect that has not connected as per § 115 shall pay, in addition to
any liens or penalties, a quarterly nonuser charge, calculated by
multiplying the rate set forth in the prevailing schedule of sewer user
rates as adopted by the Township of North Strabane as follows:
(Sewer rate per 1,000 gallons) x (number of EDUs identified) x 14.5
quarterly nonuser charge
1. Bills or invoices (hereinafter "invoices") for said sewer service shall be
submitted in the form and manner prescribed by the Authority. As a
courtesy to the owner of the property (if different from the user), all
bills for sewer service shall be directed to the user of the premises to
which sewer service is furnished, unless the owner, in writing,
otherwise directs. The owner of the property shall, however, in all
cases, be liable for payment of such bills. As used herein, the term
"user" includes but is not limited to the owner of the property to which
service is provided.
2. All users shall be invoiced quarterly, and payment of invoices shall be
due within 28 days of the invoice date. This date shall be known as the
"due date."
3. When the invoice has not been paid on or before the due date, it shall be
considered delinquent. At such time, a late payment charge of 5% of the
amount of the invoice shall also be imposed. This late payment charge
shall be in addition to the remedies otherwise available to the Authority
hereunder.
4. If the invoice is not paid within 28 days of its date, that is, by the due
date, the following procedures shall also be utilized by the Authority:
A. Not more than 15 days after the due date, the Authority shall mail a
letter to the user (and the owner of the property at issue, if
different) requesting that the account be paid in full or,
alternatively, that the user meet with the Authority to establish a
payment plan and schedule acceptable to the Authority.

Users contributing more than 6,000 gallons of wastewater per month and
whose waste strength is greater than 208 mg BOD/1 or 220 mg SS/1 shall
prepare and file with the Authority a report that shall include pertinent
data relating to the wastewater characteristics of its discharges, including
the methods of sampling and measurement to obtain this data. This data
shall be used to calculate the user charges for that user. Representatives
of the Authority shall have the right to gain access to the waste stream
of the user(s) and take its own samples. In the event the Authority does
so and should the results be substantially different than those results as
determined and certified to the Authority by the user, the user charge for
that user shall be revised for the next billing cycle/period.

or owner's failure to timely comply with any such payment plan
and schedule so established, the Authority, at least 10 days prior
to terminating service, shall mail to the user (and owner of the
property at issue, if different), by first class mail, and also post
the main entrance to the property at issue, with a notice in
substantially the form as previously adopted by the Township and
which may be administratively updated and changed from time
to time by the Township consistent with the provisions of the
Township ordinances.
1. Any industrial user who deems his user charge is unreasonable and/or
inequitable may make written application to the Authority requesting a
review of his user charge. Said written request shall, where necessary,
show the actual or estimated average flow and/or strength of his
wastewater in comparison with the values upon which the charge is
based, including how the measurements or estimates were made.

DYE TESTS AND CERTIFICATIONS
§ 401. Findings and Purpose. [Ord. 164, 12/27/1988]
The Board of Supervisors finds that excessive storm and/or surface waters
are illegally routed into the sanitary sewer systems leased by the Township
from the North Strabane Municipal Authority, thus requiring increased
and unnecessary treatment capacity and activity and thus curtailing the
availability of tap-ins and treatment to other users who need sanitary
sewage treatment. The Board of Supervisors finds that the procedures, fees
and penalties provided for herein are necessary to achieve the purposes of
this Part.

RECYCLING
§ 301. Findings and Purpose. [Ord. 183, 12/19/1991, § 301]
The Act of July 28, 1988, No. 101, known as the Municipal Waste Planning,
Recycling and Waste Reduction Act, provides that each municipality of
the commonwealth shall have the power and duty to adopt and implement
programs for the collection and recycling of municipal waste or sourceseparated
recyclable materials. Reduction of the amount of solid waste
and conservation of recyclable materials is an important public concern by
reason of the growing problem of solid waste disposal and its impact on
our environment. The Township has determined that recycling conserves
valuable material resources and energy, promotes greater efficiency in the
regional economy and provides for local employment. Recycling will reduce
the overall amount of solid waste presently generated and thus reduce
storage, collection, transportation and disposal costs.

Part 5
STREET ADOPTION
§ 501. Policy. [Ord. 147, 11/26/1985]
The Township of North Strabane hereby adopts the policy of accepting as
many existing roads and/or streets as is possible into the road system.
§ 502. Investigation of Existing Private Roads. [Ord. 147, 11/26/
1985]
Where a given road which has been heretofore classified or referred to as
a "private road" is to be considered for acceptance into the road system,
an initial investigation shall be conducted by the Township to determine
whether or not the road has ever been formally accepted by resolution of
the Board of Supervisors; whether the road or street is part of a subdivision
which has been recorded in the Recorder's Officer of Washington County
with dedications and/or releases of damages, or whether the road or street
has, in fact, been used on a regular basis by the public, giving rise to an
acceptance by implication and by public use. After this investigation has
been completed, a recommendation shall be made as to whether or not
the road can be incorporated into the road system. If the investigation
establishes that legal impediments exist which prevent the acceptance of
the road or street or which may give rise to damages in the event the
road or street is accepted, the Board of Supervisors may, if it feels such
action is appropriate, authorize and allocate funds necessary to acquire the
necessary consents, waivers, rights-of-way, or releases which will alleviate
the legal impediments and enable the Township to accept the road or street
into the road system.
§ 503. Petition. [Ord. 147, 11/26/1985]
Must precede acceptance procedure. The Township shall not consider
accepting a private road into the road system, effectuating the procedure
outlined in § 502, unless it shall receive a petition which requests the
acceptance of the street involved into the road system and which was
executed by a majority of the property owners who abut on the street or
portion of street which is being considered for acceptance.
§ 504. Justification of Expenditure of Municipal Funds. [Ord. 147,
11/26/1985]
Even though the acceptance of private roads as public roads may ultimately
result in the expenditure of Township funds, the overall objective is of such
importance to the growth of Township that the Board of Supervisors shall
be authorized to allocate from the general funds such amounts as may be
necessary to implement the project and such funds may be used to acquire
deeds of dedication, easements and rights-of-way, to obtain releases and
waivers of damage in order to remove the legal impediments preventing the
acceptance of a given street, or for any other purpose so required.
§ 501 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 505
1:413
§ 505. Investigation; Estimate of Costs; Report by Solicitor. [Ord.
147, 11/26/1985]
The Township shall treat the proposed street or road which is to be
incorporated into the road system on an individual basis and shall
investigate the facts surrounding the issue of whether the Township has
a legal basis for accepting the road and/or street into its road system.
The Board of Supervisors shall then request the Solicitor to make a
recommendation as to the appropriate legal approach which can be utilized
to accomplish this objective, together with an estimate of the possible
damages and costs involved in taking over specific individual roads and/or
streets involved.
§ 506. Decision by Board of Supervisors. [Ord. 147, 11/26/1985]
Upon receipt of the information, secured pursuant to § 505 above, the Board
of Supervisors shall make a definitive decision whether, in light of the legal
problems and the estimated costs involved, the road and/or street shall be
further considered for acceptance. If an affirmative decision is reached, the
Board of Supervisors shall establish the procedure to be followed and shall
authorize the expenditure of such funds as may be necessary to carry out
this procedure.
§ 507. Review by Engineer and Solicitor. [Ord. 147, 11/26/1985]
In arriving at its decision, the Board of Supervisors may authorize the
Township Engineer and the Township Solicitor to review each proposed
road, considering, among other things, the costs of improving the street
and/or road and of acquiring the necessary deeds of dedication, easements,
rights-of-way, releases and waivers of damages.
§ 508. Cost Responsibility. [Ord. 147, 11/26/1985]
Whenever appropriate, all of the costs of accepting the road and/or street
into the road system, including but not necessarily limited to the legal fees,
the engineering charges, the costs of securing and recording appropriate
deeds of dedication, easements, rights-of-way, releases and waivers of
damages, together with such other administrative expenses as may result,
shall be apportioned equitably against all involved property owners
pursuant to law and consistent with the Township's established policy. If this
is not possible because of legal impediments or otherwise not feasible, then
and in that event, such amounts as may be necessary may be appropriated
out of the general fund to accomplish these objectives.
§ 509. Implied Acceptance by Public User. [Ord. 147, 11/26/1985]
When the acceptance of a particular road and/or street may be based upon
an implied acceptance by public user, the appropriate municipal officials
shall determine such facts as are available, and the Board of Supervisors
shall either hold a public hearing or place the matter on the agenda of
one of its regular meetings, at which time documentation and evidence
§ 505 NORTH STRABANE CODE § 509
1:414
may be introduced into the record on the issue. Township residents and
interested parties may offer such evidence as appropriate, and an overall
determination shall be made as to whether there has been an implied
dedication of acceptance by public user which will authorize legal
acceptance of the road and/or street into the road system.
§ 510. Acceptance Procedure. [Ord. 147, 11/26/1985]
The procedure which shall be adopted for considering whether to accept
a particular street and/or road into the road system shall conform in all
respects, except as otherwise specifically outlined herein, to the procedure
utilized in considering curative amendments submitted to the Board of
Supervisors pursuant to § 609.1 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning
Code, 55 P.S. § 10609.1 et seq., as far as hearings, the production of
documents, the taking of testimony and the submission of evidence are
concerned.
§ 511. Record of Testimony. [Ord. 147, 11/26/1985]
In the event a hearing is held, or the matter is placed on the agenda,
a verbatim record will be made of all testimony and comments, and all
documentation shall be appropriately marked as exhibits and kept in a
separate file pertaining to the road and/or street involved.
§ 512. Liquid Fuel Tax Requirements to be Met. [Ord. 147, 11/26/
1985]
Any street, road or part thereof, dedicated for acceptance under this Part
into the road system, shall comply with the minimum requirements of the
Pennsylvania Department of Transportation covering the allocation of liquid
fuel tax receipts and the standards promulgated therewith.
§ 513. Improvements. [Ord. 147, 11/26/1985]
The Township of North Strabane, upon appropriate action by the Board
of Supervisors, may grade, curb, gutter, pave or otherwise improve with
suitable materials any public street, road, or part thereof, laid out and
opened in the Township, accepted by formal resolution or declared in
appropriate proceeding to be a public road by virtue of public user. Such
work may be done by Township employees or by contract, as the Board of
Supervisors shall determine. No street, road, or any part thereof shall be
improved under the provisions of this Part except by petitions of a majority
of the owners of property abutting on the street or road or part thereof
proposed to be improved.
§ 514. Improvement Cost Assessments. [Ord. 147, 11/26/1985]
The costs and expenses of any such improvement may be collected from the
owners of the real estate abutting on such street, road, or part thereof by
an equal assessment on the feet front. Such assessment shall be estimated
by the Township Engineer. If this standard of assessment is impracticable
§ 509 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 514
1:415
or for any reason inequitable, the Township Engineer shall adopt such other
method of assessment as may be legally acceptable and equitable in the
premises.
§ 515. Utility Line Considerations. [Ord. 147, 11/26/1985]
Prior to improving any street, road, or part thereof, an investigation shall be
conducted by the Township Engineer to determine the possible existence of
utility lines under the street, road, or part thereof proposed to be improved,
and the said street, road, or part thereof shall not be improved unless or
until appropriate steps are taken to either remove the utility lines or to
otherwise alleviate the problem in a manner satisfactory to the Township
Engineer.
§ 516. Additional Regulations. [Ord. 147, 11/26/1985]
The Board of Supervisors shall also establish such other procedures and
adopt such regulations as may be appropriate in the premises to effectuate
the general intent of this Part.

construction permit application, the Township will provide a written
response to the applicant explaining the basis of the denial. If the
Township fails to grant or deny the construction permit within the time
period specified above, the application shall be deemed granted. In
each case, the Township shall review the application to determine
whether such construction would have a detrimental impact on public
safety as it relates to the rights-of-way. The Township may impose
conditions on the construction permit regulating the times, locations,
and manner of construction to preserve effective traffic flow, prevent
hazardous road conditions and/or minimize noise impacts.

restrictions on the construction activity. If the application for a
construction permit is denied, this fee shall not be refunded. If the
application is granted, then the applicant shall also pay, within 30 days
of the presentation of a statement, the Township's actual costs directly
related to the applicant's construction project, based on the hourly rate

expenses prior to them being incurred and provides the permit holder
with an opportunity to mitigate such expenses. Examples of
extraordinary or unusual costs include but are not limited to the cost of
obtaining and operating a backhoe, dump truck or other heavy
equipment used to repair the right-of-way, overtime or special pay for

the permit holder shall be directly related to the Township's actual
costs.

upon submission of the application or by the date due, the applicant or
permit holder shall pay a late payment penalty of simple interest at 10%
annual percentage rate of the total amount past due. Such penalty shall
be in lieu of any other monetary penalty. Acceptance of payment under
this section shall not in any way limit or waive the Township's right to
suspend or terminate the permit according to the terms of this Part.

considered complete and properly filed, unless and until, all items
required by subsection (10) of this Section for a preliminary
application, including the filing fee, have been received by the
Township. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to submit plans
to the Washington Planning Commission as required.

specific conditions or disapproval of the proposed preliminary
application and shall communicate its decision, in writing, to the Board

the Township Planning Commission's own review and the review and
comments submitted by the Township Engineer. If plan revisions are
necessitated by the Planning Commission's recommendation, the
developer shall submit seven copies of the revised preliminary plat at
least five working days before the meeting of the Board of Supervisors
at which the application is to be considered.
5. Approval by Board of Supervisors. Within 90 days of the date of the

Planning Commission or until the County recommendations on the plan
are received by the Township, whichever is earlier.
6. Failure to Render a Decision. Failure of the Board of Supervisors to
render a decision and/or to communicate it to the developer within the
time and in the manner required in subsection (5), above, shall be
deemed an approval of the application as presented, unless the
developer has agreed in writing to an extension of time or change in the
prescribed manner of presentation of the decision, in which case failure
to meet the extended time or change in manner of presentation or
communication shall have the same effect.
7. Conditional Approval. If the Board of Supervisors determines that
certain conditions are warranted to be attached to preliminary approval
to protect the public interest and guarantee compliance with the
requirements of this Chapter, the conditions of approval shall be
specified, in writing, in the notice of the official decision required by
subsection (5) of this Section. The applicant shall accept or reject the
conditions attached to the approval by giving written notice to the

8. Amendment of Ordinances Affection Application.
A. From the time an application for approval of a subdivision, land
development or mobile home park is duly filed with the Zoning
Officer and or Planning Coordinator of the Township and while such
application is pending approval or disapproval, no change or
amendment of this Chapter or others affecting development in the
Township shall influence the decision on such application adversely
to the developer and the developer shall be entitled to a decision in
accordance with the provisions of this Chapter and others affecting
development in the Township as they stood at the time the
application was duly filed. However, if an application is properly
and finally denied, any subsequent application shall be subject to
any intervening changes in this or other ordinances.

to answer questions raised by the Commission relative to the
application. Such final application may be for all or a part of a plan
already given preliminary approval, in accordance with subsection (9),
below.
2. Review and Referral by the Zoning Officer and or Planning Coordinator.
Prior to the regular meeting of the Planning Commission for which an
application is submitted, the Zoning Officer and or Planning
Coordinator shall review the submitted documents as to conformance
with the requirements of this Chapter and other applicable Township
regulations upon development and as to incorporation of required
conditions, addition, deletions and/or changes resulting from the
preliminary approval. If the Zoning Officer and or Planning Coordinator
is satisfied that all requirements have been met in the application, he
shall submit copies to the applicable parties in the Township. If the
Zoning Officer and or Planning Coordinator is not satisfied that all
requirements have been met in the final application, he shall return the
application to the developer as incomplete or improperly filed,
indicating to the developer, in writing, the specific discrepancies and
citing the specific provisions of the Chapter which have not been met
and request the developer to correct the documents to conform before
again starting the final application approval procedure. An application
for final approval shall not be considered complete and properly filed
unless and until all items required by subsection (9) of this Section for a
final application, including the filing fee, having been received by the
Township.
3. Recommendation by the Planning Commission. The Planning
Commission shall recommend approval or disapproval of the proposed
final application to the Board of Supervisors, in writing, not later than
§ 302 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 303
1:463
60 days after the date of the meeting at which the final application was
accepted as complete and properly filed. The recommendation shall
be based upon the Commission's own review including, if needed, a
field visit to the property and the review comments submitted by the
Township Engineer.
4. Approval by Board of Supervisors. Within 90 days of the date of the
Planning Commission meeting at which the final application is accepted
as complete and properly filed, the Board of Supervisors shall approve,
approve with conditions or disapprove the proposed final application at
a public meeting and shall communicate the official decision, in writing,
to the developer at his address of record not later than 15 days after the
decision is reached indicating specifically, if the approval is denied, the
reasons for denial citing the appropriate ordinance Sections. However,
the action shall not be taken until at least 30 days after the plan was
sent to the County Planning Commission or until the County
recommendations on the plan are received by the Township, whichever
is earlier.
5. Public Hearing, Failure to Render a Decision and Amendment of
Ordinance Affecting Applications. The regulations contained in
§ 302(3), § 302(6) and § 302(8), entitled "Public Hearing," "Failure to
Render a Decision" and "Amendment of Ordinance Affecting
Applications," governing preliminary applications, shall also apply to
the final application procedure.
6. Conditional Approval. If the Board of Supervisors determines that
certain conditions are warranted to be attached to final approval to
protect the public interest and guarantee compliance with the
requirements of this Chapter, the conditions of approval shall be
specified, in writing, in the notice of the official decision required by
subsection (4) of this Section. The applicant shall accept the conditions
attached to the approval either by giving written notice to the Township
Secretary or executing the development agreement required by
subsection (8) of this Section within 30 days of the date at which final
approval with conditions is granted. If the applicant fails to execute the
development agreement or to give written notice to the Township
regarding acceptance of the conditions attached to final approval
within the required 30 days, final approval shall automatically be
rescinded without written notice to the applicant.
7. Resolution Indicating Approval. When requested by the developer, in
order to facilitate financing, the Board of Supervisors shall furnish the
developer with a signed copy of a resolution indicating approval of the
final plat contingent upon the developer obtaining a satisfactory
financial security. The final plat or record plan shall not be signed nor
recorded until the financial improvements agreement is executed. The
resolution or letter of contingent approval shall expire and be deemed
to be revoked if the financial security agreement is not executed within
90 days, unless a written extension is granted by the Board of
§ 303 NORTH STRABANE CODE § 303
1:464
Supervisors. Such extension shall not be unreasonably withheld and
shall be placed in writing at the request of the developer.
8. Guarantee That Improvements Will Be Completed. As a condition of
final approval, the developer has two options. The developer may
either:
A. Deposit with North Strabane Township an improvement bond, as
defined by this Chapter, after bond review by the Township
Solicitor, to be held in escrow and equal to 110% of the total
estimate cost, determined and posted in accordance with the
procedure specified in § 304(1) of this Chapter, for all
improvements to be constructed to serve the approved final plan
(and not to be guaranteed by requirements of other authorities),
agreed to by the developer and Township.
B. Waive the improvements bond and construct all improvements
agreed to between himself and the Township, but relinquish the
right to be issued any building permits for construction on lots
served by the improvements until all improvements have been
completed, inspected and approved by the Township. The
procedure for inspection and approval of the improvements shall
be in accordance with §§ 305 through 311 of this Chapter; however,
in lieu of release of the improvement bond, the proper officers of
the Township shall be authorized to execute the final plat for
recording purposes upon satisfactory completion of the
improvements. Building permits shall not be authorized for any lot
in the plan until all required improvements have been accepted by
the Township and the final plat has been recorded in the County
Recorder of Deeds Office in accordance with § 304(5) and § 304(6)

Chapter. No offers or statements made in the mediation sessions,
excluding the final written mediated agreement, shall be
admissible as evidence in any subsequent judicial or administrative
proceedings.
1. Improvement Bond.
A. In lieu of the completion of any improvement required prior to and
as a condition for final approval of a plat, the applicant shall deposit
an improvement bond, as defined by this Chapter, in favor of the
Township, in an amount equal to 110% of the cost of completion of
the improvements estimated as of 90 days following the date
scheduled for completion by the developer. Annually the Township
may adjust the amount of the financial security by comparing the
actual cost of the improvements which have been completed and
the estimated cost for the completion of the remaining
improvements as of the expiration of the 90th day after either the
original date scheduled for completion or a rescheduled date of
completion. Subsequent to said adjustment, the Township may
require the developer to post additional security in order to assure
that the financial security equals said 110%. Any additional
security shall be posted by the developer in accordance with this
subsection.
§ 303 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 304
1:469
B. The amount of the improvement bond required shall be based upon
an estimate of the cost of completion of the required
improvements, submitted by an applicant or developer and
prepared by a professional engineer licensed as such in this
Commonwealth and certified by such engineer to be a fair and
reasonable estimate of such cost. The Township, upon the
recommendation of the Township Engineer, may refuse to accept
such estimate for good cause shown. If the applicant or developer
and the Township are unable to agree upon an estimate, then the
estimate shall be recalculated and recertified by another
professional engineer licensed as such in this Commonwealth and
chosen mutually by the Township and the applicant or developer.
The estimate certified by the third engineer shall be presumed fair
and reasonable, and shall be the final estimate. In the event that a
third engineer is so chosen, fees for the services of said engineer
shall be paid equally by the Township and the applicant or
developer.
C. If the party posting the improvement bond requires more than one
year from the date of posting of the financial security to complete
the required improvements, the amount of financial security may
be increased by an additional 10% for each one-year period beyond
the first anniversary date from posting of the improvement bond or
to an amount not exceeding 110% of the cost of completing the
required improvements as reestablished on or about the expiration
of the preceding one year period by using the above procedure.
2. Amenities Bond. In lieu of completion of any improvement which is not
proposed to be dedicated to the public, but which is required prior to,
or as a condition for, final plat approval, the applicant may be required
"at the discretion of the Township" to deposit with the Township, an
amenities bond, as defined by this Chapter, in favor of the Township, in
an amount sufficient to cover the costs of all such required
improvements. The amenities bond shall be in an amount equal to 110%
of the cost of the improvements for which the amenities bond is posted.
The procedure for determining the amount of the amenities bond and
for extending the amenities bond for a period beyond one year shall be
the same as the procedures specified in subsection (1), above, for
determining and extending the improvement bond.
3. Development Agreement. Before granting final approval, the Board of
Supervisors shall require that the developer execute a development
agreement with the Township, in a form acceptable to the Township
Solicitor, containing any conditions of approval, provisions that are
reasonably required to guarantee the proper installation of onsite and
off-site improvements related to the subdivision and/or land
development and provisions necessary to indemnify the Township in
connection therewith. Said agreement shall be executed, the
improvement bond required by subsection (1) of this Section shall be
posted, the amenities bond required by subsection (2) of this Section, if

required, and the perpetual maintenance bond required by § 512(F) of
this Chapter, if required, shall be posted and all required fees shall be
paid before the Township Manager shall affix his or her signature and
the Township seal to the final plat for recording purposes.
4. Approval by Other Agencies. Approval of final plats by the Board of
Supervisors shall not be binding if County, State or Federal agencies
find just cause to disapprove the development. It shall be the
developer's responsibility to obtain all necessary approvals from
County, State or Federal agencies.
5. Recording of Final Plat. Upon approval of a final plat by the Township,
the developer shall, within 90 days of such final approval, record such
plat in the office of the Washington County Recorder of Deeds or the
Township's approval shall be null and void. Final plats for land
development plans which are proposed for lots within a previously
recorded plat, shall not be required by this Chapter to be recorded in
the Washington County Recorder of Deeds Office, provided there is no
change to any lot line, easement, right-of-way or other recorded feature
of the previously recorded plan. If a land development plan is proposed
which includes a subdivision, resubdivision or consolidation, the final
plat for the subdivision, resubdivision or consolidation shall be
recorded. In no case shall building locations, parking areas,
landscaping and other private improvements proposed in any land
development plan be required to be recorded; however, all information
specified by § 303(8) for a final application shall be required to be
submitted for approval by the Township, whether or not a final plat is
recorded.
6. Filing of Copies. Within five days of recording of the final plat in the
Office of the County Recorder of Deeds, the developer shall submit a
copy of the recording receipt to the Township Zoning Officer or Code
Enforcement Officer and or Planning Coordinator. As soon as is
practical after recording of the final plat in the Office of the County
Recorder of Deeds, the developer shall deliver to the Township Zoning
Officer or Code Enforcement Officer and or Planning Coordinator one
reproducible and two paper prints of the plat as recorded, containing
all required signatures and dates of approval. Proof of recording shall
be required prior to the issuance of any building permit for any lot
shown on the final plat.
1. Prior to initiating any construction in an approved plan, the developer
shall attend a preconstruction meeting with the Township Zoning
Officer or Code Enforcement Officer, and or Planning Coordinator, Road
Superintendent and other appropriate Township officials to discuss
inspection procedures and the schedule for construction.

1:471
§ 306. Notice of Completion. [Ord. 234, 5/27/1997, § 306]
When the developer has completed the required public improvements in
a plan, the developer shall notify the Township, in writing, by certified
or registered mail. Within 10 days of the receipt of such notification, the
Board of Supervisors shall authorize the Township Engineer to inspect the
public improvements in the plan to determine compliance with the design
standards and standards for construction specified in Parts 4 and 5 of this
Chapter.
§ 307. Filing of Plans. [Ord. 234, 5/27/1997, § 307]
Upon completion of the public improvements in a plan, "as-built" plans

with the Township by the developer within 10 days of the mailing of the
notice of completion. In addition, the developer's engineer shall submit a
certification, under the engineer's seal, that the improvements have been
installed and completed in accordance with the plans and specifications
designed by the engineer.
2. The developer shall notify the inspector at least 72 hours prior to
beginning any installation of public improvements in an approved plan.
While work is in progress, the developer shall notify the inspector at
least 72 hours prior to the time that the following minimum required
progress inspections are desired. The Township reserves the right to
perform inspections in addition to the minimum required progress
inspections listed below at the discretion of the inspector, if conditions
warrant:
A. Review and approval of subgrade of streets prior to laying of base.
B. Review and approval of base prior to final paving of streets.
C. Review and approval of streets after wearing course or seal coat is

§ 308. Inspection and Release from Improvement Bond. [Ord. 234,
5/27/1997, § 308]
1. The Board of Supervisors shall, within 10 days after receipt of the
notice of completion, direct and authorize the Township Engineer to
inspect all the improvements to determine compliance with the design
standards and standards for construction specified in Parts 4 and 5 of
this Chapter.
2. Having made his inspection, the Township Engineer shall file a detailed
report, in writing, with the Board of Supervisors, not later than 30 days
after receipt of the authorization to proceed, with a copy of the report
sent by registered mail to the developer. The report shall indicate
approval or rejection of the improvements either in whole or in part. In
the event that the Township Engineer shall not approve or shall reject
any or all of the improvements, his report shall contain a statement of
specific reasons for each such failure to approve or rejection. Upon
receipt of the Township Engineer's report and its acceptance by the
Board of Supervisors shall, within 15 days after its regular monthly
meeting next succeeding receipt of the report, notify the developer in
writing by certified mail of its action relative to the Township
Engineer's report.
3. If the Board of Supervisors or the Township Engineer fails to comply
with the time limitation provisions of this Section, all improvements will
be deemed to have been approved and the developer shall be released
from all liability pursuant to the improvement bond posted with the
Township.
4. If any portion of the improvements are not approved or are rejected by
the Board, the developer shall proceed to complete the improvements
so designated and, upon completion, the same procedure of
notification, inspection and approval shall be initiated as outlined in this
Part shall be followed.
5. Nothing in this Part shall be construed to limit the developer's right to
contest or question by legal proceedings or otherwise any
determination of the Board of Supervisors or the Township Engineer.
6. If any improvement covered by the improvement bond have not been
installed during the time that the improvement bond remains in effect,
the Board shall have the power to enforce the improvement bond by
appropriate legal action and equitable remedies. If proceeds of such
improvement bond are insufficient to cover the cost of installing or
making repairs or corrections to all the improvements covered by the
improvement bond and found unacceptable or left uninstalled, the
Board at its option, may install such improvements. All of the proceeds,
whether resulting from the satisfying of the improvement bond or from
any legal or equitable action brought against the developer, or both,
shall be used solely for the installation of improvements covered by
such security and for no other municipal purpose.

§ 310. Acceptance of Public Improvements. [Ord. 234, 5/27/1997,
§ 310]
7. The developer and the Board may agree to a program of partial release
of the improvement bond as the installation of improvements is
completed. Such procedure shall leave remaining under the
improvement bond at least enough credit to complete all improvements
not yet accepted. The Township shall authorize the release of funds
upon receipt of written certification from the Township Engineer that
the work for which release is requested has been completed in
accordance with the approved plat. The Township shall authorize
release of funds in an amount as estimated by the Township Engineer
that fairly represents the value of the improvements completed, less
10% retainage.
1. Approval of improvements shall not constitute an acceptance for
repairs or maintenance by the Board of Supervisors. All improvements
shall remain in private ownership until such time as their dedication
shall have been accepted by resolution, as provided for in § 310 of this
Part or until condemned for public use. The costs of advertising and
filing, if any, for the adoption of the resolution shall be borne by the
developer or the corporation requesting the adoption, except in the
case of condemnation, in which case the Township shall bear such
costs.
2. As a condition of immediate acceptance by resolution, the developer
shall post a maintenance bond, as defined by this Chapter, in
accordance with the requirements of § 311, below.
3. The recording of a plan shall not constitute grounds for assessment
increases until such time as lots are sold or improvements are installed
on the land.
1. Upon completion of the inspection and approval of the public
improvements, the developer shall submit a request to the Board of
Supervisors, in writing, to accept the dedication of the public
improvements. The request for acceptance shall be submitted at least
10 days prior to the regular meeting of the Board and shall include legal
descriptions of all rights-of-way for streets to be dedicated to the
Township. At the regular meeting, the Board shall adopt a resolution
accepting the public improvements as part of the Township's public
facilities, subject to the posting of the maintenance bond required by
§ 311 of this Chapter.
2. No property or public improvement shown on a final plat shall be
considered to have been finally accepted by the Township until the
dedication thereof has been officially accepted by adoption of a

§ 312. Release of Amenities Bond. [Ord. 234, 5/27/1997, § 312]
Upon written notice by the Township Engineer that the improvements
guaranteed by the amenities bond have been satisfactorily completed, the
Township shall authorize release of the amenities bond. Since the amenities
bond is posted to guarantee completion of required improvements that are
not to be dedicated to the public, release of the amenities bond shall not
imply approval by the Township of the method of construction or structural
integrity of the improvements, nor shall there be any liability associated
with or responsibility for maintenance of the improvements.
resolution of the Township, duly enacted and advertised in accordance
with law.
1. When the Board of Supervisors accepts the dedication of all or some of
the required public improvements in a plan, following their completion,
the Board shall require the posting of a maintenance bond, as defined
by this Chapter, to secure the structural integrity of the improvements
and to guarantee the proper functioning of those improvements in
accordance with the design and standards for construction specified in
Parts 4 and 5 of this Chapter, and the specifications of the final plat.
2. The term of the maintenance bond shall be for a period of 18 months
from the date of the acceptance of the public improvements by the
Board of Supervisors. The amount of the maintenance bond shall be
15% of the actual cost of installation of the public improvements.

1:490
§ 512. Drainage and Stormwater Management. [Ord. 234, 5/27/
1997, § 512]
existing alignment of such watercourses and of sufficient width to
preserve natural drainage.
4. Where a developer proposes to alter the land surface drainage patterns,
he shall:
A. Collect runoff from the development for discharge at stabilized
points entering the natural watercourse of the drainage area.
B. Design his drainage system to accommodate stormwater runoff
generated from the potential full development of the area upstream
from his property.
C. Provide and install all erosion and sedimentation control measures
and facilities at his expense in accordance with the approved
erosion and sedimentation control plan.
1. All areas of a subdivision, land development plan or mobile home park
to be developed with streets, residential lots or sites, recreation areas
or other uses shall be graded to assure positive drainage.
2. Storm sewers, culverts and related installations shall be provided to
ensure the controlled flow of natural watercourses and to guarantee the
drainage of all low points along the curb or gutter lines, as well as at
intervals related to slope, of all streets in or adjacent to the plan. Where
driveways cross gutter lines or on streets without curbs, they shall be
designed to allow passage of stormwater along the gutter line or
passage via a pipe below the driveway entrance of proper type and size
to carry the run-off. In no case shall stormwater flowing down a
driveway be permitted to cross a public street.
3. In designing the storm drainage system, the developer shall use as his
guide the publication "Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds,"
Technical Release No. 55, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Soil
Conservation Service, June 1986, and as amended. The predevelopment
condition of the parcel to be developed shall consider the state of the
land surface on the date that the developer entered into an agreement
to purchase the property. The developer may pass through stormwater
originating upstream of his property, but if he elects to control it,
bypass devices he installs shall be capable of handling the one-hundredyear
twenty-four-hour peak flow, and he may trade off, as compensation
for such installations, control measures that would normally be
required on his property, provided that the total control system results
in equal or better protection for downstream properties. If a property is
to be laid out in lots, no reduction in lot size shall be permitted to
accommodate storm drainage detention structures. The developer shall
consult with the Washington County office of the Soil Conservation
Service before developing his storm drainage plans. The Township and
§ 511 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 512
1:491
others reviewing a stormwater control plan will use discretion in
considering unusual conditions, such as drainage from several basins
on the same property under development.
4. The stormwater drainage plan of a subdivision, land development plan
or mobile home park shall be designed to assure that, after
development, stormwater does not leave the property at a greater
velocity or volume per second than before development commenced.
A. Volumes of runoff from the drainage area(s) must be calculated to
determine the sizing of temporary and permanent facilities to
control stormwater and erosion. For the purpose of this Part, storm
events are based on the amount of runoff during a period of 24
hours, as follows:
Storm Frequency Inches of Rainfall
2-year 2.3
5-year 3.3
10-year 3.9
25-year 4.4
one-hundred-year 5.2
B. Storm sewer system within a development shall be designed to
handle the peak rate of runoff from a twenty-five-year frequency
storm. Where the provisions of federal and state laws impose a
greater design frequency, particularly in areas where drainage
systems cross highways, they shall prevail.
C. All stormwater retention/detention facilities shall be designed on
the basis of providing adequate control for all storm frequencies of
a twenty-four-hour duration up to and including the twenty-fiveyear
storm. All designs shall provide emergency overflow facilities
for the one-hundred-year, twenty-four-hour duration storm, unless
positive measures are installed to control the inflow so as not to
exceed the safe capacity of the retention/detention facility.
D. The retention volume required shall be that necessary to handle
runoff of a twenty-five-year, twenty-four-hour duration storm from
the development, less that volume discharged during the same
duration at the approved release rate.
E. The approved peak release rate of stormwater from all retention/
detention facilities for any storm event shall be that which was
experienced prior to development for the twenty-four-hour
duration of the same storm event up to and including the twentyfive-
year storm.
F. Storm sewers shall be designed utilizing the Rational Method with
a Pennsylvania Department of Transportation twenty-five-year
storm from their intensity duration charts.
§ 512 NORTH STRABANE CODE § 512
1:492
5. Detention areas, where required to impede runoff, shall be designed to
meet or exceed the following standards:
A. Except where a permanent pond is approved by the Board of
Supervisors, detention areas shall be designed to drain completely.
B. The area to be occupied by the dam shall be cleared of all topsoil
and organic materials prior to construction. The dam shall be built
up in layers not to exceed six inches in depth with equipment
providing 95% compaction at optimum moisture conditions. The
top of the dam shall be constructed 10% higher than its designed
height to allow for settlement.
C. The settled elevation of the top of the dam at its lowest point shall
be not less than one foot above the maximum water level to be
impounded behind the dam and not less than two feet above the
elevation of the emergency spillway.
D. The surfaces of the dam shall be planted in a mixture of perennial
quick-catching grasses and crown vetch.
E. The face of the dam shall not slope on either face less than one foot
of vertical rise for each two feet of horizontal run and not more
than a total on both faces of one foot of vertical rise for each five
feet of horizontal run.
F. The horizontal drainpipe passing through the dam shall be smooth
steel, Schedule 40 or heavier, or reinforced concrete pipe with
equivalent strength and hydraulic characteristics. Anti-seepage
collars shall be placed not less than 28 feet apart along the length
of the pipe. Each collar shall be fabricated of not less than onefourth-
inch steel plate, shall extend not less than two feet in all
directions at right angles from the outer face of the pipe, shall be
welded in place all around, and shall be completely enclosed within
the dam fill.
G. The top of the outlet structure to drain the pond shall be not less
than three feet in height above the invert elevation of the horizontal
pipe, shall have openings not less than four inches in diameter, and
shall be fitted with an anti-vortex device and a trash rack. All outlet
structures shall be constructed of concrete. Metal structures are
not permitted.
H. The emergency spillway shall be capable of passing the flow
created by one-hundred-year storm.
I. The low edge of a parking area, curbed or not, may serve the
purpose of an emergency spillway to pass the overflow from a
stormwater detention area, provided that the embankment below
the edge is well stabilized with planting materials and the angle of
the slope will not encourage erosion, in the opinion of the Township
and other reviewing agencies. The maximum depth of water on a
§ 512 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 512
1:493
parking area used for stormwater management purposes shall not
exceed eight inches.
6. The owner or developer, when required by the Township, shall enter
into a legal agreement approved by the Township Solicitor which shall
hold the Township harmless from any and all liability relating to storm
drainage collection and its discharge during construction of the system
and thereafter. The agreement shall also make provisions for
maintenance of the system(s) constructed. The owner or developer
shall secure, where necessary, off-site easements for storm drainage.
7. Maintenance Standards for Stormwater Management Facilities. The
following requirements are established for the ownership and
maintenance of the of said facilities:
A. Nonresidential facilities and maintenance thereof shall become the
responsibility of the owner of the property owner.
B. In any case where a homeowners' association is established,
operation and maintenance of retention or detention facilities shall
become the responsibility of that entity.
C. In cases where there is no homeowners' association, and
stormwater facilities are constructed that are "detention" in
nature, and constructed in accordance with the Township
standards, and approved by the Township Engineer, the Township
may consider acceptance of the facility as a part of the public
improvements. The developer shall provide (to the permanent
North Strabane Township Perpetual Maintenance and Repair Fund
for Stormwater Facilities) an amount determined by the Township
Engineer which, at a rate of 6% per annum, will provide sufficient
interest income per year to the annual maintenance of such
facilities.
Example: Maintenance $250 per year = $4,166.67 deposit
$500 per year = $8,333.33 deposit
Prior to the Township approving the final plan upon which
stormwater facilities are shown for dedication to the Township,
the developer or owner shall provide to the Township satisfactory
surety as approved by the Township Solicitor to ensure the
payment of said required maintenance amount to North Strabane
Township Perpetual Maintenance and Repair Fund for Stormwater
Facilities, at the completion of construction and prior to
acceptance by the Township Engineer. Under no circumstances
will the Township accept facilities that are considered to be
"retention" in nature.
8. The costs of review and inspection by the Township Engineer of the
stormwater management system as proposed by the developer shall be
borne by the developer, whether or not the plan is ultimately approved.
The Engineer shall review such changes as the developer may make in
§ 512 NORTH STRABANE CODE § 512

approved dam during its various stages of construction and to point
out to the contractor, the developer and Board any deviations from the
design as approved.
9. Catch basins shall be pre-cast concrete meeting at least the standards
of the current edition of Pennsylvania Department of Transportation's
specification sheet RC-52. Catch basins shall be located no further
apart than 400 feet, measured between catch basins on the same side of
the street.
10. Graded areas shall be stabilized with erosion resisting plantings placed
immediately after the completion of grading. Graded slopes produced
by placing fill earth over the preexisting surface shall be keyed into the

shall be established and easements provided where necessary. No
property owner shall be permitted to alter, fill or disrupt the operation
of an open channel.
12. All persons, partnerships or corporations intending to excavate, fill or
grade land in the Township shall be required to apply for a grading
permit under the terms of Township Ord. 162, as amended [Chapter 9],
and shall have a valid grading permit in their possession prior to the
start of any grading work. Work shall be undertaken in conformance
with the requirements of Ord. 162 [Chapter 9].

are not reimbursed or otherwise imposed on applicants.
B. In the event the applicant disputes the amount of any such expense
in connection with the inspection of improvements, the applicant

Township is located or if at the time there be no President Judge,
then the senior active judge then sitting shall appoint such
engineer who, in that case, shall be neither the Township Engineer
nor any professional engineer who has been retained by, or
performed services for, the Township or the applicant within the
preceding five years.
E. The fees of the appointed professional engineer for determining the
reasonable and necessary expenses shall be paid by the applicant if
the amount of payment required in the decision is equal to or
greater than the original bill. If the amount of payment required in
the decision is less than the original bill by $1,000 or more, the
Township shall pay the fee of the professional engineer, but
§ 905 NORTH STRABANE CODE § 905
1:516
otherwise the Township and the applicant shall each pay 1/2 of the
fee of the appointed professional engineer.

Space Plan, other parks and recreation objectives, or for other
community development reasons.
D. In the event that the organization established to own and maintain
recreation open space or any successor organization shall at any

manner in which the organization has failed to maintain the
recreation space in reasonable condition.
E. If the deficiencies set forth in the original notice or in the
modifications thereof shall not be corrected within 30 days or any
extension thereof, the Township, in order to preserve the taxable
values of the properties within the land development/subdivision

nuisance, may enter upon the recreation open space and perform
maintenance as necessary. The maintenance performed by the
§ 1103 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 1103
1:527
Township shall not constitute a taking of the recreation open space
nor vest in the public any rights to use the same.
F. The pro-rata cost of such maintenance by the Township shall be
assessed ratably against the properties within the land
development/subdivision that have a right of enjoyment of the

space for the purpose of maintenance, shall file a notice of lien in
the Washington County Office of the Prothonotary upon the
properties affected by the lien within the land development/

6. Size/Location.
A. For access and visibility, the recreation open space shall have a
minimum frontage of 100 feet on an existing or proposed street or

1:529
§ 1104. Fee-in-lieu Requirements. [Ord. 303, 4/26/2005, § 4]
10. Timing of Dedication.
A. Land shall be dedicated for park/recreation use at the time that the
subdivision is recorded with Washington County. If the land
development/subdivision occurs in phases, the Township may, at its
discretion, allow the overall area of land required for park/
recreation development to be dedicated, either in whole or in part,
in a later phase(s) of the land development/subdivision. If the
Township permits such dedication to occur, the landowner and/or
developer shall post financial security to the Township equivalent
to that defined by resolution, as amended, at the time that the first
phase of the subdivision/land development is recorded. The posted
financial security shall be returned to the landowner and/or
developer upon completion of said park/recreation development.
The area of land to be dedicated for park/recreation use per
development phase shall, at a minimum, be equal to the following
equation:
Minimum land dedication per development phase = Unit of
Dedication25 Multiplied by the total number of units in the
proposed land development/subdivision phase.
B. In the event that more than the minimum land dedicated per
development phase is provided in a development's early phase(s),
the developer shall not be required, in a subsequent phase(s), to
provide more than the total minimum land dedicated for the entire
subdivision.
11. Modifications/Waivers. If land to be dedicated totals less than three
acres, the Board of Supervisors may waive or modify the above
requirements if such land is identified for a different purpose as part of
the Township's Comprehensive Park, Recreation and Open Space Plan.
12. Any land dedicated to the public shall be maintained in accordance with
§ 503(11) of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code.
1. In lieu of the dedication of land for recreation open spaces, a developer
shall pay a recreation fee to the Township for the provision of parks and
recreation.
2. The recreation fee requirements may be amended, adopted by
resolution, and published on an annual basis.
A. By January 31 of each year, the Township shall update, as
applicable, the fee per dwelling unit. The updated fee shall be
calculated based upon the annual change in the Consumer Price
Index (CPI) as reported by the Federal government.
25.Defined by § 1103.3.
§ 1103 NORTH STRABANE CODE § 1104
1:530
§ 1105. Combined Recreation Open Space Dedicated/Fee-in-Lieu
Requirements. [Ord. 303, 4/26/2005, § 5]
B. Every fifth year, the Township may update the fee per dwelling unit
based upon findings from the analysis of current sale prices of
vacant land within the Township. Sale price data utilized for the
update shall, at a minimum, include that from the current and prior
year.
3. The fee set by the Township (referenced by resolution) shall be
calculated based upon the following formula:
Recreation Fee = fee per dwelling unit multiplied by the total number
of dwelling units proposed in the land development/subdivision.
4. To minimize the incremental subdivision of land for the purpose of
avoiding the dedication of recreation open space or recreation fee, the
Township reserves the right to apply an alternative fee other than
defined by § 1104 3. Situations in which the alternative fee may be
applied include:
A. Undeveloped land upon which fewer than five dwelling units could
be constructed;
B. Developed land that could potentially continue to be subdivided or
further developed at a later date.
5. Any fee collected by the Township shall be maintained, expended, and
refunded in accordance with § 503(11) of the Pennsylvania

Total dedication = (a x b) +(c x (d-b)) where:
a = fee per dwelling unit
b = the number of dwelling units elected to be included in the
dedication
c = 2,000 square feet per single-family dwelling unit or 1,500 square

Dedication
= ($800 x 50) + (2,000 square feet x (100  50)
= ($40,000) + (2,000 square feet x 50)
= ($40,000) + (100,000 square feet)
= $40,000 + 2.3 acres
Example #2: Fulfills Combined Requirements
Total
Dedication
= ($800 x 200) + (2,000 square feet x (300-200)
= ($160,000) + (2,000 square feet x 100)
= ($160,000) + (200,000 square feet)
= $160,000 + 4,6 acres
Total
Dedication
= ($800 x 10) + (2,000 square feet x (30-10)
= ($8,000) + (2,000 square feet x 20)
= ($8,000)+ (40,000 square feet)
= $8,000 + 0.92 acres

2. As to each taxpayer employed for any length of time, each employer
shall deduct the tax from compensation payable to the taxpayer and file
a return on a form prescribed by the Township Tax Collector on a prorata
basis according to the number of payroll periods established by the
§ 601 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 604
1:549
employer for a calendar year. Typical examples of payroll periods
established by employers are weekly, biweekly, twice per month, and/or
monthly.
3. All employers with work sites within the Township are required to
deduct the LST at the site of employment.
4. Any employer who discontinues business or ceases operation before
December 31 of any calendar year shall, within 15 days after
discontinuing business or ceasing operation, file the return hereinabove
required and pay the tax to the Tax Collector.
5. The failure of the employer to deduct the tax shall not relieve the
employee from the duty to file a return and pay the tax. Any employer
who fails to deduct the tax as required by this section or who fails to pay
such tax to the Tax Collector shall be liable for such tax in full, without
deduction of the fee hereinafter provided, as though the tax has
originally been levied against such employer.
6. Withholding.
A. Employers are only required to withhold the LST on the payrollperiod
basis for those payroll periods in which the taxpayer is
employed.
B. When two or more employers employ a taxpayer in a payroll period,
an employer is not required to withhold the LST if the taxpayer
provides a pay stub from his/her principal employer accompanied
by an employee statement of principal employment that the pay
stub is from the taxpayer's principal employer and that the
taxpayer will notify the employer of any change in employment.
Employers are relieved of liability for the tax if they fail to withhold
the tax due to incorrect information provided by the taxpayer
regarding the taxpayer's principal employer or if the employer
complies with the provisions establishing the collection of the tax
on a payroll-period basis.
C. Concurrent Employment. If a taxpayer has two or more jobs in
different political subdivisions during a payroll period, the priority
of claim to collect the LST shall be as follows:
(1) Where the taxpayer maintains his or her principal employment
office or is principally employed;
(2) Where the taxpayer resides and works;
(3) Where the taxpayer is employed that is nearest in miles to the
taxpayer's home.
7. Self-Employed Individuals. The tax for self-employed individuals shall
be prorated on a quarterly basis as if their payroll period is a calendar
quarter and shall be paid within 30 days of the end of each calendar
quarter.
§ 604 NORTH STRABANE CODE § 604
1:550
§ 605. Direct Payment by Taxpayers. [Ord. 325, 11/11/2007]
Every taxpayer who is self-employed, or whose tax for any other reason is
not collected under § 604 of this Part, shall file a return on a form prescribed
by the Tax Collector and shall pay the tax directly to the Collector.
8. Remittance. Employers shall remit withheld taxes to the Tax Collector
within 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter.
9. Up-Front Exemption. In order to receive an up-front exemption,
employees must file an annual up-front exemption form (developed by
the Pennsylvania DCED) with the Tax Collector levying the LST and the
employee's employer. The exemption certificate will verify that the
employee reasonably expects to receive earned income and net profits
of less than $12,000 from all sources within the Township for the
calendar year for which the exemption certificate is filed. A copy of the
employee's last pay stubs or W-2 forms from employment within the
Township for the year prior or the calendar year for which the employee
is requesting an exemption must be attached to the exemption
certificate. Employers must make up-front exemption forms readily
available to employees at all times and provide new employees with the
forms at the time of hiring.
10. Suspension of Withholding. Upon receipt of an up-front exemption form
and until otherwise instructed by the Township imposing the tax,
employers must stop withholding the LST for the specific calendar year
from employees for whom the exemption applies.
11. Restoration of Withholding.
A. Employers shall restart withholding the LST from an employee who
files an exemption certificate in the following circumstances:
(1) If instructed to do so by the Township;
(2) If notified by the employee that he/she is no longer eligible for
the exemption; or
(3) If the employer pays the employee more than $12,000 for the
calendar year.
B. Employers restart withholding of the LST by withholding a "catchup"
lump-sum tax equal to the amount of tax that was not withheld
from the employee as a result of the exemption and the same
amount per payroll period that is withheld from other employees.
12. Military Exemption. The Township shall exempt from the LST members
of a reserve component of the armed forces called to duty and
honorably discharged veterans who served in any war or armed conflict
who are blind, paraplegic, or a double or quadruple amputee as a result
of military service or who are 100% disabled from a service-connected
disability.

regulations relating to any matter pertaining to the administration of this
Part, including but not limited to requirements for collection through
employers, requirements for deductions, requirements for evidence and
records, and provisions for the examination and correction of returns. The
Tax Collector and agents designated by him shall be provided all means,
facilities and opportunity for the examinations hereby authorized.
§ 608. Collection. [Ord. 325, 11/11/2007]
The Tax Collector, or other such person shall be designated by the Board
of Supervisors, shall collect, by suit or otherwise, all taxes, interest, costs,
fines and penalties due under this Part and unpaid. If, for any reason, any
tax is not paid when due, interest at the rate of 6% per year on the amount
of unpaid tax, and an additional penalty of 1/2 of 1% of the amount of unpaid
tax that remains unpaid, shall be added and collected. Whenever suit is
brought for the recovery of unpaid tax, the taxpayer shall, in addition, be
liable for the costs of collection as well as for interest and penalties. The
Tax Collector may accept payment under protest of the tax claimed by the
Township in any case where any person disputes the Township's claim for
the tax. If a court of competent jurisdiction thereafter decides that there has
been overpayment to the Tax Collector, the Tax Collector shall refund the
amount of the overpayment to the person who paid under protest.
§ 609. Violations and penalties.

This chapter shall take effect immediately.
§ 26-112. Waivers. [Ord. No. 383, 8/27/2019]
1. If the municipality determines that any requirement under this chapter
cannot be achieved for a particular regulated activity, the municipality
may, after an evaluation of alternatives, approve measures other than
those in this chapter, subject to § 26-112, Subsections 2 and 3. The
request for a waiver or modification shall originate with the landowner,
shall be in writing, and accompany the stormwater management site
plan submission to the municipality. The request shall provide the facts
on which the request is based, the provision(s) of the ordinance
involved and the proposed modification. The designated plan reviewer
shall review the request to determine if it meets the requirements of
this chapter including § 26-112, Subsections 2 and 3. If acceptable to
the municipality and the regulated stormwater activity involving earth
disturbance is less than one acre, the municipality may grant the waiver
or modification. If acceptable to the municipality and the regulated
stormwater activity involving earth disturbance is greater than or equal
to one acre, the municipality will send the request to the DEP as per
§ 26-112, Subsection 3.
2. Waivers or modifications of the requirements of this chapter may be
approved by the municipality if enforcement will exact undue hardship
because of unique physical circumstances or preexisting site conditions
peculiar to the land in question, provided that the modifications will not
be contrary or detrimental to the public interest and will achieve the
intended outcome, and that the purpose of the chapter is preserved.
Hardship must be due to such unique physical circumstances or
preexisting site conditions and not the circumstances or conditions
generally created by the provisions of this chapter, and there is no
possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity with
the provisions of this chapter. Cost or financial burden shall not be
considered a hardship. Hardship cannot have been created by the
landowner or developer. Modification shall not substantially or
permanently impair the appropriate use or development of adjacent
property. Modification may be considered if an alternative standard or
approach will provide equal or better achievement of the purpose of the
chapter.
3. No waiver or modification of any regulated stormwater activity
involving earth disturbance greater than or equal to one acre may be
granted by the municipality unless that action is approved in advance
by the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP). If a response
from the DEP is not received within 45 days, the waiver or modification
shall be deemed acceptable. Prior DEP approval of the particular
waiver or modification will constitute approval for use of the particular
waiver or modification for similar circumstances or conditions.

HYDROLOGIC SOIL GROUP (HSG)  Infiltration rates of soils
vary widely and are affected by subsurface permeability as well as
surface intake rates. Soils are classified into one of four HSG (A,
B, C, and D) according to their minimum infiltration rate, which
is obtained for bare soil after prolonged wetting. The Natural
Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) of the US Department of
Agriculture defines the four groups and provides a list of most of
the soils in the United States and their group classification. The
soils in the area of interest may be identified from a soil survey
report from the local NRCS office or the County Conservation

activities to the maximum extent practicable.
2. Stormwater runoff volume controls shall be implemented using the
Design Storm Method or the Simplified Method as defined below. For
regulated activity areas equal or less than one acre that do not require
hydrologic routing to design the stormwater facilities, this chapter
establishes no preference for either method; therefore, the applicant
may select either method, the intrinsic limitations on applicability of the
analytical procedures associated with each methodology, and other
factors.
34.Editor's Note: Said appendix is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 26-303 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 26-304
1:579
A. The Design Storm Method (CG-1 in the BMP Manual) is applicable
to any sized regulated activity. This method requires detailed
modeling based on site conditions.
(1) Do not increase the post-development total runoff volume
when compared to the pre-development total runoff volume for
the two-year/twenty-four-hour storm event.
(2) For hydrologic modeling purposes:
(a) Existing nonforested pervious areas must be considered
meadow (good condition) for pre-development hydrologic
calculations.
(b) Twenty percent of existing impervious area, when present
within the proposed project site, shall be considered
meadow (good condition) for pre-development hydrologic
calculations for redevelopment.
B. The Simplified Method (CG-2 in the BMP Manual) is independent of
site conditions and should be used if the Design Storm Method is
not followed. This method is not applicable to regulated activities
greater than one acre or for projects that require detailed design of
stormwater storage facilities. For new impervious surfaces:
(1) Stormwater facilities shall capture at least the first two inches
of runoff from all new impervious surfaces.
(2) At least the first one inch of runoff from new impervious
surfaces shall be permanently removed from the runoff flow,
i.e., it shall not be released into surface waters of the
commonwealth. Removal options include reuse, evaporation,
transpiration, and infiltration.
(3) Wherever possible, infiltration facilities should be designed to
accommodate infiltration of the entire permanently removed
runoff; however, in all cases at least the first 0.5 inch of the
permanently removed runoff should be infiltrated.
(4) Actual field infiltration tests at the location of the proposed
elevation of the stormwater BMPs are required. Infiltration test
shall be conducted in accordance with the BMP Manual.
Notification of the Township shall be provided to allow
witnessing of the testing.
C. In cases where it is not possible or desirable to use infiltrationbased
best management practices to partially fulfill the
requirements in either § 26-304, Subsection 2A, or B, the applicant
shall be required to obtain an NPDES permit from the Pennsylvania
Department of Environment Protection.
3. The applicable worksheets from the BMP Manual must be used in
calculations to establish volume control.

§ 26-306. Sensitive Areas and Stormwater Hotspots. [Ord. No. 383,
8/27/2019]
1. Lands contained within Washington County that have not had release
rates established under an approved Act 167 Stormwater Management
Plan:
A. Post-development discharge rates shall not exceed the predevelopment
discharge rates for the one-, two-, ten-, twenty-five-,
fifty-, and 100-year storms.
2. Lands contained within Washington County that have had release rates
established under an approved Act 167 Stormwater Management Plan:
A. The post-development peak discharge rates shall be in accordance
with the approved release rate map for the individual watershed,
except as indicated in § 26-305, Subsection 2B, Release rates
include 50%, 70% and 100% for the ten-, twenty-five-, fifty- and
100-year storms.
B. A release rate of 50% is required for drainage to all HQ/EV
waterways in North Strabane Township.
1. Sensitive areas and water quality sensitive developments as defined
below which require special consideration with regard to stormwater
management.
A. "Sensitive areas" are defined as those areas that, if developed, have
the potential to endanger a water supply. These areas consist of the
delineated one-year zone of contribution and direct upslope areas
tributary to the water supply wells. North Strabane Township may
update the sensitive area boundaries based on new research or
studies as required.
B. "Stormwater hotspots" are defined as a land development project
that has a high potential to endanger local water quality, and could
potentially threaten ground water reservoirs. The Township will
determine what constitutes these classifications on a case-by-case
basis. The PADEP wellhead protection contaminant source list shall
be used as a guide in these determinations. Industrial
manufacturing site and hazardous material storage areas must
provide NPDES SIC codes.
2. Performance Standards.
A. The location of the boundaries of sensitive areas is set by drainage
areas tributary to any public water supply. The exact location of
these boundaries as they apply to a given development site shall be
determined using mapping at a scale which accurately defines the
limits of the sensitive area. If the project site is within the sensitive
§ 26-305 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 26-306
1:581
area (in whole or in part), two-foot contour interval mapping shall
be provided to define the limits of the sensitive area. If the project
site is adjacent to but within 500 linear feet of a defined sensitive
area, a five-foot contour interval map defining the limits of the
sensitive area shall be included in the stormwater management
plan to document the site's location relative to the sensitive area.
B. Stormwater hotspots may be required to prepare and implement a
stormwater pollution prevention plan and file notice of intent as
required under the provision of the EPA Industrial Stormwater
NPDES permit requirements.
C. Stormwater hotspots must use an acceptable pre-treatment BMP
prior to volume control and/or rate control BMPs. Acceptable pretreatment
BMPs for these developments include those based on
filtering, settling, or chemical reaction processes such as
coagulation.

Riparian Buffer Standards
§ 26-601. Riparian Buffer. [Ord. No. 383, 8/27/2019]
North Strabane Township strongly encourages developers and other
persons engaged in regulated activities to provide riparian buffers for the
protection of watersheds and to promote the health, safety and public
welfare.
§ 26-602. Required Buffers. [Ord. No. 383, 8/27/2019]
§ 26-603. Strongly Recommended Riparian Buffers. [Ord. No. 383,
8/27/2019]
1. For any regulated activity, the minimum riparian buffer shall be as
follows with the buffer being measured perpendicularly from the top of
the stream bank landward:
A. For all watersheds other than high-quality or exceptional value
watersheds or impaired watersheds, a minimum of 50 feet; or
B. As determined by a stream corridor study approved by PADEP and
the Township.
1. For any regulated activity, the minimum riparian buffer should be as
follows with the buffer being measured perpendicularly from the top of
the stream bank landward.
A. High-quality or exceptional value watersheds: a minimum of 150
feet;
B. For impaired watersheds: a minimum of 150 feet.
2. Developers are encouraged to have a riparian buffer located on both
sides of all perennial and intermittent streams. The perennial and
intermittent streams and the proposed riparian buffer boundaries, if
any, should be shown on all applications for building permits,
subdivision, or land development. Existing uses within the buffer are
permitted to continue but it is encouraged that they not be expanded.
3. The buffer should be undisturbed forest consisting of appropriate
native species.
4. Where wetlands are located partially or entirely within a buffer, the
buffer should be extended to encompass the wetland and shall be
widened by a distance sufficient to provide a twenty-five-foot forested
buffer measured perpendicularly from the wetland boundary.
5. The following uses shall be permitted in the buffer:
A. Footpaths, trails and bike paths provided that:
§ 26-601 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 26-603
1:587
(1) Width is limited to five feet;
(2) Width may be increased provided a corresponding increase in
the buffer is provided;
(3) Construction shall have minimal impact to the buffer.
B. Stream crossings, provided the crossing is designed and
constructed in such a manner as to minimize the impact to the
buffer. The riparian buffer should be restored to its original
condition, to the maximum extent practical, upon completion of
construction.
C. Utility lines, provided that the crossing is designed and constructed
in such a manner as to minimize the impact to the inner buffer and
provided that there is no practical alternative to locating the utility
line within the buffer. The riparian buffer should be restored to its
original condition, to the maximum extent practical, upon
completion of construction.
D. Maintenance and restoration of the riparian buffer.
E. Projects conducted with the objective of improvement,
stabilization, restoration, or enhancement of the stream bank,
stream channel, floodplain, watershed hydrology, riparian buffers,
or aquatic habitat and maintenance activities associated with such
projects. These projects include, but are not limited to, agricultural
and stormwater management best management practices. Such
projects must receive appropriate permits and approvals from
PADEP prior to starting the project.
F. Minor private recreational uses for the property owner. Such uses
include benches, fire rings, and similar uses. Such uses do not
include structures such as cabins, sheds, pavilions, garages,
dwellings or similar structures.
6. Disturbance of the riparian buffer should be limited to the area
necessary to perform an allowable use.
7. Where possible and practical, disturbances should be phased with each
phase restored prior to beginning the next phase.
8. Allowable activities should not cause stormwater flow to concentrate.
9. Any vegetation removed for an allowable activity should be replaced
immediately upon completion of the activity. Where mature trees are
removed, such trees should be replaced with the largest practical tree
of acceptable native species.
10. Erosion and sediment pollution control shall be installed and
maintained during construction. Evidence of an approved erosion and
sediment control plan, NPDES permit or other PADEP permit, where
required, shall be submitted prior to issuance of local permits.
§ 26-603 NORTH STRABANE CODE § 26-603
1:588
11. Riparian buffers should be maintained in a manner consistent with
sound forest management practices. In the absence of a site specific
management plan, the following maintenance guidelines apply:
A. Buffers should be inspected periodically for evidence of excessive
sediment deposition, erosion or concentrated flow channels.
Prompt action should be taken to correct these problems and
prevent future occurrence.
B. Trees presenting an unusual hazard of creating downstream
obstructions should be removed. Such material should be removed
from the floodplain or the riparian buffer (whichever is widest); or
cut into sections small enough so as to prevent the possibility of
creating obstructions downstream. Wherever possible, large stable
debris should be conserved.
C. Vegetation should be inspected periodically to ensure diverse
vegetative cover and vigorous plant growth consistent with
buffering objectives.
(1) Remove invasive plant species that may threaten the integrity
of the buffer.
(2) Periodic cutting of trees may be necessary to promote vigorous
growth and encourage regeneration.
D. Excessive use of fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, and other
chemicals should be avoided. These products should be used only
when absolutely necessary to maintain buffer vegetation.

Part 7
Design Criteria
§ 26-701. Design Criteria for Stormwater Management and
Drainage Facilities. [Ord. No. 383, 8/27/2019]
1. General Design Guidelines:
A. Stormwater shall not be transferred from one watershed to
another, unless (1) the watersheds are subwatersheds of a common
watershed which join together within the perimeter of the
property; (2) the effect of the transfer does not alter the peak rate
discharge onto adjacent lands; or (3) easements from the affected
landowner(s) are provided.
B. Consideration shall be given to the relationship of the subject
property to the drainage pattern of the watershed. A concentrated
discharge of stormwater to an adjacent property shall be within an
existing watercourse or confined in an easement or returned to a
pre-development flow type condition. See § 26-301 of this chapter
for BMP location restrictions.
C. Innovative stormwater BMPs and recharge facilities are
encouraged. They shall be located, designed, and constructed in
accordance with the latest technical guidance published by PADEP,
provided they are accompanied by detailed engineering plans and
performance capabilities and supporting site-specific soils, geology,
runoff and groundwater and infiltration rate data to verify
proposed designs. Additional guidance from other sources may be
accepted at the discretion of the Township (a pre-application
meeting is suggested).
D. All existing and natural watercourses, channels, drainage systems
and areas of surface water concentration shall be maintained in
their existing condition unless an alteration is approved by the
appropriate regulatory agency.
E. The design of all stormwater management facilities shall
incorporate sound engineering principles and practices. The
Township shall reserve the right to disapprove any design that
would result in the continuation or exacerbation of a documented
adverse hydrologic or hydraulic condition within the watershed, as
identified in the plan.
F. The design and construction of multiple use stormwater detention
facilities are strongly encouraged. In addition to stormwater
management, facilities should, where appropriate, allow for
recreational uses including ball fields, play areas, picnic grounds,
etc. Consultation with the Township and prior approval are
required before design. Provision for permanent wet ponds with
stormwater management capabilities may also be appropriate.
§ 26-701 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 26-701
1:591
(1) Multiple-use basins should be constructed so that potentially
dangerous conditions are not created.
(2) Water quality basins or recharge basins that are designed for a
slow release of water or other extended detention ponds are
not permitted for recreational uses, unless the ponded areas
are clearly separated and secure.
G. Should any stormwater management facility require a dam safety
permit under PADEP Chapter 105, the facility shall be designed in
accordance with Chapter 105 and meet the regulations of Chapter
105 concerning dam safety.
2. Stormwater Management Facility Design Considerations: All
stormwater management facilities shall meet the following design
requirements:
A. All areas of a subdivision, land development plan or mobile home
park to be developed with streets, residential lots or sites,
recreation areas or other uses shall be graded to assure positive
drainage.
B. Storm sewers, culverts and related installations shall be provided
to ensure the controlled flow of natural watercourses and to
guarantee the drainage of all low points along the curb or gutter
lines, as well as at intervals related to slope, of all streets in or
adjacent to the plan. Where driveways cross gutter, line or passage
via a pipe below the driveway entrance of the type and size
required by the North Strabane Township.
C. In designing the storm drainage system, the developer shall use as
his guide the publication "Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds,"
Technical Release No. 55, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Soil
Conservation Service, June 1986, and as amended.
D. The predevelopment condition of the parcel to be developed, as
determined by the Township, shall be considered the state of the
land surface on the date that the developer entered into an
agreement to purchase the property. If the property has been
partially or completely developed at the time of purchase, the
Township shall require the new owner, if he proposes to redevelop
or further develop the property, to take remedial action for
compliance with the requirements of this subsection. This shall
include situations where removal of existing impervious areas and
replacing them with new impervious areas is proposed, where no or
inadequate existing stormwater management is present. If
remedial action is required, regardless of the condition of the
surface, the design runoff shall not exceed curve number 75
applied to class C "good meadow" soils (see Tables 2-1 and 2-2 of
T.R. 55). Stormwater runoff originating upstream of the property
that is bypassed through or around the site may be removed from
the hydrographical analysis for on-site stormwater management
§ 26-701 NORTH STRABANE CODE § 26-701
1:592
facilities. Conveyance structures designed to bypass flow must be
designed for the 100-year twenty-four-hour peak flow event. If a
property is to be laid out in lots, no reduction in lot size shall be
permitted to accommodate storm drainage detention structures.
Adequate space shall be reserved for all proposed structures and
access roads.
E. The stormwater drainage plan of a subdivision, land development
plan or mobile home park shall be designed to assure that, after
development, stormwater does not leave the property at a greater
velocity or volume per second than before development
commenced.
(1) The difference between the pre-development and postdevelopment
condition for all storms up to the 100-year storm
shall be stored on the property for gradual release at predevelopment
rate.
(2) Outlet works shall be designed so as to store water and control
runoff for all storms of frequency up to and including the onehundred-
year storm.
(3) Vertical riser pipes with trash racks and anti-vortex devices
shall be provided in detention basins, unless an alternate
design is approved by the Township.
(4) Detention basins shall be designed to drain completely in a
period between 24 and 72 hours.
(5) No outlet structure from a stormwater management facility, or
swale, shall discharge directly onto a Municipal or state
roadway or right-of-way without approval from the Township or
PennDOT.
F. Detention areas, where required to impede runoff, shall be
designed to meet or exceed the following standards:
(1) Except where a permanent pond is approved by the Township
Commissioners, detention areas shall be designed to drain
completely. All stormwater management BMPs shall be
equipped with a drain line no less than four inches in diameter
and a valve that is normally closed, preferably on the outside of
the facility where it is easily accessed, so that the facility may
be completely dewatered for maintenance and emergencies.
(2) The height of the impoundment dam shall be not more than 10
feet measured between the top of the dam and the toe of the
slope on the downstream side of the dam. The level of water
within the impoundment shall not exceed 10 feet measured
between the lowest point in the impoundment area behind the
dam and the top of the emergency spillway.
§ 26-701 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 26-701
1:593
(3) The area to be occupied by the dam shall be cleared of all
topsoil and organic materials prior to construction. The dam
shall be built up in layers not to exceed six inches in depth with
equipment providing 95% compaction at optimum moisture
conditions. The top of the dam shall be constructed 10% higher
than its designed height to allow for settlement.
(4) The core trench stabilizing the dam shall extend the full length
under the dam and full height each side of the dam and shall be
designed after a soil investigation at the dam site carried to at
least 10 feet below the level of the toe of the dam or to
bedrock. The core trench shall be not less than three feet in
depth, not less than three feet in width at its bottom, and its
sides shall slope not less than one-foot vertical rise to each one
foot of horizontal run (one to one).
(5) The settled elevation of the top of the dam at its lowest point
shall be not less than one foot above the maximum water level
to be impounded behind the dam and not less than two feet
above the elevation of the emergency spillway.
(6) The surfaces of the dam shall be planted in a seed mixture as
specified by PaDEP requirements.
(7) The horizontal drain pipe passing through the dam shall be
reinforced concrete pipe. Anti-seepage collars shall be placed
not less than 28 feet apart along the length of the pipe. Each
collar shall be fabricated of not less than one-fourth-inch steel
plate, shall extend not less than two feet in all directions at
right angles from the outer face of the pipe, shall be welded in
place all around and shall be completely enclosed within the
dam fill.
(8) The top of the riser pipe to drain the pond shall be not less than
three feet in height above the invert elevation of the horizontal

riser inoperable, demonstrating one foot of freeboard or
greater.
(10) Stone low-flow channels with underdrains shall be installed in
all aboveground earthen detention facilities, and channel
slopes within the basin shall be 2% minimum.
(11) Notwithstanding the above requirements, dams as classified
under Pennsylvania Code 25 Chapter 105, Pennsylvania Dam
Safety, shall meet all requirements of said act.
§ 26-701 NORTH STRABANE CODE § 26-701
1:594
G. The invert of all stormwater management facilities and
underground infiltration/storage facilities shall be located a
minimum of two feet above the seasonal high groundwater table.
The invert of stormwater facilities may be lowered if adequate
subsurface drainage is provided. Flows from underdrains shall not
be counted in volume or rate control calculations.

35.Editor's Note: See Ch. 22, Subdivision and Land Development.
§ 26-701 NORTH STRABANE CODE § 26-702
1:596
the individual limitations and suitability of each method for a particular
site and approved by the Township.
3. Rainfall Values:
A. Rational Method. The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation
Drainage Manual, Intensity-Duration-Frequency Curves,
Publication 584, Chapter 7A, latest edition, shall be used in
conjunction with the appropriate time of concentration and return
period.
B. NRCS Rainfall-Runoff Method. The Soil Conservation Service Type
II, twenty-four-hour rainfall distribution shall be used in
conjunction with rainfall depths from NOAA Atlas 14 or be
consistent with the following table:
Return Interval
(year)
Twenty-Four-Hour Rainfall
Total
(inches)
1 1.99
2 2.38
10 3.35
25 3.96
50 4.46
100 4.99
4. Runoff Volume:
A. Rational Method. Not to be used to calculate runoff volume.
B. NRCS Rainfall-Runoff Method. This method shall be used to
estimate the change in volume due to regulated activities.
Combining Curve Numbers for land areas proposed for
development with Curve Numbers for areas unaffected by the
proposed development into a single weighted curve number is not
acceptable.
5. Peak Flow Rates:
A. Rational Method. This method may be used for design of
conveyance facilities only. Caution should be used by the design
professional if the watershed has more than one main drainage
channel, if the watershed is divided so that hydrologic properties
are significantly different in one versus the other, if the time of
concentration exceeds 60 minutes, or if stormwater runoff volume
is an important factor. The combination of Rational Method
hydrographs based on timing shall be prohibited.
§ 26-702 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 26-702
1:597
B. NRCS Rainfall-Runoff Method. This method is recommended for
design of stormwater management facilities and where stormwater
runoff volume must be taken into consideration.
C. For comparison of peak flow rates, flows shall be rounded to a tenth
of a cubic foot per second (cfs).
6. Runoff Coefficients:
A. Rational Method. Use Table C-1 (Appendix C).36
B. NRCS Rainfall-Runoff Method. Use Table C-2 (Appendix C).37 Curve
Numbers (CN) should be rounded to tenths for use in hydrologic
models as they are a design tool with statistical variability. For
large sites, CNs should realistically be rounded to the nearest
whole number.
C. For the purposes of pre-development peak flow rate and volume
determination, existing nonforested pervious areas conditions shall
be considered as meadow (good condition).
D. For the purposes of pre-development peak flow rate and volume
determination, 20% of existing impervious area, when present,
shall be considered meadow (good condition).
7. Design Storm:
A. All stormwater management facilities shall be verified by routing
the proposed one-, two-, ten-, twenty-five-, fifty-, and 100-year
hydrographs through the facility using the storage indication
method or modified plus method. The design storm hydrograph
shall be computed using a calculation method that produces a full
hydrograph.
B. The stormwater drainage system (minor calculations) shall be
designed to safely convey the post-development 100-year storm
event to stable discharge locations, demonstrating that the pipe
capacity exceeds the total flow through the pipe, and that the
hydraulic grade line does not surcharge connecting structures.
C. Permanent channels shall be designed to convey the 100-year
storm event to stable discharge locations, demonstrating a
minimum of six inches of freeboard and that channel lining material
sheer stress does not exceed the maximum allowable sheer stress.
D. All structures (culvert or bridges) proposed to convey runoff under
a municipal road shall be designed to pass the fifty-year design
storm with a minimum one-foot of freeboard measured below the
lowest point along the top of the roadway, using FHWA HY-8 or
HEC-RAS methodology, as applicable.

§ 26-702 NORTH STRABANE CODE § 26-702
1:598
8. Time of Concentration:
A. The time of concentration is to represent the average condition that
best reflects the hydrologic response of the area. The following
time of concentration (Tc) computational methodologies shall be
used unless another method is preapproved by the Township:
(1) Pre-development: NRCS's Lag Equation:
Time of Concentration = Tc = [(Tlag/.6)* 60](minutes)
Where:
Tlag = Lag time (hours)
L = Hydraulic length of watershed (feet)
Y = Average overland slope of watershed (percent)
S = Maximum retention in watershed as defined by: S =
[(1,000/CN) - 10]
CN = NRCS Curve Number for watershed
(2) Post-development: NRCS Segmental Method. The length of
sheet flow shall be limited to 100 feet. Tc for channel and pipe
flow shall be computed using Manning's equation.
B. Additionally, the following provisions shall apply to calculations for
time of concentration:
(1) The post-development Tc shall never be greater that the predevelopment
Tc for any watershed or subwatershed. This
includes when the designer has specifically used swales to
reduce flow velocities. In the event that the designer believes
that the post-development Tc is greater, it will still be set by
default equal to the pre-development Tc for modeling
purposes.
(2) The minimum Tc for any watershed shall be five minutes.
(3) The designer may choose to assume a five-minute Tc for any
post-development watershed or subwatershed without
providing any computations.
(4) The designer must provide computations for all predevelopment
Tc paths. A five-minute Tc cannot be assumed for
pre-development.
§ 26-702 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 26-702
1:599
(5) Undetained fringe areas (areas that are not tributary to a
stormwater facility but where a reasonable effort has been
made to convey runoff from all new impervious coverage to
best management practices) may be assumed to represent the
pre-development conditions for purpose of Tc calculation.
9. Where uniform flow is anticipated, the Manning's equation shall be
used for hydraulic computations and to determine the capacity of open
channels, pipes, and storm sewers. The Manning's equation should not
be used for analysis of pipes under pressure flow or for analysis of
culverts. Manning's "n" values shall be obtained from PennDOT's
Drainage Manual, Publication 584.
10. The Township has the authority to require that computed existing
runoff rates be reconciled with field observations, conditions and site
history. If the designer can substantiate, through actual physical
calibration, that more appropriate runoff and time of concentration
values should be utilized at a particular site, then appropriate
variations may be made upon review and recommendation of the
Township.

PLANNED RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT
§ 27-1200. Purpose. [Ord. No. 376, 7/24/2018]
§ 27-1201. Applicability and Relationship to Other Ordinances.
[Ord. No. 376, 7/24/2018]
The provisions of this Part for approval of a planned residential development
shall be a modification to and in lieu of procedures and criteria for approvals
otherwise required in this chapter and the Township Subdivision and Land
Development Ordinance.52 Failure to comply with the provisions of this Part
1. The purpose of these regulations is to permit residential development
that is more creative and imaginative than is generally possible under
conventional zoning district controls and subdivision requirements.
Further, these regulations are intended to promote more effective and
efficient relationships between development, existing and planned
public infrastructure and the Township's roadway network while
providing a compatible blend of housing types, amenities and
community facilities of high quality, oriented to the specific
development site and preserving the natural scenic qualities of open
space. Based upon the context of the Township's Comprehensive Plan,
established development patterns, roadway characteristics and public
infrastructure systems existing and planned within the Township, two
planned residential development options (PRD A and PRD B) are
applicable within the Township's designated R-3 Zoning District.
2. Each planned residential development should be designed to
accomplish the following:
A. Choices in the types of dwelling units and living environments.
B. Open space and recreation areas directly related to the intended
users.
C. A pattern of development that preserves trees, outstanding natural
topography and geological features and prevents soil erosion.
D. A creative approach to the use of land and related physical
development.
E. An efficient use of land, resulting in efficient networks of utilities
and streets.
F. An environment of stable character in harmony with surrounding
development and public improvements.
G. A more desirable environment than would be possible through the
strict application of other parts of this chapter.
52.Editor's Note: See Ch. 22, Subdivision and Land Development.
§ 27-1200 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 27-1201
1:719
with respect to a recorded development plan shall be deemed to constitute

of 80% of the total dwelling unit mix.
C. Within a planned residential development that proposes a mix of
dwelling unit types, a single phase of the PRD may contain only one
dwelling unit type. Each phase that contains a different dwelling
unit type shall be accessed from the principal circulation system
within the PRD. The plan shall be designed to provide existing
natural buffers or landscaped buffers between phases containing
different dwelling types.
4. Recreational and other common facilities for the residents.

planned residential development shall be approved subject to the
submission of a legal instrument or instruments setting forth a plan for
the permanent preservation, care and maintenance of such common
open space, recreational areas and other facilities owned in common by
an organization established for such purposes. No such instrument
shall be acceptable until approved by the Board of Supervisors as to
legal form and effect. In cases where the Township will not be accepting
dedications of streets, recreation areas or common open spaces, the
developer shall create an organization or trust for ownership and
maintenance of the common open space and common facilities.
3. Common Open Space Maintenance. In the event that the organization
established to own and maintain the common open space, or any
successor thereto, shall, at any time after establishment of the final
development plan, fail to maintain the common open space, including
all streets, driveways and recreational facilities, in reasonable order
and condition in accordance with the development plan granted final
approval, the Township may take remedial action to cause the common

approve any concept presented in the pre-application
conference and shall not protect the application from any
subsequent changes in ordinance provisions adopted between
the pre-application conference and the official date of filing of
an application for tentative approval of a planned residential
development that may affect the proposed development under
the terms of this chapter.
B. Application for Tentative Approval. At least 20 calendar days prior

written communication granting tentative approval, the Board of
Supervisors shall, within 45 days of the official date of filing, grant
final approval to the development plan.
C. Variations from the Plan Granted Tentative Approval.
(1) In the event that the development plan submitted contains
variations from the development plan granted tentative

approval and may, within 45 days of the official date of filing of
the application for final approval, advise the applicant, in
writing, of said refusal, setting forth in said notice the reasons
why one or more of the variations are not in the public interest.
In the event of such refusal, the landowner may either:

variations objected; or
(b) File a written request with the Board of Supervisors that it
hold a public hearing on the application for final approval.
(2) If the landowner wishes to take either alternate action, he may
do so at any time within which he shall be entitled to apply for
final approval, or within 30 additional days if the time for
applying for final approval shall have already passed at the
time when the landowner was advised that the development
plan way not in substantial compliance.
(3) If the landowner fails to take either of these alternate actions
within said time, he shall be deemed to have abandoned the
development plan.

1. Buffer Areas Described. Buffer areas, as defined by this chapter and
required by § 27-1402, Subsection 2, shall meet all of the following
criteria. (See Appendix C for illustrations of buffer areas.71)
A. Buffer Area A shall contain two rows of plantings. Each row shall
consist of a mixture of 30% deciduous and 70% evergreen plantings
spaced within the row a minimum of 15 feet apart, measured from
the vertical center lines of adjacent trees. The two rows shall be
staggered in a manner which shall result in adjacent trees on two
different rows being no more than 10 feet apart, measured from the
vertical center lines of the trees. The depth of Buffer Area A shall
be 35 feet, as measured from the property line.
B. Buffer Area B shall contain one row of plantings which shall consist
of a mixture of 30% deciduous and 70% evergreen spaced within
the row a minimum of 10 feet apart, measured from the vertical
center lines of adjacent trees. The depth of Buffer Area B shall be
25 feet, as measured from the property line.
C. Buffer Area C shall be comprised of a continuous, compact
evergreen hedge or line of evergreen trees that will grow together
when mature and that are a minimum of six feet in height at the
time of planting. The depth of Buffer Area C shall be 15 feet, as
measured from the property line.
D. None of the required plantings shall encroach across any property
line. All plantings shall be located so that, at maturity, all parts of
the tree shall be a minimum of 2 1/2 feet from any public street
right-of-way or any property line that constitutes the exterior
boundary of the buffer area.
E. In the event that existing vegetation and/or existing topography
provides screening that is adequate to meet the intent of the
required buffer area to screen the buildings, activities and parking
areas from adjoining residential properties, the Board of
Supervisors, upon recommendation by the Planning Commission,
may determine that the existing topography and/or vegetation
constitutes all or part of the required buffer area. If such a
determination is made, the applicant may be required to record a
conservation easement, of the depth specified by the Board of
Supervisors, to guarantee that the existing topography and/or
vegetation will not be disturbed or removed from the approved
buffer area.
F. When there are substantial differences in elevation between the
first-floor elevation of the proposed construction and the elevation
of the property line along which the buffer area is required, the
buffer area may be relocated to the top of the slope or the toe of the
slope, whichever provides the more effective visual.
71.Editor's Note: Said appendix is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 27-1402 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 27-1402
1:815
G. In the event that a public street right-of-way, dedicated and
accepted by the Township, separates the two dissimilar uses
specified, the buffer area shall not be required.
H. In the case of a lot that is deeper than 400 feet, the requirement to
provide the buffer area along the entire perimeter of the lot may be
waived by the Township Supervisors, provided that the required
buffer area is installed along the side property lines and across the
rear yard at a sufficient depth to screen the buildings and parking
areas from adjacent properties.
I. Openings for driveways shall be permitted to cross a required
buffer area. Plantings in required buffer areas shall be located so as
to not obstruct visibility for traffic entering or leaving the site and
shall be subject to the clear sight triangle requirements of
§ 27-1403D of this chapter.
J. No structures or uses shall be permitted in the required buffer
area, other than fences, active or passive recreation facilities and
stormwater management facilities, provided that the structures or
uses do not interfere with the required plantings in the buffer area,
and provided that all plantings are located outside any stormwater
management structure. Structures or uses not permitted within the
required buffer area include but are not limited to buildings,
accessory structures, parking spaces, access drives and lighting
devices.
K. When common open space is provided on a development site, the
required buffer area shall be located within the common open
space and shall not be located on any individual residential lot.
2. Buffer Areas Required. Buffer Areas A, B and C listed in § 27-1402,
Subsection 1, above shall be required under the following
circumstances:
A. Buffer Area A. Buffer Area A shall be required:
(1) Along all property lines where any development in the C-2 or
I-1 District adjoins property in an A-1, A-2, R-1-V, R-2 or R-3
District.
(2) Where the express standards and criteria for a conditional use
or use by special exception in § 27-1303 of this chapter specify
that Buffer Area A is required.
(3) Along all property lines where a planned residential
development adjoins property in an A-1, A-2, R-1-V, R-2 or R-3
District.
(4) Along all property lines where multifamily dwellings adjoin
property in an A-1, A-2, R-1-V, R-2 or R-3 District.
B. Buffer Area B. Buffer Area B shall be required:
§ 27-1402 NORTH STRABANE CODE § 27-1402
1:816
(1) Along all property lines where any development in the C-1
District adjoins property in an A-1, A-2, R-1-V, R-2 or R-3
District.
(2) Along all property lines where the expansion of a legal
nonconforming use in any A-1, A-2 or R District adjoins
property in an A-1, A-2, R-1-V, R-2 or R-3 District.
(3) Where the express standards and criteria for a conditional use
or use by special exception in § 27-1303 of this chapter specify
that Buffer Area B is required.
C. Buffer Area C. Buffer Area C shall be required:
(1) Where the express standards and criteria for a conditional use
or use by special exception in § 27-1303 of this chapter specify
that Buffer Area C is required.
(2) On developed nonresidential properties in the R-1-V, C-1 or C-2
District where existing conditions such as building location and
existing paving of the parking lot make it impossible to meet
the requirements for Buffer Area B along a property line that
adjoins property in the A-1, A-2, R-1-V, R-2 or R-3 District.
3. Conflict Between Buffer Area and Yard Requirements. When the width
of a required buffer area is in conflict with the minimum yard
requirements of Parts 4 through 12, the greater distance shall apply.
The buffer area planting requirement shall be adhered to regardless of
the yard requirement.
4. Existing Structures in Buffer Areas. In instances where an existing
structure is located within any required buffer area, the buffer area may
be reduced, provided that the buffer area is not less than the minimum
distance between the existing structure and the property line. This
reduced buffer area width shall apply only to the side of the existing
structure that encroaches on the required buffer area. The required
buffer area, as determined by § 27-1402, Subsection 2, shall apply on all
other sides of the existing structure.
5. Existing Trees in Buffer Areas.
A. Where trees already exist within the required buffer area, these
trees shall remain undisturbed, except that diseased or dead
material may be removed. If it is determined that some healthy
trees must be removed in conjunction with development, a written
request to remove such trees must be submitted to the Township,
along with an explanation detailing the rationale for the request.
These trees shall not be removed until the Township has given
written authorization permitting said removal. This permission will
not be unreasonably denied; however, those who violate this
section shall be subject to the maximum penalties authorized by
this chapter.
§ 27-1402 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 27-1402
1:817
B. When any trees, regardless of their physical condition, are
removed, they shall be replaced by trees suitable to the
environment. (See Appendix D for a suggested list of plant
materials.72) All such replacement planting shall be in accordance
with accepted conservation practices.
6. Size of Trees in Required Buffer Areas.
A. Any existing trees within the required buffer area that are a
minimum of four inches in diameter at a point one foot above the
ground shall be preserved and shall count as a required tree within
the buffer area. At no point, however, shall any existing trees and
required trees be separated at a distance greater than the distance
specified in the required buffer area.
B. All trees required to be planted within the buffer area shall be a
minimum of two inches in diameter at a point one foot above the
ground, measured along the trunk of the planted tree, which tree
shall be planted in accordance with accepted conservation
practices. All required trees shall be a minimum of six feet in height
at time of planting, measured from the ground adjacent to the
planted tree to the top of the tree.
7. Responsibility For Maintenance. It shall be the responsibility of the
landowner or lessee to assure the continued growth of all required
landscaping and/or to replace the same in the event of frost, vandalism,
disease or other reasons for the discontinued growth of the required
trees, shrubs and bushes. The landowner shall record a restrictive
covenant on the land guaranteeing perpetual maintenance and
preservation of the required buffer area. Upon inspection by the
Township and issuance of an enforcement notice in accordance with
§ 27-1901, Subsection 2, of this chapter, the landowner or lessee shall
replace required landscaping materials with like type and size if the
required plant materials do not survive for any reason at any time after
occupancy of the property.
8. Stormwater Management Facilities in Buffer Areas. Stormwater
management facilities and structures may be maintained within a
buffer area, but the existence of such facilities or structures shall not be
a basis for a failure to meet the planting requirements.
9. Landscaping of Open Areas. All yard areas not utilized for parking
facilities, driveways, gardens, the planting of trees or shrubs, flower,
vegetable or herb beds or similar uses shall be seeded, sodded or
landscaped within a reasonable period of time. The phrase "a
reasonable period of time" shall be interpreted to be within two weeks
after construction activities are completed, unless those activities are
completed between a November 1 through April 1 time period. In such
case, the required sodding or seeding shall occur by April 15, and

Part 17
NONCONFORMING USES, STRUCTURES AND LOTS
§ 27-1700. Applicability. [Ord. No. 376, 7/24/2018]
This Part shall apply to all nonconforming uses, structures and lots, as
defined by this chapter. Nothing contained herein shall require any change
in the overall layout, plans, construction, size or designated use of any
development, building, structure or part thereof for which official approval
and required permits have been granted prior to the effective date of this
chapter or any amendment thereto.
§ 27-1701. Nonconforming Uses. [Ord. No. 376, 7/24/2018]
1. These regulations shall apply to any use of a structure or lot in any
zoning district that is a nonconforming use, as defined by this chapter.
Whenever the boundaries of a zoning district shall be changed so as to
transfer an area from one zoning district to another zoning district of a
different classification, these regulations shall apply to any uses which
thereby become nonconforming.
A. Continuation and Sale. Where, at the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this chapter, a lawful use of a lot or structure exists
that is made no longer permissible under the terms of this chapter
as enacted or amended, such use may be sold or otherwise
transferred to other owners and may be continued as long as it
remains otherwise lawful in accordance with the provisions of this
Part.
B. Enlargement or Expansion.
(1) Single-family dwellings that are nonconforming uses in any
nonresidential zoning district classification may be enlarged or
expanded to occupy a greater area of the lot or to increase the
height of the dwelling, provided that all applicable area and
bulk regulations of the zoning district in which the property is
located are met.
(2) No other nonconforming use of a lot or nonconforming use of a
structure shall be enlarged or increased or extended to occupy
a greater area of the lot or structure than was occupied at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter, unless
the Zoning Hearing Board, after a public hearing, shall
interpret that the enlargement or extension is necessitated by
the natural expansion and growth of the nonconforming use.
Any such enlargement or expansion shall conform to the area,
height and yard requirements of the zoning district in which it
is located.
§ 27-1700 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 27-1701
1:881
(3) No nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to
any other portion of the lot occupied by such use at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter.
(4) Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any part
of a structure that way designed for such use at the time the
use became nonconforming; however, a nonconforming use
shall not be extended to occupy any structure, lot or portion of
a lot that way not owned by the owner of the nonconforming
use at the time the use became nonconforming.
C. Change of Use.
(1) A nonconforming use shall not be changed to any use other
than a conforming use, except as permitted as a use by special
exception by the Zoning Hearing Board in accordance with the
following standards:
(a) The new use will more closely correspond to the uses
authorized in the district as permitted uses, conditional
uses or uses by special exception.
(b) The new use will be in keeping with the character of the
neighborhood in which it is located and will have an equal
or lesser impact on the neighborhood than the existing
nonconforming use.
(c) Any change from one nonconforming use to another shall
comply with the parking requirements of Part 15 for the
new use and shall be subject to the area, bulk and buffer
area regulations for such use in the zoning district where
such use is authorized as a permitted use, conditional use
or use by special exception.
(2) When a nonconforming use is changed to a conforming use, the
use thereafter shall not be changed to a nonconforming use.
(3) Where a nonconforming use exists on a lot, a conforming use
shall not be established on the same lot unless the
nonconforming use is discontinued.
D. Abandonment. When a nonconforming use of a structure and/or lot
is discontinued or abandoned for 12 consecutive months, the
structure and/or lot shall not thereafter be used except in
conformance with the regulations of the zoning district in which it
is located.
E. Damage or Destruction.
(1) Residential dwellings that are nonconforming uses in the C-1,
C-2 or I-1 District may be rebuilt on the existing foundation in
the event of damage or destruction, provided that the
§ 27-1701 NORTH STRABANE CODE § 27-1701
1:882
§ 27-1702. Nonconforming Structures. [Ord. No. 376, 7/24/2018]
reconstruction is started within 18 months of the date of
destruction.
(2) In the case of nonconforming uses, other than dwellings, when
damage or destruction of a structure in which the
nonconforming use is conducted involves 50% or less of the
gross floor area of the structure, repairs or reconstruction may
be undertaken, provided that such restoration is started within
18 months of the date of destruction. No enlargement or
expansion of the nonconforming structure shall be undertaken
unless the provisions of § 27-1701B are met.
(3) In the case of nonconforming uses other than dwellings, when
the structure in which the nonconforming use is conducted is
damaged or destroyed by fire or other means to an extent of
more than 50% of its gross floor area, the structure shall be
reconstructed only to house a conforming use.
1. These regulations shall apply to all nonconforming structures, as
defined by this chapter, in all zoning districts.
A. Structural Alteration. A nonconforming structure may be enlarged
or structurally altered, provided that the enlargement or alteration
does not encroach any further into a required yard setback than the
existing nonconforming structure does, and further provided that
no new nonconformities are created. All other alterations or
enlargements shall require review by the Zoning Hearing Board;
and, after public hearing, the Zoning Hearing Board may determine
undue hardship and may authorize a variance for the reasonable
modification of such structure.
B. Damage or Destruction. Any nonconforming structure that has
been partially or completely damaged or destroyed by fire or other
means may be rebuilt or repaired on its existing foundation even
though such foundation may violate the setback requirements for
the zoning district in which the structure is located, provided that
the repair or reconstruction and reoccupancy of the structure
occurs within 18 months of the date that the original structure was
damaged or destroyed. No enlargement or expansion of the
nonconforming structure shall be undertaken unless the provisions
of § 27-1702A are met.
C. Moving. Should a nonconforming structure be moved for any
reason for any distance whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the

authorize variances from the requirements of this chapter and to attach
such conditions to the variance as it deems necessary to assure
compliance with the purposes of this chapter. A variance may be

given case:
A. That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity, narrowness or shallowness of lot size or
shape, or exceptional topographical or other physical conditions
peculiar to the particular property and that the unnecessary
hardship is due to such conditions and not the circumstances or
conditions generally created by the provisions of this chapter in the
neighborhood or district in which the property is located.

is no possibility that the property can be developed in strict
conformity with the provisions of this chapter and that the

authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to enable the
reasonable use of the property.
C. That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
appellant.
D. That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is
located, nor substantially or permanently impair the appropriate
use or development of adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the
public welfare.
E. That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance necessary to afford relief and will represent the least
modification possible of the regulation in issue.
1. Notice.
A. Written notice of the hearing shall be given to the public, the
applicant, the Zoning Officer, the Board of Supervisors, the
Planning Commission and to any person who has made timely

participate.

respect to hearings before the Zoning Hearing Board. Fees for said
hearings may include compensation for the Secretary and members of

administrative overhead connected with the hearing. The costs,
however, shall not include legal expenses of the Zoning Hearing Board,
expenses for engineering, architectural or other technical consultants
or expert witness costs.

a stenographer shall be shared equally by the applicant and the Zoning

appealing from the decision of the Zoning Hearing Board if such appeal
is made; and in either event the cost of additional copies shall be paid
by the person requesting such copy or copies. In other cases, the parts
requesting the original transcript shall bear the cost thereof.
3. Expenditures. Members of the Zoning Hearing Board may receive
compensation for the performance of their duties as may be fixed by the
Board of Supervisors, but in no case shall it exceed the rate of
compensation authorized to be paid to the members of the Board of
Supervisors. Within the limits of funds appropriated by the Board of
Supervisors, the Zoning Hearing Board may employ or contract for
secretaries, clerks, legal counsel, consultants and other technical
services.
1. No person shall file any proceeding before the Zoning Hearing Board
later than 30 days after a preliminary or final application for
development has been approved by an appropriate Township officer,
agency or body, if such proceeding is designed to secure reversal or to
limit the approval in any manner, unless such person alleges and proves
that he had no notice, knowledge or reason to believe that such
approval had been given. If such person has succeeded to his interest
after such approval, he shall be bound by the knowledge of his
predecessor in interest.
2. The failure of any one, other than the landowner, to appeal from an
adverse decision on an application for tentative approval of a planned
residential development or from an adverse decision by a Zoning
Officer on a challenge to the validity of an ordinance or map filed
pursuant to Section 916.2 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning

tentative approval.
3. All appeals from determinations adverse to the landowner shall be filed
by the landowner within 30 days after notice of the determination is
issued.
1. Upon filing of any proceeding and during its pendency before the

challenged ordinance, order or approval of the Zoning Officer or of any
agency or body and all official action thereunder shall be stayed unless
the Zoning Officer or any other appropriate agency or body certifies to
the Zoning Hearing Board facts indicating that such stay would cause
imminent peril to life or property, in which case the development or
Official action shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order,
that may be granted by the Zoning Hearing Board or by the court
having jurisdiction of zoning appeals on petition after notice to the
Zoning Officer or other appropriate agency or body. When an
application for development, preliminary or final, has been duly
approved and proceedings designed to reverse or limit the approval are
filed with the Zoning Hearing Board by persons other than the
applicant, the applicant may petition the court having jurisdiction of the
zoning appeals to order such persons to post bond as a condition to
continuing the proceedings before the Zoning Hearing Board. The
question of whether or not such petition should be granted and the
amount of the bond shall be within the sound discretion of the court.
2. All appeals from decisions rendered by the Zoning Hearing Board shall
be taken to the Washington County Court of Common Pleas and shall be
filed within 30 days after the entry of the decision or, in the case of a
deemed decision, within 30 days after the date upon which notice of
said deemed decision is given as required by Subsection 908(9) of the

given in accordance with Sections 610, 1004 and other applicable
provisions of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code. The
hearings shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of
Subsections (4) through (8) of Section 908 of the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code, and all references in that section
to the Zoning Hearing Board shall be references to the Board of
Supervisors.
B. Evaluation of Merits of Curative Amendment. If the Board of
Supervisors determines that a validity challenge has merit, the
Board of Supervisors may accept a landowner's curative
amendment, with or without revision, or may adopt an alternative
amendment that will cure the alleged defects. The Board of
Supervisors shall consider the curative amendments, plans and
explanatory material submitted by the landowner and shall also
consider:
(1) The impact of the proposal upon roads, sewer facilities, water
supplies, schools and other public service facilities.
(2) If the proposal is for a residential use, the impact of the
proposal upon regional housing needs and the effectiveness of
the proposal in providing housing units of a type actually
available to and affordable by classes of persons otherwise
unlawfully excluded by the challenged provisions of this
chapter or Zoning District Map.
(3) The suitability of the site for the intensity of the use proposed
by the site's soils, slopes, woodlands, wetlands, floodplains,
aquifers, natural resources and other natural features.
(4) The impact of the proposed use on the site's soils, slopes,
woodlands, wetlands, floodplains, natural resources and
natural features, the degree to which these are protected or
destroyed, the tolerance of the resources to development and
any adverse environmental impacts.
(5) The impact of the proposal on the preservation of agriculture
and other land uses that are essential to public health and
welfare.
C. Declaration of Invalidity by Court. If the Township does not accept
a landowner's curative amendment brought in accordance with this
section and a court subsequently rules the challenge has merit, the
court's decision shall not result in a declaration of invalidity for this
entire chapter, but only for those provisions that specifically relate
to the landowner's curative amendment challenge.
