§ 23-3. Defined benefit pension: retirement benefits.

(1) For the defined benefit pension: Each full-time, permanent,
nonuniformed employee of the Township hired before September 9,
2013, shall become eligible on the first day of the month after
attaining age 21 and completing one year of service, whichever is
later.
(2) For the defined contribution pension: Each full-time, permanent,
nonuniformed employee hired on or after September 9, 2013 shall
become eligible upon completion of six months of service.
(3) Change in status: In the event a participant who remains in the
service of the Township ceases to be an employee eligible for
participation hereunder, no further benefit accruals shall occur
until the participant again qualifies under such participation
requirements. Such a requalified participant shall immediately
commence accrual of additional benefits hereunder upon becoming
eligible to participate.
B. Exclusions. Part-time, temporary or seasonal employees are not eligible
to participate in the plan.
C. Contributions. Employees eligible to participate in the defined benefit
pension in accordance with Subsection A shall not be required to make
contributions to the defined benefit pension. [Amended 7-17-2017 by
Ord. No. 2017-1]
A. Normal retirement benefit. The monthly retirement benefit to which a
participant shall be entitled upon retirement at his/her normal
retirement date shall be an amount equal to 1.2% of the first $800 of the
average monthly compensation plus 1.8% of any excess of the average
monthly compensation over $800, all multiplied by the years and
completed months of full-time employment as of the normal retirement
date.
§ 23-1 WARWICK CODE § 23-3
17:34
§ 23-4. Defined benefit pension: other benefits.
B. Early retirement benefit. The monthly retirement benefit to which a
participant shall be entitled, upon retirement on or after his/her early
retirement date, but before his/her normal retirement date, shall be
computed by the benefit formula described in Subsection A above.
Average monthly compensation and the period of full-time employment,
however, shall be determined as of the actual retirement date. The
amount of early retirement benefit thus determined shall be reduced by
the appropriate factor of actuarial equivalency for each completed
month by which such actual retirement date precedes the normal
retirement date.
C. Cost-of-living increase. For employees hired before January 1, 2012, the
plan hereby provides for a cost-of-living increase of participants
receiving retirement benefits. The cost-of-living increase shall be at the
rate of 2% per year. There shall be a maximum lifetime cost-of-living
increase of 30%. Employees hired after January 1, 2012, shall not
receive any cost-of-living increase from the plan.
A. Disability benefit. The amount of disability benefit shall be the
retirement benefit accrued through the date of disability, determined in
accordance with the benefit formula described in § 23-3 and based on
average monthly compensation and period of full-time employment as
of the date of disablement, reduced by the full amount of workers'
compensation benefits, if any. Disability benefits shall be payable until
recovery or death. The Plan Administrator shall have the authority to
require medical evidence of continuing total and permanent disability
at his/her discretion from time to time. Payment of disability benefits is
contingent upon continuing acceptability of medical evidence which is
satisfactory to the Plan Administrator.
B. Death benefit. If a vested participant dies before retirement, the
surviving spouse, or, in the absence of a surviving spouse, another
beneficiary, shall be entitled to receive an annuity equal to the amount
of benefit accrued at the participant's death. If a participant dies after
reaching the early retirement date, the surviving spouse or other
beneficiary shall receive payments equal to those that would have been
payable if the participant had retired with an immediate joint and fiftypercent
contingent annuity on the day before his/her death. If a
participant dies on or before the early retirement date, the surviving
spouse or other beneficiary shall receive payments equal to those that
would have been payable had the participant separated from service on
the date of death, survived to his early retirement date, retired with an
immediate joint and fifty-percent contingent annuity at that age, and
died on the day after the early retirement date.
C. Vesting.
(1) If a Township employee's employment is terminated, or if he/she
ceases to be an employee, as defined above, before his/her normal
§ 23-3 MANAGER, TOWNSHIP § 23-4
17:35
§ 23-5. Defined benefit pension: payment of benefits.
retirement date, he/she shall be vested in benefits accrued through
his/her termination date according to the following five-year Cliff
Schedule:
Completed Years of Service Vesting Percentage
Less than 5 0%
5 100%
(2) No payments shall be due to any person no longer a Township
employee until such time as the employee reaches his/her early or
normal retirement date.
A. Normal form of annuity. Retirement benefits defined in §§ 23-3 and 23-4
shall be payable monthly during the balance of each participant's life
following actual retirement.
B. Optional forms of annuity. Instead of the retirement benefit payable for
life, the employee may elect to have the retirement benefit he/she is
entitled to receive in any of the following forms, whereby the annual
amount of retirement benefit so received shall be the actuarial
equivalent of the annual amount of the retirement benefit, payable for
life, as the employee is entitled to on his/her retirement date.
(1) Life annuity with payments for 10 years certain. This form of
retirement benefit provides for monthly payments to be made for
life, commencing on the retirement date, but in the event of death
of the annuitant before 120 payments have been made, such
payments shall be continued to the beneficiary named by the
annuitant until a total of 120 payments have been made.
(2) Joint and fifty-percent contingent annuity option. This form of
retirement benefit provides for monthly payments to be made
commencing on the retirement date, until the later of the death of
the annuitant or the death of the contingent annuitant specified by
the participant. If the annuitant is not living to receive the monthly
payments, the remaining payments will be made to the contingent
annuitant, and the amount of each monthly payment to the
contingent annuitant shall be 50% of the amount of each monthly
payment to the annuitant.
(a) This annuity shall not take effect if the contingent annuitant
dies prior to the date on which payments are to commence to
the annuitant. However, the death of the contingent annuitant
on or after such date shall not affect the amount payable
monthly to the annuitant.
(b) The annual retirement benefit, in the case of any eligible
employee who was married throughout the year preceding the
annuity starting date, shall be in the form of a joint and fifty-

17:36
§ 23-6. Defined benefit pension Plan Administrator; duties of
Trustees; expenses of administration.
percent contingent annuity, unless he/she has elected
otherwise in writing as provided in Subsection B(2)(c) below. A
spouse must sign off if other than a joint and survivor's annuity
clause is chosen.
(c) At least 90 days and no more than six months before an
employee shall reach the earliest date on which an eligible
employee could elect to receive retirement benefits as
provided herein, the Plan Administrator shall give such
employee a written statement of his/her approximate
anticipated benefits if he/she should take early retirement
during the next year. If the employee is married, the statement
shall clearly explain the difference between the joint and fiftypercent
contingent annuity and other available annuities, both
in terms of the anticipated annuity amounts in each case, and
that if he/she does not elect otherwise prior to his/her
retirement, his/her benefit will be paid in the form of a joint
and fifty-percent contingent annuity if he/she has been married
throughout the year preceding his/her retirement. The
employee shall have 90 days after the receipt of such
statement to file with the Plan Administrator, on a form
provided by the Plan Administrator, an election to take the
single life annuity or the life annuity with payments for 10
years certain or the joint and fifty-percent contingent annuity.
C. Actuarial equivalence. Actuarially equivalent annuity conversion
factors and early retirement reduction factors shall be derived based on
the 1971 Group Annuity Mortality Table with an assumed interest rate
of 8% per annum. Such conversion factors and reduction factors shall
be sex-neutral; participants and beneficiaries of the same age shall be
treated the same regardless of sex.
A. Plan Administrator. The Township Nonuniformed Employees' Defined
Benefit Pension Fund shall be under the direction of the Board of
Supervisors of Warwick Township or such committee, persons, or
corporate trustee as the Board of Supervisors from time to time
designates by resolution, who shall be known as the Defined Benefit
Pension Administrator, and who shall act as Trustees of the Township
Nonuniformed Employees' Pension Fund, and such Trustees shall have
full responsibility for the administration of the plan established
hereunder.
B. Duties of Trustees. The Trustees shall hold, invest, reinvest and
distribute all funds or other property received pursuant hereto in trust
for the purposes of the plan. The Trustees may receive at any time, and

and in accordance with the provisions hereof. The Trustees shall be
subject to such rules and regulations as may from time to time be
adopted by the Board of Supervisors by ordinance or resolution. The
Trustees shall have full power and authority by a majority action of its
members, either directly or through their designated representatives,
to do all acts, execute, acknowledge and deliver all instruments and

all powers and/or discretions necessary to implement and effectuate
the purposes of the plan, including for purposes of illustrations but not

C. Expenses of administration. The expense of administrating the defined
benefit pension, including compensation of an actuary, any custodian of

§ 23-6 WARWICK CODE § 23-7
17:38
contract or agreement shall be subject to any legal process by any creditor
or such participant or beneficiary of such participant.
§ 23-8. Failure to designate beneficiary.
In the absence of an effective beneficiary designation, the Plan
Administrator shall first pay death benefits to the spouse of an employee, if
any, then to his/her children, if any, then to the employee's estate.
§ 23-9. Defined benefit lump sum distribution.
A. In the event that for any reason the benefits payable to any employee
under the defined benefit plan are determined by the Plan
Administrator, in his/her sole discretion, to be too small to feasibly
provide the normal or optional retirement benefits, then a lump sum
distribution calculated to be actuarially equivalent shall be made.
B. Optional transfers.
(1) In the event that any payment or payments to be made under the
defined benefit plan to a participant, a beneficiary who is the
surviving spouse of a participant, an alternate payee who is the
former spouse of a participant, or a beneficiary who is not an
alternate payee or the surviving spouse of a participant, would
constitute an eligible rollover distribution, the individual may
request that such payment or payments be transferred directly
from the defined benefit plan to the trustee of a) an individual
retirement account described in Section 408(a) of the Internal
Revenue Code; b) an individual retirement annuity described in
Section 408(b) of the Code (other than an endowment contract); c)
an annuity plan described in Section 403(a) of the Code; d) a
qualified retirement plan, the terms of which permit the
acceptance of rollover distributions; or e) effective for distributions
made on or after January 1, 2002, 1) an eligible deferred
compensation plan described in Section 457(b) of the Code
maintained by an eligible employer described in Section
457(e)(1)(A) of the Code that separately accounts for eligible
rollover distributions; or 2) an annuity contract described in
Section 403(b) of the Code; provided, however, that i) clauses c)
and d) shall not apply to an eligible rollover distribution made prior
to January 1, 2002, to a beneficiary who is the surviving spouse of a
participant; ii) in the case of a distribution to a beneficiary who is
not the surviving spouse or an alternate payee who is the former
spouse of a participant, only clauses a) and b) shall apply; and iii)
effective January 1, 2009, a plan described in clause a) shall include
a Roth IRA described in Section 408(A) of the Code. Any such
request shall be made in writing, on the form prescribed by the
Trustees for such purpose, at such time in advance as the Trustees
may specify. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any eligible rollover
distribution in excess of $1,000 made after final regulations are
§ 23-7 MANAGER, TOWNSHIP § 23-9
17:39
§ 23-10. Defined benefit pension funding arrangement.
This plan shall be self-insured and self-administered by the Trustees.
§ 23-11. Nondiversion of defined benefit pension assets.
Under no circumstances, prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities with
respect to participants and their beneficiaries under the defined benefit
plan, shall any part of the assets of the trust be used or diverted to any
purpose other than the exclusive benefit of defined benefit plan participants
or their beneficiaries.
§ 23-11.1. Defined benefit pension: determination of final average
monthly compensation.
issued by the Department of Labor with respect to Section
401(a)(31)(B) of the Code shall be transferred directly to the
individual retirement plan of a designated trustee or insurer, unless
the participant elects to receive such distribution.
(2) For purposes of this section, "eligible rollover distribution" shall
mean a distribution from the defined benefit plan, excluding a) any
distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic
payments (not less frequently than annually) over the life (or life
expectancy) of the individual, the lives (or life expectancies) of the
individual and the individual's designated beneficiary, or a specified
period of 10 or more years; b) any distribution to the extent such
distribution is required under Section 401(a)(9) of the Internal
Revenue Code; and c) any distribution to the extent such
distribution is not included in gross income. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, clause c) of the preceding sentence shall not apply to a
distribution that is made on or after January 1, 2002, and rolled
over to an eligible retirement plan described in clause a) or b) of
the preceding subsection or a qualified defined contribution plan
or, effective January 1, 2007, an annuity contract described in
Section 403(b) of the Code or a qualified defined benefit plan that
will separately account for the portion of the distribution that is
included in gross income.
A. Notwithstanding the above, annual compensation taken into account in
determining final average monthly compensation shall not exceed
$450,000 (or, effective January 1, 2002, $200,000), as adjusted in
accordance with Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(17)(B) [the
"Section 401(a)(17) compensation limit"]. Except as provided below, the
Section 401(a)(17) compensation limit in effect for a calendar year
applies to any period, not exceeding 12 months, over which
compensation is determined ("determination period") and which begins
in such calendar year.
B. If a determination period consists of fewer than 12 months, the Section
401(a)(17) compensation limit will be multiplied by a fraction, the
§ 23-9 WARWICK CODE § 23-11.1
17:40
§ 23-11.2. IRC § 415 maximum benefit limitations.
numerator of which is the number of months in the determination
period, and the denominator of which is 12. In determining
compensation for purposes of applying the Section 401(a)(17)
compensation limit for plan years beginning before January 1, 1997, the
family aggregation rules of Section 401(a)(17) of the Internal Revenue
Code shall apply.
C. Effective January 1, 2002, for purposes of determining the final average
compensation of a participant who completes an hour of service on or
after January 1, 2002, the Section 401(a)(17) compensation limit for any
determination period beginning before January 1, 2002, shall be the
Section 401(a)(17) compensation limit for the 2002 calendar year.
A. General limitation.
(1) Except as provided to the contrary in Subsections B and C of this
section, the annual retirement benefit attributable to employer
contributions accrued by, or payable to, any participant will not
exceed the dollar limitation in effect for the limitation year under
Internal Revenue Code Section 415(b)(1)(A), as adjusted pursuant
to Section 415(d) of the Code, in the form of a qualified joint and
survivor annuity or a single life annuity, the reduced actuarial
equivalent of such dollar limitation (as adjusted) per annum annuity
in the form of a single life annuity. The dollar limitation (as
adjusted) described in the preceding sentence will be increased
using an interest rate of 5% per year and the mortality table
described in Section 417(e)(3) of the Code. If a participant's
benefits are payable in a form subject to Section 417(e)(3) of the
Code, such benefits will be adjusted, for purposes of applying the
limitations under this section, to their actuarial equivalent in the
form of a single life annuity, using the mortality table described in
Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code and 1) for plan years prior to 2004,
the interest rate set forth in Section 417(e)(3)(C) of the Code; 2) for
the 2004 and 2005 plan years, the greater of A) the interest rate set
forth in Section 417(e)(3)(C) of the Code; or B) 5.5%; and 3) for
plan years beginning after 2005, the greatest of A) the interest rate
set forth in Section 417(e)(3)(C) of the Code; B) 5.5%; or C) the
interest rate that provides a benefit of not more than 105% of the
benefit that would be provided if the interest rate set forth in
Section 417(e)(3)(C) of the Code was used.
(2) For purposes of this section: A) the increase in dollar limitation
described under Internal Revenue Code Section 415(b)(1)(A) that is
effective January 1, 2002, will only apply to an employee who
completes an hour of service on or after January 1, 2002; B)
"compensation" has the meaning given to such term in Treas. Reg.
§ 1.415(c)-2(b) and (c), plus compensation, if any, credited to the
participant pursuant to Section 414(u)(7) of the Code and, effective
January 1, 2009, differential wage payments described in Section
§ 23-11.1 MANAGER, TOWNSHIP § 23-11.2
17:41
§ 23-11.3. Validity.
Pennsylvania law shall govern the construction, validity and administration
of this plan and trust agreement. Should any section or any provision of
either plan be declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid,
such invalidity shall not affect the plan as a whole or any other part thereof.
§ 23-11.4. Appendix: defined contribution pension.
3401(h) of the Code, subject to the applicable annual compensation
limit under Section 401(a)(17) of the Code for the plan year; and
c) the limitations of Section 415 of the Code shall be adjusted
automatically each January 1 for increases in cost of living under
Section 415(d); provided, however, that such adjustments shall not
apply to any employee who does not complete an hour of service on
or after such January 1.
B. Exceptions to the general limitation. No benefit will be deemed in
violation of the limitation expressed in Subsection A if the amount of the
benefit does not exceed $10,000 for the current plan year or any prior
plan year, and the employer has not at any time maintained a defined
contribution plan in which the participant participated.
C. Short service limitation. In the case of a participant who has less than
10 years of credited service, the limitation set forth in Subsection A will
be reduced by multiplying it by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of a participant's years of credited service (or parts thereof),
and the denominator of which is 10. The limitation described in the
preceding sentence will be applied separately with respect to each
change in the benefit structure, to the extent required by the Secretary
of the Treasury. In the case of a participant who has less than 10 years
of vesting service, the limitation set forth in Subsection B will be
reduced by multiplying it by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of the participant's years of vesting service (or parts thereof)
and the denominator of which is 10. This Subsection C shall not apply to
disability benefits or death benefits.
D. Coordination with Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code. The
provision of this section shall be interpreted and implemented in
accordance with Section 415 of the Code and all rulings, notices and
regulations issued thereunder.

17:45

written designation of investment category preference, the
Administrator shall invest all funds received on account of any

future contributions.

to this article and the defined contribution pension documents, as
valued at the time of death. If no such beneficiary survives, the
amount will be paid to the participant's estate.

commenced, the remaining portion of such interest will continue to
be distributed in accordance with the method of distribution
elected pursuant to § 23-11.4F of this chapter.

shall be subject to the state and federal laws of the 401(a) plan;

(1) Distribution. As of a participant's termination of employment, he or
she may continue to maintain the 401(a) account with no further
Township contributions or roll over the plan to another qualified
retirement plan. The last Township payment into the plan will not
reflect contributions on additional PTO buyback or severance
payments paid at the time of termination of employment or
retirement.

the Township and reenrolls in the plan within 12 consecutive
months of termination, he or she shall continue to participate in the

and documents to any professional whose services are employed
pursuant to this pension.

defined contribution pension, shall determine any questions of fact
arising under the pension and shall make all decisions required of it
under the plan and its construction thereof; any decisions and

inconsistency in such manner to such extent as it shall deem
expedient to carry the plan into effect, and it shall be the sole judge
of such expediency. The Board shall act uniformly with respect to
matters coming before it concerning employees and participants in
similar circumstances.
(4) The participants of the Board, and each of them, shall be free of all
liability for any act or omission except by willful misconduct or
gross negligence, and each of them shall be fully indemnified by the
Township against all judgments not involving findings of their
respective personal or collective willful misconduct or gross
negligence and against all costs, including counsel fees incurred in
defense of actions brought against them.
(5) The Board or its designated Administrator shall make available to
participants, retired participants and terminated participants and
to their beneficiaries, for examination during business hours, such
records as pertain to the person examining.

the Township shall supply full and timely information to it on all
matters relating to the pay of all participants, their retirement,
death, termination of employment and such other pertinent facts as
the Board may require.
(7) The Board shall enact such rules and regulations for the conduct of
its business and for the administration of the defined contribution

(8) The Chair and Manager, acting on behalf of the Board, shall have
the power to execute all documents necessary to carry out the
actions of the Board, and any person, partnership, corporation or

signature or signatures as if executed by the Board.
J. Provisions relating to Township.
§ 23-11.4 WARWICK CODE § 23-11.4
17:48
(1) It is the expectation of the Township that it will continue this
defined contribution pension indefinitely and will from time to time
contribute to the fund such amounts as may be needed to provide
the benefits set forth in this chapter, but continuance of the defined
contribution pension is not assumed as an obligation of the
Township, and the right is reserved by the Township at any time to
reduce, suspend or discontinue its contributions hereunder.
(2) The Township assumes no obligation or responsibility with respect
to the operation of the defined contribution pension and does not
guarantee the payment of the benefits provided for participants of
the defined contribution pension. The Township shall have no
liability with respect to the administration of the fund, and
payments made under the provisions of any ordinance establishing,
amending, or maintaining the defined contribution pension shall
not be a charge on any other fund in the treasury of the Township
or under its control.
(3) Nothing contained in the defined contribution pension shall be held
or construed as a contract or guarantee of employment or to create
any liability upon the Township to retain any person in its service.
The Township reserves the full right to discontinue the service of
any person without any liability, except for salary or wages that
may be due and unpaid, whenever in its judgment its best interests
so require, and such discontinuance shall be without regard to this
defined contribution pension.
K. Termination or amendment of plan.
(1) The Township may amend, curtail or terminate this defined
contribution pension at any time; provided, however, that no
amendment affecting the Administrator or Trustee shall be made
without its consent (other than an amendment having the effect of
termination of the defined contribution pension); nor shall any
amendment be made which will in any manner divert any part of
the fund to any purpose other than the exclusive benefit of
participants or their beneficiaries (except upon termination, such
diversion may be made after all of the fixed and contingent
liabilities to participants and their beneficiaries have been met);
nor shall any amendment be made at any time which will in any
manner divest any benefit then vested in a participant.
(2) In the event of termination of this defined contribution pension, the
Board shall allocate the assets then remaining in the fund, to the
extent that such assets are sufficient, to participants and retired
participants in an amount equal to their respective participant
account balance, reduced in the cases of retired participants by any
prior distributions made to them.
§ 23-11.4 MANAGER, TOWNSHIP § 23-11.4
17:49
(3) After allocation of the funds, the Board shall determine whether to
operate the fund as the source of whatever payments the money so
allocated will provide.
L. Miscellaneous provisions.
(1) No benefit under this defined contribution pension shall be subject
in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer,
assignment, pledge or encumbrance, nor to seizure, attachment or
other legal process for the debts of any participants or participant's
beneficiaries.

defined contribution pension plan and any amendments thereto
certified to be a true and correct copy by the Administrator or
Trustee.

plan to the contrary notwithstanding, it is the intention of the

Administrator or Trustee shall be taken only in accordance with
written instructions of the Board, given in such detail as to
preclude the exercise by the Trustee of discretion in the
performance thereof.

the actuarial obligations to such participants or participant's
beneficiaries have been met.
(5) If the Board deems any person incapable of receiving benefits to
which he/she is entitled by reason of minority, illness, infirmity, or
other incapacity, it may direct the Administrator or Trustee to make
payment directly for the benefit of such person to the guardian or
trustee of such person, whose receipt shall be a complete
acquittance therefor. Such payment shall, to the extent therefor,
discharge all liability of the Township, the Trustee and the fund.

determined to be void by any court, the defined contribution
pension will continue to operate and, to the extent necessary, will
be deemed not to include the provision determined to be void.
(7) Headings and captions provided herein are for convenience only
and shall not be deemed part of the defined contribution pension

sustains a permanent disability, giving rise to his/her eligibility for a
service-related disability benefit, shall be equal to the greater of 50% of
the police employee's final average compensation, as hereinabove

§ 23-18. Termination of participation.
Upon reaching the date which would have been his/her superannuation
retirement date if he/she had continued to be employed as a full-time police
officer, he/she shall be paid a partial superannuation retirement allowance
determined by applying the percentage his/her years of service bears to the
years of service which he/she would have rendered had he/she continued
to work until his/her superannuation retirement date to the gross pension,
using, however, the monthly average salary during the thirty-six-month
period prior to his/her termination of employment.
§ 23-19. Survivor benefits.
Upon the death of the police employee or probationary employee, whether
prior to or after the retirement of the police employee or probationary
police employee, as provided above, the following benefits will be payable
by the plan or from the retirement fund:
B. There is no minimum period of service required for a police employee to
be eligible for a service-related disability pension benefit.
C. A police employee will be deemed to be permanently disabled under
and pursuant to this article when he/she is permanently disabled to the
extent that he/she is unable to perform the usual and normal functions
and duties of a police officer as determined by the Board of Supervisors
as a direct result of an injury or condition that has occurred in the
course of the police employee's employment with the Township. The
restrictions imposed upon the police employee by reason of such
service-related injury or condition shall not be temporary in nature and
shall not arise by reason of a non-service-connected illness, condition or
injury. The restrictions imposed upon the police employee must
preclude the officer from performing his/her functions and duties
associated with the occupation of a police officer, as certified by a
physician licensed to practice medicine in the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania, selected and designated to evaluate the police employee
by the Township.
A. The surviving spouse, or if no spouse survives or if the surviving spouse
subsequently dies, then the child or children under the age of 18 years
or if attending college, under or attaining the age of 23 years, of the
police employee or the probationary police employee will be paid a
monthly pension commencing as of the first day of the month next
following the date on which the police employee or probationary police
employee's death occurred and terminating as of the first day of the
month in which the surviving spouse dies. That sum no less than 1/2 or
50% of the monthly pension benefit which was then being paid to the
retired police employee or probationary police employee had he/she
qualified for the benefits as provided under the pension plan as of the
date on which his/her death occurred.
§ 23-17 MANAGER, TOWNSHIP § 23-19
17:57
B. If the police employee or the probationary police employee should die
without leaving a spouse to survive him/her, or if the surviving spouse
subsequently dies, then in that event there will be paid a monthly
pension to the guardian of the estate of each surviving child of the
police employee or probationary police employee, commencing as of
the first day of the month which next follows that date on which the
police employee or probationary police employee's death occurs, or his/
her spouse dies, and terminating on the first day of the month in which
the child either dies or attains the age of 18 years, or, if attending
college, under or attaining the age of 23 years, whichever event first
occurs. The monthly benefit shall be proportionately allocated to each
remaining child and monthly pension benefit that was then being paid
to the police employee or probationary police employee, he/she been
qualified to receive benefits, as provided under the pension plan and as
determined as of the date on which the police employee or probationary
employee's death occurred; provided, however, that the aggregate
payment of all monthly benefit that was being paid or which would have
been payable to the police employee or probationary employee's
surviving spouse, if one would have survived or qualified.
C. As each child ceases to be eligible for the pension benefit provided
herein, that child's share will become payable to the remaining children
who do qualify hereunder. It is understood that the monthly benefit
formally paid to the guardian of the estate for a dependent child who
either dies or has attained the age of 18 years, or if attending college
the age of 23 years, will then be divided among the remaining surviving
children who are then eligible for such benefits in order that the
monthly benefit of the remaining dependent children will increase
equally, provided that no such increased benefit may exceed the
monthly pension which would be payable hereunder. The aggregate
monthly dependent child benefit shall not exceed the monthly spousal
benefit that either had been paid to the spouse or would have been
payable.
D. The surviving spouse of a member of the police force who dies before
his/her pension has vested or if no spouse survives or if he or she
survives and subsequently dies, the child or children under the age of
18 years, or, if attending college, under or attaining the age of 23 years,
of the member of the police force shall be entitled to receive repayment
of all money which the member invested in the pension fund plus
interest or other increases in value of the member's investments in the
pension fund, unless the member has designated another beneficiary
for this purpose.
E. In the case of payment of pensions to families of members killed in
service, the amount and commencement of the payments shall be paid
by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania pursuant to the terms and
conditions of Act 51.12
12.Editor's Note: Act 51 of 2009. See 53 P.S. § 891.
§ 23-19 WARWICK CODE § 23-19
17:58
§ 23-20. Minimum benefit.
If a police employee or probationary police employee is not survived by
a spouse or children and the death benefits payable pursuant to the
provisions hereof leave remaining additional contributions made by the
police employee or probationary police employee in the plan or retirement
fund that have not been distributed prior to the police employee's or
probationary police employee's death, the aggregate of all contributions
made by the police employee or probationary police employee prior to his/
her death with the interest thereon computed at the rate of 4% per annum,
compounded annually from the plan year of deposit to the excess of such
contribution with interest at the police employee or probationary police
employees his/her spouse or children as of the date of his/her death or the
cessation of the spouse's or children's benefits, whichever is last to occur.
§ 23-21. Designated beneficiary.
The Township shall provide and keep on file forms for the police employee
to designate his/her beneficiary for this pension plan.
§ 23-22. Vesting and severance of employment.
F. Further, if, at the time of the police employee's or probationary police
employee's death, the spouse of the police employee or probationary
police employee is "with child," this child thereafter born to the spouse
will be considered a dependent child from the date of his/her birth, and
such child will be eligible for inclusion in the monthly benefit hereunder
provided.
A. If the police employee or probationary employee terminates his/her
employment with the Township, or otherwise ceases to be a member of
the Department of the Police of the Township, whether by reason of his/
her transfer to another Department of Police or employer, resignation,
discharge, firing or for any other reason prior to vesting as is
hereinafter provided, and unless an authorized leave of absence is duly
approved by the Supervisors, the police employee or probationary
police employee will be entitled to a refund of all contributions
computed at the rate of 4% per annum, compounded annually and
calculated with regard to the police employee's or probationary police
employee's contribution in which manner as to disregard fractional
pension plan years during which the police employee's or the
probationary police employee's contributions may have been held in the
police pension and retirement fund.
B. A police employee who has been employed by the Township and has 12
years of continuous service as a police employee with the Township
shall be vested under this pension plan. Should a police employee
terminate his/her employment with the Township or otherwise cease to
be a member of the Department of Police of the Township following the
completion of the requirements for retirement, that is, before

requirements, or of satisfying the disability provisions hereunder before
set forth, that police employee may not withdraw his/her contribution
and interest accrual thereon without the expressed written consent of
the Board of Supervisors. A police employee will then be eligible to
receive benefits under the plan and from the retirement fund upon
the date at which the employee shall have satisfied superannuation
age and service requirements. The benefits paid hereunder will be a
partial superannuation retirement allowance determined by applying
the percentage his/her year of service bears to the years of service
which he/she would have rendered, had the police employee continued
to work until his/her superannuation retirement date to the gross
pension, using the monthly average salary as a police employee of
the Township during his/her termination of employment. The benefits
hereunder are those as authorized by the amendment of December 7,
1979, Act No. 1979-99, P.S. § 711.13
A. Administration. The police pension fund shall be under the direction of
the governing body of this municipality or such committee or persons as

Trustees shall have full responsibility for the administration of the
program established hereunder and shall hold, invest, reinvest and
distribute all funds or other property received pursuant hereto in trust

them in trust for the benefit of this fund in accordance with the
provisions hereof. The Trustee shall have full power and authority by a
majority action of its members either directly or through their

absence of any such advice;
(8) To register securities in the name of a nominee or nominees. The
Trustees may invest and reinvest the assets of this Trust in such a
manner and at such times as the Trustees may deem advisable and
proper. It is the intention of the employer that the Trustees shall
have absolute discretion in the matter of the selection of securities
or other property in which the trust assets shall be invested from
time to time. Securities or other property, as used herein, shall be

the participant, shall be subject in any manual to alienation, sale, transfer,
assignment or pledge; nor to attachment or encumbrance of any kind,
nor shall any retirement benefit, until actually paid to the participant,
be in any manner liable for or subject to the debts or liability of said
participant entitled to any retirement benefit. Any attempt to alienate, sell,
transfer, assign, pledge or otherwise encumber any such benefit, prior to
receipt thereof by the participant, in violation of the restrictions set forth
in the preceding sentence shall be void. If a participant shall attempt to or
shall alienate, sell, transfer, assign, pledge or otherwise encumber his/her
benefits payable under the Trust or any part hereof, or, if by reason of his/
her bankruptcy or other event happening at any time, such benefits should

otherwise, herein conferred upon the original Trustees, shall be bound

Trustees, and shall be entitled to all the privileges, exculpation,

retirement date.
B. Written election. A member of the Police Department electing to

Form prepared by Warwick Township, which shall evidence the
member's participation in the DROP. The form must be signed by the
member, notarized and submitted to the Township at least 30 days prior

continuous service for pension purposes.
D. Benefit calculation. For all pension fund purposes, continuous service of
a member participating in the DROP shall remain as it existed on the

thereafter shall not be recognized or used for the calculation or
determination of any benefits payable by the Warwick Township Police
Pension Plan. Earnings or increases in earnings thereafter shall not be
recognized or used for the calculation or determination of any benefits
payable by the pension fund. The pension benefit payable to the
members shall increase only as a result of a cost of living increase as
provided for in § 23-15C.
E. Payments to the DROP account. The monthly retirement benefits that
would have been payable had the police officer elected to cease
employment and receive a normal retirement benefit shall, upon the
police officer commencing participation in DROP, be paid into the
separate account established to receive the participant's monthly
pension payments. This account shall be designated the DROP account.
An individual officer's DROP account shall be a self-directed investment
vehicle, with the officer having exclusive control over the investment of
his or her DROP account monies. The Township accepts no
responsibility and makes no guarantee for the performance of any
investments made by the officer, nor shall the Township guarantee or be
required to guarantee that an officer's DROP account generate a
specific amount of earnings or income or any earning or income at all.
§ 23-27 MANAGER, TOWNSHIP § 23-27
17:63
Any investment losses occurring in an officer's DROP account shall be
solely the responsibility of the officer, and the Township assumes no
liability or responsibility for same.
F. Accrual of nonpension benefits. After an officer elects to participate in
the DROP program, all other contractual benefits shall continue to
accrue, with the exception of those provisions relating to the Police
Pension Plan and the buyback of accrued, but unused, sick or vacation
time. Prior to participating in the DROP program, an officer may
request payment for any accrued but unused sick or vacation time for
which the Township would contractually be obligated to buy back from
the officer upon retirement. An officer may utilize leave time during the
DROP period, but the Township shall not be contractually obligated to
buy back any such unused leave time at the end of the DROP period.
G. Payout. Upon the resignation date set forth in the member's DROP
option notice or such date as the Township separates the member from
employment, the retirement benefits payable to the member or
member's beneficiary, if applicable, shall be paid to the member or
beneficiary and shall no longer be paid to the member's DROP account.
These benefits shall be paid to the member no later than 30 days
following the resignation or termination date and shall be paid to the
member in a single lump sum payment or at the member's option, in
any fashion permitted by law.
H. Disability during DROP. If a member becomes temporarily disabled
during his participation in DROP, the member shall receive disability
pay in the same amount as disabled police officers who are not
participating in DROP. In no event shall a member on temporary
disability have the ability to draw from his DROP account. However,
notwithstanding any other provision in this subsection, if an officer is
disabled and has not returned to work as of the date of his required
resignation or per the CBA, then such resignation shall take precedence
over all other provisions herein, and said officer shall be required to
resign. Nothing contained in the plan shall be construed as conferring
any legal rights upon any police employee or other person to a
continuation of employment, nor shall participation in the DROP
program supersede or limit in any way the right of the Township to
honorably discharge a police employee based upon an inability to
perform his or her full duties as a police officer.
I. Death. If a DROP member dies before the DROP account balances are
paid, the participant member's legal beneficiary shall have the same
rights as the member to withdraw the account balance.
J. Forfeiture of benefits. Notwithstanding an officer's participation in the
DROP plan, an officer who is convicted or pleads guilty to engaging in
criminal misconduct which constitutes a "crime, related to public office
or public employment," as that phrase is defined in Pennsylvania's
Pension Forfeiture Act, 43 P.S. §§ 1311 through 1314, shall forfeit his
right to receive a pension, including any amounts currently deposited in
§ 23-27 WARWICK CODE § 23-27
17:64
the DROP account. In such a case, the member shall only be entitled
to receive the contributions, if any, made by the member to the fund,
without interest.
K. Account manager. The DROP participant shall be solely responsible for
the administration of his or her individual DROP account. The Township
shall not be responsible for any investment loss incurred in the plan or
for the failure of an investment to earn a specific or expected return or
to earn as much as any other opportunity, whether or not such other
investment opportunity was offered or available to participants in the
plan.
L. Cost of management for DROP program. Any costs or fees associated
with the management of the DROP accounts shall be paid directly from
the individual DROP accounts. Under no circumstances shall any such
costs or fees be paid by the Township or by the pension plan itself.
M. Amendment. Any amendments to the DROP program shall be consistent
with the provision covering deferred retirement option plans set forth
in any applicable collective bargaining agreement and shall be binding
upon all future DROP participants and upon all DROP participants who
have balances in their deferred retirement option accounts. The DROP
plan may only be amended by a written instrument, not by any oral
agreement or past practice.
N. Construal of provisions. An officer's election to participate in the DROP
program shall in no way be construed as a limitation on the Township's
right to suspend or terminate an officer for just cause or to grant the
officer an honorable discharge based upon a physical or mental inability
to perform his or her duties.
O. Severability. The provisions of DROP shall be severable, and if any or all
of its provisions shall be held to be unconstitutional or illegal, the
validity of any remaining provisions of DROP shall not be affected
thereby. In the event that the DROP provision is declared invalid or
illegal by a court of jurisdiction or through an administrative
determination of the Office of the Auditor General, the Police
Benevolent Association shall have the right to bargain in accordance
with Act 111 over deletion of this benefit. It is expressly understood that
this shall not involve bargaining over a replacement provision.
P. If the Office of the Auditor General, at any time, finds the DROP plan to
be invalid, it shall either be revised to conform to the requirements of
the Auditor General or, if that is not possible, it (DROP program) shall
be terminated. In the event of such a termination, all members shall be
considered retired/terminated from employment on the date they
became members of the DROP program, and all funds contained in the
DROP accounts shall be paid to the member in accordance with the
provisions contained herein.
§ 23-27 MANAGER, TOWNSHIP § 23-28
17:65
§ 23-28. Construal of provisions.
The fund agreement shall be construed according to the laws of the State of
Pennsylvania, where it is made and where it shall be enforced.
§ 23-29. Severability; repealer; when effective.
A. If any section, paragraph, subsection, clause or provision of this article
shall be declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such
decision shall not affect the validity of this article as a whole or any part
thereof.
B. All ordinances or parts of ordinances inconsistent herewith are hereby
repealed.
C. The article, upon enactment, replaces and supersedes all previous
versions. This article shall be effective five days after enactment.

A. The Township of Warwick finds that the development of cable television
and communications systems has the potential of having great benefit
and impact upon the people of Warwick. Because of the complex and
rapidly changing technology associated with cable television, the
Township further finds that the public convenience, safety and general
welfare can best be served by establishing regulatory powers which
should be vested in the Township or such persons as the Township shall
designate. It is the intent of this article and subsequent amendments to
provide for and specify the means to attain the best possible public
interest and public purpose in these matters and any franchise issued
pursuant to this article shall be deemed to include this finding as an
integral part thereof.
B. Further, it is recognized that cable communications systems have the
capacity to provide not only entertainment and information services to
the Township's residents, but can provide variety of broadband,
interactive communications services to institutions and individuals.
Many of these services involve Township agencies and other public
institutions, by providing governmental, educational or health care
communications.
C. For these purposes, the following goals underlie the regulations
contained herein:
(1) Communications services should be provided to the maximum
number of Township residents.
(2) The system should be capable of accommodating both the present
and reasonably foreseeable future cable communications needs of
the Township.
(3) The system should be improved and upgraded during the franchise
term so that the new facilities necessary for the operation of this

existing facilities.
(4) The cable communications system authorized by this article shall
be responsive to the needs and interests of the local community,
and shall provide a wide diversity of information sources and
services to the public.

held by the Township which shall entitle the Township and the grantee to
the use thereof for the purpose of installing and maintaining the grantee's
cable television system. No reference herein, or in any franchise, to the
"public way" shall be deemed to be a representation or guarantee by the
Township that its title to any property is sufficient to permit its use for such

§ 60-4. Grant of franchise.
A. Grant. In the event that the Township shall grant to the grantee a
nonexclusive, revocable franchise to construct, operate, and maintain a
cable communications system within the Township, said franchise shall
constitute both a right and an obligation to provide the services of a
cable communications system as regulated by the provisions of this
article and the franchise. The franchise shall include by reference those
provisions of the grantee's application for franchise that are finally
negotiated and accepted by the Township and grantee.
B. Event of conflict. The franchise shall be granted under the terms and
conditions contained herein, consistent with the Township's charter
and/or other applicable statutory requirements. In the event of conflict
between the terms and conditions of this article, the franchise, or the
terms and conditions on which the Township can grant a franchise, the
charter and/or statutory requirements shall control.
C. General Township ordinances. Any franchise granted by the Township is
hereby made subject to the general ordinance provisions now in effect
and hereafter made effective. Nothing in the franchise shall be deemed
to waive the requirements of the various codes and ordinances of the
Township regarding permits, fees to be paid, or manner of construction.
§ 60-3 WARWICK CODE § 60-5
60:94
§ 60-5. Franchise area.
The franchise area shall be the entire Township, or portions thereof, for
which a franchise is granted.
§ 60-6. Use of public rights-of-way.
For the purpose of operating and maintaining a cable communications
system in the Township, the grantee may erect, install, construct, repair,
replace, reconstruct and retain in, on, over, under, upon, across and along
the public streets and ways within the Township such wires, cables,
conductors, ducts, conduits, vaults, manholes, amplifiers, appliances,
pedestals, attachments and other property and equipment as are necessary
to the operation of the cable communications systems, provided, however,
that the grantee complies with all design, construction, safety, and
performance provisions contained in this article, the franchise agreement,
and other applicable local ordinances.
§ 60-7. Use of Township facilities.
In the event that a grantee chooses to utilize Township-owned conduit or
other facilities for any portion of its cable communications system, the
consideration for the use of Township conduit or other facilities shall be at
charges to be agreed upon between the parties.
§ 60-8. Use of grantee facilities.
No poles or pedestals shall be erected by the grantee without prior approval
of the Township with regard to location, height, type and any other
pertinent aspect. However, no location of any pole of the grantee shall
be a vested right and such poles shall be removed or modified by the
grantee at its own expense whenever the Township determines that the
public convenience would be enhanced thereby. The grantee shall utilize
existing poles and conduits, where possible. The Township shall have the
right, during the life of the franchise, to install and maintain upon the poles
owned by the grantee, any wire and pole fixtures that do not unreasonably
interfere with the cable system operations of the grantee. The Township
shall reimburse the grantee for any make-ready costs. The use of the
grantee's poles shall be at a fair and reasonable rate.
§ 60-9. Franchise required.
No cable communications system shall be allowed to occupy or use the
streets of the Township or be allowed to operate without a franchise.
§ 60-10. Term of franchise.
The term of any franchise granted pursuant to this article shall be stated in
the franchise.
§ 60-5 CABLE TELEVISION AND VIDEO § 60-11
60:95
§ 60-11. Franchise nonexclusive.
Any franchise granted pursuant to this article shall be nonexclusive. The
Township specifically reserves the right to grant at any time such additional
franchises for a cable communication system as it deems appropriate, and/
or build, operate, and own such cable communication system or systems
as it deems appropriate. Subject to applicable law and regulation, any
additional cable communications system franchises granted by the
Township shall, to the extent practicable, seek to create a level regulatory
playing field and shall contain similar terms and conditions, including,
without limitation, provisions of public benefit with similar cost, taking
into account the size and population of the franchised areas. A grantee is
required to indemnify the Township and to hold the Township harmless from
all claims against it by third parties arising out of its compliance with this
provision to the extent that such claims are not barred by Section 635A
of the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992
(Limitation of Franchise Authority Liability), or by any other provision of
law.
§ 60-12. Performance within time allotted.
Whenever the agreement shall set forth any time for an act to be performed
by or on behalf of the grantee or the Township, such time shall be deemed
of the essence and any failure of the grantee or the Township to perform
within the time allotted shall be sufficient ground for the other party to
invoke an appropriate penalty including possible revocation of the
franchise, subject to force majeure.
§ 60-13. Conflict of provisions.
In any controversy or dispute under this article, the law of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania shall apply.
§ 60-14. Transfer of ownership or control.
A. Transfer of franchise. Any franchise granted hereunder shall not be
sold, transferred, leased, assigned or disposed of, including but not
limited to transfer by force or voluntary sale, merger, consolidation,
receivership or other means, nor shall the control of the grantee be
changed, without the prior consent of the Township. The Township
reserves the right to impose certain conditions on the transferee as a
condition of transfer approval to ensure that the franchisee is able to
meet ordinance and franchise requirements and existing operating
practices.
B. Transfer threshold. The grantee shall promptly notify the Township of
any actual or proposed change in, or transfer of, or acquisition by any
other party of, control of the grantee. The word "control" as used herein
is not limited to major stockholders but includes actual working control
in whatever manner exercised. A transfer of ownership requiring
approval shall arise upon the disposal by the grantee, directly or
§ 60-11 WARWICK CODE § 60-14
60:96
indirectly, by gift, assignment, voluntary sale, merger, consolidation or
otherwise, of 25% or more at one time of the ownership or controlling
interest in the system, or 30% cumulatively over the term of the
franchise of such interests to a corporation, partnership, limited
partnership, trust or association, or person or group of persons acting
in concert. Except that no consent shall be required for any sale,
transfer, or assignment of ownership or control to an entity under
common control with the grantee, provided that prior to such transfer,
the grantee provides to the Township verifiable information to establish
that such transferee under common control has the financial, legal and
technical ability to fully perform all obligations of the franchise.
C. Township approval. Every change, transfer, or acquisition of control of
the grantee shall make the franchise subject to cancellation unless and
until the Township shall have consented thereto, which consent will not
be unreasonably withheld. For the purpose of determining whether it
shall consent to such change, transfer, or acquisition of control, the
Township may inquire into the legal, financial, character, technical and
other public interest qualifications of the prospective controlling party,
and the grantee shall provide the Township with all required
information relevant to said inquiry. Failure to provide all information
requested by the Township as part of said inquiry shall be grounds for
denial of the proposed change, transfer or acquisition of control.
D. Assumption of control. The Township agrees that any financial
institution having a pledge of the franchise or its assets for the
advancement of money for the construction and/or operation of the
franchise shall have the right to notify the Township that it or its
designees satisfactory to the Township will take control and operate the
cable television system. Further, said financial institution shall also
submit a plan for such operation that will insure continued service and
compliance with all franchise obligations during the term the financial
institution exercises control over the system. The financial institution
shall not exercise control over the system for a period exceeding 18
months, unless extended by the Township at its discretion and during
said period of time it shall have the right to petition for transfer of the
franchise to another grantee. If the Township finds that such transfer,
after considering the legal, financial, character, technical and other
public interest qualifications of the applicant are satisfactory, the
Township will transfer and assign the rights and obligations of such
franchise as in the public interest. The consent of the Township to such
transfer shall not be unreasonably withheld.
E. No waiver of Township property rights. The consent or approval of the
Township to any transfer of the grantee shall not constitute a waiver or
release of the rights of the Township in and to the streets, and any
transfer shall, by its terms, be expressly subject to the terms and
conditions of this article and the franchise.
F. Transfer time periods. The Township will not approve any transfer or
assignment of the franchise prior to completion of construction of the
§ 60-14 CABLE TELEVISION AND VIDEO § 60-14
60:97
§ 60-15. Franchise renewal.
Upon completion of the term of any franchise granted under this article,
the Township may grant or deny renewal of the franchise of the grantee
in accordance with the provisions of the Cable Act. The grantee shall own
the cable communication system, but shall have no property right in the
public rights of way upon the completion of the franchise term including any
renewals and extensions thereof.
§ 60-16. Police powers.
§ 60-17. Franchise fees.
proposed system unless appropriate guarantees which are acceptable
to the Township are made by the transferee.
G. Disclosure of purchase price. The Township reserves the right to
require the grantee and transferee to disclose the purchase price of any
transfer or assignment of the cable system.
H. Signatory requirement. Any approval by the Township of transfer of
ownership or control shall be contingent upon the prospective
controlling party becoming a signatory to the franchise.
I. Time frame for Township review. The Township shall have 120 days to
act upon any request for approval of such sale or transfer that contains
or is accompanied by such information as is required in accordance
with FCC regulations and by the Township. If the Township fails to
render a final decision on the request within 120 days, such request
shall be deemed granted unless the requesting party and the Township
agree to an extension of time.
A. Police powers. In accepting the franchise, the grantee acknowledges
that its rights hereunder are subject to the police power of the
Township to adopt and enforce general ordinances necessary to the
safety and welfare of the public; and it agrees to comply with all
applicable general laws and ordinances enacted by the Township
pursuant to such power.
B. Conflicts. Any conflict between the provisions of this article or the
franchise and any other present or future lawful exercise of the
Township's police powers shall be resolved in favor of the latter, except
that any such exercise that is not of general application in the
jurisdiction or applies exclusively to the grantee or cable
communications systems which contains provisions inconsistent with
this article or the franchise shall prevail only if, upon such exercise, the
Township finds an emergency exists constituting a danger to health,
safety, property or general welfare and such exercise is mandated by
law.
§ 60-14 WARWICK CODE § 60-17
60:98
A. Because the Township finds that the streets of the county,
commonwealth, and Township to be used by the grantee in the
operation of its system within the boundaries of the franchise area are
valuable public properties acquired and maintained by the county,
commonwealth, and Township at great expense to its taxpayers; the
grant to the grantee to the said streets is a valuable property right
without which the grantee would be required to invest substantial
capital in right-of-way costs and acquisitions; and the administration of
this article and the franchise imposes upon the Township additional
regulatory responsibility and expense, a grantee of any franchise
hereunder shall pay to the Township a franchise fee in an amount as
designated in the franchise, but in no event less than 5% of the gross
annual revenues, or the maximum amount permitted under applicable
federal, commonwealth, or local law, if such maximum is greater than
5%. The annual franchise fee payable shall be in addition to any other
fee and shall commence as of the effective date of the franchise.
Annually, the Township shall be furnished a statement of said payment
by a certified public accountant, reflecting the total amounts of annual
gross revenues, a breakdown by type of revenue, and the above charges
and computations for the period covered by the payment.
B. Franchise fee in addition to other tax or payment. The Township
believes that payment of the franchise fee made by the grantee to the
Township shall not be considered in the nature of a tax, but shall be in
addition to any and all taxes which are now or may be lawfully required
hereafter to be paid by any federal, commonwealth, or local law. This
payment shall be in addition to any other tax or payment owed to the
governments or other taxing jurisdiction by the grantee.
C. Acceptance by the Township. No acceptance of any payment by the
Township shall be construed as a release or as an accord and
satisfaction of any claim the Township may have for further or
additional sums payable as a franchise fee under this article or for the
performance of any other obligation of the grantee.
D. Failure to make required payment. In the event that any franchise
payment or recomputed amount is not made on or before the dates
specified herein, the grantee shall pay as additional compensation an
interest charge, computed from such due date, at the annual rate equal
to the commercial prime interest rate of the Township primary
depository bank during the period that such unpaid amount is owed.
E. Payments to be made quarterly. The franchise fee and any other cost or
damage assessed against the grantee shall be payable quarterly to the
Township of Warwick. The grantee shall file a complete and accurate
statement verified by a financial officer of the grantee, of all gross
revenues within the franchise area and the number of subscribers per
service during the period for which said quarterly payment is made, and
said payment shall be made to the Township no later than 45 days
following the expiration of each calendar quarter ending March 1, June
§ 60-17 CABLE TELEVISION AND VIDEO § 60-17
60:99
§ 60-18. Forfeiture or revocation.
30, and September 30, and no later than the 90 days after the calendar
quarter ending December 31.
F. The Township's right of inspection. The Township shall have the right to
inspect the grantee's income records and the right to audit and to
recompute any amounts determined to be payable under this article.
Audits shall be at the expense of the Township unless the audit reveals
an underpayment of more than 5% in the amount of the franchise fee
due to the Township, in which event the cost of the audit shall be borne
by the grantee. Any additional amount due the Township as a result of
the audit shall be paid within 30 days following written notice to the
grantee by the Township which notice shall include a copy of the audit
report.
A. Grounds for revocation. The Township reserves the right to revoke any
franchise granted hereunder and rescind all rights and privileges
associated with the franchise in the following circumstances, each of
which shall represent a default and breach under the article and the
franchise grant:
(1) If the grantee shall default in the performance of any of the
material obligations under this article, the franchise, or under such
documents, contracts and other terms and provisions entered into
by and between the Township and the grantee.
(2) If the grantee shall fail to provide or maintain in full force and
effect the liability and indemnification coverage or the performance
bond as required herein.
(3) If the grantee, after all established regulatory and appellate
procedures have been exhausted, shall violate any orders or rulings
of any regulatory body having jurisdiction over the grantee relative
to this article or the franchise.
(4) If the grantee practices any fraud or deceit upon the Township or
cable subscribers.
(5) The grantee's construction schedule is delayed 180 days, beyond
the schedule contained in the franchise or beyond any extended
date set by the Township.
(6) The grantee becomes insolvent, unable or unwilling to pay its debts
or is adjudged bankrupt.
(7) Failure to restore service after 96 consecutive hours of interrupted
service substantially throughout the franchise area, except when
approval of such interruption is obtained from the Township.
(8) Material misrepresentation of fact in the application for or
negotiation of the franchise or any extension or renewal thereof.
§ 60-17 WARWICK CODE § 60-18
60:100
(9) If the grantee ceases to provide a substantial portion of ongoing
cable services for any reason within the control of the grantee over
the cable communications system.
B. Effect of circumstances beyond control of the grantee. The grantee
shall not be declared at fault or be subject to any sanction under any
provision of this article in any case, in which performance of any such
provision is prevented for reasons beyond the grantee's control. A fault
shall not be deemed to be beyond the grantee's control is committed by
a corporation or other business entity in which the grantee holds a
controlling interest whether held directly or indirectly.
C. Effect of pending litigation. Pending litigation or any appeal to any
regulatory body or court having jurisdiction over the grantee shall not
excuse the grantee from the performance of its obligations under this
article or the franchise. Failure of the grantee to perform such
obligations because of pending litigation or petition may result in
forfeiture or revocation pursuant to the provisions of this section.
D. Procedure prior to revocation.
(1) The Township shall make written demand that the grantee comply
with any such requirement, limitation, term condition, rule or
regulation or correct any action deemed cause for revocation. If the
failure, refusal or neglect of the grantee continues for a period of
30 days following such written demand, the Township shall place
its request for termination of the franchise upon a regular Board of
Supervisors meeting agenda. The Township shall cause to be
served upon such grantee at least seven days prior to the date of
such Board of Supervisors meeting, a written notice of this intent to
request such termination, and the time and place of the meeting,
notice of which shall be published by the Township Manager or his
designee, at least once, seven days before such meeting in a
newspaper of general circulation within the Township.
(2) The Board of Supervisors shall hear any persons interested therein,
and shall determine in its discretion whether or not any failure,
refusal or neglect by the grantee was with just cause.
(3) If such failure, refusal or neglect by the grantee was with just
cause, as reasonably determined by the Township, the Board of
Supervisors shall direct the grantee to comply within such time and
manner and upon such terms and conditions as are reasonable.
(4) If the Board of Supervisors shall determine such failure, refusal, or
neglect by the grantee was without just cause, then the Board of
Supervisors shall, by resolution, declare that the franchise of the
grantee shall be terminated unless there is compliance by the
grantee within 90 days.
§ 60-18 CABLE TELEVISION AND VIDEO § 60-18
60:101
§ 60-19. Receivership and foreclosure.
E. Disposition of facilities. In the event a franchise expires and is not
renewed or extended, is revoked or otherwise terminated, the Township
may, in its sole discretion, do any of the following:
(1) Purchase the system under the procedures set forth in § 60-23 of
this article.
(2) Effect a transfer of ownership of the system to another party.
(3) Order the removal of all or a portion of the system facilities as
required by the Township within a reasonable period of time as
determined by the Township or require the original grantee to
maintain and operate its system for a period of six months or until
such further time as is mutually agreed upon.
F. Restoration of property. In removing its plant, structures and
equipment, the grantee shall refill, at its own expense, any excavation
that shall be made by it and shall leave all public ways and places in as
good a condition or better as that prevailing prior to the grantee's
removal of its equipment and appliances without affecting the electrical
or telephone cable wires or attachments. The Township shall inspect
and approve the condition of the public ways and public places and
cables, wires, attachments, and poles after removal. The liability,
indemnity, insurance and performance bond as provided herein shall
continue in full force and effect during the period of removal and until
full compliance by the grantee with the terms and conditions of this
paragraph, this article and the franchise.
G. Restoration by Township; reimbursement of costs. In the event of a
failure by the grantee to complete any work required by §§ 60-6 and
60-7 and/or Subsection F above, or any other work required by
Township law or ordinance within the time as may be established and to
the satisfaction of the Township, the Township may cause such work to
be done and the grantee shall reimburse the Township the cost thereof
within 30 days after receipt of an itemized list of such costs or the
Township may recover such costs through the performance bond
provided by the grantee. The Township shall be permitted to seek legal
and equitable relief to enforce the provisions of this section.
H. Extended operation. Upon either the expiration and nonrenewal or
revocation of a franchise, the Township may require the grantee to
continue to operate the system for a period of six months from the date
of such expiration or revocation, or until such time as is mutually
agreed upon. The grantee shall continue to operate the cable
communications system under the terms and conditions of this article
and the franchise and to provide the regular subscriber service and any
and all of the services that may be provided at the time. The Township
shall be permitted to seek legal and equitable relief to enforce the
provisions of this section.

§ 60-20. Equal opportunity policy.
Equal opportunity employment shall be afforded by all operators of cable
television systems to all qualified persons, and no person shall be
discriminated against in employment because of race, color, religion, age,
national origin, sex, or physical handicap. The grantee shall comply with all
equal opportunity provisions enacted by federal, commonwealth and local
authorities, as well as all such provisions contained in this article and the
franchise.
§ 60-21. Notices.
All notices from grantee to the Township pursuant to this article and the
franchise shall be to the Township Manager or his/her designee. The
A. Termination by insolvency. The franchise granted hereunder shall, at
the option of the Township, cease and terminate 120 days after the
appointment of a receiver or receivers or trustee or trustees to take
over and conduct the business of the grantee whether in a receivership,
reorganization, bankruptcy or other action or proceeding unless such
receivership or trusteeship shall have been vacated prior to the
expiration of said 120 days, or unless:
(1) Such receivers or trustees shall have, within 120 days after their
election or appointment, fully complied with all the terms and
provisions of this article and the franchise granted pursuant
hereto, and the receivers or trustees within said 120 days shall
have remedied all defaults under the franchise or have commenced
expeditiously and in good faith to do so in the reasonable opinion of
the Board of Supervisors; and
(2) Such receivers or trustees shall, within said 120 days, execute an
agreement duly approved by the court having jurisdiction in the
premises, whereby such receivers or trustees assume and agree to
be bound by each and every term, provision and limitation of the
franchise herein granted.
B. Termination by judicial action. In the case of a foreclosure or other
judicial sale of the plant, property and equipment of the grantee or any
part thereof, including or excluding the franchise, the Township may
serve notice of termination upon the grantee and the successful bidder
at such sale, in which event the franchise and all rights and privileges of
the grantee granted hereunder shall cease and terminate 30 days after
service of such notice, unless:
(1) The Township shall have approved the transfer of the franchise, in
the manner this article provides; and
(2) Such successful bidder shall have covenanted and agreed with the
Township to assume and be bound by all the terms and conditions
of the franchise.
§ 60-19 CABLE TELEVISION AND VIDEO § 60-21
60:103
grantee shall maintain with the Township, throughout the term of the
franchise, an address for service of notices by mail. The grantee shall
also maintain a locally accessible office as specified in this article and the
franchise, and telephone number for the conduct of matters related to the
franchise during normal business hours. The grantee shall be required to
advise the Township of such address(es) and telephone numbers and any
changes thereof.
§ 60-22. Failure of Township to enforce; no waiver of terms.
The grantee shall not be excused from complying with any of the terms and
conditions of this article or the franchise by any failure of the Township
upon any one or more occasions to insist upon or to seek compliance with
any such terms or conditions.
§ 60-23. Rights reserved to grantor.
A. Right to purchase of the system by the Township upon termination or
expiration of the franchise.
(1) Right to purchase. In the event the grantee forfeits and the
Township terminates the franchise for cause, pursuant to
provisions of this article and the franchise, or the franchise is not
renewed at or following the normal expiration of the franchise
term, the Township shall have the right, directly or as an
intermediary, to purchase the franchised cable communications
system or effect the ownership of the system to another person.
Any such acquisition or transfer shall be as specified in the Cable
Act. The Township shall notify the grantee in writing within 30 days
following nonrenewal or termination of its intent to acquire the
system on its behalf or effectuate the ownership of the system to
another person. Purchase price shall be based upon the value of the
system determined pursuant to this section.
(2) Arbitration. In the event the Township and grantee are unable to
agree upon the value of the cable communications system, either
party may require by written notice to the other that the value of
cable communications system be submitted to arbitration in the
following manner:
(a) The Township and the grantee shall each within 15 days after
such written notice select an arbitrator who shall be a
disinterested person with reasonable knowledge and
experience relative to the subject to be arbitrated. The two
arbitrators thus selected shall immediately thereafter select a
third arbitrator who shall likewise be a disinterested person
having reasonable knowledge and experience relative to the
subject to be arbitrated.
(b) Within 30 days after appointment of all arbitrators and upon 10
days' written notice to the parties, the panel of arbitrators shall
§ 60-21 WARWICK CODE § 60-23
60:104
commence a hearing on the issue of valuation and shall receive
all relevant information from the parties.
(c) The hearing shall be recorded and may be transcribed at the
request of either party. All hearing proceedings, debate and
deliberations shall be open to the public and at such times and
places as contained in the notice or as thereafter publicly
stated, except that if two arbitrators agree, debate and
deliberations may be held in closed session.
(d) The value of the system as determined by the arbitration panel
shall be determined pursuant to Subsection A(1) above.
(e) Within 30 days after the close of the hearing, the panel of
arbitrators shall prepare findings and decision agreed upon by
a majority of the panel which shall be filed with the Township
and served by mail upon the grantee. The decision of the panel
regarding the value of the system shall be final and binding

the violation, the notice provided under this subsection shall provide
the grantee with a minimum of 30 days to remedy the matter. If the
matter is not remedied within the cure period specified in the

Fees for Emergency Response Services
[Adopted 3-5-2012 by Ord. No. 2012-2]
§ 73-4. Purpose.
§ 73-5. Collection of fees.
A. The Board of Supervisors of the Township of Warwick has determined
that the increase in costs to provide adequate fire prevention and
protection services, and to provide other public safety emergency
services, including catastrophes that result from extraordinary and
dangerous occurrences, both natural and man-made, including, but not
limited to, hazardous materials spills, explosions, landslides, acts of
God and fires have seriously impaired the Township of Warwick's ability
to provide all necessary municipal services.
B. The Township of Warwick contributes substantial funds to amortize
some of the cost of the emergency service providers, including, but not
limited to, special response teams and volunteer fire companies, and
the Township of Warwick owns and maintains various emergency
service, fire-fighting and rescue equipment and incurs the cost for
worker's compensation provided to volunteer fire and ambulance
members.
C. The volunteer fire companies and ambulance services serving the
Warwick Township and the Central Bucks Special Response Team
("CBSRT"), which provides special police response services in the
Township, incur significant costs to render those services.
D. In order to protect public health, safety and welfare, and to protect and
preserve public funds and tax dollars, the Township of Warwick hereby
adopts a policy of partial reimbursement of the expenses and costs
incurred in providing such service.
A. Either the Warwick Township Police Chief, on behalf of the CBSRT, the
Chief of the volunteer fire companies, or the administrative chief of any
other service provider authorized by the Township, may request and
collect all fees for fire prevention and safety protection services and for
other emergency services. Such fees may include and encompass all
costs for manpower, equipment, materials, maintenance and overhead
expenses.
B. Within 30 days of the date of providing fire prevention and protection
services or any other public safety and emergency services as
enumerated in this article, the Warwick Township Police Chief or the
chief of the appropriate volunteer fire company or other emergency
service provider shall prepare a claim for fees, which may include the
cost of reimbursing the emergency service provider for materials used
in providing the service. The claim shall be submitted to the Township
for review.
§ 73-4 CABLE TELEVISION AND VIDEO § 73-6
60:163
§ 73-6. Claims to be approved by Township.
All claims shall be reviewed by the Township Board of Supervisors or
its designee ("Board"). The Board, in its sole discretion, shall determine
whether the claim is reasonable and appropriate for submission to the
person or entity to whom services were provided. In determining whether
the claim should be submitted, the Board shall consider the severity of the
event and the amount of resources expended in providing the service; and
the likelihood of collection of the funds by the Township. The Board may
adjust or reject the claim as it, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate. The
emergency service provider shall be advised of the disposition of the claim
within 30 days of submission thereof to the Township. Claims not approved
within 30 days of submission shall be deemed denied.

jurisdiction for the collection of any amounts due hereunder, plus attorneys'
fees, and may pay for any other relief that may be appropriate, including
equitable relief.
§ 73-9. Allocation of fees.
The fees set forth in this article shall be delivered to and for the use of
the emergency service provider which was primarily responsible for the
emergency service provided. The emergency service provider in whose
district the incident occurred is entitled to the fee even if said emergency
service provider was assisted by other emergency service providers. In the
event that the incident occurs on realty that is located in more than one
district, then the fee shall be split between the appropriate emergency
service providers. In all cases, the determination of the allocation of the fees
collected shall be determined solely by Warwick Township.
A. Upon approval of the claim by the Township, the emergency service
provider may submit the claim to the person or entity to whom the
service or services were provided. All such claims shall be paid within
60 days of the receipt thereof, and interest shall accumulate thereafter
on any unpaid balance at the rate of 10% per annum until paid.
B. In addition to any fees due, any fine and penalty that results from said
claim shall also be paid, and any fees or expenses that are imposed
upon the Township of Warwick, or emergency service provider by any
local, state or federal agency which related to the same incident or
occurrence for which the services were provided may be included in the
claim or may be billed separately within 30 days of receipt of such local,
state or federal cost or fee. The person or entity to whom services were
provided shall have 30 days from receipt to reimburse the service
provider for said cost or fee.
§ 73-6 WARWICK CODE § 73-10

The fees heretofore set forth are not inclusive of all the remedies that
the Township of Warwick or its emergency service providers may pursue.

officials, employees or members have the right to pursue any other legal
remedy or to recover any other cost against any person regardless of
payment of the prescribed fees.

Floodplain Areas
§ 92-17. Identification.
§ 92-18. Description.
The identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific areas:
A. The identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific
areas:
(1) Any areas of Warwick Township, classified as special flood hazard
areas (SFHAs) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and the
accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) dated March
16, 2015, and issued by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA), or the most recent revision thereof, including all
digital data developed as part of the Flood Insurance Study.
(2) For areas abutting streams and watercourses where the base flood
elevation has not been delineated by a Flood Insurance Study, the
applicant shall submit a floodplain identification study. The study
prepared by a registered professional engineer expert in the
preparation of hydrologic and hydraulic studies shall be used to
delineate the base flood elevations. The floodplain study shall be
subject to the review and approval of Warwick Township. All areas
inundated by the base flood shall be included in the identified
floodplain area.
B. The above-referenced FIS and FIRMs, and any subsequent revisions
and amendments, are hereby adopted by Warwick Township and
declared to be a part of this chapter.
A. The Floodway District identified as floodway in the FIS and the FIRM
which represents the channel of a watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood
without any increase in the water surface elevation at any point. This
term shall also include floodway areas which have been identified in
other available studies or sources of information for those special
floodplain areas where no floodway has been identified in the FIS and
FIRM.
(1) Within any floodway area, no encroachments, including fill, new
construction, substantial improvements, or other development,
shall be permitted unless it has been demonstrated through
hydrologic and hydraulic analysis performed in accordance with
standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment
would not result in any increase in flood levels within the Township
during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
§ 92-17 FEES § 92-18
81:189
§ 92-19. Changes in identification of area.
The identified floodplain area may be revised or modified by the Board of
Supervisors where studies or information provided by a qualified agency
or person documents the need for such revision. However, prior to any
such change within the A District or AE District, approval must be obtained
from FEMA. Additionally, as soon as practicable, but not later than six
months after the date such information becomes available, the Township
shall notify FEMA of the changes by submitting technical or scientific data.
See § 92-22B for situations where FEMA notification is required.
§ 92-20. Boundary disputes.
Should a dispute concerning any identified floodplain boundary arise, an
initial determination shall be made by the Floodplain Administrator, and any
party aggrieved by this decision or determination may appeal to the Zoning
Hearing Board. The burden of proof shall be on the appellant.
(2) No new construction or development shall be allowed, unless the
appropriate permit is obtained from the Department of
Environmental Protection Regional Office.
B. The AE District shall be those areas adjacent to the floodway and
identified as an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by
FEMA for which base flood elevations have been provided.
C. The A District shall be those areas identified as an A Zone on the FIRM
included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no base flood
elevations have been provided. For these areas, elevation and floodway
information from other federal, state, or other acceptable sources shall
be used when available. Where other acceptable information is not
available, the elevation shall be determined by hydrologic and hydraulic
engineering techniques. Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be
undertaken only by professional engineers or others of demonstrated
qualifications, who shall certify that the technical methods used
correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. Studies,
analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail to
allow a thorough technical review by Warwick Township.
D. For areas adjoining streams, ponds, and lakes not included in the FIS
prepared by FEMA, the applicant shall be required to determine the
elevation and area of the floodplain with hydrologic and hydraulic
engineering techniques. Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be
undertaken only by registered professional engineers or others of
demonstrated qualifications, who shall certify that the technical
methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts.
Studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient
detail to allow a thorough technical review by the municipality. All areas
inundated by the base flood shall be included in the identified floodplain
area.

including irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or
shape, or exceptional topographical or other physical
conditions peculiar to the particular property and that the
unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions and not the
circumstances or conditions generally created by the
§ 92-32 FEES § 92-33
81:207
provisions of this chapter in the neighborhood or district in
which the property is located;
(b) That because of such physical circumstances or conditions,
there is no possibility that the property can be developed in
strict conformity with the provisions of this chapter and that
the authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to enable
the reasonable use of the property;
(c) That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
applicant;
(d) That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property
is located, nor substantially and permanently impair the
appropriate use or development of adjacent property, nor be
detrimental to the public welfare;
(e) That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance that will afford relief and will represent the least
modification of the regulation in issue;
(f) That the variance, if authorized, will not result in an
unacceptable or prohibited increase in flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary public
expense; and
(g) That the variance, if authorized, will not create nuisances,
cause fraud on, or victimize the public or conflict with any
other applicable state or local ordinances and regulations.
B. A complete record of all variance requests and related actions shall be
maintained by Warwick Township. In addition, a report of all variances
granted during the year shall be included in the annual report to FEMA.
C. Notwithstanding any of the above, however, all structures shall be
designed and constructed so as to have the capability of resisting the
one-percent-annual-chance flood.

§ 98-1. Findings and purpose.
§ 98-2. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
ABATE  To remove the graffiti by such means, in such a manner and to
such extent as the Board of Supervisors or other agent appointed by the
Board reasonably determines is necessary to remove the graffiti from public
view.
GRAFFITI  Any unauthorized inscription, word, figure, painting or other
defacement that is written, marked, etched, scratched, sprayed, drawn,
painted or engraved on or otherwise affixed to any surface of public or
private property by any graffiti implement, to the extent that the graffiti
was not authorized in advance by the owner or occupant of the property,
or, despite advance authorization, is otherwise deemed a public nuisance by
the Board.
§ 98-3. Prohibited acts.
A. The purpose and intent of this chapter is to help provide a procedure for
the prevention, prohibition and removal of graffiti from public and
private property. This order is to protect against vandalism and
deterioration and promote the health and safety of the Township. The
Township Board of Supervisors is authorized to enact this chapter
pursuant to 53 P.S. § 66506.
B. The Township Board of Supervisors finds that graffiti is a public
nuisance and destructive of the rights and values of property owners, as
well as the entire community. Graffiti is obnoxious, contributes to
neighborhood deterioration and tends to remain on private and public
property, unless it is immediately abated. The Township must act to
prevent against the spread of graffiti and to avoid the detrimental
impact on the neighborhoods and residents.
C. The Township Board of Supervisors intends, through the adoption of
this chapter, to provide additional enforcement tools to protect public
and private property from acts of vandalism and defacement. The Board
does not intend for this chapter to conflict with any existing anti-graffiti
state laws.
§ 95-19 GRAFFITI § 98-3
98:233
§ 98-4. Violations and penalties.
§ 98-5. Graffiti as nuisance.
A. It shall be unlawful for any person to apply graffiti or deface any natural
or man-made surface on any Township owned property, or without the
permission of the owner or occupant, on any private property.
B. It shall be unlawful for anyone to possess any graffiti implement while
in or upon any public facility, park, playground, swimming pool,
recreational facility, or other public building or structure owned or
operated by the Township or while within 50 feet of an underpass,
bridge abutment, storm drain, or similar types of infrastructure unless
otherwise authorized by the Township.
C. All sidewalks, walls, buildings, fences, signs and other structures or
surfaces shall be kept free from graffiti that is visible from the street or
other public or private property.
A. Fines and imprisonment. Any person violating this chapter shall be
punished by a minimum fine of $200 to a maximum of $600, or by
imprisonment in the local jail for a term not to exceed 60 days, or by
both fine and imprisonment at the discretion of the court.
(1) Minors. In the case of a minor, the parents or legal guardian shall
be jointly and severally liable with the minor for payment of all
fines.
(2) Failure of the parents or legal guardian to make payments will
result in the filing of a lien on the parents' or legal guardian's
property that includes the fine and administrative costs.
(3) Upon an application and finding of indigence, the court may decline
to order fines against the minor, parents or guardian.
B. Restitution. In addition to any punishment specified in this section, the
court shall order any violator to make restitution to the victim for
damages or loss caused directly or indirectly by the violator's offense in
the amount or manner determined by the court. In the case of a minor,
the parents or legal guardian shall be ordered jointly and severally
liable with the minor to make the restitution.
A. The existence of graffiti on public or private property in violation of this
chapter is expressly declared to be a public nuisance and, therefore, is
subject to the removal and abatement provisions specified in this
chapter.
B. It is the duty of both the owner of the property to which the graffiti has
been applied and any person who may be in possession or who has the
right to possess such property to at all times keep the property clear of
graffiti.

A. No insurance company, association or exchange (hereinafter "insurer")
doing business in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania shall pay a claim
of a named insured for fire damage to a structure located within the
Township of Warwick where the amount recoverable for the fire loss to
the structure under all policies exceeds $7,500, unless the insurer is
furnished by the Warwick Township Treasurer with a certificate
pursuant to 508(b) of the Insurance Company Law of 1921 (40 P.S.
§ 638) (the "Act"), and unless there is compliance with the procedures
set forth in 508(c) and (d) of the Act.
B. Municipal claims.
(1) Where there are delinquent taxes, assessments, penalties or user
charges against the property ("municipal claims"), or there are
expenses which the Township of Warwick has incurred as a cost for
the removal, repair or securing of a building or other structure on
the property (collectively "municipal expenses"), the Manager of
the Township of Warwick shall immediately render a bill for such
work, if he has not already done so. Upon written request of the
named insured specifying the tax description of the property, the
name and address of the insurer and the date of receipt by the
insurer of a loss report of the claim, the Treasurer shall furnish,
within 14 working days after the request, to the insurer, a
certificate (or at his discretion an oral notice confirmed in writing)
either:
(a) Stating that there are no unpaid municipal claims or municipal
expenses against the property; or
(b) Specifying the nature and amount of such claims or expenses,
accompanied by a bill for such amounts.
(2) Taxes, assessments, penalties and user charges shall be deemed
delinquent for this purpose if a lien could have been filed for such
claims under applicable law. Upon receipt of a certificate and bill
pursuant to Subsection B(1)(a) of this section, the insurer shall
transfer to the Treasurer an amount from the insurance proceeds
sufficient to pay such sums prior to making payment to the named
insured, subject to the provisions of subsection (3) hereof.
C. When all municipal claims and municipal expenses have been paid
pursuant to Subsection B(1) of this section, or where the Treasurer has
issued a certificate described in Subsection B(1)(a) indicating that
there are no municipal claims or municipal expenses against the
property, the insurer shall pay the claim of the named insured;
§ 102-1 IMPACT DISCLOSURE STATEMENT § 102-1
101:239
provided, however, that if the loss agreed upon by the named insured
and the insurer equals or exceeds 60% of the aggregate limits of
liability on all fire policies covering the building or structure, the
following procedures must be followed:
(1) The insurer shall transfer from the insurance proceeds to the
Treasurer, in the aggregate, $2,000 for each $15,000 of such claim
or fraction thereof.
(2) If, at the time a loss report is submitted by the insured, such
insured has submitted to the insurer, with a copy to the Township of
Warwick, a contractor's signed estimate of the cost of removing,
repairing or securing the building or other structure in an amount
less than the amount calculated under the foregoing transfer
formula, the insurer shall transfer to the Treasurer from the
insurance proceeds the amount specified in the estimate. If there is
more than one insurer, the transfer of proceeds shall be on a pro
rata basis by all insurers insuring the building or other structure.
(3) Upon receipt of the above-described portion of the insurance
proceeds, the Treasurer shall do the following:
(a) Place the proceeds in a separate fund to be used solely as
security against the total municipal expenses anticipated by
the Township of Warwick to be required in removing, repairing
or securing the building or structure as required by this article.
Such costs shall include, without limitation, any engineering,
legal or administrative costs incurred by the Township of

A. Inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting
from development and redevelopment throughout a watershed
increases flood flows and velocities, contributes to erosion and
sedimentation, overtaxes the carrying capacity of streams and storm
sewers, greatly increases the cost of public facilities to convey and
manage stormwater, undermines floodplain management and floodreduction
efforts in upstream and downstream communities, reduces
groundwater recharge, and threatens public health and safety.
B. Inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting
from land development and redevelopment throughout a watershed can
also harm surface water resources by changing the natural hydrologic
patterns, accelerating stream flows (which increase scour and erosion
of streambeds and streambanks, thereby elevating sedimentation),
destroying aquatic habitats, and elevating aquatic pollutant
concentrations and loadings such as sediments, nutrients, heavy
metals, and pathogens.
C. A comprehensive program of stormwater management (SWM),
including reasonable regulation of development and activities causing
accelerated runoff, is fundamental to the public health, safety, and
welfare and the protection of the people of the municipality and all the
people of the commonwealth, their resources, and the environment.
D. Stormwater is an important water resource by providing groundwater
recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams, which also
protects and maintains surface water quality. Impacts from stormwater
runoff can be minimized by using project designs that maintain the
natural hydraulic regime and sustain high water quality, groundwater
recharge, stream base flow and aquatic ecosystems. The cost-effective
and environmentally advantageous way to manage stormwater runoff is
through nonstructural project design that minimizes impervious
surfaces and sprawl, avoids sensitive areas, i.e., stream buffers,
floodplains, and steep slopes, and considers topography and soils to
maintain the natural hydrologic regime.

§ 157-3. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to promote the public health, safety, and
welfare within the Township by maintaining the natural hydrologic regime
and by minimizing the harms and maximizing the benefits described in this
chapter, through provisions designed to:
E. Public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an
essential component in successfully addressing stormwater.
F. Federal and state regulations require Warwick Township to implement
a program of stormwater controls. Warwick Township is required to
obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from its separate storm
sewer systems under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination
System (NPDES).
A. Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including
regulations at 25 Pa. Code Chapter 93, to protect, maintain, reclaim,
and restore the existing and designated uses of the waters of this
commonwealth.
B. Minimize increases in stormwater volume and control peak flows.
C. Minimize impervious surfaces.
D. Provide review procedures and performance standards for stormwater
planning and management.
E. Preserve the natural drainage systems as much as possible.
F. Manage stormwater impacts close to the runoff source, requiring a
minimum of structures and relying on natural processes.
G. Focus on infiltration of stormwater to maintain groundwater recharge,
to prevent degradation of surface and groundwater quality, and to
otherwise protect water resources.
H. Preserve and restore the flood-carrying capacity of streams.
I. Prevent scour and erosion of streambanks and streambeds.
J. Provide standards to meet National Pollution Discharge Elimination
System (NPDES) permit requirements.
K. Address certain requirements of the Municipal Separate Stormwater
Sewer System (MS4) NPDES Phase II Stormwater Regulations.
L. Provide for proper operation and maintenance of all stormwater
management facilities and best management practices (BMPs) that are
implemented in the municipality.

criteria of this chapter shall apply to the total proposed development
even if development is to take place in stages. Preparation and
implementation of an approved SWM site plan are required. No
regulated activities shall commence until the municipality issues
written approval of an SWM site plan, which demonstrates compliance
with the requirements of this chapter. The applicant shall be
responsible for the control of surface runoff entering the development
or subdivision originating from an upstream drainage area. The future,
fully developed use of undeveloped areas upstream as shown on the
approved Township Comprehensive Plan shall be taken into account in
the calculation of pipe sizes for storm sewer system designs.

the development site, as well as calculations indicating the capacity of
the receiving storm sewer or watercourse downstream of the proposed
development for the one-hundred-year storm.
B. SWM site plans approved by the Township, in accordance with Article
IV, shall be on site throughout the duration of the regulated activity.
C. The municipality may, after consultation with the Department of
Environmental Protection (PADEP), approve measures for meeting the
state water quality requirements other than those in this chapter,
provided that they meet the minimum requirements of, and do not
conflict with, state law, including but not limited to the Clean Streams
Law.75
D. For all regulated earth-disturbance activities, erosion and sediment
(E&S) control best management practices (BMPs) shall be designed,
implemented, operated, and maintained during construction to meet
the purposes and requirements of this chapter and to meet all
requirements under Title 25 of the Pennsylvania Code and the Clean

§ 157-11. Permit requirements by other governmental entities.
Approvals issued and actions taken under this chapter do not relieve the
applicant of the responsibility to secure required permits or approvals for
activities regulated by any other code, law, regulation or ordinance.
§ 157-12. Volume control.
Volume controls will mitigate increased runoff impacts, protect stream
channel morphology, maintain groundwater recharge, and contribute to
water quality improvements. Stormwater runoff volume control methods
are based on the net change in runoff volume for the two-year storm event.
Volume controls shall be implemented using the Design Storm Method in
Subsection A or the Simplified Method in Subsection B below. For regulated
activities equal to or less than one acre, this chapter establishes no
preference for either methodology; therefore, the applicant may select
either methodology on the basis of economic considerations, the intrinsic
I. Infiltration BMPs should be spread out, made as shallow as practicable,
and located to maximize the use of natural on-site infiltration features
while still meeting the other requirements of this chapter.
J. The design of all facilities over karst shall include an evaluation of
measures to minimize the risk of adverse effects.
K. Storage facilities should completely drain both the volume control and
rate control capacities over a period of time not less than 24 and not
more than 72 hours from the end of the design storm.
L. The design storm volumes to be used in the analysis of peak rates of
discharge should be obtained from the Precipitation-Frequency Atlas of
the United States, Atlas 14, Volume 2, Version 3.0, United States
Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA), National Weather Service,
Hydrometeorological Design Studies Center, Silver Spring, Maryland.
NOAA's Atlas 14 can be accessed at http://hdsc.nws.noaa.gov/hdsc/

limitations of the procedures associated with each methodology, and other
factors. All regulated activities greater than one acre must use the Design
Storm Method.
A. Design Storm Method (any regulated activity). This method requires
detailed modeling based on site conditions. For modeling assumptions,
refer to § 157-14A.
(1) Post-development total runoff should not be increased from
predevelopment total runoff for all storms equal to or less than the
two-year, twenty-four-hour-duration precipitation.
(2) The following applies in order to estimate the increased volume of
runoff for the two-year, twenty-four-hour-duration precipitation
event: To calculate the runoff volume (cubic feet) for existing site
conditions (predevelopment) and for the proposed developed site
conditions (post-development), it is recommended to use the Soil
Cover Complex Method as shown as follows. The calculated volume
shall be either reused, evapotranspired, or infiltrated through
structural or nonstructural means. Other means of calculating the
runoff volume may be used if approved in advance by the Township
Engineer.
Soil Cover Complex Method
Step 1: Runoff (in) = Q = (P - 0.2S)2/(P + 0.8S)
Where:
P = 2-year rainfall (in)
S = (1,000/CN) -10
Step 2: Runoff Volume (cubic feet) = Q x Area x 1/12
Where:
Q = Runoff (in) (from Step 1)
Area = SWM area (square feet), i.e., the square-foot area of
the regulated activity
Step 3: Required Volume = Post-development Runoff Volume 
Predevelopment Runoff Volume
Once runoff volume is calculated for the site under both existing
and proposed developed conditions, the difference between the
two site conditions is the increase in runoff volume from
predevelopment conditions to post-development conditions for the
two-year, twenty-four-hour precipitation event.
The calculated volume shall be captured, reused, evapotranspired,
or infiltrated through nonstructural or structural means.
B. Simplified Method (regulated activities less than or equal to one acre).
(1) Stormwater facilities shall capture the runoff volume from at least
the first two inches of runoff from all new impervious surfaces.
§ 157-12 WARWICK CODE § 157-12
155:338
Volume (cubic feet) = (2-inch runoff/12 inches) * Impervious
Surface (square feet)
(2) At least the first inch of runoff volume from the new impervious
surfaces shall be permanently removed from the runoff flow, i.e., it
shall not be released into the surface waters of the commonwealth.
The calculated volume shall be either reused, evapotranspired or
infiltrated through structural or nonstructural means.
Volume (cubic feet) = (1-inch runoff/12 inches) * Impervious
Surface (square feet)
(3) Infiltration facilities should be designed to accommodate the first
0.5 inch of the permanently removed runoff.
(4) No more than one inch of runoff volume from impervious surfaces
shall be released from the site. The release time must be over 24 to
72 hours.
C. Stormwater control measures. The applicant must demonstrate how the
required volume is controlled through stormwater best management
practices (BMPs), which shall provide the means necessary to capture,
reuse, evaporate, transpire or infiltrate the total runoff volume.
(1) If natural resources exist on the site, the plan shall indicate the
total acreage of protected area where no disturbance is proposed.
The acreage of the protected area should be subtracted from the
total site area and not included in the stormwater management site
area acreage used in determining the volume controls.
Stormwater Management Site Area = Total Site Area (for both
pre- and post-development conditions)  Protected Area
Natural resource areas should be calculated based upon the
municipality's own natural resource protection ordinance. If no
ordinance exists, see Table B-2 in Appendix B79 for guidance to
assess the total protected area. For additional reference, see
Chapter 5, Section 5.4.1, of the Pennsylvania BMP Manual.
(2) Calculate the volume controls provided through nonstructural
BMPs. Table B-5 in Appendix B is recommended as guidance.80
(3) Volume controls provided through nonstructural BMPs should be
subtracted from the required volume to determine the necessary
structural BMPs.

(4) Calculate the volume controls provided through structural BMPs.
Table B-6 in Appendix B is recommended as guidance.81 See the
Pennsylvania BMP Manual, Chapter 6, for a description of the
BMPs.
(5) Infiltration BMPs intended to receive runoff from developed areas
shall be selected based on the suitability of soils and site conditions
(see Table B-6 in Appendix B for a list of Infiltration BMPs82).
Infiltration BMPs shall be constructed on soils that have the
following characteristics:
(a) A minimum soil depth of 24 inches between the bottom of the
infiltration BMPs and the top of bedrock or seasonally high
water table.
(b) An infiltration rate sufficient to accept the additional
stormwater load and dewater completely as determined by
field tests. A minimum of 0.2 inch per hour should be utilized,
and for acceptable rates a safety factor of 50% should be
applied for design purposes (e.g., for soil which measured 0.4
inch per hour, the BMP design should use 0.2 inch per hour to
ensure safe infiltration rates after construction).
(c) All open-air infiltration facilities shall be designed to
completely infiltrate runoff volume within three days (72
hours) from the start of the design storm. Subsurface systems
shall be designed to infiltrate the stored volume in 48 hours or
less with a minimum infiltration rate and percolation rate of
greater than 0.2 inch per hour.
(6) Soils. A soils evaluation of the project site shall be required to
determine the suitability of infiltration facilities. All regulated
activities are required to perform a detailed soils evaluation by a
qualified design professional which, at a minimum, addresses soil
permeability, depth to bedrock, and subgrade stability. The general
process for designing the infiltration BMP shall be:
(a) Analyze hydrologic soil groups as well as natural and manmade
features within the site to determine general areas of
suitability for infiltration practices. In areas where
development on fill material is under consideration, conduct
geotechnical investigations of subgrade stability; infiltration
may not be ruled out without conducting these tests.
(b) Provide field tests such as double-ring infiltrometer or
hydraulic conductivity tests (at the level of the proposed
infiltration surface) to determine the appropriate hydraulic
conductivity rate. Percolation tests are not recommended for

hydrologic modeling of the Neshaminy Creek Watershed.
design purposes. The Township Engineer shall observe all field
testing of soils.
(c) Design the infiltration structure based on field-determined
capacity at the level of the proposed infiltration surface and
based on the safety factor of 50%.
(d) If on-lot infiltration structures are proposed, it must be
demonstrated to the municipality that the soils are conducive
to infiltrate on the lots identified.
(e) An impermeable liner will be required in detention basins
where the possibility of groundwater contamination exists. A
detailed hydrogeologic investigation may be required by the
municipality.
A. Standards for managing runoff from each subarea in the Neshaminy
Creek Watershed for the two-, five-, ten-, twenty-five-, fifty-, and onehundred-
year design storms are shown in Table 157-13. Development
sites located in each of the management districts must control the
proposed development conditions' runoff rates to existing conditions'
runoff rates for the design storms in accordance with Table 157-13.

B. General. Proposed conditions' rates of runoff from any regulated
activity shall not exceed the peak release rates of runoff from existing
conditions for the design storms specified on the Stormwater
Management District Watershed Map (Appendix D)83 and in this section
of this chapter.
C. District boundaries. The boundaries of the stormwater management
districts are shown on official maps and are available for inspection at
the Municipal Office and County Planning Offices. A copy of the map at
a reduced scale, and four other maps with zoomed-in extents, are
included in Appendix D.84 The exact location of the stormwater
management district boundaries as they apply to a given development
site shall be determined by mapping the boundaries using the two-foot
topographic contours (or most-accurate data required) provided as part
of the SWM site plan.
D. Sites located in more than one district. For a proposed development site
located within two or more stormwater management district category
subareas, the peak discharge rate from any subarea shall meet the
management district criteria for the district in which the discharge is
located.
E. Off-site areas. When calculating the allowable peak runoff rates,
developers do not have to account for runoff draining into the subject
development site from an off-site area. On-site drainage facilities shall

be designed to safely convey off-site flows through the development
site.
F. Site areas. The stormwater management site area is the only area
subject to the management district criteria. Nonimpacted areas or
nonregulated activities bypassing the stormwater management
facilities would not be subject to the management district criteria.
G. Alternate criteria for redevelopment sites. For redevelopment sites, one
of the following minimum design parameters shall be accomplished,
whichever is most appropriate for the given site conditions, as
determined by the Township:
(1) Meet the full requirements specified by Table 157-13 and § 157-13A
through F; or
(2) Reduce the total impervious surface on the site by at least 20%
based upon a comparison of existing impervious surface to
proposed impervious surface.
A. The following criteria shall be used for runoff calculations:
(1) For development sites not considered redevelopment, the ground
cover used to determine the existing conditions' runoff volume and
flow rate shall be as follows:
(a) Wooded sites shall use a ground cover of "woods in good
condition."
(b) The undeveloped portion of the site, including agriculture,
bare earth, and fallow ground, shall be considered as "meadow
in good condition," unless the natural ground cover generates
a lower curve number (CN) or Rational "C" value (i.e., woods)
as listed in Table B-4 or B-7 in Appendix B of this chapter.85
(2) For development and redevelopment sites, the ground cover used
to determine the existing conditions' runoff volume and flow rate
for the developed portion of the site shall be based upon actual land
cover conditions. If the developed site contains impervious
surfaces, 20% of the impervious surface area shall be considered
meadow in the model for existing conditions.
B. Stormwater runoff peak discharges from all development sites with a
drainage area equal to or greater than 25 acres shall be calculated
using a generally accepted calculation technique that is based on the
NRCS Soil Cover Complex Method. Table 157-14 summarizes
acceptable computation methods. The method selected by the design
professional shall be based on the individual limitations and suitability

of each method for a particular site. The municipality may allow the
use of the Rational Method (Q=CIA) to estimate peak discharges from
drainage areas that contain less than 25 acres.
Q = Peak flow rate, in cubic feet per second (cfs)
C = Runoff coefficient, dependent on land use/cover
I = Design rainfall intensity, in inches per hour
A = Drainage area, in acres
C. All calculations consistent with this chapter using the Soil Cover
Complex Method shall use the appropriate design rainfall depths for the
various return-period storms according to the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Atlas 14 rain data corresponding
to the Doylestown rain gage, seen in Table B-1 in Appendix B.86 The SCS
Type II rainfall curve from NOAA is found on Figure B-1 in Appendix B.
This data may also be directly retrieved from the NOAA Atlas 14
website: hdsc.nws.noaa.gov/hdsc/pfds/orb/pa_pfds.html. If a hydrologic
computer model such as PSRM or HEC-1/HEC-HMS is used for
stormwater runoff calculations, then the duration of rainfall shall be 24
hours.

D. All calculations using the Rational Method shall use rainfall intensities
consistent with appropriate times-of-concentration for overland flow
and return periods from NOAA Atlas 14, Volume 2, Version 2.1. Timesof-
concentration for overland flow shall be calculated using the
methodology presented in Chapter 3 of Urban Hydrology for Small
Watersheds, NRCS, TR-55 (as amended or replaced from time to time
by NRCS). Times-of-concentration for channel and pipe flow shall be
computed using Manning's equation.
E. Runoff Curve Numbers (CN) for both existing and proposed conditions
to be used in the Soil Cover Complex Method shall be based on Table
B-4 in Appendix B.87
F. Runoff coefficients (C) for both existing and proposed conditions for use
in the Rational Method shall be consistent with Table B-7 in Appendix

G. Runoff from proposed sites graded to the subsoil will not have the same
runoff conditions as the site under existing conditions because of soil
compaction, even after topsoiling or seeding. The proposed condition
"CN" or "C" shall increase by 5% to better reflect proposed soil
conditions.
H. The Manning Equation is preferred for one-dimensional, gradually
varied, open-channel flow. In other cases, appropriate, applicable
methods should be applied; however, early coordination with the
municipality is necessary.
I. Outlet structures for stormwater management facilities shall be
designed to meet the performance standards of this chapter using the

J. The design of any stormwater detention facilities intended to meet the
performance standards of this chapter shall be verified by routing the
design storm hydrograph through these facilities using the Storage-
Indication Method. For drainage areas greater than 200 acres in size,
the design storm hydrograph shall be computed using a calculation
method that produces a full hydrograph. The municipality may approve
the use of any generally accepted full-hydrograph approximation
technique that shall use a total runoff volume that is consistent with the
volume from a method that produces a full hydrograph.
A. Hot spots.
(1) The use of infiltration BMPs is prohibited on hot spot land use
areas. Examples of hot spots are listed in Appendix G.88
(2) Stormwater runoff from hot spot land uses shall be pretreated. In
no case may the same BMP be employed consecutively to meet this
requirement. Guidance regarding acceptable methods of
pretreatment is located in Appendix G.
A. General provisions.
(1) A storm sewer system and all appurtenances shall be required to be
constructed by the applicant in any area from which the surface or
subsurface drainage could impair public safety or cause physical
damage to adjacent lands or public property. The system(s) shall be
designed to collect water at any point where three cubic feet per
second is accumulated, at the bottom of all vertical grades and
immediately upgrade from all street intersections. The system(s)
shall discharge to the nearest practical natural drainage channel or
storm system.
(2) When required, storm drains and appurtenances shall be
constructed by the developer to take surface water from the bottom
of vertical grades, to lead water away from springs, and to avoid
excessive use of cross-cutters at street intersections and
elsewhere.
(a) Open watercourses are encouraged where they exist naturally
and where, in the opinion of the Township Engineer, they will
not interfere with public convenience or safety but in fact will
provide comparable or superior drainage. Where necessary,
stream corridor improvements, including rock stabilization and
88.Editor's Note: Appendix G is included at the end of this chapter.
§ 157-14 WARWICK CODE § 157-16
155:346
gabions, shall be performed. Naturalized or "bioengineering"
methods of stabilization are preferred.
(b) Design of storm drainage facilities shall be prepared in
accordance with accepted engineering practices, subject to
approval by the Township Engineer.
(c) Any necessary corrective measures deemed appropriate by the
Board of Supervisors to alleviate any off-site drainage problem
affected by the subdivision or land development must be
undertaken by the developer. The costs for such measures will
be borne entirely by the developer.
(d) The developer may be required to participate in off-site storm
drainage improvements in the watershed within which the
proposed development is located. The specific off-site drainage
improvements required shall be those specified by the
Township Board of Supervisors.
(3) Storm sewer or drainage easements:
(a) Easements shall be a minimum of 20 feet in width and shall be
provided in undedicated land to accommodate required storm
sewer facilities and drainage swales. Such easements shall be
offered for dedication to Warwick Township and shall be
provided where storm sewers, drainage swales, culverts, or
other structures traverse, enter or discharge onto private
property. On private property, the owner shall maintain ground
cover and landscaping within the easement. The Township
shall not maintain and/or repair any improvements within that
easement unless stormwater runoff from public roads or public
lands crosses through the easement. If stormwater runoff from
public roads or public lands crosses through the easement, the
Township shall, upon satisfactory installation of improvements
as specified in a land development agreement with Warwick
Township, maintain and repair only the structural
improvements within the easement, if any, such as piping,
inlets, stormwater manholes, headwalls/endwalls, and energydissipation
structures or facilities. Warwick Township will not
be responsible for any other repair/maintenance, vermin
control, removal of obstructions from drainage swales, removal
of accumulated sediment or vegetation from drainage swales,
removal of litter or garbage, repair of erosion, and restoration
of vegetation/ground cover.
(b) The record plan and development approved agreement for the
approved land development shall define easement ownership,
maintenance responsibilities, and access. Specifically, the
record plan shall contain a provision permitting access to such
easement(s), at any reasonable time, for inspection and/or
emergency repair/maintenance, by Warwick Township or its
§ 157-16 SPEED-TIMING DEVICES § 157-16
155:347
designee, of all facilities deemed critical to public welfare. In
the event that the lot owner or homeowners' association fails
to honor their maintenance responsibilities set forth herein, in
any manner, Warwick Township shall have the right of entry
upon and within the area of the easement to undertake any
required corrective or maintenance effort. The total cost of
such, including administrative, engineering, and legal costs
for enforcement, may be imposed upon the responsible party
as determined by Warwick Township. Failure to remedy all
associated costs described above may be subject of the
imposition of a lien by the Township against the owner(s) in
question, in the same manner as the Township might otherwise
be empowered by law to assess or impose a lien against a
property for municipal improvements. The record plan size
shall meet the requirements for recording at the office of the
Recorder of Deeds of Bucks County.
(4) Also see the Warwick Township Subdivision and Land Development
Ordinance, § 163-67, for additional storm sewer, detention basin
and erosion control requirements.
B. Design criteria.
(1) Open channels and swales.
(a) Open channels should have a triangular or trapezoidal cross
section in compliance with accepted engineering practices.
(b) Existing stream channels should be maintained in their natural
state. Only under unusual circumstances will it be permitted to
line, straighten, or relocate an existing stream, with approval
of the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) and the
Bucks County Conservation District.
(c) Permissible channel velocities, slopes, and cover shall be in
accordance with the Natural Resources Conservation Service
Engineering Field Manual, Chapter 7, Grassed Waterways and
Outlets.
(d) Acceptable energy-dissipation devices shall be installed to
bring discharge velocities down to limits specified in the DEP
Erosion and Sediment Pollution Control Program Manual,
latest edition.
(e) Riprap and/or gabions may be required by the Township
Engineer where erosion potential is great.
(f) Swales and open channels shall be designed to convey the onehundred-
year storm event. Capacity shall be determined by
Manning's Equation.
§ 157-16 WARWICK CODE § 157-16
155:348
(g) Curbed sections. The maximum encroachment of runoff on the
roadway pavement shall not exceed 1/2 of the traveled lane
during a one-hundred-year design storm of five minute's
duration. Inlets shall be provided to control the encroachment
of water on the traveled lane.
(h) On-lot drainage swales shall be designed to provide positive
conveyance of surface water from the individual lot. Each
swale lot shall convey stormwater from the lot to a storm sewer
system, street, open space area, or stormwater management
easement without crossing or combining with stormwater from
more than the adjacent lot.
(i) Whenever swales are necessary, they shall be centered on a
property line and at a location approved by the Township
Engineer.
(j) Vegetated swales proposed to satisfy water quality
requirements shall be designed to be consistent with the
following:
[1] The maximum flow velocity in the grass swale for runoff
from the water quality design storm (one-year, twentyfour-
hour) shall not exceed 1.5 feet per second (fps).
[2] The average slope of the swale shall not exceed 4%, unless
the swale is designed and protected to provide adequate
erosion control.
(k) The maximum velocity of flow, as determined by Manning's
Equation, shall not exceed the allowable velocities as shown in
the following table for the specific type of material, unless
otherwise approved by the Township Engineer and the Bucks
County Conservation District or as otherwise updated in the
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, Bureau
of Soil and Water Conservation publication, Erosion and

(2) Storm sewer design.
(a) Design flow rate.
[1] The storm drain collection system shall be designed to
carry a one-hundred-year peak flow rate. In addition, the
interior street and storm drain system should be designed
in such a manner to control runoff in excess of the onehundred-
year peak inflow rate by directing the excess
runoff through the use of proper grading techniques and
permanent stormwater runoff control structures into
drainage channels or detention basins. The peak flow rate
shall be determined by the Rational Method formula:
Q = CIA
Where:
Q = Peak runoff rate, measured in cubic feet per
second (cfs)
C = Runoff coefficient
I = Intensity (average rainfall intensity, in inches
per hour)
A = Area (drainage area, in acres)
[2] Appropriate values for the rainfall intensity can be found
in the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation Design
Manual, Part 2. Appropriate values for the runoff
coefficient shall be as presented in Table B-7 in Appendix
B.89
[3] More-specific runoff coefficients, as stated in Pennsylvania
Department of Transportation Deign Manual, Part 2, or as
stated in the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Protection publication, Recommended Hydrologic

§ 157-16 WARWICK CODE § 157-16
155:350
Procedures for Computing Urban Runoff from Small
Watersheds in Pennsylvania, may be used upon
consultation with the Township Engineer.
(b) Consideration shall be given to future land use changes in the
drainage area in selecting the "C" coefficient. For drainage
areas containing several different types of ground cover, a
weighted value of "C" shall be used. In no case shall a weighted
value of "C" be less than 0.45 for an area to be changed from its
natural state.
(c) In determining the peak flow rate to individual storm sewer
inlets (or other collection structures), the time-ofconcentration
method shall be used for inlet drainage areas in
excess of 1.25 acres, unless otherwise specified by the
Township Engineer, and a five-minute time of concentration
shall be used for all other drainage areas, unless otherwise
approved by the Township Engineer.
(d) In determining the required design flow rate through a storm
sewer piping system, a five-minute time of concentration shall
be used if the five-minute time of concentration does not result
in a maximum expected discharge that exceeds the capacity of
a thirty-inch-diameter pipe (or equivalent flow area of 4.9
square feet).
(e) In determining the required design flow rate through a storm
sewer piping system, if a five-minute time of concentration
results in a pipe size exceeding a thirty-inch-diameter pipe (or
equivalent flow area of 4.9 square feet), the calculated time of
concentration shall be used in determining storm duration.
(f) All pipes shall, at a minimum, provide required carrying
capacity as determined by the United States Department of
Commerce, Hydraulic Design Series No. 5, Hydraulic Design of
Highway Culverts. Where pressure flow is anticipated in storm
sewer pipes (non-open-channel flow), the designer shall be
required to calculate the elevation of the hydraulic grade line
through the storm sewer system.
(g) All pipe and structures utilized for the storm sewer system
shall conform to the design standards of Pennsylvania
Department of Transportation (PennDOT) Publications 408 and
72M (Road Construction Standards), as amended. All inlet
grates shall be "bicycle safe" structural steel.
(h) Pipe requirements.
[1] The minimum diameter of all storm sewer piping shall be
18 inches (or other with an equivalent flow area of 1.76
square feet), including detention basin barrel pipes. Piping
shall be laid on a four-inch-minimum bed of PennDOT Type
§ 157-16 SPEED-TIMING DEVICES § 157-16
155:351
2A coarse aggregate and shall be designed with a slope
not less than 0.50%. All storm drains located within the
right-of-way of a street shall be protected by a cover of
at least 18 inches. No pipe shall exceed a slope that will
permit full-flow velocity in excess of 15 feet per second.
Cover over HDPE and corrugated metal pipe (CMP) shall
be as per manufacturer's specifications, but not less than
12 inches.
[2] Storm sewer piping shall be reinforced concrete pipe
(RCP); however, in areas that are not to be dedicated for
public use, smooth-bore, high-density corrugated
polyethylene (HDPE) or aluminum corrugated pipe may be
permitted as approved by the Township Engineer. All
outlet pipes through detention basin and retention basin
berms shall be reinforced concrete pipe with watertight Oring
joints (O-ring RCP).
[3] Stormwater runoff shall not be permitted to surcharge
from the storm sewer structures for the required design
storm. Hydraulic grade line calculations should be
submitted to confirm compliance.
[4] Curved pipe sections shall not be permitted. This includes
horizontal deflections exceeding 1°.
(3) Manholes.
(a) Storm sewer manholes shall be spaced as necessitated by the
proposed piping alignment; however, in no case shall manhole
spacing exceed 450 feet. Manholes shall be located at all
abrupt changes of grade, at all locations where a transition in
pipe sizing is required and at all points of convergence of two
or more storm sewer mains, where inlets are not warranted.
(b) Manhole castings and covers shall conform to the
requirements of Pennsylvania Department of Transportation
Publications 72M and 408, as amended. Manhole covers shall
have the word "STORM" cast in two-inch-high letters on the
top of the cover.
(4) Inlets.
(a) Storm sewer inlet spacing shall not exceed 250 feet, except
between inlets connected by pipe with a diameter of 48 inches
or greater, where spacing shall then not exceed 450 feet. Inlets
shall be located at all abrupt changes of grade, at all locations
where a transition in pipe sizing is required and at all points of
convergence of two or more storm sewer mains.
(b) At street intersections, inlets shall be placed in the tangent and
not in the curved portion of the curbing. The gutter adjacent to
§ 157-16 WARWICK CODE § 157-16
155:352
and immediately upgrade from the inlet shall be so warped as
to direct the water into the inlet. Inlets shall be required on
the upslope side of all approaches to an intersection when the
design flow rate is in excess of 1.0 cfs.
(c) The crowns of all pipes tying into an inlet or manhole shall be
set at equal elevations when pipe inverts are within 12 inches
(vertical separation) of each other. A minimum of two inches
shall be provided between the inlet pipe invert elevation and
the invert elevation of the outlet pipe.
(d) The capacity of inlets shall be based on a maximum surface
flow to the inlet of three cfs. The maximum flow to inlets
located in low points of paved areas (vertical curves) shall
include the overland flow directed to the inlet, as well as the
cumulative bypass surface runoff from the inlets upstream. The
bypass runoff from each upstream inlet shall be calculated
using inlet efficiently curves found in the Pennsylvania
Department of Transportation Design Manual, Part 2, latest
revision. An inlet at a low point of a paved area maybe
designed to accept a maximum of five cubic feet per second
(cfs). Type M inlets shall be designed to accept a maximum of
six cfs, unless otherwise approved by the Township Engineer.
(e) Inlet spacing in paved areas shall be arranged so that a
minimum of 95% of the gutter flow tributary to the inlet will be
captured. The designer shall be required to verify that bypass
surface runoff from the one-hundred-year design storm will
enter the storm sewer piping system at some point prior to
discharge into a detention basin or other approved outlet
point. Inlet capacity shall be based on inlet efficiency curves
provided in the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation
Design Manual, Part 2.
(f) All inlets shall be stenciled by the developer to indicate that
"No Dumping Allowed  This inlet flows to . . . Creek," or other
approved wording by Warwick Township. Specifications for
stenciling are to be provided by Warwick Township.
(5) Headwalls and endwalls.
(a) An endwall shall be provided at the end of all pipe runs.
Headwalls shall be provided at the beginning of all pipe runs.
Headwalls/endwalls with a height greater than three feet may
be required to have a safety fence or guiderail if determined by
the Township Engineer. Rock aprons (riprap) or other approved
velocity-dissipation devices shall be placed at all pipe outlets
(endwalls) to reduce flow velocity and prevent erosion.
(b) All headwalls and endwalls shall be stenciled by the developer
to indicate that "No Dumping Allowed  This inlet flows to . . .
Creek," or other approved wording by Warwick Township.
§ 157-16 SPEED-TIMING DEVICES § 157-16
155:353
Specifications for stenciling are to be provided by Warwick
Township.
(6) Bridges, culverts, and drainage channels.
(a) Bridges and culverts shall be designed and constructed to
meet current Pennsylvania Department of Transportation
construction and loading standards (HS-25 loading standards).
They shall be constructed to the full width of the right-of-way
or to an adequate dimension to accommodate special grade
conditions. Approval of the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection is required for all improvements in
and along all waters of the commonwealth. The applicant shall
provide verification of Department of Environmental
Protection approval for all such proposed bridges and culverts.
(b) Approval of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Protection is required for all improvements in and along waters
of the commonwealth. Where applicable, stormwater
management facilities or programs shall comply with the
requirements of Chapter 102 (Erosion Control), Chapter 105
(Dam Safety and Waterway Management), and Chapter 106
(Floodplain Management) of Pennsylvania Code, Title 25,
Rules and Regulations of the Department of Environmental
Protection.
(c) All bridges, culverts and drainage channels shall be designed
to convey a flow rate equal to a one-hundred-year, twenty-fourhour
storm, as defined by the United States Department of
Agriculture, Soil Conversation Services, Technical Release No.
55. All bridges and culverts shall be designed to pass the onehundred-
year design storm without increasing the extent and
depth of the one-hundred-year floodplain.
(d) The capacity of all culverts and drainage channels shall, as a
minimum, provide the required carrying capacity. Capacity and
stabilization shall be as determined by the United States
Department of Transportation, Federal Highway
Administration, Hydraulic Design Series No. 5, Hydraulic
Charts for the Selection of Highway Culverts; United States
Department of Transportation, Federal Highway
Administration, Hydraulic Engineering Circular No. 15, Design
of Roadside Channels with Flexible Linings, as amended;
Federal Highway Administration, Hydraulic Engineering
Circular No. 13, Hydraulic Design for Improved Inlets for
Culverts; United States Department of Transportation, Design
of Roadside Channels with Flexible Linings, as amended; and

2011-10]
§ 157-16 WARWICK CODE § 157-16
155:354
(e) Drainage channels shall be designed to convey the design
discharge at a stable, nonerosive velocity. Channel linings that
are assumed in the design must be established before the
channel is utilized for its stated objective. Diversions or
alternate channel linings may be necessary to provide channel
conditions in the field to match design assumptions. Where
storm sewers discharge into existing drainage channels at an
angle greater than 30° from parallel with the downstream
channel flow, the far side bank shall be stabilized by the use of
riprap or masonry and/or concrete walls. The stabilization shall
be designed to prevent erosion and frost heave under and
behind the stabilizing media.
(f) Maximum channel velocities for vegetated and rock-lined
channels shall be as set forth in the Pennsylvania Department
of Environmental Protection, Bureau of Soil and Water
Conversation publication, Erosion and Sediment Control
Program Manual, latest revision.
(g) Any vegetated drainage channel requiring mowing of the
vegetation shall have a maximum grade of four horizontal to
one vertical (4:1 or 25%) on those areas to be mowed.
(7) Stormwater detention/retention basins.
(a) Calculation methodology shall be utilized as noted in this
chapter.
(b) Detention areas shall be designed so that the total rate of
runoff from the entire site, after complete development, will
not exceed the specified percentage of total predeveloped
runoff rate form the entire site. Individual points of
concentrated runoff discharge from the site may be designed
for up to a 100% release rate so long as the total runoff from
the entire site, after development, is controlled to the
applicable release rate.
(c) Discharge piping from detention areas shall be designed to
control the rate of runoff for a one-year through one-hundredyear-
frequency design storm.
(d) If permanent ponds (retention basin) are proposed, the
developer shall demonstrate that such ponds are designed to
protect the public's health and safety.
(e) Ownership and maintenance of detention or retention basin
easements. Prior to the grant of final approval of any
subdivision or land development, the owner and developer of
the property which is the subject of the subdivision or land
development shall execute agreements, in a form satisfactory
to the Township, which state that all stormwater management
facilities, including detention or retention basins, will be
§ 157-16 SPEED-TIMING DEVICES § 157-16
155:355
properly maintained. If all or a portion of the facilities are on a
property which will be conveyed to an individual, homeowners'
association or any other eventual owner, the guaranties must
be in such a form that they will carry through to the new
owners. Warwick Township will not accept dedication
maintenance responsibilities for any detention or retention
basin or similar facility located on private grounds, unless
otherwise approved by the Board of Supervisors. [Amended
10-17-2011 by Ord. No. 2011-10]
[1] When a private entity (homeowners' association) retains
ownership of any stormwater management facility, such
entity shall be responsible for maintenance of the facility.
In such case, approval of the stormwater management
facility plans shall be conditioned upon the private entity
agreeing to be responsible for all maintenance of the
stormwater management facility. This agreement shall be
in writing, shall be in recordable form and shall contain a
provision permitting access to such facilities deemed
critical to the public welfare for inspection at any
reasonable time by Warwick Township or its designee.
[2] When any stormwater management facility is located on
an individual lot, and when maintenance thereof is the
responsibility of that landowner, a description of the
facility or systems and terms of the required maintenance
shall be incorporated on a plat of the property. The plat
shall be recorded with the Bucks County Recorder of
Deeds within 90 days following Township approval. The
plat of the property shall also contain a provision
permitting access to such facilities deemed critical to
public welfare for inspection at any reasonable time by
Warwick Township or its designee.
[3] Upon presentation of proper credentials, duly authorized
representatives of Warwick Township may enter at any
reasonable time upon any property within the Township to
investigate or to ascertain the condition of the subject
property.
[4] The failure of any person, individual lot owner or private
entity to properly maintain any stormwater management
facility shall be construed to be a violation of this section
and is declared to be a public nuisance, subjecting the
violator to any and all penalties provided by law.
Specifically, in the event that the entity responsible for
maintenance fails to honor those responsibilities set forth
herein, in any manner, Warwick Township shall have the
right of entry upon the area of such facilities to undertake
any required corrective or maintenance effort. The total
cost of such, including administrative, engineering, and
§ 157-16 WARWICK CODE § 157-16
155:356
legal costs for enforcement, may be imposed upon the
responsible party as determined by Warwick Township.
Failure to remedy all associated costs described above
may be subject to the imposition of a lien by the Township
against the owner(s) in question, in the same manner as
the Township might otherwise be empowered by law to
assess or impose a lien against a property for municipal
improvements.
(f) When basins are provided, they shall be designed to utilize the
natural contours of the land whenever possible. When such
design is not practical, the construction of the basin shall
utilize slopes as flat as possible to blend the structure into the
terrain. Detention basins shall be designed to facilitate regular
maintenance, mowing and periodic desilting and reseeding. In
residential developments, shallow, broad basins shall be
provided for recreational use. The maximum depth of the onehundred-
year water surface in a detention basin shall be five
feet.
(g) Except with the one-year design storm, permanent detention
basins shall be designed so that they return to normal
conditions within approximately 24 hours after the termination
of the storm, unless the Township Engineer finds that
downstream conditions may warrant other design criteria for
stormwater release.
(h) Detention basins shall not be located on more than one lot.
(i) Basins shall not be located within floodplains.
(j) Landscaping and grading of detention basins. All landscaping
and grading of detention basins shall be in accordance with the

[d] Other methods approved by the Township.
§ 157-16 SPEED-TIMING DEVICES § 157-16
155:357
[2] The portion of the basin which will be wet most of the time
shall be landscaped in a combination of the following.
Plantings and/or seed mixes shall be as listed in the Army
Corps of Engineers Wetlands Manual as FACW or FAC
plants, or the Pennsylvania Stormwater Best Management
Practices Manual, as amended.
[a] Naturalized grasses, switchgrass or approved equal.
[b] Wildflower seed mix.
[c] FACW wetland meadow mix.
[d] Live plugs.
[e] Other methods approved by the Township.
(k) If a stormwater management basin will serve as a temporary
sediment control device, the temporary sediment control
measures shall be shown, including perforated riser pipes or
standboxes, filter berms, cleanout stakes and other measures
as may be required by Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection Chapter 102 regulations.
Sedimentation basins shall be installed and functional prior to
any earthmoving activities within their tributary drainage
areas. A perforated riser, sized in accordance with Bucks
County Conservation District requirements, shall be provided
at each basin outlet structure for sediment control. Risers shall
not be removed until such time as the entire area tributary to
the basin has been permanently stabilized and until approved
by the Bucks County Conservation District and/or the Township
Engineer.
(l) Stormwater management basins shall be in place before the
creation of any additional impervious surfaces on the site.
Runoff shall not be directed to an infiltration structure until all
tributary drainage areas are stabilized.
(m) Where permanent retention (pond) facilities are proposed,
there shall be a safety ledge, three feet wide at the maximum
water surface level. If the pond is to be stocked, the
Pennsylvania Fish and Game Commission shall approve the
stocking plan.
(n) All basin berms shall have slopes of four horizontal to one
vertical (4:1), or less. The top or toe of any slope shall be
located a minimum of five feet from any property line.
(o) Basin embankment. The fill material shall be taken from
selected borrow areas. It shall be free of roots, woody
vegetation, oversized stones, rocks or other objectionable
material. Areas on which fill is to be placed shall be scarified
§ 157-16 WARWICK CODE § 157-16
155:358
prior to placement of fill. The fill material should contain
sufficient moisture so that it can be formed by hand into a ball
without crumbling. If water can be squeezed out of the ball, it
is too wet for proper compaction. Fill material shall be placed
with lifts not exceeding one foot and shall be continuous over
the entire length of the fill. Fill material must be compacted to
a minimum of 95% of modified proctor density as established
by ASTM D-1557. Compaction testing by a certified soils
engineer/geologist must be completed as directed by the
Township Engineer to verify that adequate compaction has
been achieved.
(p) Emergency overflow facilities/spillway shall be provided with
basins in order to convey basin inflow in excess of design flows,
out of the basin, or in the event the outlet structure becomes
blocked and is unable to convey flow. Emergency spillways
discharging over embankments shall be lined. Lining for
emergency spillways shall incorporate native colors and
materials where possible. The lining shall extend to the toe of
the embankment on the outside of the berm and shall extend to
an elevation of three feet below the spillway crest on the inside
of the berm. Vegetated spillways may be utilized for spillways
constructed entirely on undisturbed ground if the designer can
demonstrate that flow velocities through the spillway will not
cause erosion of the spillway. A dense cover of vegetation shall
be rapidly established in such spillways by sodding or seeding
with geotextile anchor. Such a vegetated spillway must be
stabilized before runoff is directed to the basin. All spillway
velocities shall be based upon flows during an assumed
clogged primary outlet condition. The minimum capacity of all
emergency spillways shall be equivalent to the peak flow rate
of the one-hundred-year, post-development design storm with
the primary outlet structure blocked.
(q) For all permanent detention basins, the permanent outlet
control structure shall be a Type M inlet, grate and box, or
similar structure as approved by the Township Engineer. The
inlet grate elevation shall be at least six inches below the
emergency spillway elevation.
(r) The minimum top-of-basin berm width shall be 10 feet. A cutoff
trench (keyway) of impervious material shall be provided
under all embankments that require fill material. The cutoff
trench shall be a minimum of eight feet wide, two feet deep
below virgin ground and have side slopes of one horizontal to
one vertical.
(s) The minimum freeboard through the emergency spillway shall
be one foot. "Freeboard" is defined as the difference between
the design flow elevation through the spillway and the
elevation of the top of the settled basin berm. In addition, there
§ 157-16 SPEED-TIMING DEVICES § 157-16
155:359
shall be one foot of freeboard provided between the onehundred-
year routed water surface elevation and the invert of
the emergency spillway.
(t) Anti-seep collars shall be installed around the pipe barrel and
shall be centered within the normal saturation zone of the
berm. The anti-seep collars shall be cast-in-place and extend a
minimum of two feet beyond the outside of the principal pipe
barrel. Precast collars may be permitted only when approved
by the Township Engineer. A minimum of two collars shall be
installed on each outlet pipe.
(u) Energy-dissipating devices (rock lining/riprap) shall be
provided at all basin outlets and shall be sized in accordance
with the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection
Erosion and Sediment Control Program Manual, latest
revision.
(v) An access easement (minimum 20 feet in width) and stabilized
drive to stormwater detention facilities shall be provided for
maintenance and operation. Proximity of detention facilities to
the public right-of-way shall be encouraged in order to
minimize the length of accessways. Multiple accesses shall be
encouraged for major facilities. Accessways to basins shall be a
minimum of 12 feet in width and be no steeper in slope than 12
feet horizontal to one foot vertical. In addition, depressed curb
shall be provided where the accessway enters a street/
driveway. The stabilized driveway shall extend from the bottom
of the interior basin berm embankment to the point of access to
the basin. The access easement shall be owned and maintained
by the individual lot owner(s) or a homeowners' association but
shall be established to permit access by Warwick Township or
its designee for emergency inspection and/or maintenance at
any reasonable time.
(w) The minimum distance between a proposed basin discharge
point and a downstream property boundary shall be 50 feet.
(x) Inlet structures and outlet structures shall be separated to the
greatest extent possible in order to maximize the flow path
through the basin.
(8) Underground detention basins and infiltration facilities.
Underground detention basins and infiltration facilities shall meet
the following minimum design standards:
(a) A minimum of one foot of freeboard shall be provided between
the one-hundred-year water surface elevation and the top of all
inlet grates or manhole rims.
(b) Inlets or storm manhole structures with steps shall be located
at each corner of the underground detention basin to provide
§ 157-16 WARWICK CODE § 157-16
155:360
access for maintenance. If the pipe diameter is less than 24
inches, cleanout ports shall be provided at appropriate
locations to permit flushing of the system as necessary.
(c) The infiltration system shall be set back at least 15 feet from all
structures with subgrade elements (i.e., basements) and
outside all public rights-of-way.
(d) Infiltration rates shall not be used in computing the storage
volume of the infiltration system.
(e) Surface inflows shall be designed to prevent direct discharge
of sediment. Accordingly, pretreatment shall be provided prior
to infiltration.
(f) Underground detention basins shall be constructed of
perforated high-density corrugated polyethylene pipe or
approved equal. The required volume shall be provided
utilizing only underground pipe capacity. Each pipe shall have
a minimum slope of 0.5%.
(g) An emergency overflow weir shall be provided for the outlet
structure in order to convey basin inflow in excess of design
flows or in the event that the outlet structure becomes blocked
and is unable to convey the design flow. The minimum capacity
of the emergency overflow weir shall be equivalent to the onehundred-
year peak inflow rate for the post-development design
storm. Site improvements and grading downstream of the
underground detention basin shall be designed to convey the
one-hundred-year peak inflow rate to a natural outfall, storm
sewer system or other drainage facility without adversely
affecting downstream properties.
(9) Wet basins. Existing ponds or permanent pool basins can be used,
provided that they meet the following minimum standards in
addition to providing the required release rate and volume control
requirements:
(a) The minimum permanent pool basins can be maintained to
allow sufficient depth throughout the year to reduce the
growth of unwanted vegetation and mosquitoes.
(b) The pond must be of sufficient size and depth to allow the
appropriate aquatic community needed to maintain healthy
pond ecology.
(c) An outlet structure shall be designed to allow complete
drainage of the pond for maintenance.
(d) The design of a wet basin shall include the determination of the
proposed site's ability to support a viable permanent pool. The
design should take into account such factors as the required
§ 157-16 SPEED-TIMING DEVICES § 157-16
155:361
§ 157-17. Grading, erosion and sedimentation controls.
rate and quality of dry-weather inflow, the quality of
stormwater inflow, seasonal and longer-term variations in the
groundwater table, and effects of suspected pollutant loadings.
The Pennsylvania Fish Commission and Natural Resources
Conservation Service should be consulted during the design of
facilities.
(10) Riparian buffers proposed to meet the water quality standards shall
meet the following minimum requirements:
(a) The minimum overland flow length through the buffer shall be
25 feet.
(b) The maximum overland flow length contributing runoff to the
boundary of the riparian buffer shall be 150 feet for pervious
surfaces and 75 feet for impervious surfaces.
(c) The average contributing overland slope shall not exceed 5%.
(d) Runoff shall enter the riparian buffer as sheet flow. A levelspreading
device shall be utilized where sheet can no longer be
maintained.
(e) The riparian buffer shall be specifically designated on the final
subdivision and/or land development plan and shall be
landscaped in accordance with the requirements of and as
recommended by the Township Engineer. Plan notes should
also indicate the portions of the riparian buffer being used to
satisfy the requirements. Generally, the riparian buffer should
be increased in effectiveness while maintaining a natural state
as much as possible to maximize water quality benefits.
A. Grading.
(1) Blocks and lots shall be graded to secure proper drainage away
from buildings and to prevent the collection of stormwater in pools,
except as approved by the Township Engineer. Grading at buildings
shall conform to Township Building Codes, as amended. The
minimum allowable slope in lawn areas shall not be less than 2%.
(2) All drainage provisions shall be of such design as to carry surface
water to the nearest practical street, storm drain or natural
watercourse.
(3) The owner shall construct and/or install such drainage structures
and/or pipes necessary to prevent erosion damage and to
satisfactorily carry off such surface waters.
(4) No excavation shall be made with a cut face steeper in slope than
three horizontal to one vertical, except under one or more of the
following conditions, as approved by the Township Engineer:
§ 157-16 WARWICK CODE § 157-17
155:362
(a) The material in which the excavation is made is sufficiently
stable to sustain a slope of steeper than three horizontal to one
vertical, and a written statement of a civil engineer, licensed by
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and experienced in erosion
control, to that effect is submitted to the Township Engineer
and approved by him. The statement shall state that the site
has been inspected and that the deviation from the slope
specified hereinbefore will not result in injury to persons or
damage to property.
(b) A concrete or stone masonry wall, or modular block wall,
constructed in accordance with approved standards is
provided to support the face of the excavation.
(c) Design drawings and supporting calculations, both prepared
by an engineer registered to practice in Pennsylvania, shall be
submitted to the Township for review prior to construction of
retaining walls.
(5) No fill shall be made which creates any exposed surface steeper in
slope than three horizontal to one vertical, except under one or
more of the following conditions, as approved by the Township
Engineer:
(a) The fill is located so that settlement, sliding or erosion will not
result in property damage or be a hazard to adjoining property,
streets, alleys or buildings.
(b) A written statement from a civil engineer, licensed by the
commonwealth and experienced in erosion control, certifying
that he has inspected the site and that the proposed deviation
from the slope specified above will not endanger any property
or result in property damage, is submitted to and approved by
the Township Engineer.
(c) A concrete or stone masonry wall or modular block wall
constructed in accordance with approved standards is
provided to support the face of the fill.
(6) The top or bottom edge of slopes shall be a minimum of five feet
from property or right-of-way lines of streets or alleys in order to
permit the normal rounding of the edge without encroaching on the
abutting property.
(7) Grading equipment shall not be allowed to cross any wetlands,
watercourses, floodplains, etc., without prior approval by the
appropriate Township, state and federal agencies.
(8) Within all subdivisions and land developments, and all singlefamily,
multifamily residential, commercial or noncommercial
buildings, additions or developments, expansion or changes of any
impervious areas or surfaces, the owner, agent, builder or builders
§ 157-17 SPEED-TIMING DEVICES § 157-17
155:363
shall be required to fine grade and seed each individual lot within a
subdivision or the lot within the land development. Each lot shall be
fine graded to its boundary lines and adjusted accordingly to meet
existing grades adjacent to the boundary lines prior to issuance
of any use and occupancy permits for any dwelling or building
within any subdivision or land development. In the event that the
developer cannot complete the required grading and seeding due
to mitigating circumstances, the developer shall escrow with
Warwick Township the appropriate sums as determined by the
Warwick Township Engineer to guarantee the grading or
adjustments to any grades in any areas which shall impair
stormwater runoff on any adjacent lot in any way.
(9) Fine grading shall be defined as that work which is required to
remove all large lumps, particles and debris within the lot area.
This shall be accomplished by hand-raking or mechanical
equipment mounted with a fine-tooth rake. Dragging with a trackmounted
tractor or wheel-mounted tractor will not be considered
as fine grading. Fine grading shall also include the installation of a
minimum of a four-inch thickness of topsoil.
(10) Limits of grading and seeding within a wooded lot shall be the
same as any other type of lot; and all lots, whether wooded or not,
within a subdivision and/or a land development shall be graded and
seeded from boundary to boundary unless it is specifically agreed
by the subdivider, owner, builder or builders and the purchaser of
the lot or lots in writing to the contrary. Evidence of this
arrangement must be submitted to the Township Building
Inspector for his review prior to the issuance of any use and
occupancy permit being issued for the structure on the lot where
located, unless waived by Warwick Township. Grading and seeding
shall also be a requirement between all areas of sidewalk and curb
subject to all the hereinbefore-stated requirements and conditions,
except where the same may be waived by Warwick Township.
(11) Where stormwater drainage swales are installed, if, in the opinion
of the Township Engineer, there may be erosion prior to
establishment of vegetation, he may require the installation of sod,
geotextile matting, or other methods to ensure stabilization.
(12) Lawn areas shall be considered to be poorly drained if they contain
standing water for longer than a twelve-hour period following the
cessation of precipitation, which determination may be subject to
the consideration of antecedent moisture conditions.
(13) All fill material utilized shall be clean and free from rock, refuse,
debris, stone, concrete, brick, building material scraps, blacktop,
organic material or other foreign material.
(14) All debris, such as but not limited to concrete, blacktop, wood,
wood chips, stumps, refuse, building material or other material as
§ 157-17 WARWICK CODE § 157-17
155:364
determined inappropriate by the Township Engineer, shall be
removed from the site and disposed of according to the governing
regulations.
(15) All building foundations, grade slabs and cellar floors located in
soils that have a community development limitation degree of
moderate to severe seasonal high-water table (as defined in the
Bucks County Soil Survey) shall be provided with an underdrain
system. This system shall provide for drainage of the enclosed
volume above the slab and relief of subsurface water to a depth not
less than 18 inches below the slab or foundation bottom. The
system will consist of a perforated pipe field of the herringbone or
gridiron configuration in coarse gravel-filled trenches that are in
direct contact with the slab or foundation subbase. The excavation
shall provide a minimum of 0.05 foot/foot slope to the gravel-filled
trenches. Foundation drains shall discharge to a storm sewer
system or into a natural watercourse as directed by the Township
or Township Engineer.
B. Erosion and sedimentation control.
(1) No regulated earth-disturbance activities within the Township shall
commence until approval of an erosion and sediment control plan
by the Township. In addition, the Bucks County Conservation
District requires submission of an erosion and sediment control
plan for any earth-disturbance activity of 1,000 square feet or
more.
(2) Pursuant to 25 Pa. Code, Chapter 102.5, a DEP NPDES permit for
stormwater discharges associated with construction activities is
required for any earth-disturbance activity that involves equal to or
greater than one acre of earth disturbance prior to commencing
the earth-disturbance activity. This includes earth disturbance on
any portion or part or during any stage of a larger common plan of
development or sale.
(3) Detailed construction schedules shall be included in all erosion and
sedimentation plans and stormwater management plans for sites
disturbing in excess of 1,000 square feet of site area.
(4) Evidence of any necessary permit(s) for regulated activities from
the appropriate DEP regional office or County Conservation
District must be provided to the municipality. The issuance of an
NPDES construction permit or permit coverage under the
statewide general permit (PAG-2) satisfies the requirements of
Subsection B(1). A copy of the erosion and sediment control plan
and any required permit, as required by DEP regulations, shall be
available at the project site at all times.
(5) General performance principles. The following shall be adhered to
where applicable during design and construction of approved
plans:
§ 157-17 SPEED-TIMING DEVICES § 157-17
155:365
(a) Stripping of vegetation, regrading, or other development shall
be done in a way that will minimize erosion.
(b) Development plans shall preserve salient natural features,
keep cut-fill operations to a minimum, and ensure conformity
with topography so as to create the least erosion potential and
adequately handle the volume and velocity of surface water
runoff.
(c) Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained,
protected, and supplemented.
(d) Disturbed areas shall be stabilized immediately or, at a
minimum, at the end of the day. In addition, any dirt tracked
onto roadways outside the subject property shall be cleaned
prior to the end of the workday or as directed by the Township
Engineer.
(e) Temporary seeding and/or mulching shall be used to protect
exposed critical areas during development.
(f) The permanent (final) vegetation and mechanical erosion
control and drainage shall be installed as soon as practical in
the development.
(g) Sediment in the runoff water shall be trapped until the
disturbed area is stabilized by the use of debris basins,
sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures.
(h) During grading operations, necessary measures for dust
control must be exercised.
(i) Installation and maintenance of all erosion control facilities
shall be the responsibility of the applicant until all disturbed
areas have been stabilized to the satisfaction of the Township
and the Bucks County Conservation District.
(j) In the event that the developer proceeds to clear and grade
prior to recording plans without satisfying conditions of plan
approval, the Warwick Township Board of Supervisors may
revoke its approval of the preliminary plan.
(k) Tire-cleaning areas shall be provided at each point of access to
the development site.
(l) No person, corporation or other entity shall block, impede the
flow of, alter, construct any structure or deposit any material or
thing or commit any act which will affect normal or flood flow
in any communal stream or watercourse without having
obtained prior approval from the Township or Pennsylvania
Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP), whichever
is applicable.
§ 157-17 WARWICK CODE § 157-17
155:366
(6) Responsibility.
(a) Whenever sedimentation is caused by stripping vegetation,
regrading or other development, it shall be the responsibility of
the applicant and/or person, corporation or other entity
causing such sedimentation to remove it from all adjoining
surfaces, drainage systems and watercourses and to repair any
damage at his expense as quickly as possible.
(b) Maintenance of all temporary erosion and sedimentation
control facilities within any subdivision or land development is
the responsibility of the developer until they are accepted by
the Township or some other official agency, after which they
become the responsibility of the accepting agency.

A. Applicability of impact assessment:
§ 163-14 WARWICK CODE § 163-15
155:434
(1) The impact on the environment created by subdivisions and land
developments necessitates a comprehensive analysis of the variety
of problems that may result and actions that can be taken to
minimize these problems. To effectively evaluate the environmental
consequences or effects of certain projects proposed in the
Township, an applicant shall submit an impact assessment (IA)
report that meets all of the requirements of this section. The
information provided in the IA report must mirror the information
provided upon the plans submitted to the Township and vice versa.
(2) An IA report shall be submitted concurrently with the preliminary
plan, unless waived by the Township due to the limited scope of the
application or plan. An updated IA report shall be submitted
concurrently with the final plan for the Township's review and
approval if the project scope has undergone a significant change
since the preliminary plan submission. The approved IA shall
become a part of the approved final plan, and the subdivision/land
development shall be constructed in accordance with the
information set forth within the report.
(3) Twenty copies and an electronic copy of the IA report shall be
submitted to the Township. Within the IA report, specific emphasis
shall be directed toward the proposed project's effects on and
relationship to applicable site, neighborhood (including areas in
adjacent municipalities, where applicable), and Township-wide
resources, conditions or characteristics. The IA report shall be
divided into two sections: site analysis and design analysis. The
report shall include text, tables, maps, and analyses describing the
project site, proposed use(s), environmental characteristics, and
the environmental effects of the proposal.
B. Site analysis. This section of the IA report shall contain the following:
(1) In a narrative format, indicate the purpose and scope of the
proposed project. Enumerate the benefits to the public which will
result from the proposed project, and describe the suitability of the
site for the intended use. The description of the proposed project
shall indicate the extent to which the site must be altered, the kinds
of facilities to be constructed, how they are to be considered and
the uses intended. The resident population, working population,
and visitor population shall be projected. The basis of the
projections shall be clearly stated in the report.
(2) Compatibility. The compatibility or incompatibility of the proposed
project shall be described in relation to the following, and should
be accomplished in narrative form, with references to the plan as
submitted:
(a) Surrounding properties and uses, including, where applicable,
local villages.
§ 163-15 SPEED-TIMING DEVICES § 163-15
155:435

value of the development by the assessment factor; multiply the
result by the school district millage rate.
(2) Development-generated operating costs. Multiply the number of
school-age children to be generated by the project by the operating
cost per student.
(3) Development-generated capital costs. Multiply the number of
school-age children to be generated by the project by the capital
costs per student for the new facilities. Multiply the result by the
debt constant. This gives the annual debt service cost.
(4) Net impact assessment. Add the operating costs and capital costs
generated by the project, and subtract that number from the school
district tax revenue generation to determine the educational cost
impact of the development proposal.

A. Purpose. A transportation impact study, provided by the developer, shall
be required for all nonresidential subdivisions, land developments,
zoning changes, special exceptions, or residential subdivisions of 10
lots or more as defined in Subsection C. This study will enable Warwick
Township to assess the impact of an application on the transportation
system, both highways and public transportation, in Warwick Township.
Its purpose is to ensure that proposed developments or zoning changes
do not adversely affect the transportation network and to identify any
traffic problems associated with access from the site to the existing
transportation network. The study's purpose is also to delineate
solutions to potential problems and to present improvements to be
incorporated into the proposed development. The study shall assist in
§ 163-16 SPEED-TIMING DEVICES § 163-17
155:445
the protection of air quality, the conservation of energy and the
encouragement of public transportation use.
B. Conduct of the transportation impact study. The transportation impact
study shall be prepared by a qualified traffic engineer and/or
transportation planner with previous traffic study experience. The
procedures and standards for the transportation impact study are set
forth in Subsection C.
C. General requirements and standards. A transportation impact study
shall contain the following information:
(1) General site description. The site description shall include the size,
location, proposed land uses, construction staging and completion
date of the proposed land development. If the development is
residential, the types of dwelling units and number of bedrooms
shall also be included. A brief description of other major existing
and proposed land developments within a two-mile radius of the
site shall be provided. The general site description shall also
include probable socioeconomic characteristics of potential site
users to the extent that they may affect the transportation needs of
the site (e.g., the number of senior citizens).
(2) Transportation facilities description.
(a) The description shall contain a full documentation of the
proposed internal and existing external transportation system.
This description shall include proposed internal vehicular,
bicycle and pedestrian circulation, all proposed ingress and
egress locations, all internal roadway widths and rights-of-way,
parking conditions, traffic channelizations and any traffic
signals or other intersection control devices at all intersections
within the site. The site design shall be shown to maximize
potential public transportation usage to and from the
development, such as providing adequate turning radius at all
access points to allow a bus to enter the development. Bus
shelter and sign locations shall be designated, where
appropriate.
(b) The report shall describe the entire external roadway system
within the study area. Major intersections in the study area
shall be identified and sketched. All existing and proposed
public transportation shall be documented. All future highway
improvements, including proposed construction and traffic
signalization, shall be noted. This information shall be obtained
from the Twelve-Year High Capital Program for the Delaware
Valley Region (DVRPC) and from the Pennsylvania Department
of Transportation. Any proposed roadway improvements due to
proposed surrounding developments shall be recorded. The
study area will extend approximately 1/2 mile along the
adjacent roadway in both directions from all access points or to
§ 163-17 WARWICK CODE § 163-17
155:446
a major intersection along these roadways. Where doubt
exists, the transportation engineer shall seek guidance from
the Warwick Township Engineer prior to the submission of the
transportation impact study.
(3) Existing traffic conditions. Existing traffic conditions shall be
measured and documented for all roadways and intersections in
the study area. Existing traffic volumes for average daily traffic,
peak highway hour(s) traffic and peak development-generated
hour(s) traffic shall be recorded. Manual traffic counts at major
intersections in the study area shall be conducted, encompassing
the peak highway and development-generated hour(s), and
documentation shall be included in the report. A volume/capacity
analysis based upon existing volumes shall be performed during
the peak highway hour(s) and the peak development-generated
hour(s) for all roadways and major intersections in the study area.
Levels of service shall be determined for each location. This
analysis will determine the adequacy of the existing roadway
system to serve the current traffic demand. Roadways and/or
intersections experiencing levels of service "E" or "F" shall be
noted as congestion locations.
(4) Transportation impact of the development. An estimation of
vehicular trips to result from the proposal shall be completed for
the average daily peak highway hour(s) and peak developmentgenerated
hour(s). Vehicular trip generation rates to be used for
this calculation shall be obtained from the Bucks County Planning
Commission's Trip Generation Rates, as amended. These
development-generated traffic volumes shall be provided for the
inbound and outbound traffic movements as estimated, and the
reference source(s) and methodology followed shall be
documented. All turning movements shall be calculated. These
generated volumes shall be distributed to the study area and
assigned to the existing roadways and intersections throughout the
study area. Documentation of all assumptions used in the
distribution and assignment phase shall be provided. Traffic
volumes shall be assigned to individual access points. Pedestrian
volumes shall also be calculated, if applicable. If school crossings
are to be used, pedestrian volumes shall be assigned to each
crossing. Any characteristics of the site that will cause particular
trip-generation problems shall be noted.
(5) Analysis of transportation impact.
(a) The total future traffic demand shall be calculated. This
demand shall consist of the combination of the existing traffic
expanded to the completion year (using an annual traffic rate
available from the Delaware Valley Regional Planning
Commission), the development-generated traffic and the traffic
generated by other proposed developments in the study area. A
second volume/capacity analysis shall be conducted using the
§ 163-17 SPEED-TIMING DEVICES § 163-17
155:447
total future demand and the future roadway capacity. If the
phasing of the proposed development is anticipated,
calculations for each phase of completion shall be made. This
analysis shall be performed during the peak highway hour(s)
and peak development-generated hour(s) for all roadways and
major intersections in the study area. Volume/capacity
calculations shall be completed for all major intersections. It is
usually at these locations that capacity is most restricted.
(b) All access points and pedestrian crossings shall be examined
as to the feasibility of installing traffic signals. This evaluation
shall compare the projected traffic and pedestrian volumes to
the warrants for traffic signal installation.
(6) Conclusions and recommended improvements.
(a) Levels of service for all roadways and intersections shall be
listed. All roadways and/or intersections showing a level of
service below "C" shall be considered deficient, and specific
recommendations for the elimination of these problems shall
be listed. This listing of recommended improvements shall
include but not be limited to the following elements: internal
circulation design; site access location and design; external
roadway and intersection design and improvements; traffic
signal installation and operation, including signal timing; and
transit design improvements. All physical roadway
improvements shall be shown in sketches.
(b) Existing and/or future public transportation service shall also
be addressed. A listing of all actions to be undertaken to
increase present public transportation usage and improve
service, if applicable, shall be included. An analysis based on
the guidelines contained in the Bucks County Public
Transportation Study Phase I Report shall be undertaken to
indicate whether or not future public transportation service
should be provided to the development.
(c) The listing of recommended improvements for both roadways
and transit shall include, for each improvement, the party
responsible for the improvement and the completion date for
the improvement.
D. Time of submission.
(1) The transportation impact study shall be submitted to Warwick
Township and the Bucks County Planning Commission with the
preliminary plan submittal.

E. Implementation.
(1) Warwick Township shall review the transportation impact study to
analyze its adequacy in solving any traffic problems that will occur
due to the land development or subdivision. To bring about a
rational evaluation of the transportation impact study, Warwick
Township may retain a consultant (the Bucks County Planning
Commission, Township Engineer, or other), responsible to the
Township, to perform evaluation services. The cost of such
evaluation shall be borne solely by the developer.
(2) The Warwick Township Board of Supervisors may decide that
certain improvements contained in the study on or adjacent to the
site are mandatory for development or subdivision plan approval
and may attach these conditions to the approval. If Warwick

conditions make continuance or conformance to existing streets
impractical.
D. Residential streets shall be laid out to discourage their use by through
traffic.
E. Where a subdivision or land development abuts or contains an existing
or proposed arterial or collector street, the Board of Supervisors may
require marginal access streets, reverse-frontage streets, alleyways, or
such street designs needed to adequately protect existing and/or
proposed residential properties and to separate through and local
traffic.
F. Streets that are extensions of or obviously in alignment with existing
streets shall bear the names of the existing streets. Street names shall
not be repeated, and all street names shall be subject to the approval of
the Board of Supervisors.

for each street or portion thereof. ADT shall be based on the current trip
generation rates as published by the Bucks County Planning Commission
for the specified uses:
(4) That a proposal to offer the street for dedication by the owners of
more than 50% of the lot road frontage shall be binding on owners
of the remaining lots.
J. The Board of Supervisors shall, in the interest of highway safety and the
safety of the area residents and in order to promote orderly community
development, require the owner/developer of any large commercial
use, such as a shopping center, industrial park or plant, housing
project, apartment complex, major education or recreational facility or
other significant traffic generator, to meet jointly with representatives
of the Township and the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation to
ultimately achieve the best possible design from the standpoint of
traffic.
K. Any applicant who encroaches within the legal right-of-way of a state

Pennsylvania Department of Transportation.
L. Any applicant who encroaches within the legal right-of-way of a
Township road is required to obtain a road occupancy permit from the
Township.
M. The area between an existing right-of-way line and the ultimate right-ofway
line shown on a proposed subdivision or land development plan
shall be offered for dedication to the entity having jurisdiction over the
road. (See Appendix E.128)
A. Arterial streets and highways are those roads which carry fast-moving
and heavy traffic or may handle interstate or transcontinental traffic.
Such streets or highways are generally restricted to limited access,
and, for the most part, the authority for control of access or
construction within their rights-of-way is vested within the
Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, PennDOT 408 Standard as
well as the guidelines and requirements set forth in the MUTCD
(Manuel on Uniform Traffic Control Devices) for streets and highways.
B. Collector streets are those which carry traffic from other collector,
primary or secondary streets into the system of arterial or major
highways (ADT of 1,001 to 3,000).

abutting properties and generally serve only internally developed areas
(ADT of 201 to 500).
E. Residential streets are those serving areas of low population density
where abutting properties are of one acre or more in area. Roads of this
class may be considered a part of the Comprehensive Plan of the
municipality but shall not be included in any subdivision plan under this
classification (ADT of zero to 200).
F. Cul-de-sac streets are those which are closed at one end and shall not
be more than 500 feet long, terminating in a turnaround with a
minimum right-of-way radius of 50 feet and an outer paving radius of 40
feet. The minimum right-of-way width shall be 50 feet, and the
minimum cartway width shall be 30 feet (ADT of zero to 200).
G. Marginal access streets are minor streets of the secondary class which
are laid out parallel to and adjacent to arterial streets and highways and
which provide access to abutting properties and protection from
through traffic.
H. Alleys are streets which are intended to provide access to the rear of
residential lots for service and on-lot parking.

§ 163-33 SPEED-TIMING DEVICES § 163-34
155:471
§ 163-35. Street alignment.
C. The intersections of primary or secondary streets entering any collector
street from the same side shall be located not less than 800 feet apart,
as measured from center line to center line. The intersections of
secondary streets entering any existing or proposed street from
opposite directions shall be located not less than 125 feet apart, as
measured from center line to center line.
D. Marginal access streets shall be provided when a development adjoins
an arterial or collector route. These marginal streets shall provide
access to all lots abutting this arterial road, and none of these lots shall
take access from the arterial or collector road.
E. The center-line profile of streets shall be adjusted to the contour of the
land so as to produce usable lots and streets consistent with reasonable
grade, alignment, drainage and future municipal sanitary facilities.
F. The rights-of-way shall be graded to their full width, and the applicant
shall provide suitable finished grades to the tolerances herein specified.
In no case shall the rights-of-way be less than the minimum width
specified in this chapter.
G. Provision for additional street width may be required by the Township
in specific cases for:
(1) Public safety and convenience.
(2) Parking in commercial or industrial areas and in areas of highdensity
residential developments.
(3) Widening existing streets where the minimum width outlined in
these specifications does not meet with the specific requirements
of the individual street.
A. The minimum radius at the center line for curves on collector streets
shall be 500 feet; for primary streets, 350 feet; and for secondary,
residential and cul-de-sac streets, 150 feet.
B. Superelevation.
(1) Street superelevations shall only be required on collector and
arterial streets. All curves shall be superelevated in accordance
with Pennsylvania Department of Transportation Design Manual,
Part 2, Highway Design, as amended.
(2) On all types of pavement or all subbase construction, curves to be
superelevated shall conform to the requirements set forth in
Pennsylvania Department of Transportation Design Manual, Part 2,
Highway Design, as amended. The crown will be removed and the
slope will be uniform from the inside to the outside of the
pavement. Full superelevation will be attained at the point of
§ 163-34 WARWICK CODE § 163-35
155:472
curvature and point of tangency with runouts as indicated in the
Design Manual.
(3) The normal grade of the inside edge of the pavement or the center
line of the pavement will be held as a baseline from which all
superelevation will be applied. The method to be used shall be
specified by the Township.
C. Proper sight distances shall be provided for both horizontal and vertical
alignment, measured along the center line. Minimum sight distances
shall be 500 feet for collector streets, 400 feet for primary streets and
250 feet for secondary streets. Sight distances provided shall not be
less than permitted by PennDOT for similarly classified roadways.
Proper sight lines shall be maintained at all intersections. Measured
along the center line, there shall be a clear-sight triangle for 75 feet
from the point of intersection for fifty-foot rights-of-way and 130 feet for
sixty-foot and eighty-foot rights-of-way. This sight line shall be indicated
on all plans of street alignment. No existing or proposed structure,
plantings or fences are permitted in the area between a plane two feet
above the road center line and a plane eight feet above the road center
line.
D. At each point where a private accessway (driveway or private street)
intersects a public street, a clear sight triangle conforming to the
required sight distance shall be maintained, within which vegetation
and other visual obstructions shall be limited to a height of not more
than two feet above the street grade. Intersection sight distance, both
required and available, shall be provided in accordance with Pa. Code,
Title 67, Chapter 441, latest revision.
E. Street intersections shall be approached from all sides by leveling
areas. Where the grade exceeds 7%, such leveling areas shall have a
minimum length of 50 feet, measured from the edge of the pavement of
the transverse street, within which no grade shall exceed 4%.
F. At changes in grade of more than 1%, vertical curves shall be used. The
length of the curve shall be a minimum of 100 feet on collector and
primary streets and a minimum of 50 feet on secondary streets for
every one-percent change in grade. Vertical alignment shall conform as
much as practical to the existing contour of ground within the
limitations herein stipulated.
G. Regarding the horizontal alignment of streets, a minimum tangent
length of 100 feet, measured along the center line, shall be provided on
collector and primary streets between the point of tangency of the first
curve and the point of curvature of the second curve, unless otherwise
approved by the Township Engineer. In no case shall two curves in
reverse direction be joined together without this minimum onehundred-
foot tangent length provided for the above two classifications
of streets. The tangent length between curves on secondary streets
shall be designed as required or approved by the Township Engineer.
§ 163-35 SPEED-TIMING DEVICES § 163-35
155:473
H. A minimum grade of 1% shall be established on all primary or
secondary streets. A minimum grade of 1/2% shall be established for all
collector streets only under unique circumstances and upon prior
approval by the Township Engineer.
I. Maximum grades of 5% shall generally apply. In exceptionally hilly
areas, a maximum grade of 6% on collector and primary streets and
10% on secondary streets for a maximum distance of 1,500 feet will be
permitted. Grades in excess of 6% should be avoided on all streets
wherever possible.
J. The grade within the outer perimeter of a cul-de-sac shall not exceed
3%. The grade will be measured along the curbline of the street.
K. A combination of minimum-radius horizontal curves and maximum
grades will not be approved.
L. A normal crown shall be provided on all streets, not superelevated, of 5/
16 inch per foot of straight slope extending in cross section from the
edge of the pavement to the center line or from the edge of the
pavement to the medial edge, whichever will apply, symmetrical to the
center line.
M. Whenever practicable, the number of intersections with arterial
highways shall be kept to a minimum and shall be located at least 1,000
feet apart.
N. Whenever practicable, right-of-way lines shall intersect at right angles.
When secondary streets intersect primary or collector streets, the angle
of intersection of the street center lines shall not be less than 90º.
O. Street curb intersections shall be rounded by a tangential arc with a
minimum radius of 25 feet for secondary streets and 35 feet for
intersections which incorporate primary or collector streets.
P. The dedication of half streets at the perimeter of a new subdivision is
prohibited. If circumstances render this impracticable, adequate
provision for the concurrent dedication of the remaining half of the
street must be furnished by the subdivider. Where there exists a half
street in an adjoining subdivision, the remaining half shall be provided
by the proposed development.
Q. Reserve strips controlling ingress and egress are prohibited. When the
development adjoins unimproved land, new streets shall be provided
through to the boundary lines of the development with temporary
easements for turnarounds; or, at the discretion of the Engineer, the
entire width of the right-of-way may be paved for a distance of 75 feet.
R. Streets that are extensions of or obviously in alignment with existing
named streets shall bear the names of the existing streets. All street
names shall be subject to the approval of the Board of Supervisors.

curves and tangents.
U. Whenever curbs are to be constructed across private driveways within
residential areas or driveway approaches of ingress or egress from
abutting industrial or commercial properties, the curb shall be
depressed unless otherwise directed by the Township Engineer.
V. When required and approved by the Supervisors, separated driveway
approaches may be constructed for entrance and exit to abutting
properties. Such individual driveway approach shall not exceed the
maximum longitudinal length of 35 feet of depressed curb at each
driveway approach, and a standard curb section shall be constructed as
a separating curb between the driveways, conforming to the
dimensions and details of the standard detailed drawings of these
specifications.
A. A cul-de-sac will not be approved when a through street is practicable.
The applicant shall have the burden of showing the impracticability of
the through street in order to justify a cul-de-sac.
B. A cul-de-sac permanently or temporarily exceeding 500 feet in length
may be approved by the Board of Supervisors if conditions of the land
so warrant.
C. A cul-de-sac permanently terminated according to the subdivision plan
shall be provided with a circular turnaround with a minimum right-ofway
radius of 50 feet and an outer paving radius of 40 feet.
D. A temporary cul-de-sac shall be designed the same as a permanent culde-
sac.
E. Drainage, where possible, shall be toward the open end.
F. Unless future extension is clearly impractical or undesirable, the
turnaround right-of-way shall be placed adjacent to a property line, and
a right-of-way of the same width as the street shall be carried to the
property line in such a way as to permit future extension of the street
into the adjoining street. At such time as the street is extended, the area
created by the turnaround shall revert ownership to the property
owner(s) fronting on the cul-de-sac turnaround.

[5] All plantings shall be able to survive soot, gas fumes and
salt. Trees which have low-growing branches, gum or
moisture which may drop on vehicles or blossoms, thorns,
seeds or pods which may clog drainage facilities shall be
avoided. The plantings chosen should be of sufficient size
to be effective the first year they are planted.
(g) Existing vegetation. In cases where natural features on the site
duplicate or essentially duplicate the requirements of the
buffering provisions of this chapter, these requirements may be
waived by the Board of Supervisors.
(12) Maintenance.
(a) An agreement between the developer and the Township shall
be required and entered into in order to provide maintenance
of all such plantings.
(b) Street trees, plant material and buffer plantings.
[1] The term of the maintenance agreement shall be for 18
months from the day the Board of Supervisors takes final
dedication of all public streets and any other public
improvements in all phases of an approved subdivision and
land development plan. If for some reason dedication of
streets is not part of the approved subdivision or land
development plan, the term of the maintenance agreement
shall be from the day the Township Engineer and Township
Manager give to the developer final approval on all
required improvements identified in the developer's
agreement. During this maintenance term, the developer
shall:
[a] Replace all dead street trees, plant material and
buffer plantings due to improper maintenance or
damage by accident within six months of notification
by the Township Engineer.
[b] Control insects and diseases.
[c] Repair mechanical injury.
§ 163-51 SPEED-TIMING DEVICES § 163-51
155:493
§ 163-51.1. Tree protection standards.
[d] Remove all dead branches.
[2] The Township Engineer shall make a final inspection of all
street trees, plant material and buffer plantings prior to
the end of the term of the maintenance agreement to make
sure that all conditions set forth in and all terms of said
maintenance agreement have been met. A written report
of compliance shall be submitted to the Board of
Supervisors.
[3] Upon the satisfactory completion of said maintenance
agreement, the maintenance and replacement of all street
trees, plant material and buffer plantings as shown on the
final subdivision and land development plans shall become
the responsibility of the applicant, unless otherwise
agreed to by the Township.
[4] Upon the completion of a maintenance agreement, the
Township Zoning Officer shall have jurisdiction to enforce
these provisions to ensure compliance with the landscape
material shown on the approved final land development
plans as they will pertain to the individual lots.
[5] Replacement of all street trees, plant material and buffer
plantings by an individual lot owner shall be subject to
approval by the Zoning Officer or another designated code
enforcement official, including but not limited to the
Township Engineer, foresters, tree wardens or other
assistants the Township Board of Supervisors may employ.
[6] Where areas of forest remain as part of the land
development or open space associated therewith, the
developer shall be responsible for maintenance and sound
forest management practices, including but not limited to
removal of dead or diseased trees. Where a forested area
is to be dedicated to the Township, the developer shall
provide the Township with a forestry management plan
prepared by a certified arborist. Prior to dedication and
during the eighteen-month maintenance period, the
developer shall implement the forestry management plan,
including the removal of all dead and diseased trees.
A. General requirements.
(1) Grade changes and excavation shall not encroach upon the tree
protection zone. The tree protection zone shall be established as a
distance of 20 feet from the trunk of the tree, or the dripline,
whichever is greater.
§ 163-51 WARWICK CODE § 163-51.1
155:494
(2) No toxic materials shall be stored within 100 feet of a tree
protection zone, including petroleum-based and/or -derived
products.
(3) The area within the tree protection zone shall not be built upon, nor
shall any materials be stored there either temporarily or
permanently. Vehicles and equipment shall not be parked in the
tree protection zone.
(4) When tree stumps are located within 10 feet of the tree protection
zone, the stumps shall be removed by means of a stump grinder to
minimize the effect on surrounding root systems.
(5) Tree roots which must be severed shall be cut by a backhoe or
similar equipment aligned radially to the tree. This method reduces
the lateral movement of the roots during excavation, which, if done
by other methods, could damage the intertwined roots of adjacent
trees.
(6) Within four hours of any severance of roots, all tree roots that have
been exposed and/or damaged shall be trimmed cleanly and
covered temporarily with moist peat moss, moist burlap or other
moist biodegradable material to keep them from drying out until
permanent cover can be installed.
(7) Sediment, retention and detention basins shall not discharge into
the tree protection zone.
(8) Sediment, retention and detention basins shall not be located
within the tree protection zone.
(9) Trees shall not be used for roping, cables, signs or fencing. Nails
and spikes shall not be driven into trees.
B. The tree protection zone. Prior to construction, the tree protection zone
shall be delineated by the following methods:
(1) The tree protection zone that is delineated on the site prior to
construction shall conform to the approved development plans.
(2) All trees scheduled to remain shall be marked; where groups of
trees exist, only the trees on the edge need to be marked.
(3) A forty-eight-inch-high barrier fence (commonly referred to as a
"snow fence"), mounted on posts, located eight feet on center, shall
be placed along the boundary of the tree protection zone. Such
fence shall be bright orange in color.
(4) In addition to the tree protection zone, trees may be left standing
as protection between the trunks of the trees to be retained and the
limits of grading. When additional trees are used as protection, the
tree protection zone on the approved plan shall be marked in the
field as directed by the Township Engineer so that the additional
§ 163-51.1 SPEED-TIMING DEVICES § 163-51.1
155:495
buffer area is delineated. When this method of protection is used,
these additional trees shall be removed at the time of completion of
the project.
(5) When the barrier fence has been installed, it shall be inspected and
approved by the Township Engineer prior to commencing clearing
and construction; the fencing along the tree protection zone shall
be maintained until all work/construction has been completed. Any
damages to the protective fencing shall be replaced and repaired
before further construction shall begin.
(6) Trees being removed shall not be felled, pushed or pulled into a
tree protection zone or into trees that are to be retained.
C. Retaining walls.
(1) When the original grade cannot be retained at the tree protection
zone line, a retaining wall shall be constructed outside of the tree
protection zone.
(2) The retaining wall shall be designed to comply with the Township
standards for retaining walls.
(3) In addition, the following methods shall be used to ensure survival
of the tree:
(a) The top of the wall shall be four inches above the finished
grade line.
(b) The wall shall be constructed of large stones, brick, building
tile, concrete blocks or treated wood beams not less than 6 x 6
inches. A means for drainage through the wall shall be
provided so water will not accumulate on either side of the
wall. Weep holes shall be required with any wall.
(c) Any severed roots as a result of excavation shall be trimmed so
that their edges are smooth and are cut back to a lateral root if
exposed.
(d) A layer of clean stone (size: 3/4 to one inch) shall be placed one
foot out from the wall to aid in drainage.
(4) Design drawings and supporting calculations, both prepared by an
engineer registered to practice in Pennsylvania, shall be submitted
to the Township for review prior to construction.
D. Pruning methods. All final cuts shall be made sufficiently close to the
trunk or parent limb but without cutting into the branch collar or
leaving a protruding stub, according to the National Arborist
Association standards. All necessary pruning cuts must be made to
prevent bark from being torn from the tree and to facilitate rapid
healing. Flush cuts are unacceptable.
§ 163-51.1 WARWICK CODE § 163-51.1
155:496
§ 163-51.2. Individual tree replacement.
Any individual trees having a diameter of eight inches or more, measured at
breast height, which are removed as a result of development of a parcel and
cannot be relocated shall be replaced with a new tree of like kind having
a minimum diameter of 2.5 caliper inches, measured at breast height.
Individual trees shall be defined as those freestanding trees outside a forest,
as defined by this chapter. This is in addition to all other plantings as
required by this chapter.
§ 163-51.3. Corridor Overlay District.
E. Fertilization methods.
(1) All trees which have experienced any disturbance or have had
damages to the roots or branches shall be fertilized.
(2) Trees shall be fertilized in early fall (September to October) or mid
spring (April to May). Fall applications are preferred.
(3) Fertilizer shall be broadcast over the soil surface in an area twice
the size of the tree protection zone at a rate equivalent to one
pound of nitrogen per 1,000 square feet. A minimum of 1,000
square feet per tree will receive fertilization.
(4) Fertilizer grade shall have approximately three parts nitrogen to
one part phosphorus and potassium (3:1:1 ratio).
F. Trenching and tunneling.
(1) If there is no alternative but to locate a utility line through a tree
protection zone, tunneling shall be used instead of trenching,
except where, in the opinion of the Township arborist, survival of
the tree would not be affected by either method. The Township
Engineer shall determine the most-desirable location for the utility
line.
(2) Trenches shall be filled as soon as possible and tamped lightly to
avoid air spaces.
A. Applicability. The Corridor Overlay District shall apply to all properties
in Warwick Township, regardless of zoning district, depicted on the
attached overlay district plan. These are supplemental regulations
which shall apply in addition to all other applicable regulations of the
Zoning Ordinance137 and this chapter. In the case of a conflict between
this section and any other section, the section imposing the stricter
requirements shall apply.
B. Purpose. The purpose of the Corridor Overlay District is to enhance the
appearance and design of the corridor which serves as a gateway to

design shall be reviewed as part of the subdivision or land development
review process. Where no subdivision or land development is required
or where developments are constructed in phases, such as but not
limited to expansions or changes in use, the proposed design shall be
reviewed by the Township as part of the building permit review process
and at the request of the Township by the Warwick Township Board of
Supervisors. Design review consists of a systematic assessment of the
three-dimensional configuration, design, and materials to be used to
ensure that the proposed development meets the goals for the Corridor
Overlay District.

(3) Excavation for pipe trench.
§ 163-67 WARWICK CODE § 163-67
155:520
(a) The contractor shall make all necessary open trench
excavation to line and grade herein specified or as directed by
the Engineer. Caution shall be taken to prevent excavation
deeper than necessary, as pipe shall not be placed on filled
material without approval of the Engineer.
(b) The contractor shall provide ample space in pipe trenches to
permit proper laying of pipe and fittings. Pipe trenches shall be
excavated to the widths and using the methods as specified in
PennDOT Specifications.
(c) The contractor shall be responsible for properly supporting the
sides of all excavations. Such supports shall be adequate to
fully protect workmen working within the trench, to maintain
reasonable vertical trench walls, to prevent undue sloughing
off of materials into the trench and to prevent damage to
abutting property or structures.
(d) The contractor shall construct and maintain suitable
barricades around all open excavations and shall maintain
sufficient lights for said barricades to prevent accidents or as
directed by the Township Police Force.
(e) The minimum depth of cover over the top of pipe laid in place
shall be 1.5 feet for all RCP pipe laid beneath unpaved surfaces
or flexible-type pavements (and as per manufacturer's
recommendations for CMP and HDPE), as measured vertically
between the outer top surfaces of the pipe and the underside of
the wearing surface pavement or its projected elevation.
(f) If rock is encountered within the excavated trench, the trench
shall be subcut to a minimum depth of 12 inches beneath the
lowest projection of the pipe barrel and backfilled with
PennDOT 2A stone to a point 12 inches above the top of the
pipe. The maximum size of any particles in the selected
material shall be 1/2 inch. Excavation of open trench shall be
restricted to a maximum of 600 feet ahead of laying pipe. In
areas where suitable backfill material is encountered, all pipe
shall be bedded with four inches of PennDOT 2B stone. The
bedding shall extend to the height of the spring line of the pipe,
at a minimum.
(4) Pipelaying.
(a) The laying of pipe in finished trenches shall be commenced at
the lowest point, so that the tongue or spigot ends point in the
direction of flow.
(b) All pipes shall be laid in a dry trench with tongue or spigot ends
fully entered into the adjacent groove or bell and true to the
required lines and grades. The tongue and groove or bell and
spigot shall be satisfactorily cleaned before laying each
§ 163-67 SPEED-TIMING DEVICES § 163-67
155:521
section. All joint work shall be done in an approved manner
by skilled workmen to the end that the pipe, when laid, shall
form a continuous pipeline with a smooth and uniform interior
surface. The pipe sections shall be satisfactorily jointed, the
tongue end of each section being inserted the proper distance
into the groove to make a watertight and adequately sealed
joint. No gapping or irregular joints shall be acceptable in the
work.
(c) When unstable foundation material is found within the trench,
the Engineer may direct that undercutting of the trench shall
be performed and backfill to the established grade be made
with suitable material, compacted and stabilized, to form the
proper pipe bedding, or the Engineer may direct that a Class B
concrete pipe (PennDOT Specifications) saddle be placed
throughout the unstable length of trench.
(d) When pipe is placed within a trench below the established
water table, the Engineer may require that all joints be formed
with a continuous-ring rubber-seal gasket or that a collar or
mold of cement mortar, not less than one inch thick and four
inches wide, shall be placed around the outside perimeter of
(entirely encircling) the pipe at the joint of each section.
(5) Backfilling of trenches.
(a) All trenches and excavations shall be backfilled immediately
after the pipes are laid, unless other protection of the pipe is
necessary. The backfilling material shall be selected earth, free
from large lumps and stone shavings of any dimension greater
than two inches. When pipe trenches are located beneath
existing or paved roadway areas, the trench shall be backfilled
with PennDOT Specification 2B stone to the bottom of the
existing or proposed base course as directed by the Township
Engineer. All backfill shall be thoroughly compacted under the
haunches and along the sides with mechanical tampers or
other approved methods as fast as placed up to a level above
the top of the pipe. The filling and tamping of the backfill shall
be carried up evenly on both sides of the pipe, care being taken
not to raise the pipe or move it off line during the operation.
(b) The remainder of the trench shall then be filled and compacted
by tamping or rolling. The backfill material shall be evenly
spread in built-up layers not exceeding eight inches before
tamping or power-rolling. Care shall be taken that the material
close to the bank, as well as other portions of the trench, shall
be thoroughly compacted.
(c) Puddling or water flooding shall be restricted to consolidate
the backfilling of sandy or gravelly materials. No compacting
shall be done when the material is too wet to be compacted
§ 163-67 WARWICK CODE § 163-67
155:522
properly. If this method is used, the first flooding shall be
applied after the backfilling has been compacted by tamping
up to two feet above the top of the pipes and the second
flooding during or after the subsequent filling of the trench.
Any excess of water shall be avoided, in order to prevent
disturbances of the earth under and around the pipes, and also
to prevent an undue excess of pressure upon them.
(d) Walking or working on the completed pipeline, except as may
be necessary in tamping or backfilling, shall not be permitted
until the trench has been backfilled to a height of at least 1 1/2
feet over the top of the pipes.
(e) The method of backfilling outlined in this section shall apply to
all utilities and service lines contained within the right-of-way
of all roads and streets.
(6) Seasonal limits. No construction shall be done during unfavorable
weather, as determined by the Township Engineer.
(7) Inlets.

for their completion.
(b) All materials shall be procured from approved sources and be
of the design type approved by the Engineer. All metal castings
for frames and gratings shall conform to ASTM standards.
(c) Excavation shall be made to the required depth, and the earth
foundation material shall be stable and compacted to a firm,
even surface.
(d) The forms for the concrete structure shall be sufficiently rigid
to prevent displacement or sagging between supports and so
constructed that the concrete will not be damaged by their
removal. Forms shall be sufficiently tight to prevent leakage of
mortar. The contractor shall be entirely responsible for their
adequacy.
(e) All forms shall be thoroughly cleaned and oiled before concrete
is placed therein, with an approved nonstaining oil or liquid
coating.
§ 163-67 SPEED-TIMING DEVICES § 163-67
155:523
(f) Forms for concrete surfaces exposed to view in the finished
work shall be of plywood, sanded smooth and fined with tight
joints between panels.

(c) Excavation shall be made to the required depth, and the earth
foundation material shall be stable and compacted to a firm,
even surface. When the foundation material is found to be of
water-bearing texture, the Engineer may require additional
depth excavation to a more-stable foundation material,
backfilled to the prescribed foundation elevation with select
material.
(d) Wood forms shall be constructed for all concrete structures.
The forms shall be so constructed that watertightness shall be
maintained and braced and wired in such manner to prevent
warping and expansion under the pressure of the loads
contemplated during the placing of the concrete. The forms
shall be thoroughly cleaned prior to using and oiled to facilitate
their removal. The concrete, when placed within the forms,
shall be restricted to a maximum of five feet of free drop and
shall be spread and tamped or vibrated into place in such a

the plates shall be removed, plates braced into correct
position and fill material replaced. The bracing shall
be removed as directed by the Engineer.
[e] The skew angle shall not exceed 45° for metal pipe or
pipe arches. When the skew angle for arches is more
than 15°, the length of the structure shall be such that
no portion of the live load will be carried by the cut
portion of the arch end. When rights-of-way or other
conditions do not permit this required length, then the
cut end shall be supported by a rigid headwall
designed to meet the conditions, and the end plates
shall be anchored to this headwall.
(10) Endwalls required.
(a) This item shall consist of the construction of endwalls of the
types specified in PennDOT Standards for Roadway

or improved as may be required by this chapter and any walkways, curbs,
gutters, streetlights, fire hydrants, shade trees, water mains, sanitary
sewers, storm drains and other improvements as may be required by this
chapter have been installed in accordance with this chapter.
§ 163-79. Guaranties and financial security.
A. In lieu of the completion of any improvements required as a condition
for the final approval of a plan, this chapter shall provide for the deposit
with the Township of financial security in an amount sufficient to cover
the costs of any improvements or common amenities, including but not
limited to roads, parking areas, lighting, sewage disposal systems,
traffic signal and controls, stormwater detention and/or retention
basins and other related drainage facilities, recreational facilities, open
space improvements or buffer or screen plantings which may be
required.
B. The Board of Supervisors shall provide an applicant or developer with a

Board of Supervisors shall grant final plan approval, and the linen plan
can be recorded.
C. Without limitation as to other types of financial security which the
Township may approve, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, federal or commonwealth-chartered lending institution

lending institutions shall be deemed acceptable financial security for
the purposes of this section. The financial security shall provide for and
secure the completion of the improvements within one year of the date
fixed in the subdivision plan for completion of such improvements.
D. Amount of financial security. The amount of financial security shall be
equal to 110% of the cost of the required improvements for which
financial security is to be posted. The cost of the required
improvements shall be estimated as of 90 days following the date
scheduled for the completion of said improvements.
E. Basis for establishing amount of security.
(1) The cost of the improvements shall be established by submission to
the Supervisors or the Planning Commission of a bona fide bid or
§ 163-78 SPEED-TIMING DEVICES § 163-79
155:541
bids from the contractor or contractors chosen by the party posting
the financial security to complete the improvements, or, in the
absence of such bona fide bids, the costs shall be established by
estimate prepared by the Township Engineer.
(2) If the party posting the financial security requires more than one
year from the date of posting of the financial security to complete
the required improvements, the amount of financial security may
be increased by an additional 10% for each one-year period beyond
the first anniversary date from posting of financial security or to an
amount not exceeding 110% of the cost of completing the required
improvements as reestablished on or about the expiration of the
preceding one-year period by using the above bidding procedure.
In the case where development is projected over a period of years,
the Supervisors (or the planning agency) may authorize submission
of final plans by section or stages of development, subject to such
requirements or guaranties as to improvements in future sections
or stages of development as it finds essential for the protection of
any finally approved section of the subdivision or land
development.

shall prepare and submit a fair and reasonable estimate of costs of
completion of required improvements;
(2) In the event that the Township Engineer, for good cause shown,
shall recommend that the estimate be refused, the applicant and
Township shall mutually agree upon a third PE to reestimate these
costs; and
(3) The estimate of the third PE shall be presumed to be a fair and
reasonable final estimate to be adopted by both the applicant and
Township, each of which shall pay 1/2 of the fees owed the third
PE.
G. Contracts. Before the Township Supervisors shall cause their approval
to be endorsed upon the final plans of any subdivision or land
development (except in the case of minor subdivisions wherein the
Supervisors impose no condition or conditions for the approval of the
plan) and as a requirement for the approval thereof, the owners shall

individual capacity if the grantee claims an exemption from taxation
under this subsection.

transfer of stock or because of acquisition or transfer of assets that are
devoted to the business of agriculture, it fails to meet the minimum
requirements of a family farm corporation under this article.

fiscal year for which the employee is requesting to be exempted
from the local services tax. Upon receipt of the exemption
certificate and until otherwise instructed by Warwick Township,
the employer shall not withhold the tax from the person during
the calendar year or the remainder of the calendar year for which
the exemption certificate applies. Employers shall ensure that the
exemption certificate forms, which are provided by the Department
of Community and Economic Development, are readily available
to employees at all times and shall furnish each new employee
with a form at the time of hiring. For purposes of this section,
earned income and net profits shall have the same meanings as in
§ 13 of the Local Tax Enabling Act, as amended, 53 P.S. § 6913, as
amended.
(2) With respect to a person who claimed an exemption for a given
calendar year from the local services tax, upon notification to an
employer by the person or by Warwick Township that the person
has received earned income and net profits from all sources within
the Township equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that calendar year
or that the person is otherwise ineligible for the tax exemption for
that calendar year, or upon an employer's payment to the person of
earned income within the Township in an amount equal to or in
excess of $12,000 in that calendar year, an employer shall withhold
the local services tax from the person under Subsection C(3) below.
(3) If a person who claimed an exemption for a given calendar year
from the local services tax becomes subject to the tax for the
calendar year under Subsection C(2) above, the employer shall
withhold the tax for the remainder of that calendar year. The
employer shall withhold from the person, for the first payroll period
after receipt of the notification under Subsection C(2), a lump sum
equal to the amount of tax that was not withheld from the person
due to the exemption claimed by the person under this subsection,
plus the per-payroll amount due for that first payroll period. The
amount of tax withheld per payroll period for the remaining payroll
periods in that calendar year shall be the same amount withheld for
other employees. In the event the employment of a person subject
to withholding of the tax under this subsection is subsequently
severed in that calendar year, the person shall be liable for any
outstanding balance of tax due, and the Township may pursue
collection under this article.
A. No person shall be subject to the payment of the full local services tax
by more than one political subdivision during each payroll period.
B. The situs of the tax shall be the place of employment on the first day the
person becomes subject to the tax during each payroll period.

and 8426, as amended, and/or any Township ordinance or resolution
governing said refunds.
§ 171-51. Violations and penalties.
Any resident or nonresident who fails or refuses to pay the local services tax
or to render accurate information to an assessor concerning the status of
his or her employment or age shall, upon conviction thereof, be sentenced
to pay a fine of not more than $600 and, in default of payment, to
imprisonment for a term not to exceed 30 days. The Tax Collector and
Township may also proceed with all other available remedies, including but
not limited to filing an action for the recovery of any tax due or unpaid under
this article, together with interest and penalty.
C. In the event a person is engaged in more than one occupation, that is,
concurrent employment, or an occupation which requires the person
working in more than one political subdivision during a payroll period,
the priority of claim to collect the local services tax shall be in the
following order: first, the political subdivision in which a person
maintains the person's principal office or is principally employed;
second, the political subdivision in which the person resides and works,
if the tax is levied by that political subdivision; and third, the political
subdivision in which a person is employed and which imposes the tax
nearest in miles to the person's home.
D. In the case of concurrent employment, an employer shall refrain from
withholding the local services tax if the employee provides a recent pay
statement from a principal employer that includes the name of the
employer, the length of the payroll period and the amount of the local
services tax withheld and a statement from the employee that the pay
statement is from the employee's principal employer and the employee
will notify other employers of a change in principal place of employment
within two weeks of its occurrence.

any stage of a water supply emergency plan, the Authority as the
Board's designee shall cause notice of the fact to be published in a
newspaper of general circulation in the Township. Such notice shall
identify the stage of emergency and the applicable water demand
reduction measures. Water use restriction may be applied to all or
part of a service area as may be necessary.
A. The Board of Supervisors may, from time to time, modify, add to remove
or otherwise amend the standards and restrictions herein.
B. As actual operating experience with each water facility increases, it
may be necessary for the Authority to adjust the water emergency stage
trigger points required per § 187-7. Such adjustments shall be made by
revision to the applicable Water Resources Management Plan and are
not considered as an amendment to this chapter.
A. Any person, partnership, association, firm or corporation violating any
of the provisions of this chapter shall, upon summary conviction before
a District Justice, be sentenced to pay a fine of not less than $100 nor
more than $300, plus the cost of prosecution. In default of payment of

(2) B2 Cluster Subdivision.
(a) General.
[1] These regulations allow for the reduction in lot area and
other bulk requirements so that structures may be
grouped in certain areas of the development at higher
densities than are generally permitted, while the
remainder of the site is in common open space. Although
cluster regulations permit increased densities, the
provision of common open space land allows the overall
gross density of the development to be compatible with
that of the underlying zoning district.
[2] Cluster development is permitted in order to promote the
efficient use of undeveloped lands and to facilitate the
§ 195-16 WARWICK CODE § 195-16
187:666
preservation and use of open space lands for recreational
and aesthetic purposes or other general municipal or
school district uses.
[3] Cluster development shall be permitted as a conditional
use. The applicant proposing cluster development shall
have the initial burden of establishing that the proposed
conditional use meets all of the expressed standards and
criteria set forth specifically in the cluster development
regulations section and the conditional use section of this
chapter and any other general standards and criteria set
forth in other sections of the chapter.
(b) Standards for cluster development. Any development which
proposes to use a cluster design must have a significant
natural feature or features to be preserved as part of its
common open space. These features are as follows:
[1] Prime farmland: as defined in Article II of this chapter.
[2] Located within an identified floodplain area as defined in
Article II of this chapter. [Amended 3-16-2015 by Ord.
No. 2015-5]
[3] Woodland: Woodlands are areas comprised of largely
mature trees in which the largest trees measure at least
six inches dbh (diameter at breast height or 4 1/2 feet
above the ground). The woodland shall be measured from
the dripline of the outer trees. Woodlands are also 10 or
more individual trees which measure at least 10 inches
dbh and form a contiguous canopy.
[4] Steep slope: any land with a slope in excess of 8%, which,
because of this slope, may also be subject to high rates of
stormwater runoff and erosion.
[5] Wetland: an area of poorly drained soil, which is inundated
or saturated by surface water or groundwater during a
significant portion of each year and which supports a
prevalence of vegetation typical of saturated soil
conditions. In addition, wetland areas are determined by
current criteria of the United States Army Corps of
Engineers and the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection.
[6] Recreation land: areas designated for a specific
recreational use, including, but not limited to, tennis,
swimming, shuffleboard, play field, basketball court and
tot lot. Such areas shall be maintained so as to avoid
creating a hazard or nuisance and shall perpetuate the
proposed use.
§ 195-16 WATER CONSERVATION § 195-16
187:667
(c) Permitted districts and uses. Cluster subdivisions shall be
permitted in the RA and R1 Residential Districts subject to the
following provisions:
[1] Cluster subdivision, Use B2, shall be permitted as a
conditional use in the R1 Residential Districts on sites of
15 acres or larger.
[2] Cluster subdivision, Use B2, shall be permitted as a
conditional use in the RA Residential Districts as follows:
[a] On sites of 15 contiguous acres but less than 20
contiguous acres, cluster subdivision is an optional,
conditional use.
[b] On sites of 20 contiguous acres or larger, cluster
subdivision is permitted as a conditional use. Use B1
Detached Dwelling(s) is not a permitted use except
that subdivisions of not more five lots or fewer for Use
B1 Detached Dwelling(s) are permitted in any fiveyear
period. The five-year period shall be measured
from the approval of final subdivision plans for the
first lot for Use B1.
(d) Density and lot requirements for Use B2 in the R1 Residential
Districts.
[1] Minimum site area. The minimum area for a cluster
development shall be not less than 15 contiguous acres.
[2] Density. The overall density of a cluster development shall
not exceed 120% of the density permitted for Use B1
Single-Family Detached Dwelling.
[3] Lot and yard reduction.
[a] In the R1 Residential District, dimensional and/or
performance standards shall meet the following
minimum requirements:
[i] Minimum lot area (square feet): 15,000.

[ix] Building coverage: 15%.
[4] Common open space regulations.
[a] Significant natural features shall be protected as set
forth in §§ 195-60 and 195-61 of this chapter.
[b] In addition to the significant natural features, land in
common open space may contain land surrounding
historically significant structures and sites,
archaeological sites and land suitable for recreational
or other general municipal or school district uses.
[c] Stormwater detention and retention basins shall not
be considered part of any calculated common open
space.
[d] No less than 50% of the base site area shall be
designated for common open space. Additionally,
active open space shall be provided as required by
§ 195-16B(2)(d)[5] below.
[e] Active open space areas are intended to serve all
residents. Greenways shall lead to the major
recreational areas.
[f] All common open space areas shall be offered for
dedication to and for no consideration to be paid by
the Township. If the Board of Supervisors does not
accept any or all of the required open space, the open
space may be held by a homeowners' association, a
private conservation organization, or other municipal
or conservation organization. In any event, an
endorsement upon the deed and recorded in the Bucks
County Recorder of Deeds' office shall indicate that all
common open space land is restricted for use as open
space or other designated general municipal purposes
in perpetuity. The developer shall make adequate
provision for the access to and maintenance of open
space and facilities within the open space area. Said
provisions shall be subject to the approval by the
Board of Supervisors and the Township Solicitor and
shall be contained in deed restrictions which shall be
subject to the approval of the Board of Supervisors.
[5] Active open space requirements. The developer shall
provide a minimum of five acres of active open space for
each 100 units or fractional percentage thereof.

(12) H12 Extractive Operations.
(a) Definitions. As used in this subsection, the following terms
shall have the meanings indicated:
ASPHALT PLANT  An operation or plant which has as its
primary function the mixing of rock materials with asphalt oils
or other binders for road-building and construction purposes.
OWNER OR OPERATOR OF A QUARRY/EXTRACTION USE,
READY-MIX CONCRETE PLANT OR ASPHALT PLANT  The
applicant therefor and its agents when acting under this
subsection, notwithstanding any definition to the contrary in
any other law or regulation.
PENNSYLVANIA DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL
PROTECTION (DEP)  Also the successor thereto.
QUARRY/EXTRACTION OPERATION  An excavation or other
place from which an aggregate or mass of mineral matter,
whether or not coherent, is extracted by surface mining,
including but not limited to the extraction of stone, including
limestone and dolomite, gravel and sand, rock and stone,
earth, clay and topsoil, fill, slag, iron ore, zinc ore, vermiculite,
shale, slate, or other minerals or natural resources, by cutting,
digging, blasting or other means, including but not limited
to those related operations of crushing, sorting, sizing,
§ 195-16 WATER CONSERVATION § 195-16
187:771
stockpiling, or spoilpiling of such extracted materials, and
including overburden, settlement basins, borrow pits,
equipment maintenance, and parking areas. Minor excavation,
such as removal of topsoil for construction of buildings or other
structures or construction operations and blasting for removal
of rock in construction operations not qualifying as a quarry/
extraction operation, is hereby excluded.
READY-MIX CONCRETE PLANT  An operation or plant which
has as its primary function the mixing of materials to make
concrete. Excluded from the regulations of this subsection is
the mixing of concrete on a construction site on a temporary
basis or until construction on the site is completed.
(b) All other definitions in this chapter, and any other Township
ordinances, the provisions of this subsection shall control.
(c) The Township shall have the authority, by adoption of a
resolution, to establish a schedule of fees to be applied to all of
the applications, inspections and permits for the uses governed
by this subsection, including applications for conditional use,
land development, and subdivision approval for the uses
governed by this subsection and for the insurance
requirements required by the owner or operator of such uses.
(d) An applicant for conditional use and subdivision/land
development approval of any of the uses governed by this
subsection shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the
Township that all of the provisions of this subsection have been
or will be satisfied, and all the provisions of this subsection are
hereby established as specific requirements for conditional use
approval and for land development and subdivision approval.
(e) The following regulations shall govern the quarry/extraction,
ready-mix concrete plant and asphalt plant uses in Warwick
Township, and they shall apply to all three uses, except where
the context of a regulation would apply only to a particular use
or it is otherwise specified that the regulation applies to a
particular use:
[1] Soil berm.
[a] For a quarry/extraction operation, there shall be a soil
berm of a minimum height of 35 feet and a maximum
height of 40 feet, measured from the natural ground
elevation of the land prior to any development,
surrounding the entire property site, except for those
areas required for ingress and egress to the quarry/
extraction property designated on the final land
development plan approved by the Township. The
slope of the sides of the berm shall not exceed in
steepness a three-to-one ratio (horizontal to vertical);
§ 195-16 WARWICK CODE § 195-16
187:772
however, a lesser ratio and steeper slope of the berm
may be utilized, with proper stabilization, if, in the
opinion of the Township, such lesser ratio and steeper
slope of the berm are justified by geologic conditions
on the site or surrounding property, good engineering
or design practice or taking into consideration the
beneficial resultant qualities of visibility barrier to be
achieved. Berms shall be spread with topsoil and
planted with grass and other suitable vegetation.
Erosion control measures shall be provided in
accordance with the standards approved by the
United States Natural Resources Conservation
Service. As a condition for subdivision and land
development approval, the foregoing requirements for
a soil berm may be modified or waived by the
Township for that portion of the site which has natural
geologic conditions and resources which would serve
the same objectives as the soil berm and which, in
good ecological judgment, should not be disturbed
by the berm construction. By way of example and
not limitation, a steep, wooded bank might serve the
purposes of this subsection in lieu of the soil berm.
[b] The soil berm location on the site shall provide the
maximum visibility barrier to the use from locations
outside the property, and it is to be located between
the buffer yard and the use. However, the Township
may require the soil berm to be located within the
buffer yard if the geologic or natural conditions and
features of and on the site would support that
relocation or the same might enhance the required
visibility barrier.
[c] No soil berm is required specifically for ready-mix
concrete plant or asphalt plant uses, since these uses
are permitted only within the boundary of a quarry
which requires a soil berm.
[d] No quarry/extraction operations may be performed
within or under the surface of the soil berm.
[2] Buffer yard.
[a] A minimum two-hundred-foot-wide buffer yard shall
be provided and maintained along the entire outside
boundary line of a quarry/extraction property, and the
buffer yard shall be planted in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter. All plant material shall
consist of a dense screen of trees, shrubs or other
vegetation along the entire length of the lot line to
serve as a barrier to visibility, airborne particles, glare
§ 195-16 WATER CONSERVATION § 195-16
187:773
and noise and shall be in accordance with the
standards of the this chapter. Areas of ingress and
egress shall be located and sufficiently screened by
planted vegetation to form a suitable visibility barrier
between the extraction operation and the adjoining
roads and properties. The buffer yard shall be kept
free of debris and refuse at all times and shall be
maintained in a neat, tidy, and safe condition. Grass
and weeds shall be cut or trimmed regularly and as
needed to maintain a neat and clean appearance. No
quarry/extraction operations may be performed within
or under the surface of the buffer yard.
[b] A buffer yard is not required for a ready-mix concrete
or asphalt plant since the same are permitted only
inside a quarry.
[3] Minimum lot size and lot width.
[a] Minimum lot size and lot width shall be as follows:
[i] Quarry/extraction operation: 60 contiguous acres.
[ii] Ready-mix concrete plant: five contiguous acres.
[iii] Asphalt plant: five contiguous acres.
[b] Each of the uses governed by this subsection shall
have and maintain a minimum lot width of 200 feet on
a public street.
[4] Landscaping.
[a] Landscaping of the berm and buffer yard areas shall
be required in accordance with the standards of this
chapter, and the same shall be sufficient to produce,
three years after planting, a complete, all-season
visual screen of at least 10 feet in height.
[b] Any plantings in the buffer yard or berm which die or
are destroyed shall be replaced immediately or as
soon as seasonably possible.
[c] Both landscaping of the buffer yard and construction
of the berm shall be in compliance with plans
submitted to and approved by the Township.
[d] The buffer yard landscaping and plantings and the
berm construction shall be completed in accordance
with the approved plans and the provisions of this
subsection within six months after the issuance of the
initial zoning permit.
§ 195-16 WARWICK CODE § 195-16
187:774
[e] A landscape architect, licensed by the Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania, shall prepare, sign and seal the
landscaping plan for the buffer yard and any other
location on a property where any of the uses permitted
by this subsection are located and shall supervise the
installation of all landscaping and plantings.
[5] Fence. A chain-link-type fence with openings no larger
than two inches and at least 10 feet in height, surmounted
by six strands of barbed wire mounted on V-shaped arms
angled inward and outward, shall be erected within the
buffer yard and around the entire outside perimeter of the
property, except at the points of ingress and egress to the
site. The position of the fence shall be approved by the
Township and located at a point no closer than 50 feet
from the ultimate right-of-way line along a street boundary
of the property or not less than 50 feet inside the property
line not bordered by a street. The chain-link fence and
barbed wire shall be maintained in good order and repair
at all times. Points of ingress and egress shall have a gate
or gates which can and shall be locked to secure the
property after the permitted hours of operation.
[6] Warning signs.
[a] Appropriate warning signs shall be mounted or posted
along the fence required as aforesaid, at intervals of
not more than 100 feet, advising of the use, and the
same shall be maintained in good order and repair at
all times.
[b] Warning signs shall be erected, in accordance with
Pennsylvania Department of Transportation
regulations, on all public highways intersected by
internal driveways, at a point 150 feet from the
intersection of a public highway and an internal
driveway (or such lesser distance, if necessary and
required by the Township or if such distance between
the internal driveway and the public highway is less
than 150 feet) and on both sides of the intersection of
any internal driveway with a public highway. The
warning signs shall be readily visible to approaching
traffic and shall indicate that caution should be
observed and that trucks will be entering the highway.
[7] Internal driveways. For a quarry use, an adequate internal
circulation pattern of driveways shall be provided and
maintained between the excavation sites and processing
areas, and the same shall provide adequately for traffic
safety inside the boundary of the property.
§ 195-16 WATER CONSERVATION § 195-16
187:775
[8] Use of public streets, bridges, and culverts.
[a] Use of public streets, bridges, and/or culverts shall not
be permitted for any vehicles hauling between quarry/
extraction and processing areas for weigh-in or for
any other internal operations of the uses permitted by
this subsection.
[b] Before exiting a property upon which any use
governed in this subsection is conducted, all vehicles
shall be cleaned and washed so that no dust, dirt, or
other materials from the operation of such uses or
from the property on which the uses are conducted
are carried or transported beyond the property
boundary by the vehicles. Adequate washing and
cleaning facilities shall be provided and maintained in
good order and repair at all times at exit points on the
property, and the same shall be used by all vehicles to
accomplish the purposes of this subsection. All loaded
trucks leaving the facility must be covered to prevent
materials from spilling into the highways.
[c] If vehicular traffic for any use governed in this
subsection exits the use onto a Township road, it must
be established, as a condition for approval of the use,
by competent, reliable engineering and scientific
proof, that the Township street, bridge and/or culvert
has been constructed to the specifications and
standards that accommodate the expected vehicular
traffic of the use without causing damage to the
Township road to an extent greater than that which
would be expected without the operation of such use.
If such a greater extent of damage to the Township
road is established as aforesaid, then, as a
prerequisite for conditional use approval, the
Township may deny the use application or require the
owner or operator of the use to make improvements to
the Township road in order that the vehicular traffic
from the use can be accommodated in safety and
without causing damage to the Township road. The
nature and extent of such road improvements shall be
determined by the Township based on sound
engineering practice and judgment, and the costs of
such road improvements shall be paid by the owner or
operator of the use prior to and as a condition for use
approval.
[d] The owner and operator of any use governed by this
subsection shall be responsible for cleaning any
material, mud, dirt, or other debris which may be left
on the public roads and streets as a result of truck
§ 195-16 WARWICK CODE § 195-16
187:776
traffic entering or leaving the facility. This obligation
shall exist even if the trucks depositing or tracking
the materials, dirt, mud, or debris are not owned or
operated by the owner or operator of the quarry.
[9] Stop signs. Stop signs shall be erected in accordance with
Pennsylvania Department of Transportation regulations at
the intersection of all internal driveways with public
highways, halting all internal traffic in any direction before
entering upon a public highway.
[10] Caution lights. For all uses governed by this subsection,
caution lights that are approved by Pennsylvania
Department of Transportation regulations shall be
provided, having at least two blinking yellow lights on
each sign which are sufficient to attract the attention of a
passing motorist. The lights shall be attached to signs
which advise that caution should be observed due to
trucks entering ahead. The signs shall be erected on the
public highway at a distance of 300 feet from the
intersection of the public highway and internal driveway,
or less if necessary and required by the Township. At least
one sign shall face and be readily visible in each direction
of travel on the public highway. The owner/operator of the
use for which the caution lights are required herein shall
pay the cost of providing electricity for the signs, which at
all times shall be fully operational and maintained in good
order and repair.
[11] Slopes. In a quarry/extraction operation, no slope shall be
maintained for piles of extracted or excavated materials
exceeding the normal limiting angle of slippage of the
material of which the excavation or extraction is being
made, except for temporary occasions when the
excavation of sand and gravel requires exceeding that
normal limiting angle of slippage. These instances should
be minimized. No undercutting shall be permitted within
the buffer yard or beneath the berm.
[12] Lateral support. All quarry/extraction operations shall be
conducted with sufficient lateral support to be safe with
respect to hazard to persons, physical damage to adjacent
lands, and improvements and damage to any street,
sidewalk, parking area or utility by reason of slide, sinking
or collapse.
[13] Stockpiles and spoilpiles. No stockpiles and spoilpiles shall
exceed 35 feet in height above the original ground surface
level prior to the development and shall be located inside
the soil berm and buffer yard, toward the quarry
extraction use. No materials or waste deposited upon any
§ 195-16 WATER CONSERVATION § 195-16
187:777
stockpile or spoilpile shall be washed, blown, or otherwise
carried or transferred off the site by normal causes or
forces.
[14] Drainage. All drainage from the site shall be controlled by
dikes, barriers, or drainage structures sufficient to prevent
any silt, debris, or other loose materials from filling any
existing drainagecourse or encroaching on any streets or
adjacent property or entering into any stream, pond, well,
subterranean stream, or other body of water. All
operations shall comply with the Pennsylvania Clean
Streams Act206 and such other laws and regulations which
are applicable.
[15] Ground vibration. No ground vibration caused by blasting
or machinery shall exceed the limits established by all the
applicable laws and the rules and regulations which are
adopted thereunder and which are effective during the
operation of the use, with the exception that no blasting
shall cause a peak particle velocity greater than 0.5 inch
per second, measured at any location beyond the boundary
line of the property. Ground vibration for all blasting
activities shall be monitored by the quarry owner/operator
with seismic instrumentation approved by the Township as
to its proper frequency response and calibration
referenced to accepted national standards, technological
effectiveness and efficiency; and reports thereon
concerning all blasting activities, certified as to their
accuracy by the quarry owner/operator, shall be furnished
to the Township, on a monthly basis; and these reports
shall indicate the time, location and measurement of all
blasting which had taken place on the quarry property
since the previous report had been delivered to the
Township. Reports required to be furnished to DEP
concerning blasting activities also shall be sent to the
Township when the same are filed with DEP.
[16] Noise levels.
[a] The maximum permissible level of noise for the uses
permitted by this subsection shall not exceed the peak
levels allowable under 25 Pa. Code § 77.564(f)(1) and,
further, shall be limited to an hourly average
continuous A-weighted sound level which shall not
exceed 57 dbA on the A-scale when measured at the
property boundary during hours of permissible
operation, using a noise meter in compliance with the
American National Standards Institute Standard
ANSI.SI 4-1971 (R1976) Type S2A or equivalent.
206. Editor's Note: See 35 P.S. § 691.1 et seq.
§ 195-16 WARWICK CODE § 195-16
187:778
[b] The maximum permissible noise level as set forth in
this subsection shall be further adjusted as follows:
[i] If the continuous noise occurs for less than 5% of
the time, but more than 1% of the time during any
one-hour period, then five dbA may be added to
the maximum permissible noise level set forth
herein; or
[ii] If the continuous noise occurs for less than 1% of
the time during any one-hour period, then 10 dbA
may be added to the maximum permissible noise
level set forth herein.
[c] The following activities are exempt from the maximum
permissible noise levels contained herein, except in no
case shall the maximum allowable peak noise level at
the property boundary given in 25 Pa. Code §
77.564(f)(1) be exceeded nor the hourly average noise
level exceed 75 dbA with an allowed increase of five
dbA for 1% to 5% during any one hour and an increase
of 10 dbA allowed for up to 1% of any one hour:
[i] Temporary construction work and site
preparation; and
[ii] Emergency warning signals and devices.
[d] Noise levels shall be monitored by the use owner or
operator on a daily basis with the instrumentation
identified above, and reports thereon, certified as to
their accuracy by the use owner or operator, shall be
furnished to the Township on a monthly basis, and
these reports shall indicate the results of the noise
testing which had taken place on the quarry property
since the previous report had been delivered to the
Township. Reports required to be furnished to DEP
concerning noise levels for the uses permitted by this
subsection also shall be sent to the Township when the
same are filed with DEP.
[17] Air quality. Emissions from the use shall be no more than
0.02 grain of particulate per dry standard cubic foot, with
the further conditions that visible air contaminants shall
not be emitted in such a manner that the opacity of the
emissions is equal to or greater than 15% for a period or
periods aggregating more than three minutes in any one
hour or equal to or greater than 20% at any time; and
fugitive emissions shall not extend beyond the property
boundary line where any use permitted by this subsection
is conducted.
§ 195-16 WATER CONSERVATION § 195-16
187:779
[18] Odor. No malodorous air contaminants, as defined by DEP,
from any use permitted by this subsection shall be
detectable beyond the property boundary line where the
use is located.
[19]Water quality.
[a] The uses governed by this subsection shall not affect
surrounding ground and/or surface water quality with
regard to increasing the concentration in the water of
total suspended solids, total dissolved solids, total
hardness, chemical oxygen demand, biological oxygen
demand, total or fecal coliform bacteria, ammonia,
nitrate, nitrite, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, salt (as NaCl),
cyanide, iron, manganese, radioactive element or
compound, oil, grease, total petroleum hydrocarbons,
total organic halogens, total organic carbon, dioxins,
PCBs, pesticides/herbicides, phenols, phthalates, or
any chemical element or chemical compound listed by
the United States Environmental Protection Agency as
a "priority pollutant." Prior to initiating any
construction of a quarry/extraction operation, the
owner/operator of the use shall determine at its
expense, either through examination of well records
or on-site measurements as allowed by or at the
convenience of the well owner or user, the current
well water quality, including concentration of
parameters listed above.
[b] The uses governed by this subsection shall not affect
the quantity of groundwater available to private or
public water supply wells within the zone of influence
of any pumping of groundwater for any of the
foregoing uses or within one mile outside of the
property boundary of the use, whichever is greater.
The quantity of groundwater available to a well shall
be considered to be affected if, due to the use, the
static water level drops in the well one foot or more, or
the well is unable to provide 50% or less of its historic
flow rate of water. Prior to initiating any construction
of a quarry/extraction use, the owner/operator of the
use shall determine, at its expense, either through
examination of well records or through on-site
measurements as allowed by and at the convenience
of the well owner or user, the normal water level and
flow rate of each well within one mile of the boundary
line of the quarry/extraction use property. The owner/
operator of this use shall provide the record of these
initial water levels and flow rates to the Township and
to the well owner or user.
§ 195-16 WARWICK CODE § 195-16
187:780
[c] The uses governed by this subsection shall not affect
the quantity of surface water available in any surface
water body within one mile from the property
boundary line of the use. The quantity of water
available shall be considered to be affected if, due to
the use, the water level in a pond, lake, brook, stream
or river decreases one foot or more or if the water flow
decreases 0.1 of a cubic foot per second (cfs) or more.
Prior to initiating any construction of a quarry/
extraction use, the owner/operator of the use shall
determine, at its expense, either through examination
of existing records or through on-site measurements,
the normal water quantity, water level and water flow
rate of each surface water body within one mile of the
property boundary of the use. The owner/operator of
the quarry/extraction use shall provide the record of
these initial water level and flow rates to the
Township.
[d] In order to establish a baseline of groundwater
conditions and to serve as an early warning of the
impact of a quarry/extraction use on groundwater
quality and quantity, a series of monitoring wells shall
be installed around the periphery of the property, at
locations determined and approved by the Township,
prior to initiating construction of a quarry/extraction
operation. At least one well shall be installed every
500 linear feet. The monitoring wells shall be installed
in accordance with the practices prescribed by the
United States Environmental Protection Agency
Environmental Monitoring Systems Laboratory. The
monitoring wells shall be installed so as to provide
data on groundwater quality and quantity from each
underground aquifer which is likely to be affected by
the construction and operation of the quarry/
extraction use. The initial measurements of
groundwater quality and quantity shall be provided to
the Township. The monitoring wells shall be tested
monthly as to water level and water quality
parameters, and the results thereof shall be provided
to the Township. The report shall indicate whether
there has been any significant change in water level,
which shall be defined as greater than a one-foot drop,
or water quality, which shall be defined as an increase
in any parameter of 25% or greater, since the previous
report or cumulatively during the previous reports.
The Township may, at its discretion, decrease the
frequency of monitoring to quarterly or less often for
some or all of the wells and testing parameters. The
Township may, as the results of a significant change in
§ 195-16 WATER CONSERVATION § 195-16
187:781
water quality or quantity, as noted in the reports or
by an expert consultant in hydrogeology hired by the
Township, require increased monitoring at the
existing or additional wells to be constructed, a
change in quarry/extraction practices to avoid impact
on water quality or quantity in off-site wells or a
cessation in quarry/extraction operations until the
quarry owner/operator can demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the Township's hydrogeological expert
consultant that continued operations, modified as
appropriate, will not significantly impact on water
quality or quantity available to off-site wells.
[20] Native raw materials. If quarry/extraction operation use is
lawfully combined with either or both ready-mix concrete
plant and asphalt plant uses, the primary or principal

discontinuance for a period of one year of the quarry/
extraction operation or the completion of the
excavation of a portion of an entire operation which
can feasibly be restored, reclaimed or rehabilitated
separately from other portions of the quarry/
extraction operation and which is not necessary to
such operation. Normal benching operations for
sloping purposes shall not be construed as requiring
the commencement of rehabilitation. Such
rehabilitation or reclamation shall be completed
within five years from the date the same is
commenced except where a longer period of time is
§ 195-16 WATER CONSERVATION § 195-16

§ 195-16 WATER CONSERVATION § 195-16
187:821
conformance with manufacturer's instructions and the
regulations promulgated by the PADEP and set forth in
this chapter unless the manufacturer's instructions are
stricter than the regulations promulgated hereunder, in
which case the manufacturer's instructions shall apply.
[Amended 3-7-2011 by Ord. No. 2011-1]
[2] The outdoor wood-fired furnace may burn only those
materials approved by PADEP. [Amended 3-7-2011 by
Ord. No. 2011-1]
[3] No person may operate an outdoor furnace unless it is
upon a lot of at least two acres in size. Any outdoor woodfired
furnace shall meet the required setbacks for principal
uses in the district in which the furnace is located,
provided that in no event shall a furnace be less than 50
feet from the nearest property line nor less than 200 feet
from the nearest residence which is not served by the
furnace. [Amended 3-7-2011 by Ord. No. 2011-1]
[4] The chimney height shall be determined by the distance
from the nearest residence not served by the furnace as
follows:
[a] Fifty feet to 100 feet: height of the eave line of the
tallest residence not served plus two feet.
[b] One hundred feet to 250 feet: 75% of the height of the
eave line of the tallest residence not served plus two
feet.
[c] Two hundred fifty feet or more: minimum of
manufacturer's recommendation.
[d] Due to the rolling topography of the Township, there
may be circumstances where the furnace may be
located in a depressional area, with adjacent home(s)
located at a higher elevation. In these situations, the
Township may require the chimney must be at a
greater height, in order to be, in fact, higher than the
eave of the adjacent house. The Zoning Hearing
Board, upon recommendation from the Building
inspector, may approve a lesser height on a case-bycase
basis if necessary to comply with manufacturer's
recommendations and if the property owner can
demonstrate that the smoke from the lower chimney
height does not create a nuisance for neighbors. Any
exception to required height granted under this
subsection is contingent upon the lower height not
being a nuisance to neighboring residences and is
§ 195-16 WARWICK CODE § 195-16
187:822
subject to further modification by the Zoning Hearing
Board.
[5] The outdoor wood-fired furnace shall be operated and
maintained to meet all emission standards required by the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the
Underwriter's Laboratory (UL) listing. This documentation
must be provided at the time the permit is applied for.
[6] All processed wood products used for fuel in outdoor
wood-fired furnaces must be screened from sight.
Processed wood products include, but are not limited to,
pallets, crates and cut lumber. These fuel items must be
screened from public view of roads and lot lines. Screening
may consist of solid fences, evergreens or similar types of
fencing. All nonprocessed wood products used for fuel in
outdoor wood-fired furnaces may be stored on the
property without required fencing. Nonprocessed wood
products would be cut wood that has not been treated with
paint, stain or any other products.
(b) Permits required.
[1] No person shall install, use, or maintain an outdoor woodfired
furnace without first having obtained a zoning permit
and a building permit from the Township Building
Inspector.
[2] Permit fees shall be established by resolution of the Board
of Supervisors.

shall comply with the following standards. Site alterations, regrading,
filling, or clearing of vegetation prior to the submission of applications for
zoning or building permits or the submission of plans for subdivision or land
development shall be a violation of this chapter. In the event that two or
more resources overlap, the resource with the greatest protection standard
(the least amount of alteration, regrading, clearing or building) shall apply
to the area of overlap.
A. Floodplains. Any use or activity within an identified floodplain area
shall comply with the provisions of the Warwick Township Floodplain
Ordinance.214 [Amended 3-16-2015 by Ord. No. 2015-5]
B. Floodplain soils. All such areas shall not be altered, regraded, or built
upon. Roads and utilities may cross floodplain soils where design
approval is obtained from the Township and the Pennsylvania
Department of Environmental Protection and where no other
reasonable access is available. Floodplain soils shall not be used where
a floodplain has been delineated in accordance with the Warwick
Township Floodplain Ordinance.215 [Amended 3-16-2015 by Ord. No.

altered, regraded, cleared, or built upon.
E. Streams, watercourses, wetlands, lakes, or ponds. Such areas shall not
be altered, regraded, developed, filled, piped, diverted, or built upon
except that roads and utilities may cross streams, watercourses, and
wetlands where design approval is obtained from the Township and the
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection and where no
other reasonable access is available.
(1) In the event that a wetlands delineation validated by the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers (ACOE) is shown to vary from the wetlands
boundary derived from the definition in § 195-9 of this chapter, the
ACOE delineation will govern. The wetlands margin will then be
measured from the ACOE-delineated boundary.
F. Lake or pond shorelines. No more than 20% of such areas shall be
altered, regraded, filled or built upon.
G. Stormwater. All applicants proposing development in the Township
should review their proposals with the Township to assess the impacts

217. Editor's Note: See 35 P.S. § 691.1 et seq.
§ 195-60 WARWICK CODE § 195-60
187:880
applicant shall demonstrate compliance with the requirements of
this section for all applications for zoning or building permits.
(2) Where an existing or proposed on-site sewage treatment system
with either surface discharge or subsurface discharge is proposed
adjacent to a stream or water body, including lakes, ponds, and
wetlands, it shall be set back not less than 300 feet from the edge
or bank of such stream or water body to ensure that the
contaminated water moves through the soil a sufficient distance to
allow contaminants to be removed by the soil before discharging
into a stream or water body.
J. Prime farmland in the RA District. On a tract(s) containing 20 acres or
more, no more than 50% of prime farmland as defined in § 195-9 of this
chapter may be developed.
K. Riparian corridor preservation.
(1) Establishment. The establishment of the Riparian Corridor
Conservation District (RCCD) applies to all streams and tributaries
as well as perennial and intermittent streams leading to those
streams and including all lakes and ponds shown on the map
included in the Township's Official Sewage Facilities Plan (Act 537
Plan).
(2) A residential lot legally in existence as of the effective date of this
chapter may expand the area of the principal building on the lot by
not more than 25% of the ground-floor area of the principal
building on the property as of the effective date of this chapter
without the provisions of the RCCD being applicable.
(3) Measurement of the RCCD boundary shall extend a minimum of 75
feet from each defined edge of an identified watercourse or surface
water body at the top of the bank, or shall equal the extent of the
one-hundred-year floodplain, whichever is greater. The district will
consist of two distinct zones designated as:
(a) Zone One.
[1] This zone will begin at each edge of an identified waterway
(which can include wetlands and intermittent
watercourses) and occupy a minimum width of 25 feet
measured horizontally on a line perpendicular to the topof-
bank. The width of Zone One may be required to extend
beyond the minimum 25 feet depending upon existing
topography, woodlands, and other natural conditions.
[2] Where steep slopes (in excess of 25%) are located within
25 feet of a municipally designated watercourse, Zone One
shall extend the entire distance of this sloped area. If the
distance of this sloped area is greater than 75 feet, there
will be no requirement for the establishment of Zone Two.
§ 195-60 WATER CONSERVATION § 195-60
187:881
If the distance is less than 75 feet, the width of Zone Two
will be adjusted so that the total corridor width (Zone One
and Zone Two) will be 75 feet maximum.
(b) Zone Two.
[1] This zone will begin at the outer edge of Zone One and
occupy a minimum width of 50 feet in addition to Zone
One, unless modified herein.
[2] Where the one-hundred-year floodplain extends greater
than 75 feet from the waterway, Zone One shall remain a
minimum of 25 feet wide, and Zone Two shall extend from
the outer edge of Zone One to the outer edge of the onehundred-
year floodplain.
(c) Width determination. The developer, applicant, property owner
or designated representative shall be responsible for the initial
width determination of the riparian corridor and identifying
this area on any plan that is submitted to the municipality for
subdivision, land development, or other improvements that
require plan submissions or permits. This determination shall
be subject to review by the Township Engineer.
(4) Uses permitted in the RCCD. The following uses are permitted,
either by right or as a conditional use, in the RCCD. Within any
corridor, however, no construction, development, use, activity, or
encroachment shall be permitted unless the activity is described in
the corridor management plan.
(a) Zone One.
[1] Uses permitted by right. Open space uses that are
primarily passive in character shall be permitted to extend

guidelines in the corridor management plan. The
entire basin shall be located a minimum of 50 feet
from the defined edge of identified watercourses.
(5) Uses specifically prohibited in the RCCD. Any use or activity not
authorized by Subsection L(4) of this section shall be prohibited
within the RCCD. By way of example, the following activities and
facilities are specifically prohibited:
(a) Clear-cutting of trees and other vegetation.
(b) Selective cutting of trees and/or the clearing of other
vegetation within Zone One or Two except where such clearing
is necessary to prepare land for a use permitted herein and
where the effects of these actions are mitigated by
revegetation, as specified herein.
(c) Removal of trees in excess of selective cutting, except where
such removal is necessary as a means to eliminate dead,
diseased, or hazardous tree stands that jeopardize public
safety or as part of a reforestation project, provided that the

(b) The district may also be inspected periodically by the
municipal representatives for compliance with an approved
restoration plan, excessive or potentially problematic erosion,
hazardous trees, or at any time when the presence of an
unauthorized activity or structure is brought to the attention of
Township officials.
(7) Management of the Riparian Corridor District.
(a) Corridor management plan. Within any Township-identified
corridor area, no construction, development, use, activity, or
encroachment shall be permitted unless the effects of such
development are accompanied by implementation of an
approved corridor management plan.
(b) The developer, applicant or property owner shall submit to the
Township Engineer a corridor management plan, prepared by a
landscape architect, engineer, or other qualified professional,
which fully evaluates the effects of any proposed uses on the
Riparian Corridor Conservation District. The corridor
management plan shall identify the existing conditions
(vegetation, one-hundred-year floodplain, soils, slopes, etc.),
all proposed activities, and all proposed management
techniques, including any measures necessary to offset
disturbances to the Riparian Corridor Conservation District.
The plan shall be approved by Township Council as part of the
subdivision and land development process.
(c) Vegetation selection. To function properly, dominant vegetation
proposed to be planted in the corridor management plan shall
be selected from a list of plants most suited to the riparian
corridor. Plants not included on the lists may be permitted
when evidence is provided from qualified sources certifying
their suitability.
§ 195-60 WATER CONSERVATION § 195-60
187:885
[1] In Zone One, dominant vegetation shall be composed of a
variety of native riparian tree and shrub species and
appropriate plantings necessary for stream bank
stabilization.
[2] In Zone Two, dominant vegetation shall be composed of
riparian trees and shrubs, with an emphasis on native
species and appropriate plantings necessary to stabilize
the soil.
[3] Disturbed areas shall be revegetated with riparian
corridor plants, in compliance with an approved corridor
management plan.
[4] Areas that cannot be revegetated shall be restored in
compliance with an approved corridor management plan.
[5] Where natural wooded areas, meadows, and old fields do
not exist within the stream protection area, the applicant
shall be required to either plant native species
characteristic of the indigenous vegetation community or
allow the adjacent areas to become reestablished by native
plant communities through the natural process of
succession. For the purpose of this section, "native
species" shall include wooded areas, meadows, and old
fields and shall be defined as follows:
MEADOWS  A natural community consisting primarily
of herbaceous plant material, such as grass, sedges and
reeds, with few or no woody plants.
OLD FIELDS  Areas consisting primarily of herbaceous
plant species, such as goldenrod, buttercups, milkweed
and daisies, with some woody plant species, such as
cedars, sumac, blackberries, and raspberries.
WOODED AREAS  Areas consisting of oak, chestnut,
hickory or hardwood species characteristic of the original
forests of southeastern Pennsylvania, including ash,
beech, maple, birch, dogwood, and others. Wooded areas
generally consist of a well-developed canopy with
understory trees, shrubs, and herbaceous layer and
provide valuable aesthetic and environmental benefits,
including wildlife habitat and erosion control.
(8) The disturbance standards described in this section shall apply to
all uses and activities established after the effective date of this
chapter, provided that residential accessory uses will be permitted
in the RCCD on residential lots in existence as of the effective date
of this chapter.

square feet shall be identified for location of the sewage disposal
system in addition to the "buildable area" specified in Subsection
A(1) above. Such additional area shall not include natural features
with a one-hundred-percent protection standard and the portion of
those natural features that may not be developed or intruded upon
as specified in this article.
(3) Applicants for zoning permits and/or subdivision or land
development approval shall submit the following information:
(a) A site plan which illustrates all natural resources on the site
and the proposed use on the site; and

and land developments. Through these calculations, the net buildable
site area, maximum number of lots or dwelling units, maximum amount
of impervious surface, and required open space will be determined for
the site.
(1) Base site area. Calculate the base site area. From the total site
area, subtract future road rights-of-way (for existing roads); land
which is not contiguous or which is separated from the parcel by an
arterial or collector road, railroad, Neshaminy Creek or Little
Neshaminy Creek; or land shown on previous subdivision or land
development plans as reserved for open space and/or natural
resource protection.

(2) Land with resource restrictions and resource protection land. All
land within the base site area shall be mapped and measured for
the purpose of determining the amount of land that is nonbuildable
due to the presence of natural resources. First, indicate the entire
amount of natural resources that exist on the tract. Calculate the
amount of land containing the natural resource that is required to
be preserved by multiplying the amount of land in resource by the
resource protection ratio. In the event that two or more natural
resources overlap, only the resource with the highest protection
ratio shall be used in the calculations.

A. Purpose of open space. In order to ensure adequate open space,
agricultural and recreational areas to serve the future residents of
Warwick Township, all residential land developments, industrial and
office park developments, and major residential subdivisions shall
include suitable and adequate open space and recreation areas and/or
facilities to serve the needs of the residents of the community.
B. Layout and quality of open space.
(1) Common open space.
(a) Common open space shall be a parcel or parcels of land within
a development site logically located and interrelated,
interconnected and designed to disperse density and separate
individual development clusters. Common open space shall not
include any streets or street rights-of-way, off-street parking
areas, stormwater management facilities (including, but not
limited to, detention basins), minimum required yard areas,
minimum lot areas or areas required for active open space.
Common open space shall be free of surface structures except
those existing structures determined by the Township to be of
historical or aesthetical importance. Common open space may
contain subsurface structures, conduits, pipes or other utilities
determined to be necessary by the Township, provided that
they are properly restricted and subject to necessary
easements to the satisfaction of the Township. Required
common open space areas may include no more than 70%
natural resources protection area, provided that the location
and configuration of the proposed common open space meets
the requirements of this definition as determined by the
Township. Common open space may be set aside and
maintained in one or a combination of the ways upon approval
of the Township as set forth in this chapter.
(2) Active open space.
(a) Active open space shall be a parcel of land located by
determination of the Township, which is generally flat, dry, and
clear of any trees or other vegetation other than grass
(exclusive of required yard and buffer areas) and which is
suitable for agricultural use or active recreational use, such as
baseball, football, soccer, tennis, basketball, or other general
municipal or school district uses. Active open space areas shall
§ 195-61 WARWICK CODE § 195-62
187:892
not merely be left over or unusable land. It shall be laid out to
the satisfaction of the Board of Supervisors according to sound
site design principles. Except where the active open space is
suitable for and restricted to agricultural uses, active open
space shall be accessible to a maximum number of residents.
Active open space shall be one single area or a few large areas
linked by a common means of access and circulation. Active
open space shall be contiguous to the developed area and
not separated from it by existing roads or streets unless safe
pedestrian access can be provided. Active open space areas
shall be developed by the applicant according to the Township
requirements. In general, active open space shall have an area
of not less than five acres. If, based on the requirements of this
chapter, a tract of less than five acres would result, the Board
may require such land to be located on the periphery of the
development so that a tract of sufficient size will result when
additional active open space land is obtained via dedication
when adjacent land is developed. The recreation facilities or
other general municipal or school district uses and design of
active open space areas shall be subject to the approval of
the Board of Supervisors. At the discretion of the Township
Supervisors, the required active open space, recreational
facilities, or other general municipal or school district uses
may be provided.
(3) Ownership of open space. The following forms of open space shall
be acceptable. The Township Board of Supervisors shall determine
which form is appropriate for each development:
(a) Dedicated open space: "Dedicated open space" is defined as an
area or areas dedicated in fee simple to the Township for use
by all residents or general municipal or school district uses.
(b) Homeowners' association: ownership by a planned community
association incorporated in accordance with the Planned
Community Act (68 Pa.C.S.A. § 5101 et seq, as amended), and
established to the satisfaction of the Township Solicitor.
(c) Private ownership: When the Board of Supervisors is assured
through easement and restrictions of record that the property
may only be used for agricultural purposes, the Board of
Supervisors may approve private ownership of the open space.
The easement or restriction of record shall include a clause
providing that the open space shall revert to the Township in
the event it is no longer used for agriculture.
(4) Fee-in-lieu of open space. Where the Board of Supervisors, after
conferring with the Park and Recreation Board, finds that, because
of the size, shape, location, accessibility, contour, or slope of the
land or other physical features, any of the land to be provided as
active or common open space by this chapter (the Zoning
§ 195-62 WATER CONSERVATION § 195-62

§ 195-63. Buffer yards.
Buffering serves to soften the outline of buildings, screen glare and noise,
and create a visual and/or physical barrier between conflicting land uses.
Ordinance) herein is unsuitable for recreation purposes or other
general municipal or school district uses as required by this
chapter, the Supervisors shall require the payment of a fee in lieu
of such land to the Township prior to approval of each final section
of the overall plan by the Board of Supervisors. Said fees shall be
used for acquisition, development, expansion, or maintenance of
recreation and open space land.
(a) The amount of the fee shall be 100% of the fair market value of
the improved land in the particular subdivision, determined at
the time of final plan approval. If agreement cannot be reached
between the developer and the Township on this value, the
amount shall be determined by an independent, licensed land
appraisal firm acceptable to the Township and developer who
shall offer the value based on the value of land upon which
houses can be built subsequent to the approval of the final
plan. The appraiser shall be hired by the Township and the
appraisal costs shall be equally divided between the developer
and the Township.
(5) Recreation facilities. Recreation facilities must be provided for
active open space areas as per the requirements of Chapter 163,
Subdivision and Land Development.
(6) Cumulative open space requirements. Any subdivision or land
development of any tract which occurs after November 16, 1998,
the effective date of the 1998 Warwick Township Zoning Ordinance,
will be cumulative for the purpose of determining the number of
lots in order to calculate active open space requirements set forth
in Article III, Use Regulations, of this chapter. The required open
space shall be based on the total (cumulative) number of lots or
units as of the most recent subdivision. The total (cumulative)
number of lots shall be calculated by adding the number of lots in
the current subdivision to the number of lots subdivided from the
parcel in existence as of the effective date of this subsection.
A. The extent of buffering required shall be determined by the type of use
proposed and the adjacent uses or streets surrounding the proposed
development. The impact of the proposed use on adjoining properties is
the basis for establishing buffer yard standards.
B. To determine the required buffer yard and planting schedule, a threestep
procedure shall be followed.
Step 1: Site analysis and determination of buffer yard class
Step 2: Selection of the planting option for the buffer class
§ 195-62 WARWICK CODE § 195-63
187:894
Step 3: Selection of the plant materials from the plant materials
list
(1) Site analysis and determination of buffer yard class. For each
property boundary, the applicant shall determine the adjacent land
use or street classification. Land use information shall be
determined by an on-site survey. Chapter 163, Subdivision and
Land Development, shall be utilized to determine street
classifications (refer to Appendix220). The applicant shall match the
proposed land use with the corresponding adjacent land use,
Zoning District, or street classification for each property boundary
(refer to Table 1221). The letter indicates the buffer yard class,
unless otherwise specified for a specific use set forth at § 195-15 or
195-16. [Amended 3-7-2011 by Ord. No. 2011-1]
(2) Selection of the planting option for the buffer class.
(a) After determining the buffer class, the applicant shall select a
planting option from Table 2.222 For each buffer class, several
planting options are available, one of which the applicant shall
select to meet the buffer yard requirement for each boundary.
The Board of Supervisors may consider an alternative planting
option and/or use of solid fencing which shall have a screening
capability equal to, or greater than, any of the available
options.
(b) The options included indicate the amount of plant material that
is required per linear foot of property line. Plantings are not
required to be aligned on property or right-of-way boundaries,
but may be located on any appropriate portion of the buffer
yard. Grouping of plant materials is encouraged, except where
a solid screen is desirable.
(3) Selection of plant materials from the plant materials list. Each
planting option may utilize plant materials outlined in the
Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance.223 The Board of
Supervisors may permit other planting types if they are hardy to
the area, are not subject to blight or disease, and are of the same
general character and growth habit as those listed in the
Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance. Solid fencing may
also be used when approved by the Board of Supervisors.
(4) The applicant may be relieved of the requirement to install buffer
yard plantings should existing vegetation, topography, or man-

In the event that an applicant proposes to alter, clear, or regrade an area
of woodlands in excess of the maximum permitted by §§ 195-60 and 195-61,
the applicant shall be required to reforest the area of woodlands which was
required to be preserved and shall not develop or disturb any portion of the
made structures be deemed acceptable for screening purposes by
the Board of Supervisors.
C. Planting materials shall be in accordance with the planting
requirements and acceptable plant lists set forth in the Warwick
Township Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance (Chapter 163
of this Code).
D. General buffer yard requirements.
(1) The buffer yard may be coterminous with required front, side, or
rear yards and, in case of conflict, the larger yard requirements
shall apply.
(2) All buffer yards shall be maintained and kept clean of all debris,
rubbish, weeds, and tall grass in conformance with existing
regulations.
(3) No structure, manufacturing, or processing activity, parking or
other paved surfaces, or storage of materials shall be permitted in
the buffer yard except access driveways and fences permitted
pursuant to § 195-16B(12) of this chapter. [Amended 6-18-2018
by Ord. No. 2018-1]
(4) At a minimum, a Class B buffer shall be maintained along each side
and/or rear property line where other than a B1 residential use
directly abuts an existing residential use.
(5) Planting design. It is encouraged that plant materials in buffer
yards be planted in natural clusters that will give privacy but do not
block views or vistas. The exception shall be commercial or
industrial uses bordering residential uses where a dense, visual
screen is encouraged.
(6) The buffer yard may be part of the open space area or individual
lots.
(7) Prior to the issuance of any zoning permit, complete plans showing
the arrangement of all buffer yards, the placement, species and
size of all plant materials, and the placement, size, materials, and
type of all fences to be placed in such buffer yard shall be reviewed
by the Zoning Officer, Township Engineer, and/or Planning
Commission (where applicable) to ascertain that the plans are in
conformance with the terms of this chapter.

A. The total number of caliper-inches of the trees to be removed, in excess
of the 20% permitted by right, shall be determined.
B. The resulting figure shall be multiplied by 0.80 to determine the total
number of caliper-inches to be replaced on the lot.
C. The amount of caliper-inches determined in Subsection B above shall
then be divided by three to determine the total gross number of trees to
be planted on the lot for reforestation.
D. Replacement trees shall meet the following specifications:
(1) Trees shall meet the following minimum size requirements:
(a) Deciduous trees shall be a minimum of three inches to 3 1/2
inches in caliper (meeting the American Association of
Nurserymen specifications).
(b) Coniferous trees shall be a minimum of eight feet to 10 feet in
height.
(2) The types of trees to be planted shall be selected on the basis of the
tree list and guidelines found in this article. Trees shall be
compatible with existing forest association.
(3) Up to 25% of the new trees to be planted may be of the coniferous
variety.
(4) Where 25 or more trees need to be planted to meet the
reforestation requirements, a minimum of three tree species shall
be planted.
E. Trees required to be planted under these reforestation procedures shall
be in addition to any street trees or buffer requirements which this
article or any other applicable ordinance shall require.
F. Replacement trees may be dispersed throughout the proposed
development or throughout Warwick Township at locations approved by
the Board of Supervisors. [Amended 6-18-2018 by Ord. No. 2018-1]

meter having an A-weighted filter constructed in accordance with
specifications of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI).
Measurements are to be made at any point on the boundary line of
any residential, commercial or other district property within the
Township.
(2) Impact noise shall be measured using the fast response of the
sound level meter. Impact noises are intermittent sounds such as
from a punch or drop forge hammer. Measurements are to be made
at any point on the boundary line of any residential, commercial or
other district property within the Township.
(3) In all zoning districts, as defined and designated under the
provisions of the Code of Warwick Township, at no point on or
beyond the boundary of any adjacent property shall the sound level
of any person, property, residence, business or corporation exceed
the dBA levels shown in Table I below. Between the hours of 10:00
p.m. to 7:00 a.m., the permissible sound levels shall be reduced by
20 decibels as measured under the test procedures established
under this chapter.

§ 195-70. Glare and heat; outdoor illumination.
This section provides for the regulation of intense heat and glare,
specifically for outside lighting to reduce the intensity to the minimum
required for safety and commercial purposes and to reduce to an absolute
minimum the spillover of light and glare, horizontally and skyward for
persons on adjacent properties, roads, operators of motor and other types
of vehicles and pedestrians.
A. Standards.
(1) All zoning districts of the Township:
(a) This chapter shall apply when exterior lighting is first installed
or substantially modified. Cumulative modification or
replacement of exterior lighting constituting 25% or more of
the permitted lumens for the parcel, no matter the actual
amount of lighting already on a nonconforming site, shall
constitute a substantial modification for purposes of this
section.
(b) An exterior lighting plan is required to be submitted for the
Township's review and approval whenever an application for a
zoning permit, building permit, or land development is made.
The lighting plan must include all the information necessary
for the Township to ensure that the outdoor lighting complies
with the requirements of this section, and prior to issuance of a
zoning permit and construction of the outdoor lighting
installation. The submission shall contain, but shall not
necessarily be limited to, the following:
[1] Plans indicating the location on the premises of each
illuminating device, both proposed and any already
existing, on the site;
[2] Description of all illuminating devices, fixtures, lamps,
supports, reflectors, both proposed and existing. The
description may include, but is not limited to, catalog cuts
and illustrations by manufacturers (including sections
where required);
[3] Photometric data, such as that furnished by manufacturers
or similar data showing the angle of cutoff of light
emissions; and
[4] Descriptions and data sufficiently complete to enable the
official or reviewer to readily determine whether
compliance with the requirements of this chapter will be
secured. If such plans, descriptions and data cannot
enable this ready determination, the application shall
additionally submit as evidence of compliance to enable
such determination such certified reports of tests as will

industrial, office, institutional, and multifamily uses shall be
provided with a minimum of 0.9 footcandle (with
corresponding uniformity ratios for maximum to minimum and
average to minimum of 20:1 and 4:1 respectively) of
illumination at any point on the intended area on the ground
consistent with the use.
(e) All outside lighting shall be directed such that the projected
light and glare are within property or lighting area lines with
the cutoff angle arranged to avoid projecting light on adjacent
properties, roads or skyward. Cutoff angles shall not exceed
72° from the vertical.
(f) All luminaries shall be designed or equipped with shielding so
that the light source (bulb, filament, etc.) within the luminaire
is not visible outside the intended illuminated area. The
intended illuminated area shall not extend beyond the
boundaries of the property on which the light source is located.
(g) The spacing and height of poles should be designed to provide
uniform ground illumination with a minimum number of poles
and the lowest possible height of poles while minimizing stray
light outside the intended lighted area and skyward. The
maximum pole height for residential areas shall be 12 feet;
parking lots for commercial and institutional areas shall be 20
feet; and 25 feet for parking lots in industrial areas. Lighting,
other than parking lot lighting, for commercial, institutional,

224. Editor's Note: See Ch. 62, Construction Codes, Uniform.
§ 195-70 WATER CONSERVATION § 195-70
187:903
[6] Low-wattage, low-intensity landscape lighting is exempt
from this requirement providing stray light does not
infringe on adjacent or nearby properties or roads.
(p) Luminaires which do not meet the strict definition for cutoff
luminaires, yet employ advanced or alternative technology
which causes the photometric performance to approach that of
cutoff luminaires, may be approved by the Township on a caseby-
case basis. Such luminaires include, but are not limited to,
period-style luminaires with refractive globes and internal
cutoff reflectors.
(2) Additional requirements:
(a) Residential security lighting.
[1] All security lighting fixtures shall be shielded and aimed so
the illumination is directed at only to the designated area
and not cast on other areas. In no case may the light
extend past the property line nor shall lighting be directed
above a horizontal plane through the top of the fixture, and
said fixture shall include shields that prevent the light
source or lens from being visible from the adjacent
properties, roadways and sidewalks.
[2] All residential security lighting shall include primers and
motion sensors to be designed to be off unless triggered or
such triggering shall be limited to movement occurring
exclusively on the subject property. Once triggered,
security lighting shall remain on for not more than five
minutes without manual intervention.
(b) Residential lighting.
[1] The use of general floodlighting fixtures for other than
occasional use shall be prohibited. All residential spot or
floodlamps are to be aimed at no higher than 60° below
horizontal. In no case shall the spot or floodlamp be aimed
above the roof eave.
[2] The light source or bulb for all exterior lights shall not be
directly visible from the adjacent properties or roadways.
[3] Temporary seasonal lighting displays are permitted;
however, flood or spotlighting associated with such
displays must conform with this chapter.
[4] All lighting in model or sample homes, except security
lights illuminated by a motion detector, shall be turned off
within one hour of the sample or model home closing for
the day or 9:00 p.m. prevailing time, whichever is earlier.
§ 195-70 WARWICK CODE § 195-70
187:904
[5] Only low-output, fully shielded, luminaires may be utilized
for landscape lighting, and the use of spotlights or
floodlights is specifically prohibited. Lighting fixtures shall
not be directed towards adjacent streets or roads nor shall
they contribute glare, disabling glare, discomfort player,
light trespass, or sky glow.
(c) Private outdoor recreation lighting.
[1] Outdoor lighting of private tennis courts and sports courts
shall be permitted only by conditional use. The applicant
shall bear the burden of proving that the proposed lights
do not impact or offend abutting property owners or the
community in general. In no case may such lights be
placed on properties of less than three acres and in no
case may the light be closer than 200 feet to the nearest
property line. The Board of Supervisors may, at its sole
discretion, require the addition of buffer plantings or
exercise other options to minimize the impact lights have
on neighboring properties, roads, and/or the community at
large.
[2] All luminaires shall be designed or equipped with shielding
so that the light source (bulb, filament, etc.) within the
luminaire is not visible outside the intended illuminated
area. The intended illuminated area shall not extend
beyond the boundaries of the property on which the light
source is located. All light shall be limited to 15 feet in
height and be extinguished by 10:00 p.m. Lighting fixtures
shall be specified, mounted and aimed so that their beams
fall within the primary playing area and immediate
surroundings, and so that no direct illumination is directed
off the site.
(d) Outdoor sports and recreational lighting. These regulations
apply to all sports and recreational facilities including, but not
limited to, ball fields, ballparks, stadiums, tennis courts,
basketball courts, soccer fields, recreation fields, swimming
pools, skating rinks, golf driving ranges, golf courses, and the
like. Where permitted, the outdoor lighting of sports and
recreational facilities shall comply with the following
requirements:
[1] The requirements of this subsection apply to all outdoor
lighting installations employed for nighttime area
illumination of sports and recreational facilities. All sports
and recreational facilities shall be illuminated with the
following two systems:
[a] Performance area lighting. This is the lighting
directed upon the field, court, rink, etc., to illuminate
§ 195-70 WATER CONSERVATION § 195-70
187:905
the sports/recreational activity taking place upon/
within that facility. The maximum permitted post
height for the performance area lighting is 60 feet.
Post height shall be limited to minimum height
necessary to meet the performance area lighting
needs of that specific sports/recreational use as
determined by the Township.
[b] General area lighting. This is a low-level lighting
system used to facilitate pedestrian circulation,
patrons leaving the facility, cleanup, nighttime
maintenance, etc. General area lighting shall meet all
of the requirements listed above.
[2] Use of cutoff luminaires required. All luminaires employed
in outdoor sports and recreational lighting installations
shall be the cutoff luminaire type unless the performance
area lighting needs of the sports/recreational use cannot
be met through the use of cutoff luminaries, as determined
by the Township.
[3] Use of glare shields required for noncutoff luminaire
types. Where noncutoff luminaires such as floodlights
must be used to meet the lighting design objectives for the
performance area lighting, the luminaires shall be
equipped with glare shields, visors, barn doors, and other
similar shielding accessories as required to meet the
following criteria:
[a] The candlepower distribution from all lighting
installations shall be cutoff at and above the horizontal
(level).
[b] To the extent practicable, the candlepower
distribution from all lighting installations shall be
further cutoff at angles below the horizontal (level) to
restrict direct illumination to within the performance
area being illuminated for sports and recreation
purposes.
[c] No direct illumination shall project off the property.
[4] Design submittal and approval requirements. The design
for all outdoor sports and recreation lighting installations
shall be submitted for review and approval by the
Township.
[5] All outdoor sports and recreation lighting shall be
extinguished between 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. on Sunday
through Thursday nights and between 11:00 p.m. and 9:00
a.m. on Friday and Saturday nights and nights preceding
federal holidays. In addition, the performance area
§ 195-70 WARWICK CODE § 195-70
187:906
§ 195-71. Outdoor storage and waste disposal.
lighting shall be turned off no more than 30 minutes after
the end of the event or use of the sports/recreational
facility.
(3) Communication towers. Communications tower lighting is
prohibited unless required by the FCC (Federal Communications
Commission) or FAA (Federal Aircraft Administration) regulations.
(4) Temporary lighting. Unless the lighting poses a risk to the health,
safety, and welfare, temporary or seasonal lighting (except as
prohibited elsewhere in this chapter for residential uses) is exempt
from these regulations. Unless the lighting poses a risk to the
health, safety and welfare, temporary commercial activities such as
carnivals are also exempt if the temporary commercial activity lasts
no more than 10 consecutive days' use.
(5) Nuisance prohibition. All outside lighting, including sign lighting,
shall be directed in such a way as not to create a nuisance in any
agricultural, institutional, or residential area. In all areas of the
Township, all lighting shall be arranged so as to protect the street
or highway and adjoining properties from direct glare or hazardous
interference of any kind. All luminaires shall be equipped with a
glare-shielding device.
(6) Light source covering. All luminaires and light sources shall be
covered so that the source of light is not visible from any adjacent
property.
(7) Overlay districts. Properties in overlay districts may also be subject
to additional lighting requirements of overlay districts.
A. No flammable or explosive liquids, solids, or gases shall be stored in
bulk aboveground; provided, however, that tanks or drums of fuel
directly connecting with energy devices, heating devices or appliances
located on the same lot as the tanks or drums of fuel are excluded from
this provision.
B. All outdoor storage facilities for fuel, raw materials and products; and
all fuel and all raw materials and products stored outdoors; and all
waste disposal dumpster areas shall be enclosed by an adequate fence
or other enclosure to provide security for the property. Outside storage
and waste disposal areas shall be shielded from view from public
streets and adjoining properties. The enclosure shall be made
aesthetically pleasing to the community.
C. No materials or wastes shall be deposited upon a lot in such form or
manner that may be transferred off the lot by natural causes or forces.
Dikes must be constructed around aboveground liquid storage facilities
to preclude such transference in the event of failure of the facility.

ARTICLE XX
Regulations Governing All Districts; Parking Requirements
§ 195-74. Lot area or yard required.
The lot or yard requirements for any new building or use shall not include
any part of a lot that is required by any other building or use to comply
with the requirements of this chapter. No required lot or area shall include
any property, the ownership of which has been transferred subsequent to
the effective date of this chapter, if such property was a part of the area
required for compliance with the dimensional requirements applicable to
the lot from which such transfer was made.
§ 195-75. Minimum lot area.
§ 195-76. Exceptions to minimum lot areas.
A. Where a minimum lot area is specified, no principal building or use
shall be erected or established on any lot of lesser size than as specified
in Articles IV through XVIII, except as specified in § 195-76.
B. In addition, if a parcel or property proposed for subdivision is subject to
a restrictive covenant under Act 319, and is located in a zoning district
requiring a minimum lot size of greater than one acre, the following
provisions shall apply:
(1) The minimum lot size for each lot in the subdivision shall be 43,560
square feet provided the Act 319 regulations for the subdivision are
met.
(2) All other applicable zoning regulations including lot width and yard
setbacks shall apply.
A. The provisions of this chapter shall not prevent the construction of a
single-family detached dwelling on any lot that was lawful when created
and which, prior to the effective date of this chapter, was in separate
ownership duly recorded by plan or deed, and provided that:
(1) Such lot is not less than one acre in the RA District and not less
than 80% of the minimum lot area in all other districts.
(2) Those lots not served by public water and sewer shall meet all
requirements of the Bucks County Department of Health.
(3) The percentage of lot area covered by the detached dwelling shall
not exceed 15% of the area of the lot.
(4) Front and rear yards shall aggregate at least 60% of the total lot
depth or meet the normal requirements of the district in which the
lot is located; but in no case shall either the front yard or the rear
yard be less than 30 feet.
§ 195-74 WATER CONSERVATION § 195-76
187:909
§ 195-77. Minimum lot width; lane lots.
No principal building shall be erected on any part of a lot which has a width
less than that specified in Articles IV through XVIII, except as specified
in § 195-76 or in the case of lane lots. Lane lots may be permitted as an
exception to the minimum lot width requirement at the building setback line
as defined in § 195-9. A lane lot is a parcel of land which does not have the
required minimum lot width at the minimum front yard line but has direct
access to a public street through a narrow strip of land which is part of the
same lot. The lot lines of the narrow portion of the lot (the lane) shall be
parallel or nearly parallel.
(5) The side yards shall aggregate at least 40% of the total lot width or
meet the normal requirements of the district in which the lot is
located, but in no case shall either side yard be less than 12 feet.
B. This exception shall not apply to any two or more vacant contiguous lots
in a single ownership as of or subsequent to the effective date of this
chapter. These lots shall be consolidated to minimize the nonconformity.
A. Lane lot may serve one detached dwelling only.
B. Each lot must have a separate lane.
C. Lane lots may not be used in a subdivision of lots containing any new
streets.
D. If the proposed lane lot is not large enough to further subdivide under
the zoning requirements at the time the subdivision is proposed, then
the lane shall have a minimum width of 25 feet at the street line of a
public street and shall not narrow to a lesser dimension. However, if the
proposed lot is large enough to further subdivide under the zoning
requirements at the time the subdivision is proposed, then the
minimum lane width shall be 50 feet at the street line and shall not
narrow to a lesser dimension; provided, however, that should the
property owner agree by plan notation and recorded document that the
lot will not be further subdivided, then a lane of 25 feet in width shall be
sufficient.
E. The area of the lane shall not be included in the calculation of the
minimum lot area.
F. Only one tier of lane lots will be permitted on a tract.
G. The front yard setback for a lane lot shall be a distance equal to the
front yard requirements for the district in which the lot is located and
shall be measured from the point where the lot first obtains a minimum
lot width measurement.
H. The length of the lane shall be limited to a maximum length of 500 feet.
I. The improvement requirements of Chapter 163, Subdivision and Land
Development, shall be met.
§ 195-76 WARWICK CODE § 195-77
187:910

No portion of a building or structure shall be built within the minimum
depth of front, side or rear yards as specified in the dimensional
requirements for each zoning district (Articles IV through XVIII), except
in accordance with this section. A proposed building may be constructed
nearer to the street than a required minimum front yard depth under the
following conditions:
§ 195-79. Off-street parking regulations.
J. Lane lots of three or more will not be permitted if a public street could
feasibly be constructed.
A. There shall be existing buildings on the lots on either side of lot which
would contain the proposed building.
B. The proposed building would front on the same side of the same street
in the same block as the existing buildings on lots on either side.
C. The existing buildings on the lots on either side would be no greater
than 50 feet from the proposed building.
D. The proposed building may be constructed at a front yard depth that is
not less than the average of the front yard setbacks of the existing
buildings on the lots on either side.
E. In no case shall the front yard of the proposed building be less than 20
feet.
F. Ground-story bays, porches, and chimney flues may project into
required yard areas no more than three feet. Such projections into the
required minimum yard areas shall not occupy more than 1/3 the length
of the building wall. Cornices and gutters may project no more than two
feet over a required yard. Fire escapes may be permitted in accordance
with this section in side or rear yards only.
G. The provisions of this section shall not apply to fences, hedges or walls
less than six feet high above the natural grade in the required yard, nor
to terraces, steps, decks, or uncovered patios, except that no such
uncovered patio or deck may be built or extend more than 50% within
the minimum depth of side or rear yards as specified in Articles IV
through XVIII.
A. Ingress and egress for nonresidential uses shall be designated so that
vehicles shall not be required to back out onto a street or another lot.
Whenever possible, ingress and egress for residential uses shall be
designed so that vehicles shall not be required to back out onto a street
or another lot.
B. Parking areas for all uses except residences shall be designed to permit
each motor vehicle to proceed to and from the parking space provided
§ 195-77 WATER CONSERVATION § 195-79
187:911
for without requiring the moving of any other motor vehicle. Wherever
possible, parking areas for residential uses shall be designed to permit
each motor vehicle to proceed to and from the parking space without
requiring the moving of any other motor vehicle.
C. Structures and uses in existence at the date of the adoption of this
chapter shall not be subject to the requirements of this section so long
as the kind or extent of use is not changed, provided that any parking
facility now serving such structures or uses shall not, in the future, be
reduced below such requirements.
D. Whenever there is an alteration of a structure or a change or extension
of a use which increases the parking requirements according to the
standards of this chapter, the total additional parking required for the
alteration, change or extension shall be provided in accordance with
the requirements of that section.
E. No parking area shall be used for any use that interferes with its
availability for the parking need it is required to serve.
F. All required facilities shall be provided and maintained so long as the
use exists which the facilities were designed to serve. Off-street parking
facilities shall not be reduced in total extent after their provision,
except upon the approval of a special exception by the Zoning Hearing
Board for reason of diminution in floor area, seating area, number of
employees or change in other factors controlling the regulation of the
number of parking spaces.
G. Two or more uses may provide for required parking in a common
parking lot if the total space provided is not less than the sum of the
spaces required for each use individually. However, the number of
spaces required in a common parking facility may be reduced below
this total by special exception if it can be demonstrated to the Zoning
Hearing Board that the hours or days of peak parking needed for the
use are so different that a lower total will provide adequately for all
uses served by the common parking facility. The uses utilizing the
common parking facility shall be located on the same parcel or shall be
located on contiguous parcels, but in no event shall the common
parking area be located on the opposite side of an arterial or collector
street. [Amended 6-18-2018 by Ord. No. 2018-1]
H. Off-street parking spaces shall be provided in accordance with the
appropriate use regulations of § 195-16. For any use where parking
provisions are not specifically listed in § 195-16, the number of parking
spaces required shall be determined by the Board of Supervisors upon
the recommendation of the Planning Commission and the Township
Engineer.
I. All areas for the loading and unloading of delivery trucks and other
vehicles for servicing of establishments and/or shops by refuse
collection, fuel, or their service vehicles, shall have adequate and
§ 195-79 WARWICK CODE § 195-79
187:912
unobstructed access from a street, service driveway, or alley and shall
be so arranged that they may be used without blocking or otherwise
interfering with the use of automobile accessways, parking facilities, or
pedestrian ways or backing out onto a street.
J. Maintenance of parking areas. For parking spaces of three or more
vehicles, the area not landscaped and so maintained, including
driveways, shall be graded, surfaced with asphalt or other suitable
material, and drained to the satisfaction of the Township Engineer to
the extent necessary to prevent dust, erosion, or excessive water flow
across streets or adjoining property. All parking lots for commercial
purposes shall be paved in accordance with the standards within
Chapter 163, Subdivision and Land Development. All off-street parking
spaces shall be marked so as to indicate their location. Failure to keep
parking areas in satisfactory condition, i.e., from holes, clearly
delineated, or properly graded, shall be considered a violation of this
chapter.
K. Off-street loading. Off-street parking requirements as specified herein
shall be provided on any lot on which a building exceeding 6,000 square
feet of gross floor area for business, industry, or otherwise indicated is
hereafter erected.

§ 195-80. Reduction of nonresidential parking requirements.
In order to prevent the establishment of a greater number of parking spaces
than is actually required to serve the needs of nonresidential uses, the
Board of Supervisors, after consulting with the Planning Commission and
Township Engineer, may permit a conditional reduction of parking space if
the following conditions are satisfied:
§ 195-81. Street access.
For all nonresidential uses, access to roads shall be at least 200 feet from
the intersection of any street lines.
inflammables or other potentially dangerous materials shall be
parked overnight in residential areas.
A. This conditional reduction of parking space shall apply to any permitted
institutional, commercial or industrial uses.
B. The design of the parking lot, as indicated on the land development
plan, must designate sufficient space to meet the parking requirements
of this chapter. The plan shall also illustrate the layout for the total
number of parking spaces.
C. The conditional reduction may provide for the establishment of not less
than 80% of the required number of parking spaces, as specified in this
chapter. This initial phase of the parking provision shall be clearly
indicated on the plan.
D. The balance of the parking area conditionally reserved shall not include
areas for required buffer yards, setbacks or areas which would
otherwise be unsuitable for parking spaces due to the physical
characteristics of the land or other requirements of this chapter. This
parking area which is reserved shall be located and have
characteristics so as to provide amenable open space should it be
determined the additional parking spaces are not required. The
developer shall provide a landscaping plan for the reserved area with
the land development plan.
E. The developer shall enter into a written agreement with the Board of
Supervisors providing for the installation of the reserved parking areas
upon recommendation and review by the Township Engineer at any
time after the issuance of the last occupancy permit. The additional
parking spaces shall be provided at the developer's or owner's expense
should it be determined by the Township that the required number of
parking spaces are necessary to satisfy the need of the particular land
development.
F. Land which has been determined and designated by the Board of
Supervisors to remain as open space rather than as required parking
shall not be used to provide parking spaces for any addition or
expansion but shall remain as open space.

Nonconformities
§ 195-82. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
NONCONFORMING STRUCTURE OR LOT  A structure or lot, or part
of a structure or lot, which does not comply with the applicable area,
dimensional, parking, buffer, height, environmental or other provisions of
this chapter or amendment heretofore or hereafter enacted, where such
structure or lot lawfully existed prior to enactment of such ordinance or
amendment. Such nonconforming structures include, but are not limited to,
nonconforming signs. Nonconforming lots are also governed by § 195-76 of
this chapter.
NONCONFORMING USE  A use, whether of land or of structure, which
does not comply with the applicable use provisions in a zoning ordinance or
amendment heretofore or hereafter enacted, where such use was lawfully
in existence prior to the enactment of such ordinance or amendment.
§ 195-83. Buildings under construction.
A building for which a valid building permit has been issued and is actually
under construction to the extent of completion of footings may be completed
as a nonconforming use. Buildings for which no permit has been issued or
for which the footings have not been completed at the time of passage of
this chapter shall be built in conformity with its requirements.
§ 195-84. Change of use.
Once changed to a conforming use, no structure or land shall be permitted
to revert to a nonconforming use. A nonconforming use may be changed to
another nonconforming use only under all of the following conditions:
A. Such change shall be permitted only as a special exception by the
Zoning Hearing Board.
B. The applicant shall show that a nonconforming use cannot reasonably
be changed to a permitted use.
C. The applicant shall show that the proposed change will be less
objectionable in external effects than the existing nonconforming use,
with respect to:
(1) Traffic generation and congestion including truck, passenger car,
and pedestrian traffic.
(2) Noise, smoke, dust, fumes, vapors, gases, heat, odor, glare, or
vibration.
(3) Storage and waste disposal.
§ 195-82 WATER CONSERVATION § 195-84
187:917
§ 195-85. Discontinuation or abandonment.
No nonconforming use which has been abandoned or discontinued shall be
resumed. For purposes of this section, cessation of use for the period of one
year shall raise a presumption of abandonment or discontinuance, and no
use which has ceased for one year shall be resumed except upon special
exception by the Zoning Hearing Board, which shall only be given when
the Board is satisfied that the applicant has overcome the presumption of
abandonment or discontinuance.
§ 195-86. Extension of nonconformity.
§ 195-87. Destruction of building.
A nonconforming building which has been damaged or destroyed by fire,
explosion, accident or calamity (as contrasted to deterioration due to time
or neglect) may be reconstructed and used for the nonconforming use,
(4) Appearance and aesthetics.
A. A structure that does not conform with the dimensional, area, parking,
buffer, environmental and all other requirements of the district in this
chapter may be extended only if the extension meets all of the
requirements of this chapter. Such a structure may be extended by right
along the building lines of the existing nonconformity in keeping with
all applicable provisions of this chapter.
B. Any lawful nonconforming use of a portion of a building may be
extended throughout the building and any lawful nonconforming
building or any building of which a lawful nonconforming use is made
may be extended upon the lot occupied by such buildings and held in
single and separate ownership on the effective date of this chapter,
provided that the area of the building or structure in which the use is
located shall not be increased by more than a total of 25% of the area of
such building existing on the date it first became a lawful
nonconforming building or a building of which a lawful nonconforming
use is made, and provided, further, that any structural alteration,
extension or addition shall conform to all the height, area, width, yard
and coverage requirements for the district in which it is located. A
nonconforming use conducted mostly out of doors shall not be
increased to occupy more than an additional 25% of the square footage
actively devoted to the nonconforming use on the date the use first
became nonconforming, provided that the expansion shall comply with
applicable area and dimensional requirements of this chapter.
C. Permission to extend a nonconforming use as described in this article
shall not be construed to mean that a new use or uses may be
established. A nonconforming use shall be prohibited from encroaching
on another parcel of land subsequently added to the original parcel. A
structure which is nonconforming in terms of height shall not be
extended to increase the height.
§ 195-84 WARWICK CODE § 195-87
187:918
provided that the reconstructed building shall not exceed in height, area
and volume the building destroyed and that the building reconstruction

A nonconforming building which has been legally condemned shall not be
rebuilt or used except in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
§ 195-89. Signs.
Any sign existing at the time of passage of this chapter and which was
legally erected that does not conform with these regulations shall be
considered a nonconforming sign. Owners of property upon which a
nonconforming sign exists shall make application for a registration of the
nonconformity with the Zoning Officer for a determination as to the sign
nonconformity. Failure of an owner to comply with this provision shall be a
forfeiture of the right to use the nonconforming sign or to transfer its use to
a subsequent owner or tenant of the property.
§ 195-90. Identification and registration.
A. Upon request by the Board of Supervisors or a property owner who
desires to register a nonconforming use, structure or lot, and
subsequent to the provision by the property owner of documentation
and verification of the proposed nonconforming use, structure or lot,
the Zoning Officer shall identify and register a nonconforming use,
structure or lot as follows:

used car lots).
(b) Nonconforming uses of conforming buildings (for example, a
funeral home utilizing an old residence in a residential
district).
§ 195-87 WATER CONSERVATION § 195-90

(c) Nonconforming uses of buildings usable only for
nonconforming purposes (for example, a gasoline service
station in a residential district).
(d) Buildings that are nonconforming only so far as they violate
dimensional regulations.

shall be evidence of abandonment of the same.
C. The Zoning Officer at any time may challenge any registration by
ordering the same stricken or amended in any respect, which order
shall be conclusive and shall determine the nature and scope of the
nonconforming use or structure unless appealed within 30 days of
receipt of the order to the Zoning Hearing Board.
D. The registration of a nonconforming use or structure shall be prima
facie evidence of the validity of the nonconforming use or structure
until such time as the Zoning Officer challenges the registration.

§ 195-117. Variances.

E. In order that a landowner may be assured in an expeditious manner
that the ordinance or map under which he proposes to build is free from

be made to this chapter or the Zoning Map by the following procedure:
(1) The landowner may submit plans and other materials describing
his proposed land use or development to the Zoning Officer for a
preliminary opinion as to their compliance with the applicable
zoning ordinance or map. These plans need not meet the required
standards for preliminary, tentative or final approval as long as
they provide a sufficient basis for a preliminary opinion as to their
compliance.
(2) If the Zoning Officer's preliminary opinion is that the proposed use
or development complies with this chapter or the Zoning Map,
notice thereof shall be published once each week for two
successive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the
Township. The favorable preliminary opinion of the Zoning Officer
shall be deemed as preliminary approval, and that time specified
for initiating action before the Board shall commence upon the
publishing of the second public notice.
F. When a substantive challenge is upheld by the Zoning Hearing Board or
a curative amendment is approved by the governing body, the applicant
has two years from the date of approval to file for subdivision approval

provisions of this chapter inflict unnecessary hardship upon the
§ 195-116 WATER CONSERVATION § 195-117
187:937
§ 195-118. Special exceptions.
appellant. The Board may grant a variance, provided that the following
findings are made where relevant in a given case:
(1) That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity, narrowness or shallowness of lot size or
shape or exceptional topographical or other physical conditions
peculiar to the particular property, and that the unnecessary
hardship is due to such conditions and not the circumstances or
conditions generally created by the provisions of this chapter in the
neighborhood or district in which the property is located.
(2) That, because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there
is no possibility that the property can be developed in strict
conformity with the provisions of this chapter and that the
authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to enable the
reasonable use of the property.
(3) That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
appellant.
(4) That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is
located nor substantially or permanently impair the appropriate
use or development of adjacent property nor be detrimental to the
public welfare.
(5) That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance that will afford relief and will represent the least
modification possible of the regulation in issue.
B. In granting any variance, the Board may attach such reasonable
conditions and safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement the
purpose of this chapter.
C. Life of decision. A variance granted by the Zoning Hearing Board in
accordance with this section shall expire one year from the date of the
decision, unless the applicant or owner or successor in interest has
commenced construction within that time. Construction will be deemed
commenced upon the issuance of a building and/or zoning permit for
the approved use.
A. The Zoning Hearing Board shall have the power to approve special
exceptions when this chapter specifically requires the obtaining of such
approval and for no other use or purpose.
B. The Zoning Hearing Board shall grant a special exception only if it finds
adequate evidence presented by the applicant that the proposed special
exception is duly authorized under provisions of this chapter; that the
application falls within the terms of the specific provisions allowing for
special exceptions; and that the proposed use complies with all other
§ 195-117 WARWICK CODE § 195-118
187:938

The Zoning Hearing Board shall hear the following matters:
requirements of this chapter. The Zoning Hearing Board, in granting
a special exception, may attach such reasonable conditions and
safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement the purpose of
this chapter. The Board shall, among other things, require that any

(1) In accordance with the Township Comprehensive Plan and
consistent with the spirit, purpose and intent of this chapter.

request an advisory opinion from the Planning Commission on any
application for a conditional use, and the Planning Commission will
submit a report of such advisory opinion prior to the date of the public
hearing held by the Board. The Planning Commission may request a
report from the Township Engineer.
