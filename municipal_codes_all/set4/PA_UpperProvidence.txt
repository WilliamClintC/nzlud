following the 55th birthday, provided that the aforesaid
criteria are satisfied. Extension of service beyond normal
retirement age shall be based primarily upon the officer's
health and the good of the service; or
[2] A police officer who received an honorable discharge from
the Upper Providence Township Police Department after
having served in the Township for an aggregate of not less
than 20 years in accordance with Act 24 of 1998,19
provided that the amount of pension benefits shall be
reduced by a ratio of the years of service at retirement
divided by years of service at the superannuation
retirement date and shall be further actuarially reduced
for early payout. The ratio shall be as follows:
[a] Twenty years = 20/25.
[b] Twenty-one years = 21/15.
[c] Twenty-two years = 22/25.
19.Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 771.
§ 28-6 MANAGER, TOWNSHIP § 28-7

(b) A police officer who has suffered a permanent service-related
disability shall be eligible to receive a monthly service-related
disability benefit of no less than 50% of the officer's salary at
the time of disability. This service-connected disability benefit
shall be reduced only by payment of social security disability
benefits for the same injury. The gross monthly compensation
is to be calculated using the twelve-month average of the gross
monthly compensation of the officer prior to the onset of the
disability. The gross monthly compensation of a participant is
the amount paid as a base salary on an anniversary date of the
plan, computed on a monthly basis, plus overtime and
longevity pay, but excluding premiums, bonuses and other
nonrecurring compensation. [Amended 4-7-2003 by Ord.
No. 424]
(2) Intentionally self-inflicted injuries or death shall not be considered

on the part of a member shall not be considered service-connected.
B. Normal retirement benefit. [Amended 2-1-1999 by Ord. No. 379]
(1) The normal monthly retirement benefit of a police officer retiring
under § 28-7A(1)(a) shall be 1/2 of the average monthly gross
compensation (as reflected on the W-2 form) received during the
last 36 months of employment.
(2) The first monthly pension benefit shall be paid to the eligible
person on the first day of the month following the month of the
effective date of retirement and shall continue for life in equal
monthly payments, as adjusted by cost of living increases, ceasing
in the month of death.
(3) Monthly benefits.
(a) The monthly benefits determined under this subsection shall
be computed as the sum of:
[1] Any pension benefits from pension plans heretofore
established by a private organization or association for the
members of the police force, but only to the extent that the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or any of its municipalities
shall have contributed to such pension plan moneys raised
by taxation.
[2] Benefits from the Police Pension Plan of Upper Providence
Township established pursuant to this article to the extent
§ 28-7 UPPER PROVIDENCE CODE § 28-7
24:64
necessary to bring the total benefits in any month up to
1/2 the aforesaid average monthly gross compensation (as
reflected on the W-2 form).
(b) For the purpose of computing monthly benefits, there shall be
no Social Security offset.
(c) The normal monthly retirement benefit shall be increased each
January 1 by the lesser of 3% per year or the percentage
increase in the consumer price index from the year in which
the police member last worked, subject to a maximum increase
in the normal monthly retirement benefit of 30%. In no event
will the total normal monthly retirement benefit exceed 75% of
the average monthly gross compensation (as reflected on the
W-2 form) received during the last 36 months of employment.
C. Disability retirement benefit. [Amended 2-1-1999 by Ord. No. 379]
(1) The monthly retirement benefit of a police officer retiring under
§ 28-7A(1)(b) shall be 1/2 of the average monthly gross
compensation (as reflected on the W-2 form) received during the
last 36 months of employment.
(2) The first monthly pension benefit shall be paid to the eligible
person effective the first day of the disability, as determined by a
board-certified physician, and shall continue for life in equal
monthly payments, ceasing in the month of death. [Amended
4-7-2003 by Ord. No. 424]
(3) Monthly benefits.
(a) The monthly benefits determined under this subsection shall
be computed as the sum of:
[1] Any pension benefits from pension plans heretofore
established by a private organization or association for the
members of the police force, but only to the extent that the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or any of its municipalities
shall have contributed to such pension plan moneys raised
by taxation.
[2] Benefits from the Police Pension Plan of Upper Providence
Township established pursuant to this article to the extent
necessary to bring the total benefits in any month up to 1/2
the aforesaid average monthly gross compensation (as
reflected on the W-2 form).
(b) For the purpose of computing monthly benefits, there shall be
no Social Security offset.
(c) The disability retirement benefit shall be increased each
January 1 by the lesser of 3% per year or the percentage
increase in the consumer price index from the year in which
§ 28-7 MANAGER, TOWNSHIP § 28-7
24:65
the police member last worked, subject to a maximum increase
in the normal monthly retirement benefit of 30%. In no event
will the total normal monthly retirement benefit exceed 75% of
the average monthly gross compensation (as reflected on the
W-2 form) received during the last 36 months of employment.
D. 20Deferred retirement option provision (DROP). [Added 12-15-2008
by Ord. No. 498]
(1) Establishment of DROP. A DROP shall be available to police officers
who qualify for and apply for such option pursuant to this
Subsection D.
(2) DROP eligibility. A police officer who is eligible for a normal
retirement benefit pursuant to § 28-7B, or will be eligible for a
normal retirement benefit prior to participation in the DROP, is
eligible to participate in the DROP by filing a written application
with the plan administrator at least 30 days before the employees
effective date of DROP participation.
(3) Election to participate in DROP. An eligible participant may elect to
participate in the DROP for a period not to exceed five years. Upon
deciding to participate in a DROP, an eligible participant must
submit, on forms provided by the plan administrator, a binding and
irrevocable written election which discloses the participants intent
to retire, specifies the effective date of DROP participation,
specifies the participants final retirement date (no later than five
years after the effective date of DROP participation), which shall be
the DROP termination date, and designates a beneficiary or
beneficiaries. Such election must detail a DROP participants rights
and obligations under the DROP and include an agreement to
forego active membership in the plan, any growth in the salary
base used for calculating the regular retirement benefit, and any
additional benefit accrual for retirement purposes. The DROP
participant shall be required to provide by other information
required by the Township.
(4) Calculation of DROP retirement benefit. Upon receipt of a
participants election forms to participate in DROP, the Township
shall calculate the normal retirement benefit pursuant to § 28-7B as
of the employees DROP participation date.
(5) Credits to DROP account. A DROP shall be established in the name
of the DROP participant for purposes of accumulating DROP
retirement benefits during DROP participation. Starting with the
calendar month following the DROP participation date, the amount
of the DROP retirement benefit shall be credited to the DROP
participants DROP account each month during DROP
participation. The DROP retirement benefit shall be adjusted

by Ord. No. 379.
§ 28-7 UPPER PROVIDENCE CODE § 28-7
24:66
annually by the lesser of 3% per year or the percentage increase
in the consumer price index from the previous year. In addition,
interest shall be credited to the DROP account. The annual rate
of interest shall be 4.5% and shall be compounded and credited
monthly. A separate accounting of the DROP participants
accumulated DROP account shall be calculated annually and
provided to the participant.
(6) DROP participation termination. A DROP participant may change
the DROP termination date to an earlier date, and no penalty shall
be imposed for early termination of DROP participation. Notice
should be provided to the Township at least 60 days prior to any
such early termination, except in the case where the DROP
participant incurs a permanent service-related disability. Upon
either early or regular termination of DROP participation, the
DROP participant shall be separated from employment with the
Township and the retirement plan shall pay the balance in the
DROP participants DROP account to the terminating participant as
provided in § 28-7D(7), and the DROP participant shall be ineligible
to reenroll in the DROP thereafter even if the former DROP
participant is reemployed by the Township with renewed active
membership in the plan.
(7) Payment of DROP benefits. On the effective date of a DROP
participants termination of employment with the Township,
participation in the DROP shall cease and the plan shall pay to the
participant total accumulated value of the participants DROP
account. Such distribution shall be considered an eligible rollover
distribution. The terminating DROP participant shall commence
receipt of the monthly DROP retirement benefit directly, starting
with the calendar month following termination of employment with
the Township.
(8) Death of a DROP participant. If a DROP participant dies, the DROP
participants surviving spouse shall be entitled to receive the
benefits accumulated in the participants DROP account. In
addition, a monthly benefit shall be paid to the surviving spouse if
the participant previously elected a form of benefit payment for the
participants DROP retirement benefit that would provide for
payments after death to a beneficiary or contingent annuitant.
Such monthly benefit payments shall commence the calendar
month following the death of the DROP participant.
E. Survivor benefits. [Amended 2-1-1999 by Ord. No. 379]
(1) The family of any member who is on active duty status and who dies
of any cause and the family of any member who is retired and who
dies of any cause shall receive the following benefits: [Amended
4-7-2003 by Ord. No. 424]
§ 28-7 MANAGER, TOWNSHIP § 28-7
24:67
(a) The surviving spouse of such member shall receive a monthly
payment equal to 50% of such member's pension benefit,
including benefits received by said surviving spouse under
federal social security laws on account of such member, until
the surviving spouse dies, when such benefits shall terminate.
(b) After the death of the surviving spouse, an officer's surviving
child or children under the age of 18 years, or if attending
college, under the age of 23 years old, shall receive the 50%

of a felony or crime of moral turpitude or death, cease to be employed
as a full-time police officer by Upper Providence Township, in whose
pension plan he has been a member, he shall be entitled to a refund of
all moneys paid by him into the fund, plus all interest earned on such
moneys as provided in § 28-6F of this article, or to vest his retirement
benefits by filing with Upper Providence Township within 90 days of the
date he ceases to be a full-time police officer a written notice of his
intention to vest. Upon reaching the date which would have been his
superannuation retirement date if he had continued to be employed as a
full-time officer, he shall be paid a partial superannuation retirement
allowance determined by applying the percentage his years of service
bear to the years of service which he would have rendered had he
continued to work until his superannuation retirement date to the gross
pension, using the monthly average compensation during the
appropriate period prior to his termination of employment. Such
pension or retirement benefits for any month shall be determined in
accordance with § 28-7B, C or E of this article. If an officer dies prior to
vesting in his or her pension, the surviving spouse or, if the spouse is
deceased, any child or children under the age of 18, or age 23 if
attending college, is entitled to 100% of the officer's contributions
together with any interest thereon, unless the officer has designated
another beneficiary. "Attending college" is defined as the child being
enrolled in an institution of higher learning and carrying a minimum
course load of seven credits per semester.22

to the committee of a candidate, nor any committee supporting multiple
candidates where any supported candidate is seeking the office of Township

court interpretations of, the Pennsylvania Election Code.28 A person shall be
considered a candidate on the date on which they file candidacy papers with
the Montgomery County Board of Elections, or the first date on which they
publicly announce an intention to run for the office of Supervisor, whichever

committee that does not have the stated purpose of supporting a candidate
for Township Supervisor but which subsequently makes a contribution to
a candidate for Township Supervisor. The terms of this chapter may not
be avoided by having the work that is the subject of the agreement done

described.

of services or goods not covered by the open bidding process as above
described shall sign an affidavit stating that he/she/it is aware of the
provisions of this chapter and has not made a contribution in violation of
it. The form for such affidavit will be prepared by staff in conjunction with
the Solicitor. A copy of this chapter and the affidavit will be distributed with
any Township letter which solicits nonbid proposals or which is responding
to an inquiry from a person or entity interested in providing materials or
services not subject to competitive bidding, and will also be distributed to
all persons or entities who are currently providing services or materials that
were not subject to competitive bidding.

provisions of this chapter is then serving as a consultant or professional
to the Township, a violation of this chapter will disqualify them from
continuing to provide services to the Township.

apply:
(1) An excavation which does not exceed three feet in vertical depth at
its deepest point measured from the natural ground surface nor
cover an area of more than 1,000 square feet. This exception shall
not affect the applicability of this chapter to or the requirement of a
grading permit for any fill made with the material from such
excavation.
(2) A fill which does not exceed 10 cubic yards of material on any one
site or a fill which does not exceed three feet in vertical depth at its
deepest point measured from the natural ground surface nor cover
an area of more than 1,000 square feet, provided that the surfaces
of such fills do not have a slope at any point steeper than five
horizontal to one vertical.
(3) An excavation below finished grade for basements and footings of a
building, swimming pool or underground structure authorized by a
building permit and excavation for a driveway between a building
site and the street. This exception shall not affect the applicability

streets and alleys, buildings, trees over 10 inches in diameter two
feet above the ground and sufficient dimensions and other data to
show the location of all work; a description of the type and
classification of the soil; details and the location of any proposed
drainage structures and pipes, walls and cribbing; and the nature
of fill material and such other information as the Township
Engineer may require to carry out the purposes of this chapter. All
plans shall be dated and bear the name of the person who prepared
the same, the applicant and the owner of the land. Plans shall be
submitted in triplicate.
(3) State the estimated dates for the starting and completion of the
grading work.
(4) State the purpose for which the grading application is filed.

§ 99-6. Expiration of permit.
Every grading permit shall expire by limitation and become null and void
if the work authorized by such permit has not been commenced within six
months or is not completed within one year from the date of issue, provided
that the Township Engineer may, if the permit holder presents satisfactory
evidence that unusual difficulties have prevented work being started or
completed within the specific time limits, grant a reasonable extension of
time, and provided further that the application for the extension of time is
made before the date of expiration of the permit.
§ 99-7. Denial of permit; appeal.
§ 99-8. Inspections.
A. Where, in the opinion of the Township Engineer, the work as proposed
by the applicant is likely to endanger any property or any street or alley,
he shall deny the grading permit. In determining whether the proposed
work is likely to endanger property or streets or alleys or create
hazardous conditions, the Township Engineer shall give due
consideration to possible saturation by rains, earth movements, runoff
of surface waters and subsurface conditions such as the stratification
and faulting of rock and the nature and type of the soil or rock.
B. The Board of Supervisors shall consider promptly appeals from the
provisions of this chapter or from the determination of the Township
Engineer, and the Board shall make determinations of alternate
methods, standards or materials when, in its opinion, strict compliance
with the provisions of this chapter is unnecessary. Any applicant or
permit holder shall have the right to appeal to any court of competent
jurisdiction from any decision of determination of the Board of
Supervisors.
A. The Township Engineer shall, when requested, make inspections
hereinafter required and shall either approve that portion of the work
which has been completed or notify the permit holder wherein the same
fails to comply with the provisions of this chapter. Where it is found by
inspection that the soil or other conditions are not as stated or shown in
the application, the Township Engineer may refuse to approve further
work until approval is obtained for a revised grading plan conforming to
existing conditions.

§ 99-5 GRADING, EXCAVATING AND FILLING § 99-8
99:115
§ 99-9. Standards for excavations.
B. Plans for grading work bearing the stamp of approval of the Township
Engineer shall be maintained at the site during the progress of the
grading work and until the work has been approved.
C. The permit holder shall notify the Township Engineer in order to obtain
inspections in accordance with the following schedule and at least 24
hours before the inspection is to be made:
(1) Initial inspection: when work on the excavation or fill is about to be
commenced.
(2) Rough grading: when all rough grading has been completed.
(3) Drainage facilities: when drainage facilities are to be installed.
(4) Special structures: when excavations are complete for retaining
and crib walls and when reinforcing steel is in place and before
concrete is poured.
(5) Final inspection: when all work, including the installation of all
drainage and other structures, has been completed.
D. If at any stage of the work the Township Engineer shall determine by
inspection that the nature of the formation is such that further work as
authorized by an existing permit is likely to endanger property or
streets or alleys or create hazardous conditions, the Township Engineer
may require as a condition to allowing the work to be done that such
reasonable safety precautions be taken as the Township Engineer
considers advisable to avoid such likelihood of danger. Safety
precautions may include but shall not be limited to specifying a flatter
exposed slope, construction of additional drainage facilities, berms or
terracing, compaction or cribbing.
A. No excavation shall be made with a cut face steeper in slope than one
horizontal to one vertical, except under one or more of the following
conditions:
(1) The excavation is located so that a line having a slope of one
horizontal to one vertical and passing through any portion of the
cut face will be entirely inside the property lines of the property on
which the excavation is made.
(2) The material in which the excavation is made is sufficiently stable
to sustain a slope of steeper than one horizontal to one vertical and
a written statement of a civil engineer, licensed by the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and experienced in erosion
control, to that effect is submitted to the Township Engineer and
approved by him. The statement shall state that the site has been
inspected and that the deviation from the slope specified above will
not result in injury of persons or damage to property.
§ 99-8 UPPER PROVIDENCE CODE § 99-9
99:116
§ 99-10. Standards for fills.
(3) A retaining wall or other approved support is provided to support
the face of the excavation.
B. The Township Engineer may require an excavation to be made with a
cut face flatter in slope than one horizontal to one vertical if he finds
that the material in which the excavation is to be made unusually
subject to erosion or if other conditions exist which make such flatter
cut slope necessary for stability and safety.
C. Excavation shall not extend below the angle of repose or natural slope
of the soil under the nearest point of any footing or foundation of any
building or structure unless such footing or foundation is first properly
underpinned or protected against settlement.
D. Before commencing any excavation which will in any way affect an
adjoining property or structures thereon, the person making or causing
the excavation to be made shall notify, in writing, the owners of
adjoining buildings not less than 30 days before such excavation is to be
made that the excavation is to be made.
A. No fill shall be made which creates any exposed surface steeper in slope
than 1 1/2 horizontal to one vertical, except under one or more of the
following conditions:
(1) The fill, in the opinion of the Township Engineer, is located so that
settlement, sliding or erosion of the fill material will not result in
property damage or be a hazard to adjoining property, streets,
alleys or buildings.
(2) A written statement from a civil engineer licensed by the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and experienced in erosion
control, certifying that he has inspected the site and that the
proposed deviation from the slope specified above will not
endanger any property or result in property damage, is submitted
to and approved by the Township Engineer.
B. The Township Engineer may require that the fill be constructed with an
exposed surface flatter than 1 1/2 horizontal to one vertical if he finds
that under the particular conditions such flatter surface is necessary for
stability and safety.
C. Whenever a fill is to be made of materials other than clean soil or earth,
the grading permit shall be subject to the following additional
limitations and requirements:
(1) The fill shall be completed within a reasonable length of time, said
time limit to be determined by the Township Engineer and to be
specified on the grading permit.
§ 99-9 GRADING, EXCAVATING AND FILLING § 99-10
99:117
§ 99-11. Compaction of fills.
All fills shall be compacted to provide stability of material and to prevent
undesirable settlement. The fill shall be spread in a series of layers, each not
exceeding 12 inches in thickness, and shall be compacted by a sheepsfoot
roller or other approved method after each layer is spread. The Township
Engineer may require tests or other information if, in his opinion, the
conditions of materials are such that additional information is necessary.
§ 99-12. Drainage.
Adequate provisions shall be made to prevent any surface waters from
damaging the cut face of an excavation or the sloping surface of a fill.
Slopes of more than 10 feet in vertical height shall be separated by level
berms of at least four feet in width. Berm ditches shall be constructed where
necessary to prevent erosion. All drainage provisions shall be of such design
as to carry surface waters to the nearest practical street, storm drain or
natural watercourse approved by the Township Engineer as a safe place to
deposit and receive such waters. The Township Engineer may require such
drainage structures or pipes to be constructed or installed which, in his
opinion, are necessary to prevent erosion damage and to satisfactorily carry
off surface waters.
(2) Clean soil or earth shall be placed over the top and exposed
surfaces of the fill to a depth sufficient to effectively conceal all
materials other than clean soil or earth within the fill. Where the
nature of the fill requires, the Township Engineer may require
clean soil or earth to be placed over the top and exposed surfaces of
the fill to a depth sufficient to conceal all materials at the end of
each day's operation.
(3) No grading permit shall be issued for the filling of materials other
than clean soil or earth until a faithful performance bond in the
amount of at least 10% more than the Township Engineer's
estimated cost of adequately covering such fill with clean soil or
earth has been furnished to the township. Such bond shall be
executed by a corporate surety, as well as by the principal, and
shall be subject to the approval of the Township Solicitor as to form.
The bond shall inure to the benefit of the township and be
conditioned upon the faithful performance of the work required
under the terms and conditions of the grading permit to the
satisfaction of the Township Engineer. In lieu of said bond, a cash
deposit in said amount may be made with the Township Treasurer
or with a bank or trust company approved by the Township Solicitor
which shall act as escrow agent.
§ 99-10 UPPER PROVIDENCE CODE § 99-13
99:118
§ 99-13. Maintenance of protective devices.
The owner of any property on which an excavation or fill has been made
shall maintain in good condition and repair all retaining walls, cribbing,
drainage structures, fences and other protective devices.
§ 99-14. General requirements.
§ 99-15. Grading certificate.
§ 99-16. Violations and penalties.
A. The top or bottom edge of slopes shall be at least three feet from
property or right-of-way lines of streets in order to permit the normal
rounding of the edge without encroaching on the abutting property. At
property lines where walls or slopes are steeper than 1:1 and six feet or
more in height, they shall be protected by a substantial fence three feet
or more in height. Before a grading permit is issued, a bond may be
required to guarantee the protection of steep slopes.
B. The owner of a property shall be responsible to protect and clean up
lower properties of silt and debris washing from his property as a result
of the regrading of his property.
C. In order to prevent the denuding of the landscape, wherever
practicable, large trees and other natural features constituting
important physical, aesthetic and economic assets of existing or
impending suburban development shall be preserved.
A. If, upon final inspection of an excavation or fill, it is found that the work
authorized by the grading permit has been satisfactorily completed in
accordance with the requirements of this chapter, and any other
requirements imposed, a grading certificate covering such work and
stating that the work is approved shall be issued to the permit holder by
the Township Engineer.
B. The Township Engineer shall have the power to revoke any grading
certificate whenever he finds that the work covered by the certificate
has been materially extended or altered without a permit so to do or
that any retaining walls, cribbing, drainage structures, fences or other
protective devices shown on the approved plans and specifications
submitted with the application for a permit have not been maintained in
good order and repair.
C. Before such renovation, the Township Engineer shall first give written
notice to the permit holder and to the owner of the property involved,
specifying the defective condition and stating that unless such defective
condition is remedied satisfactorily, the grading certificate may be
revoked. If the defective condition is remedied, the certificate shall not
be revoked.
§ 99-13 GRADING, EXCAVATING AND FILLING § 99-16
99:119
§ 99-17. Additional remedies.
In case any work is performed by any person in violation of any of the
provisions of this chapter, the proper officer of the township, in addition to
other remedies, may institute in the name of the township any appropriate
action or proceeding, whether by legal process or otherwise, to prevent
such unlawful work and to restrain or abate such violation.

Providence Township, designed for the collection of sanitary sewage and
operated by a sewer authority.

water used by any such property is not discharged into the collection/
conveyance system, the owner or user of the property may install, at his
expense, a meter or other measuring device on the sewer connection
(in which case the sewer rent will be calculated on the reading obtained
thereby) or on the facilities through which is discharged effluent not
entering into the collection system (in which case the sewer rent will
be calculated on the net of the total water usage less the reading
obtained thereby), provided that any such meter or other measuring
device and the installation and continued maintenance thereof shall be
subject to the approval and inspection of the sewer authority. In the
case of any property served by a metered water supply in respect of

be determined on a water usage basis because the entire water supply
is not metered or properly metered or the sewer authority is prevented,
for any reason, from reading the water meter or making such tests or
inspections of the meter or of the water transmission or distribution
facilities located on the property as it may deem necessary to determine
the accuracy or sufficiency of the metering devices, then the sewer
authority shall compute the sewer rent in the manner provided in
Subsection C of this section. [Amended 9-22-1970 by Ord. No. 132;

provided in Subsection B of this section shall be computed on a flat-rate
basis at a rate to be set, from time to time, by resolution of the Board of
Supervisors, per quarter-year per equivalent dwelling unit. Other types
of structures or uses or property shall be equated to dwelling units in

are connected to the collection system through a single lateral or if two
or more families use separate cooking and/or toilet facilities in a single
dwelling, the sewer rent payable under Subsection B or C, whichever is
appropriate, shall be computed as though each such dwelling,
apartment, store, office or industrial unit and each such family were a
separate property or user with a separate connection to the collection
system. In computing sewer rents under Subsection B, in such cases the
total water usage shall be divided by the number of such units, unless

F. Sewer rents for schools payable under Subsection C shall be computed
on the basis of the average number of pupils enrolled during the school
term preceding the date of the quarterly bill. Teachers and employees
shall be included with pupils for purposes of such computation.
G. In the event that the sewer authority is not provided, upon request, with
accurate information, including supporting documents to determine the
number of employees or pupils using any property or such other data as
may be necessary to determine a user classification or rate under
Subsection C, the sewer authority's estimate or determination thereof
shall be conclusive. [Amended 9-18-2006 by Ord. No. 46643]
H. The sewer rent with respect to all properties which have purchased
equivalent dwelling units (EDUs) more than 24 months prior to a billing
period but have not connected to the sewer system or otherwise are not
utilizing the total number of EDUs purchased for the property shall be

into the collection/conveyance system of sanitary sewage only, and all
persons are hereby prohibited from discharging into the collection/
conveyance system any wastes, substances or other matter other than
sanitary sewage, except in accordance with this section. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, all persons are specifically
prohibited from discharging into the collection/conveyance system any
stormwater or roof or subsurface drainage from stormwater inlets,

B. Industrial wastes may be discharged into the collection system but only
upon prior written permit issued by the sewer authority. Application for
any such permit shall be accompanied by such information relating to
the nature or character of the industrial waste proposed to be
discharged or otherwise, including, without limitation, a detailed
engineering report in respect thereof prepared by a registered
engineer or engineering firm, as the sewer authority may reasonably
require. Any permit issued under this Subsection B may be conditioned
upon compliance with such reasonable restrictions as the sewer
authority may impose, including, without limitation, requirements for
the establishment of facilities for the pretreatment and prescreening of
wastes, the construction of flow-equalization facilities to assure a
uniform rate of discharge and the construction of suitable control
manholes to facilitate observation, sampling and measurement of
wastes and the discharge thereof. Grease, oil and sand interceptors
shall be provided by the applicant when they are required by the sewer
authority for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing grease in
excessive amounts or any flammable wastes, sand or other harmful
ingredients. All such interceptors shall be of a type and capacity
approved by the sewer authority and shall be located as to be readily
and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Where any such
required facilities or interceptors are constructed, they shall be
maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective operation by the
applicant, at his expense. No permit for the discharge of industrial
wastes issued under this Subsection B shall be deemed to give any right
to the applicant to continue such use, and any such permit may be
revoked by the sewer authority at any time.
C. The sewer authority may promulgate prohibitions against specific types
or strengths of industrial wastes or other substances (in addition to
those set forth in Subsection A above) which are harmful to the
collection system or which the Montgomery County Sewer Authority
has prohibited from discharge to its treatment and disposal facilities to
which the collection system is to be connected. Such prohibitions may
be modified from time to time by the sewer authority, and any permit
issued pursuant to Subsection B of this section shall, by virtue hereof,
be subject to such prohibitions as the same are in existence from time
to time. Any person questioning the reasonableness of any such
prohibitions as applied to property owned or used by such person shall
have the right to a hearing before the Board of Supervisors within a
reasonable time after requesting the same (but such request shall not
operate as a stay of such prohibitions), except in cases where such
prohibitions have been established or specifically approved by
ordinance.
D. Upon the issuance of any permit for the discharge of industrial waste in
accordance with Subsection B of this section, the sewer authority shall
establish the rent to be paid for the use permitted thereunder and shall
report such rent to the Board of Township Supervisors. Upon approval
by the Board, such rent shall be deemed imposed under this article.

If any quarterly installment of sewer rent is not paid within 30 days after the
date of the bill, a penalty of 10% shall be added thereto. Any unpaid sewer
rent, together with penalties thereon to the extent permitted by law, shall be
a lien on the property served which may be collected by action in assumpsit,
by distress or by a lien filed in the nature of a municipal claim, as and to
the extent provided by law. In addition, the sewer authority may require any
water utility to shut off the water supply to any property with respect to
which the sewer rent imposed hereby is unpaid until all such rents, together
with penalties as aforesaid, are paid.
§ 143-15. Additional rules and regulations.
Rules and regulations regarding the payment and collection of the sewer
rents imposed hereunder and the use of the collection system may be
promulgated by the sewer authority, and upon approval by the Board of
A. The flat-rate sewer rents imposed by § 143-11C shall be payable
quarterly in advance, and the rent for each calendar quarter shall be
billed and payable as of the 15th day of each quarter, i.e., on the 15th
day of January, April, July and October in each year. Rent for the quarter
in which the connection is made shall be prorated and shall be billed in
conjunction with the next regular quarterly billing or by special billing,
as the official responsible for billing may elect. When sewer service has
been provided in such manner as to make a connection available for
more than six months, any property capable of connection therewith
shall be billed as if connection had actually been made, unless a waiver
has been granted by the Board of Supervisors in accordance with
§ 143-3A. [Amended 3-3-1969 by Ord. No. 120; 9-18-2006 by Ord.

upon billing and shall be billed and payable on a quarterly basis. The
respective dates of quarterly meter reading and billing in respect of the
several properties subject to such sewer rents shall be established by
the sewer authority and may be on a staggered basis. The first such
reading and billing in respect of each such property may be based upon
such time period not exceeding six months, as the sewer authority may
determine, with appropriate proration of the rent in respect of any such
periods which vary from an exact quarter-year.
C. Bills for sewer rent shall be mailed to the address specified in the
application for permit to make the connection, unless and until a
different address is specified by the owner or user of the property to the
sewer authority. Failure to receive a bill as a result of an incorrect

or at any point in the sewer interceptor system or the POTW;
(18) Any substance or condition which will cause the POTW to violate its
NPDES and/or State Disposal System Permit, the receiving water
quality standards, or any statute, rule, or regulation of any public
agency;
(19) In no case shall a slug load have a flow rate or contain
concentration or qualities of pollutants that exceed any time period
longer than 15 minutes or contain more than five times the average
twenty-four-hour concentration of flow during normal operation, or
otherwise constitutes a slug discharge;
(20) The discharge of toxic or hazardous wastes, as defined in the Act or

§ 143-57. National Categorical Pretreatment Standards.
§ 143-58. Modification of National Categorical Pretreatment
Standards.
Where the Lower Perkiomen Valley Regional Sewer Authority's wastewater
treatment system achieves consistent removal of pollutants limited by
national pretreatment standards, the Lower Perkiomen Valley Regional
Sewer Authority, as control authority, may apply to the approval authority
for modification of specific limits in the National Pretreatment Standards.
"Consistent removal" shall mean reduction in the amount of a pollutant
or alteration of the nature of the pollutant by the wastewater treatment
system to a less toxic or harmless state in the effluent which is achieved by
the system in 95% of the samples taken when measured according to the
B. When the control authority determines that a user is contributing to the
POTW any of the above-enumerated substances in such amounts as to
interfere with the operation of the POTW, the control authority shall:
(1) Advise the user(s) of the impact of the contribution on the POTW;
(2) Develop effluent limitation(s) for such user to correct the
interference with the POTW; and
(3) Proceed with enforcement pursuant to the provisions of this article.
C. Pollutants, substances or wastewater prohibited by this section shall
not be processed or stored in a manner that they could be discharged to
the POTW.
A. The categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 CFR Chapter I,
Subchapter N, Parts 405 through 471 are hereby incorporated in this
article by reference as though set forth in full.
B. Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms
of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the
control authority may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in
accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(c).
C. When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is
mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the control
authority shall impose an alternate limit using the combined waste
stream formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e).
D. A user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment standard
if the user can prove, pursuant to the procedural and substantive
provisions in 40 CFR 403.13, that factors relating to its discharge are
fundamentally different from the factors considered by EPA when
developing the categorical pretreatment standard.
E. A user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in
accordance with 40 CFR 403.15.
§ 143-56 UPPER PROVIDENCE CODE § 143-58

procedures set forth in Section 403.7(c)(2) of Title 40 of the Code of Federal
Regulations, Part 403 "General Pretreatment Regulations for Existing and
New Sources of Pollution" promulgated pursuant to the Act. The Lower
Perkiomen Valley Regional Sewer Authority, as control authority, may then
modify pollutant discharge limits in the National Pretreatment Standards if
the requirements contained in 40 CFR 403.7 are fulfilled and prior approval
from the approval authority is obtained.
§ 143-59. State requirements.
State requirements and limitations on discharges shall apply in any case
where they are more stringent than federal requirements and limitations or
those in this article.
§ 143-60. Right of revision.
The Lower Perkiomen Valley Regional Sewer Authority, as control authority,
reserves the right to establish by resolution more stringent limitations or
requirements on discharges to the wastewater disposal system if deemed
necessary to comply with the objectives presented in § 143-51 of this article.
§ 143-61. Dilution.
No user shall ever increase the use of process water or, in any way, attempt
to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate
treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation, unless
expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or
requirement. The control authority may impose mass limitations on users
who are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or
requirements or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is
appropriate.
§ 143-62. Accidental discharges.
A. Each user shall provide protection from accidental discharge of
prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this article.
Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall
be provided and maintained at the owner's or user's own cost and
expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to
provide this protection shall be submitted to the control authority for
review and shall be approved by the control authority before
construction of the facility. All existing users shall complete such a plan
by January 1, 1994. No user shall be permitted to introduce pollutants
into the system until accidental discharge procedures have been
approved by the control authority. Review and approval of such plans
and operating procedures shall not relieve the industrial user from the
responsibility to modify the user's facility as necessary to meet the
requirements of this article. In the case of an accidental discharge, it is
the responsibility of the user to immediately notify the control authority
§ 143-58 PROPERTY MAINTENANCE § 143-62
135:193
§ 143-63. Local limits.
of the incident. The notification shall include location of discharge, type
of waste, concentration and volume, and corrective actions.
B. Written notice. Within five days followings an accidental discharge the
user shall submit to the control authority a detailed written report
describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by
the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall
not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability
which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, fish kills, or
any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification
relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may
be imposed by this article or other applicable law.
C. Notice to employees. A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's
bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to
call in the event of an accidental discharge. Employers shall insure that
all employees who may cause or suffer such an accidental discharge to
occur are advised of the emergency notification procedures.
A. The Lower Perkiomen Valley Regional Sewer Authority, as control
authority, is authorized to establish local limits pursuant to 40 CFR
403.5(c).
B. The following pollutant limits are established to protect against passthrough,
interference, and sludge contamination. No person shall
discharge wastewater containing in excess of the following limits:
Parameter

§ 143-64. Pretreatment facilities.
Users shall provide wastewater treatment as necessary to comply with
this article and shall achieve compliance with all categorical pretreatment
standards, local limits, and the prohibitions set out in §§ 143-55 through
143-63 of this article within the time limitations specified by EPA, the
state, or the control authority, whichever is more stringent. Any facilities
necessary for compliance shall be provided, operated, and maintained at
the user's expense. Detailed plans describing such facilities and operating
procedures shall be submitted to the control authority for review and shall
be acceptable to the control authority before such facilities are constructed.
The review of such plans and operating procedures shall in no way relieve
the user from the responsibility of modifying such facilities as necessary
to produce a discharge acceptable to the control authority under the
provisions of this article.
§ 143-65. Additional pretreatment measures.
C. The above limits apply at the point where the wastewater is discharged
to the sewer. All concentrations from metallic substances are for total
metal unless otherwise indicated. The above local limits are based on
maximum allowable headworks loadings (MAHL) as approved by EPA.
The Lower Perkiomen Valley Regional Sewer Authority, as control
authority, through the issuance of an industrial waste discharge permit,
may establish other effluent limits consistent with the approved MAHL.
No such permits, however, shall waive or abrogate federal or state
categorical pretreatment standards or regulations. Categorical
concentrations apply at the end of the process waste stream. No person
shall discharge wastewater containing in excess of allowable discharge
limits as established by the Lower Perkiomen Valley Regional Sewer
Authority as control authority. The Lower Perkiomen Valley Regional
Sewer Authority, as control authority, may impose mass limitations in
addition to or in place of the concentration-based limitations.
D. The Lower Perkiomen Valley Regional Sewer Authority, as control
authority, may develop best management practices (BMPs), by
resolution or in wastewater discharge permits, to implement local limits
and the requirements of §§ 143-55 through 143-63.
A. Whenever deemed necessary, the control authority may require users to
restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain
wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or
consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage waste streams from
industrial waste streams, and such other conditions as may be
necessary to protect the POTW and determine the user's compliance
with the requirements of this article.
B. The control authority may require any person discharging into the
POTW to install and maintain, on his/her property and at his/her
expense, a suitable storage and flow control facility to ensure

The control authority shall evaluate whether each significant industrial user
needs an accidental discharge/slug control plan or other action to control
slug discharges. The control authority may require any user to develop,
submit for approval, and implement such a plan. Alternatively, the control
authority may develop such a plan for any user. An accidental discharge/
slug discharge control plan shall address, at a minimum, the following:
§ 143-67. Hauled wastewater.
The Lower Perkiomen Valley Regional Sewer Authority does not accept
septic tank waste or industrial waste from haulers or RCRA hazardous
wastes.
§ 143-68. Wastewater dischargers.

solely for flow equalization.
C. Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided by the user when,
in the opinion of the control authority, they are necessary for the proper
handling of wastewater containing excessive amounts of grease and oil,
or sand; except that such interceptors shall not be required for
residential users. All interception units shall be of type and capacity
approved by the control authority and shall be so located to be easily
accessible for cleaning and inspection. Such interceptors shall be
inspected, cleaned, and repaired regularly, as needed, by the user at its
expense.
D. Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be
required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection
meter.
A. Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch
discharges;
B. Description of stored chemicals;

provisions of this article, subject to state and federal laws and regulations.
§ 143-69. Wastewater analysis.
When requested by the control authority, a user must submit information
on the nature and characteristics of its wastewater within 30 days of the
request. The control authority is authorized to prepare a form for this
purpose and may periodically require users to update this information.
§ 143-70. Wastewater discharge permit requirement.
§ 143-71. Wastewater discharge permitting for existing
connections.
Any user required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit who was
discharging wastewater into the POTW prior to the effective date of this
article, and who wishes to continue such discharges in the future, shall
within 30 days after said date, apply to the control authority for a
wastewater discharge permit in accordance with this article. Said user shall
not cause or allow discharges to the POTW to continue after 30 days of
the effective date of this article, except in accordance with a wastewater
discharge permit issued by the control authority.
§ 143-72. Wastewater discharge permitting for new connections.
Any user required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit who proposes
to begin or recommence discharging into the POTW must obtain such
permit from the control authority prior to the beginning or recommencing
of such discharge. An application for this wastewater discharge permit, in
accordance with this article, must be filed at least 90 days prior to the date
upon which any discharge will begin or recommence.
A. No significant industrial user shall discharge wastewater into the
POTW without first obtaining a wastewater discharge permit from the
control authority. A permitted user may discharge for the time period
specified in the permit.
B. The control authority may require other users to obtain wastewater
discharge permits as necessary to carry out the purposes of this article.
C. Any violation of the terms and conditions of a wastewater discharge
permit shall be deemed a violation of this article and subjects the
wastewater discharge permittee to the sanctions set out in this article.
Obtaining a wastewater discharge permit does not relieve a permittee
of its obligation to comply with all federal and state pretreatment
standards or requirements or with any other requirements of federal,
state, and local law.

§ 143-80. Wastewater discharge permit transfer.
§ 143-81. Wastewater discharge permit revocation.
I. To reflect a transfer of the facility ownership or operation to a new
owner or operator.
A. Wastewater discharge permits are issued to a specific user for a specific
operation. A wastewater discharge permit shall not be reassigned or
transferred or sold to a new owner, new user, different premises, or a
new or changed operation without approval of the control authority.
Any succeeding owner or user shall also comply with the terms and
conditions of the existing permit, as well as any additional terms and
conditions which may be required as a result of the proposed transfer.
B. Wastewater discharge permits may be transferred to a new owner or
operator only if the permittee gives at least 90 days' advance notice to
the control authority and it approves the wastewater discharge permit
transfer. The notice to the control authority must include a written
certification by the new owner or operator which:
(1) States that the new owner and/or operator has no immediate intent
to change the facility's operations and processes;

standards.
A. Within either 180 days after the effective date of a categorical
pretreatment standard, or the final administrative decision on a
category determination under 40 CFR 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later,
existing categorical industrial users currently discharging to or
scheduled to discharge to the POTW shall submit to the control
authority a report which contains the information listed in Subsection B
§ 143-83 PROPERTY MAINTENANCE § 143-84
135:205
below. At least 90 days prior to commencement of their discharge,
new sources, and sources that become categorical industrial users
subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable categorical standard,
shall submit to the control authority a report which contains the
information listed in Subsection B below. A new source shall report the
method of pretreatment it intends to use to meet applicable categorical
standards. A new source also shall give estimates of its anticipated flow
and quantity of pollutants to be discharged.
B. Users described above shall submit the information set forth below:
(1) All information required in §§ 143-73A(1) and (2), 143-73C(1) and
143-73F.

(a) The user shall provide the information required in
§ 143-73G(1) through (4).
(b) The user shall take a minimum of one representative sample to
compile that data necessary to comply with the requirements
of this subsection.
(c) Samples should be taken immediately downstream from
pretreatment facilities if such exist or immediately
downstream from the regulated process if no pretreatment
exists. If other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated
wastewater prior to pretreatment, the user should measure the
flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the
combined waste stream formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e) to evaluate
compliance with the pretreatment standards. Where an
alternate concentration or mass limit has been calculated in
accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(e), this adjusted limit along
with supporting data shall be submitted to the control
authority.
(d) Sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with
§ 143-93.
(e) The control authority may allow the submission of a baseline
report which utilizes only historical data so long as the data
provides information sufficient to determine the need for
industrial pretreatment measures.
(f) The baseline report shall indicate the time, date and place of
sampling and methods of analysis, and shall certify that such
sampling and analysis is representative of normal work cycles
and expected pollutant discharges to the POTW.
(3) Certification. A statement reviewed by the user's authorized
representative, as defined in § 143-53, and certified to by a
qualified professional, indicating whether pretreatment standards

The following conditions shall apply to the schedule required by
§ 143-84B(4) of this article.
§ 143-86. Report on compliance with categorical pretreatment
standard deadline.
Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable
categorical pretreatment standards or, in the case of a new source,
following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW,
any user subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall
submit to the control authority a report containing the information
described in §§ 143-73F and G and 143-84B(2) of this article. For users
are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not, whether additional
operation and maintenance (O&M) and/or additional pretreatment
is required to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements.
(4) Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or O&M will
be required to meet the pretreatment standards, the shortest
schedule by which the user will provide such additional
pretreatment and/or O&M must be provided. The completion date
in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date
established for the applicable pretreatment standard. A compliance
schedule pursuant to this section must meet the requirements set
out in § 143-85 of this article.
(5) Signature and certification. All baseline monitoring reports must be
signed and certified, in accordance with § 143-97A of this article,
and signed by an authorized representative as defined in § 143-53.
A. The schedule shall contain progress increments (milestones) in the
form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events
leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment
required for the user to meet the applicable pretreatment standards
(such events include, but are not limited to, hiring an engineer,
completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts for major
components, commencing and completing construction, and beginning
and conducting routine operation);
B. No increment referred to above shall exceed six months;
C. The user shall submit a progress report to the control authority no later
than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the final date for
compliance, including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with
the increment of progress, the reason for any delay and, if appropriate,
the steps being taken by the user to return the construction to the
established schedule; and
D. In no event shall more than one month elapse between such progress
reports to the control authority.
§ 143-84 PROPERTY MAINTENANCE § 143-86
135:207
subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established in accordance
with the procedures in 40 CFR 403.6(c), this report shall contain a
reasonable measure of the user's long-term production rate. For all other
users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of
allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of
operation), this report shall include the user's actual production during the
appropriate sampling period. All compliance reports must be signed and
certified in accordance with § 143-74 of this article.
§ 143-87. Periodic compliance reports.
A. All SIUs are required to submit periodic compliance reports even if they
have been designated a nonsignificant categorical industrial user under
the provisions of § 143-87C.
B. Except as specified in § 143-87C, all significant industrial users must, at
a frequency determined by the control authority, submit no less than
twice per year [June and December (or on dates specified)] reports
indicating the nature, concentration of pollutants in the discharge
which are limited by pretreatment standards and the measured or
estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. In
cases where the pretreatment standard requires compliance with a best
management practice (BMP) or pollution prevention alternative, the
user must submit documentation required by the control authority or
the pretreatment standard necessary to determine the compliance
status of the user.
C. The control authority may authorize an industrial user subject to a
categorical pretreatment standard to forego sampling of a pollutant
regulated by a categorical pretreatment standard if the industrial user
has demonstrated through sampling and other technical factors that
the pollutant is neither present nor expected to be present in the
discharge, or is present only at background levels from intake water
and without any increase in the pollutant due to activities of the
industrial user. [See 40 CFR 403.12(e)(2).] This authorization is subject
to the following conditions:
(1) The waiver may be authorized where a pollutant is determined to
be present solely due to sanitary wastewater discharged from the
facility, provided that the sanitary wastewater is not regulated by
an applicable categorical standard and otherwise includes no
process wastewater.
(2) The monitoring waiver is valid only for the duration of the effective
period of the individual wastewater discharge permit, but in no
case longer than five years. The user must submit a new request for
the waiver before the waiver can be granted for each subsequent
individual wastewater discharge permit. See § 143-73G(6).
(3) In making a demonstration that a pollutant is not present, the
industrial user must provide data from at least one sampling of the
§ 143-86 UPPER PROVIDENCE CODE § 143-87
135:208
facility's process wastewater prior to any treatment present at the
facility that is representative of all wastewater from all processes.
(4) The request for a monitoring waiver must be signed in accordance
with § 143-53, and include the certification statement in § 143-97
[40 CFR 403.6(a)(2)(ii)].
(5) Nondetectable sample results may be used only as a demonstration
that a pollutant is not present if the EPA approved method from 40
CFR Part 136 with the lowest minimum detection level for that
pollutant was used in the analysis.
(6) Any grant of the monitoring waiver by the control authority must be
included as a condition in the user's permit. The reasons
supporting the waiver and any information submitted by the user in
its request for the waiver must be maintained by the control
authority for three years after expiration of the waiver.
(7) Upon approval of the monitoring waiver and revision of the user's
permit by the control authority, the industrial user must certify on
each report, with the statement in § 143-97C below, that there has
been no increase in the pollutant in its waste stream due to
activities of the industrial user.
(8) In the event that a waived pollutant is found to be present or is
expected to be present because of changes that occur in the user's
operations, the user must immediately: comply with the monitoring
requirements of § 143-87A, or other more frequent monitoring
requirements imposed by the control authority, and notify the
control authority.
(9) This provision does not supersede certification processes and
requirements established in categorical pretreatment standards,
except as otherwise specified in the categorical pretreatment
standard.
D. Reduced reporting.
(1) The control authority may reduce the requirement for periodic
compliance reports [see § 143-87A; 40 CFR 403.12(e)(1)] to a
requirement to report no less frequently than once a year, unless
required more frequently in the pretreatment standard or by the
EPA, where the industrial user's total categorical wastewater flow
does not exceed any of the following:
(a) One thousand two hundred eleven gallons per day [0.01% of
the POTW's design dry-weather hydraulic capacity (12.11 mgd)
of the POTW], or 5,000 gallons per day, whichever is smaller, as
measured by a continuous effluent flow monitoring device
unless the industrial user discharges in batches.
§ 143-87 PROPERTY MAINTENANCE § 143-87
135:209
(b) One and twenty-five hundredth pounds per day [0.01% of the
design dry-weather organic treatment capacity (12,500 pounds
per day) of the POTW]; and
(c) The loading for any pollutant regulated by the applicable
categorical pretreatment standard for which approved local
limits were developed in accordance with § 143-58 of this
article shall be below 0.01% of the maximum allowable
headworks loading as set forth below:
Parameter
0.01% MAHL
(0.001 lbs/day)
Arsenic 0.140
Cadmium 0.040
Chromium 1.800
Copper 1.483
Cyanide 1.453
Lead 0.365
Mercury 0.032
Nickel 1.160
Silver 2.732
Zinc 2.400
(2) Reduced reporting is not available to industrial users that have in
the last two years been in significant noncompliance, as defined in
§ 143-53 of this article. In addition, reduced reporting is not
available to an industrial user with daily flow rates, production
levels, or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that, in the
opinion of the control authority, decreasing the reporting
requirement for this industrial user would result in data that are
not representative of conditions occurring during the reporting
period.
E. All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in
accordance with § 143-74 of this article.
F. All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's discharge.
Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be
properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at
all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good
working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample
results are unrepresentative of its discharge.
G. If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section monitors
any regulated pollutant at the appropriate sampling location more
frequently than required by the control authority, using the procedures
§ 143-87 UPPER PROVIDENCE CODE § 143-87

Each user must notify the control authority of any planned significant
changes to the user's operations or system which might alter the nature,
quality, or volume of its wastewater at least 90 days before the change.
§ 143-89. Reports of potential problems.
prescribed in § 143-93 of this article, the results of this monitoring shall
be included in the report.
A. The control authority may require the user to submit such information
as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition,
including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application
under § 143-73 of this article.
B. The control authority may issue a wastewater discharge permit under
§ 143-82 of this article or modify an existing wastewater discharge
permit under § 143-79 of this article in response to changed conditions
or anticipated changed conditions.
C. For purposes of this requirement, significant changes include, but are
not limited to, flow increases of 20% or greater, and the discharge of
any previously unreported pollutants.
A. In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental
discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a
noncustomary batch discharge, or a slug discharge or slug load that
may cause potential problems for the POTW, the user shall immediately
telephone and notify the control authority of the incident. This
notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste,
concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the
user.
B. Within five days following such discharge, the user shall, unless waived
by the control authority, submit a detailed written report to the control
authority describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to
be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such
notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or
other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the
POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property
nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties, or
other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this article.
C. A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or
other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of
a discharge described in Subsection A above. Employers shall ensure
that all employees who may cause such a discharge to occur are advised
of the emergency notification procedure.

135:211
§ 143-90. Reports from unpermitted users.
All users not required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall provide
appropriate reports to the control authority as the control authority may
require.
§ 143-91. Notice of violation/repeat sampling and reporting.
If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify
the control authority within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation.
The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the result
of the repeat analysis to the control authority within 30 days after becoming
aware of the violation. The user is not required to resample if the control
authority monitors at the user's facility at least once a month, or if the
control authority samples between the user's initial sample and when the
user receives the results of this sampling.
§ 143-92. Analytical requirements.
All pollutant analyses, including sample techniques, to be submitted as
a part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be
performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part
136 and amendments thereto, unless otherwise specified in an applicable
categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain
sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where
the EPA determines that the Part 136 sampling and analytical techniques
are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall
be performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable
sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the
control authority or other parties approved by EPA.
§ 143-93. Sample collection.
Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based on
data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during
the period covered by the report, based on data that is representative of
conditions occurring during the reporting period.
D. Significant industrial users are required to notify the control authority
immediately of any changes at their facility affecting the potential for a
slug discharge.
A. Except as indicated in Subsections B and C below, the user must collect
wastewater samples using twenty-four-hour flow-proportional
composite sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite
sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the control authority. Where
time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized
by the control authority, the samples must be representative of the
discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation)
specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple
grab samples collected during a twenty-four-hour period may be

Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date
postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail
facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date or receipt of
the report shall govern.
§ 143-95. Recordkeeping.
Users subject to the reporting requirements of this article shall retain
and make available for inspection and copying all records of information
obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this article, any
additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities
undertaken by the user independent of such requirements, and
documentation associated with best management practices established
under § 143-63. Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and
time of sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the
dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical
techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records
shall remain available for a period of at least three years. This period shall
be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the
user or the control authority, or where the user has been specifically notified
of a longer retention period by the control authority.
composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols,
and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in
the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be
composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters
unaffected by the compositing procedures, as documented in approved
EPA methodologies, may be authorized by the control authority, as
appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to show
compliance with instantaneous limits.
B. Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols,
sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab
collection techniques.
C. For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and ninety-day
compliance reports required in §§ 143-84 and 143-86 [40 CFR 403.12(b)
and (d)], a minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide,
total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for
facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for
which historical sampling data are available, the control authority may
authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by § 143-87 [40
CFR 403.12(e) and 403.12(h)], the industrial user is required to collect
the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance
with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.

the control authority, pursuant to §§ 143-53 and 143-74C, must annually
submit the following certification statement signed in accordance with
the signatory requirements in § 143-53. This certification must
accompany an alternative report required by the control authority:
Based on my inquiry of the person or persons directly responsible
for managing compliance with the categorical pretreatment standards
under 40 CFR _____, I certify that, to the best of my knowledge and
belief that during the period from __________, _____ to __________, _____
[months, days, year]:
(a)The facility described as _______________ [facility name] met the
definition of a nonsignificant categorical industrial user as
described in § 143-53;
(b)The facility complied with all applicable pretreatment standards
and requirements during this reporting period; and
(c)The facility never discharged more than 100 gallons of total
categorical wastewater on any given day during this reporting
period.
This compliance certification is based on the following information.
§ 143-96 UPPER PROVIDENCE CODE § 143-97
135:214
§ 143-98. Right of entry for inspection and sampling.
The control authority or its designated representative shall have the right to
enter the premises of any user to determine whether the user is complying
with all requirements of this article and any wastewater discharge permit
or order issued hereunder. Users shall allow the control authority or its
designated representative ready access to all parts of the premises for the
purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the
performance of any additional duties. A user shall not obstruct, block or
otherwise interfere with access to the sampling point(s).
C. Certification of pollutants not present. Users that have an approved
monitoring waiver based on § 143-87B must certify on each report with
the following statement that there has been no increase in the pollutant
in its waste stream due to activities of the user: "Based on my inquiry of
the person or persons directly responsible for managing compliance
with the pretreatment standard for 40 CFR _____ [specify applicable
National Pretreatment Standard part(s)], I certify that, to the best of my
knowledge and belief, there has been no increase in the level of _____
[list pollutant(s) in the wastewaters due to the activities at the facility
since filing of the last periodic report under § 143-87A."
A. Where a user has security measures in force which require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user
shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that,
upon presentation of suitable identification, the control authority or its
designated representative shall be permitted to enter without delay for
the purposes of performing specific responsibilities.
B. The control authority or its designated representative shall have the
right to set up on the user's property or require installation of such
devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the
user's operations.
C. The control authority or its designated representative may require the
user to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's
sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in
a safe and proper operating condition by the user at its own expense.
All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be
calibrated semiannually to ensure their accuracy.
D. Any temporary or permanent obstruction of safe and easy access to the
facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by
the user at the written or verbal request of the control authority or its
designated representative and shall not be replaced. The costs of
clearing such access shall be borne by the user.
§ 143-97 PROPERTY MAINTENANCE § 143-98
135:215
§ 143-99. Search warrants.
If the control authority or its designated representative has been refused
access to a building, structure, or property or any part thereof and is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this
article, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine
inspection and sampling program of the control authority designed to verify
compliance with this article or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to
protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then
the control authority may seek issuance of a search warrant from the Court
of Common Pleas of Montgomery County, Pennsylvania.
§ 143-100. Confidential information.
Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater
discharge permit applications, monitoring programs, and from the control
authority's inspection and sampling activities shall be available to the public
without restriction, unless the user specifically requests, and is able to
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the control authority, that the release
of such information would divulge information, processes, or methods of
production entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable state
law. Any such request must be asserted at the time of submission of the
information or data. When requested and demonstrated by the user
furnishing a report that such information should be held confidential, the
portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes
shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made
available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses
related to NPDES program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement
proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater
constituents and characteristics and other effluent data, as defined by 40
CFR 2.302, will not be recognized as confidential information and will be
available to the public without restriction.
§ 143-101. Publication of users in significant noncompliance.
The control authority shall publish annually, in a newspaper of general
circulation that provides meaningful public notice within the jurisdictions
served by the POTW, a list of the users which, at any time during the
previous 12 months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable
pretreatment standards and requirements. The term significant
noncompliance shall be applicable to all significant industrial users (or any
other industrial user that violates Subsection C, D or H of this section) and
shall mean:
E. Unreasonable delays in allowing the control authority or its designated
representative access to the user's premises shall be a violation of this
article.
A. Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those
in which 66% or more of all the measurements taken for the same
§ 143-98 UPPER PROVIDENCE CODE § 143-101
135:216
§ 143-102. Notification of violation.
When the control authority finds that a user has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
control authority may serve upon that user a written notice of violation.
Within 30 days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation
and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include
specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the control
authority. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for
pollutant parameter taken during a six-month period exceed (by any
magnitude) a numeric pretreatment standard or requirement, including
instantaneous limits as defined in §§ 143-55 through 143-63;
B. Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in
which 33% or more of wastewater measurements taken for each
pollutant parameter during a six-month period equals or exceeds the
product of the numeric pretreatment standard or requirement,
including instantaneous limits, as defined by §§ 143-55 through 143-63,
multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and
grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH);
C. Any other violation of a pretreatment standard or requirement as
defined by §§ 143-55 through 143-63 (daily maximum, long-term
average, instantaneous limit, or narrative standard) that the control
authority determines has caused, alone or in combination with other
discharges, interference or pass-through, including endangering the
health of POTW personnel or the general public;
D. Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment to
the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the control
authority's exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a
discharge;
E. Failure to meet, within 30 days of the scheduled date, a compliance
schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or
enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction,
or attaining final compliance;
F. Failure to provide within 30 days after the due date, any required
reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance
with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic selfmonitoring
reports, and reports on compliance with compliance
schedules;
G. Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or
H. Any other violation(s), which may include a violation of best
management practices, which the control authority determines will
adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local
pretreatment program.
§ 143-101 PROPERTY MAINTENANCE § 143-102
135:217
any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation.
Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the control authority
to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement
action, without first issuing a notice of violation.
§ 143-103. Consent orders.
The control authority may enter into consent orders, assurances of
voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an
agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents
shall include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the
noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. Such
documents shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders
issued pursuant to §§ 143-105 and 143-106 of this article.
§ 143-104. Show cause hearing.
The control authority may order a user which has violated, or continues
to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement
to appear before the control authority and show cause why the proposed
enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user
specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement
action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause
why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the
meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return
receipt requested) at least 10 days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be
served on any authorized representative of the user, as defined in § 143-53
and required by § 143-74A. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against,
or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
§ 143-105. Compliance orders.
When the control authority finds that a user has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
control authority may issue an order to the user responsible for the
discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified
time. If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided,
sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities,
devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly
operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to
address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and
management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants
discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline
for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement,
nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation,
including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not
be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the
user.

135:218
§ 143-106. Cease and desist orders.
§ 143-107. Administrative civil penalties.
§ 143-108. Emergency suspensions.
A. When the control authority finds that a user has violated, or continues
to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit
or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the
control authority may issue an order to the user directing it to cease
and desist all such violations and directing the user to:
(1) Immediately comply with all requirements; and
(2) Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation,
including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.
B. Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
A. When the control authority finds that a user has violated, or continues
to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit
or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, the control authority may fine such a user in an amount
not to exceed $25,000 per day for each violation regardless of
jurisdictional boundaries. Such fines shall be assessed on a per
violation, per day basis. In the case of monthly or other long-term
average discharge limits, penalties shall be assessed for each day
during the period of violation. The foregoing administrative civil
penalties shall be enforced in accordance with the provisions of
§§ 143-112 and 143-118 of this article.
B. A lien against the user's property will be sought for unpaid charges,
fines and penalties.
C. Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for the
control authority to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the
fine amount within 30 days of being notified of the fine. Where a request
has merit, the control authority may convene a hearing on the matter. In
the event the user's appeal is successful, the payment, together with
any interest accruing thereon, shall be returned to the user. The control
authority may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement
actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine.
D. Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
A. The control authority may immediately suspend a user's discharge,
after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is
necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably
§ 143-106 PROPERTY MAINTENANCE § 143-108
135:219
§ 143-109. Termination of discharge.
appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment
to the health or welfare of persons. The control authority may also
immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to
respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW or
which represents or may present an endangerment to the environment.
(1) Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately
stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to
immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the
control authority may take such steps as deemed necessary,
including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent
or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or
endangerment to any individuals. The control authority may allow
the user to recommence its discharge when the user has
demonstrated to the satisfaction of the control authority that the
period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination
proceedings in § 143-109 of this article are initiated against the
user.
(2) A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written
statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and
the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the
control authority prior to the date of any show cause or termination
hearing under §§ 143-104 or 143-109 of this article.
B. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior
to any emergency suspension under this section.
A. In addition to the provisions in § 143-81 of this article, any user who
violates the following conditions is subject to discharge termination:
(1) Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions;
(2) Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
(3) Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater
volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge;
(4) Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose
of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or
(5) Violation of the pretreatment standards in §§ 143-55 through
143-63 of this article.
B. Such user will be notified of proposed termination of its discharge and
be offered an opportunity to show cause under § 143-104 of this article
why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by
§ 143-108 UPPER PROVIDENCE CODE § 143-109
135:220
§ 143-110. Notification to contributing jurisdictions.
The control authority shall provide to the contributing municipality a true
and correct copy of any administrative enforcement remedy, judicial
enforcement remedy, or supplemental enforcement action initiated by the
control authority with reference to an industrial user within the
municipality, pursuant to §§ 143-102 through 143-119 of this article. The
failure to provide a copy to the contributing municipality shall not be a
defense to any third party who is a subject of an administrative enforcement
remedy, judicial enforcement remedy, or supplemental enforcement action.
§ 143-111. Injunctive relief.
When the control authority finds that a user has violated, or continues
to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit,
or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, the control authority may petition the Court of Common Pleas
of Montgomery County, Pennsylvania for appropriate legal and equitable
relief, including the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as
appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the
wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this
article on activities of the user. Relief requested may also include
requirements for environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief
shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action
against a user.
§ 143-112. Civil penalties.
the control authority shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking
any other action against the user.
A. A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this
article, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or
any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to the
control authority for a maximum civil penalty of $25,000 per violation,
per day. In the case of a monthly or other long-term average discharge
limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the
violation. Each violation for each separate day shall constitute a
separate and distinct offense under this section.
B. The control authority may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court
costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities,
including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual
damages incurred by the control authority.
C. In determining the amount of civil liability, there shall be taken into
account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the
extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of
the violation, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation,
corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and
any other factor as justice requires.

§ 143-113. Criminal prosecution.
A user who willfully or negligently violates any provision of this article,
a wastewater discharge permit, order issued hereunder, any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, or who willfully or negligently
introduces any substance into the POTW which causes personal injury or
property damage, or any user who knowingly makes any false statements,
representations or certifications in any application, record, report, plan,
or other document filed, or required to be maintained pursuant to this
article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued under this article or
who falsifies, tampers with or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring
device of method required under this article, may be subject to criminal
prosecution in accordance with the applicable provisions of the
Pennsylvania Crimes Code, 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 101 et seq.
§ 143-114. Remedies nonexclusive.
The remedies provided for in this article are not exclusive. The control
authority may take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a
noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally
be in accordance with the control authority's enforcement response plan.
However, the control authority may take other action against any user when
the circumstances warrant. Further, the control authority is empowered to
take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant user.
§ 143-115. Performance bonds.
The control authority may decline to issue or reissue a wastewater
discharge permit to any user who has failed to comply with any provision
of this article, a previous wastewater discharge permit, or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless such
user first files a satisfactory bond, payable to the control authority, in a sum
not to exceed a value determined by the control authority to be necessary
to achieve consistent compliance.
§ 143-116. Liability insurance.
The control authority may decline to issue or reissue a wastewater
discharge permit to any user who has failed to comply with any provision
of this article, a previous wastewater discharge permit, or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless the
user submits proof that it has obtained financial assurances sufficient to
restore or repair damage to the POTW caused by its discharge.

is hereby declared a public nuisance and shall be corrected or abated as
directed by the control authority. Any person(s) creating a public nuisance
shall be subject to the provisions of the Second Class Township Code or
Borough Code, as the case may be, and applicable ordinances governing
such nuisances, including reimbursing the control authority for any costs
incurred in removing, abating, or remedying said nuisance.
§ 143-118. Assessment of civil penalties.
A. Pursuant to the provisions of Act 9 of 1992, providing for enhanced
penalty authority for publicly owned treatment works which are
authorized to enforce industrial pretreatment standards for industrial
waste discharges, and in addition to proceeding under any other
remedy available at law or equity for violation of pretreatment
standards and/or requirements, the control authority, as the operator of
a publicly owned treatment works, may assess a civil penalty upon an
industrial user for violation of any of the terms and provisions of this
article. The penalty may be assessed whether or not the violation was
willful or negligent. The civil penalty shall not exceed $25,000 per day
for each violation, regardless of jurisdictional boundaries. Each
violation for each separate day shall constitute a separate and distinct
offense under this section.
B. As part of any notice of assessment of civil penalties issued by the
control authority to an industrial user, there shall also be included a
description of the applicable appeals process to be followed, including
the name, address and telephone number of the person responsible for
accepting such appeal on behalf of the control authority.
C. For purposes of this section, a single operational upset which leads to
simultaneous violations of more than one pretreatment standard or
requirement shall be treated as a single violation as required by the
Federal Water Pollution Control Act. The control authority may,
however, recover its costs for reestablishing the operation of the
treatment works in addition to any civil penalty imposed under this
section.
D. The Lower Perkiomen Valley Regional Sewer Authority, as control
authority, shall publicly adopt a formal, written civil penalty assessment
policy and make it publicly available. Each industrial discharger
participating in the pretreatment program shall be given written notice
of the policy. The penalty assessment policy shall consider:
(1) Damage to air, water, land or other natural resources of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and their uses;
(2) Costs of restoration and abatement;
(3) Savings resulting to the person in consequence of the violation;
(4) History of past violations;
§ 143-117 PROPERTY MAINTENANCE § 143-118
135:223
(5) Deterrence of future violations; and
(6) Other relevant factors.
E. Uses for penalties. All civil penalties collected pursuant to this section
shall be placed by the control authority in a restricted account and shall
only be used by the control authority and the publicly owned treatment
works for the following uses:
(1) The repair of damage and any additional maintenance needed or
any additional costs imposed as a result of the violation for which
the penalty was imposed;
(2) Pay any penalties imposed on the Lower Perkiomen Valley Regional
Sewer Authority, as control authority, or the publicly owned
treatment works by the federal or state government for violation of
pretreatment standards;
(3) For the costs incurred by the Lower Perkiomen Valley Regional
Sewer Authority, as control authority, or publicly owned treatment
works to investigate and take the enforcement action that resulted
in a penalty being imposed;
(4) For the monitoring of discharges in the pretreatment program and
for capital improvements to the treatment works, including sewage
collection lines, which may be required by the pretreatment
program; and
(5) Any remaining funds may be used for capital improvements to the
treatment works, including collection lines.
F. Injunctive relief.
(1) The control authority shall have the power to obtain injunctive
relief to enforce compliance with or restrain any violation of any
pretreatment requirement or standard pursuant to and in
accordance with the provisions of Act 9 of 1992 and 40 CFR
403.8(f)(l)(vi)(A). Injunctive relief shall be available upon the
showing of one or more of the following:
(a) A discharge from an industrial user presents an imminent
danger or substantial harm to the POTW or the public;
(b) A discharge from an industrial user presents an imminent or
substantial endangerment to the environment;
(c) A discharge from an industrial user causes the POTW to violate
any condition of its discharge permit; or
(d) The industrial user has shown a lack of ability or intention to
comply with a pretreatment standard.
(2) Notwithstanding the preceding subsection, an injunction affecting
an industrial operation not directly related to the condition or

violation in question may be issued if the court determines that
other enforcement procedures would not be adequate to affect
prompt correction of the condition or violation. In addition to an
injunction, the court in any such proceedings may levy civil
penalties in accordance with Act 9 of 1992 and this article.
G. Appeal. An industrial user assessed with a civil penalty under the terms
of this section shall have 30 days to pay the proposed penalty in full, or,
if the industrial user wishes to contest either the amount of the penalty
or the fact of the violation, the industrial user must file an appeal of the
action within 30 days pursuant to Title 2 Pa.C.S.A. (relating to
administrative law and procedure). Failure to appeal within this period
shall result in a waiver of all legal rights to contest the violation or the
amount of the penalty.
H. The penalty authorized in this section is intended to be concurrent and
cumulative, and the provisions of this section shall not abridge or alter
any right of action or remedy, now or hereafter existing in equity, or
under the common law or statutory law, criminal or civil, available to a
person, the Lower Perkiomen Valley Regional Sewer Authority as
control authority, or the commonwealth.
A. Any person who knowingly makes any false statements, representation
or certification in any application, record, report, plan or other
document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this article or
wastewater discharge permit, or who falsifies, tampers with, or
knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method
required under this article, shall be prosecuted in accordance with the
provisions of the Pennsylvania Crimes Code pertaining to perjury and
falsification in official matters pursuant to 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 4901 et seq.
A. For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional incident
in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the
reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include
noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly
designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of
preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation.
B. An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for
noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the
requirements of Subsection C below, are met.
C. A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall
demonstrate through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs
or other relevant evidence that:
§ 143-118 PROPERTY MAINTENANCE § 143-120
135:225
§ 143-121. Prohibited discharge standards.
A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought
against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in §§ 143-55
through 143-63 of this article or the specific prohibitions in § 143-56 of this
article, except § 143-56A, B and H, if it can prove that it did not know,
or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with
discharges from other sources, would cause pass-through or interference
and that either:
(1) An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
(2) The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation
and maintenance procedures; and
(3) The user has submitted the following information to the control
authority within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this
information is provided orally, a written submission must be
provided within five days):
(a) A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
(b) The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times
or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is
expected to continue; and
(c) Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
D. In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
E. Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any
claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance
with categorical pretreatment standards.
F. Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary
to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon
reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This
requirement applies in situations where, among other things, the
primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or
fails.
A. A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in

conditions at the time the application is approved and of his right of appeal
of the permit conditions. If the Township refuses to consider a late
application under § 149-4C, the Township shall inform the applicant of its
reason for the refusal and of his right to appeal.
§ 149-7. Grounds for denial of application.
A. The Township shall approve an application for a special event permit,
unless it is determined from a consideration of the application or other
pertinent information that:
(1) Information contained in the application or supplemental
information requested from the applicant is found to be false in any
material detail.
(2) The applicant failed to complete the application form after having
been notified of the additional information or documents required.
(3) The sole purpose of the event is advertising of any product, good,
ware, merchandise.
(4) Another special event permit application has been received prior in
time or has already been approved to hold another event at the
same time and place requested by the applicant or so close in time
and place as to cause undue traffic congestion or the Police
Department is unable to meet the needs for police services for both
events.
(5) The time, route or size of the event will substantially interrupt the
safe and orderly movement of traffic contiguous to the event site or
route or disrupt the use of a street at a time when it is usually
subject to a great traffic congestion.
(6) The concentration of persons, animals and vehicles at the site of
the event or the assembly and disbanding areas around an event
will prevent proper police, fire or ambulance services to areas
proximate to the event.
(7) The size of the event will require diversion of so great a number of
police officers of the Township to ensure that participants stay
within the boundaries or route of the event or to protect
participants in the event as to prevent normal protection to the rest
of the Township. Nothing herein authorizes denial of the permit
when additional peace officers would be available to the Township
under applicable state law and mutual aid plans, if requested by the
Township in advance of the event. Nothing herein authorizes denial
of a permit because of the need to protect participants from the
conduct of others, if reasonable permit conditions can be imposed

Each stream segment in Pennsylvania has a "designated use," such
as "cold water fishery" or "potable water supply," which are listed
in Chapter 93. These uses must be protected and maintained,
under state regulations.
(1)
"Existing uses" are those attained as of November 1975, regardless
whether they have been designated in Chapter 93. Regulated earth
disturbance activities must be designed to protect and maintain
existing uses and maintain the level of water quality necessary to
protect those uses in all streams and to protect and maintain water
quality in special protection streams.
(2)
Water quality involves the chemical, biological and physical
characteristics of surface water bodies. After regulated earth
disturbance activities are complete, these characteristics can be
impacted by addition of pollutants such as sediment and changes
in habitat through increased flow volumes and/or rates as a result
of changes in land surface area from those activities. Therefore,
permanent discharges to surface waters must be managed to
protect the streambank, streambed and structural integrity of the
waterway to prevent these impacts.

Stormwater Management for Water Quality
§ 150-7. General requirements for stormwater management.
§ 150-8. Erosion and sediment control during regulated earth
disturbance activities.
§ 150-9. Water quality requirements after regulated earth
disturbance activities are complete.
A. All regulated earth disturbance activities within the Township shall be
designed, implemented, operated and maintained to meet the purposes
of this chapter, through these two elements:
(1) Erosion and sediment control during the earth disturbance
activities (e.g., during construction), and
(2) Water quality protection measures after completion of earth
disturbance activities (e.g., after construction), including
operations and maintenance.
B. No regulated earth disturbance activities within the Township shall
commence until the requirements of this chapter are met.
C. Erosion and sediment control during regulated earth disturbance
activities shall be addressed as required by § 150-8.
D. Postconstruction water quality protection shall be addressed as
required by § 150-9. Operations and maintenance of permanent
stormwater BMPs shall be addressed as required by Article V.
A. No regulated earth disturbance activities within the Township shall
commence until approval by the Township of an erosion and sediment
control plan for construction activities.
B. Evidence of any necessary permit(s) for regulated earth disturbance
activities from the appropriate DEP regional office or County
Conservation District must be provided to the Township.
C. A copy of the erosion and sediment control plan and any required
permit, as required by DEP regulations, shall be available at the project
site at all times.
A. No regulated earth disturbance activities within the Township shall
commence until approval by the Township of a plan which demonstrates
compliance with this chapter after construction is complete.
B. To control postconstruction stormwater impacts from regulated earth
disturbance activities, State Water Quality Requirements can be met by
BMPs, including site design, which provide for replication of
preconstruction stormwater infiltration and runoff condition, so that
postconstruction stormwater discharges do not degrade the physical,
§ 150-7 PROPERTY MAINTENANCE § 150-9
135:267
chemical or biological characteristics of the receiving waters. This may
be achieved by the following:
(1) Infiltration: replication of preconstruction stormwater infiltration
conditions;
(2) Treatment: use of water quality treatment BMPs to ensure filtering
out of the chemical and physical pollutants from the stormwater
runoff: and
(3) Streambank and streambed protection: management of volume and
rate of postconstruction stormwater discharges to prevent physical
degradation of receiving waters (e.g., from scouring).

ARTICLE IV
Stormwater Management for Runoff Control
§ 150-10. General requirements.
Measures used to collect and carry stormwater on any site shall be designed
to meet the following minimum performance standards:
A. Prevent erosion damage and satisfactorily carry off or detain and
control the rate of release of surface waters.
B. When subsurface soil conditions are suitable, require runoff control
measures to percolate the stormwater into the ground to aid in the
recharge of ground waters, and the preservation of baseflow.
C. Carry surface water to the nearest adequate street, storm drain,
detention basin, natural watercourse or drainage facility.
D. Take surface water from the bottom of vertical grades, to lead water
away from springs and collect water upgrade of all street intersections
at the earliest or most efficient point.
E. Control/accommodate not only the anticipated peak discharge from the
on-site disturbed ares, but also the existing runoff being contributed
from all land at a higher elevation in the same watershed.
F. Maintain the adequacy of the natural stream channels. Accelerated
bank erosion shall be prevented by controlling the rate and velocity of
runoff discharged to these watercourses so as to avoid increasing the
occurrence of stream bank overflow.
G. Preserve the adequacy of existing culverts and bridges by suppressing
the new flood peaks created by the new earth disturbances.
H. If in the course of preparing or reviewing the stormwater management
plan the Township Engineer determines that off-site improvements are
necessary to satisfactorily control the stormwater from the site, the
applicant shall be responsible for such off-site improvements.
I. All stormwater detention and retention facilities shall be in place and
functioning prior to the creation of any impervious surface.
J. Whenever a watercourse, stream or intermittent stream is located
within a grading site, it shall remain open in its natural state and
location and shall not be piped unless permitted by Pennsylvania
Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) and the Upper
Providence Township Board of Supervisors.
K. The existing points of natural drainage discharge onto adjacent
property shall not be altered without the written approval and a
drainage easement from the affected land owners.
§ 150-10 PROPERTY MAINTENANCE § 150-10
135:269
§ 150-11. Detention facility design.
L. No stormwater runoff or natural drainage shall be so diverted as to
overload existing drainage systems or create flooding or the need for
additional drainage structures on other private properties or public
lands.
A. Stormwater detention facilities. Stormwater detention facilities include
all structural measures, which can reliably and predictably achieve the
peak discharge requirements. Stormwater detention facilities include,
but are not necessarily limited to, detention basins, retention basins,
bioretention areas, open (at-grade) sand filters, closed (belowgrade)
sand filters, water quality inlets, dry wells, below-grade detention
chambers and rooftop detention.
B. Peak discharge design storms. The design storm criteria to be used in
calculations for the watershed is to limit the post-development runoff
for the fifty-year storm to the two-year storm pre-development rates.
Any stormwater detention facilities required by this chapter and subject
to the water quality requirements and stormwater runoff peak rate
requirements herein shall meet the applicable water quality and peak
rate requirement for the two-, ten-, 50- and one-hundred-year return
period runoff events (design storms) consistent with the standard and
accepted calculation methodology and engineering standards and be
satisfactory to the Township engineer.
C. Runoff calculation methodology.
(1) Any stormwater runoff calculation involving drainage areas greater
than 20 acres, including on- and off-site areas, shall use a generally
accepted calculation technique that is based on the NRCS soil
cover complex method. It is assumed that all methods will be
selected by the design professional based on the individual
limitations and suitability of each method for a particular site.
(2) All calculations consistent with this chapter using the soil cover
complex method shall use the appropriate design rainfall depths for
the various return period storms.
(3) For purposes of pre-development flow rate determination,
undeveloped land shall be considered as "meadow, in good
condition", unless the natural ground cover generates a lower
curve number or rational "c" value.
(4) All calculations using the rational method shall use rainfall
intensities consistent with appropriate times of concentration for
overland flow and return periods from NRCS methodology. Time of
concentration for overland flow (maximum 300 feet) and
concentrated flow shall both be calculated using NRCS
methodology. Times of concentration for channel and pipe flow
§ 150-10 UPPER PROVIDENCE CODE § 150-11
135:270
shall be computed using Manning's equation or NRCS
methodology.
(5) The design of any stormwater detention facilities intended to meet
the performance standards of this chapter shall be verified by
routing the design storm hydrograph through these facilities using
accepted methods of practice. The Township Engineer may approve
the use of any generally accepted reservoir routing technique,
which shall use a total runoff volume that is consistent with the
volume from a method that produces a full hydrograph. The
computer routing program used must take into account the
tailwater effect of the discharge pipe on the orifice design as well
as the submergence of the discharge pipe outlet.
(6) Outlet structures for stormwater BMPs shall be designed to meet
the performance standards of this chapter using any generally
accepted hydraulic analysis technique or method approved by the
Township Engineer.
D. Stormwater detention and retention facilities. Stormwater detention
and retention facilities shall meet the following minimum design/
construction standards:
(1) Detention basin shall be designed to facilitate regular
maintenance, mowing and periodic silt removal and reseeding.
Shallow broad basins are preferred to steep sided basins.
(2) The maximum slope of the earth and detention basin embankment
shall be three to one (3:1) with the exception that any slope to be
maintained by the Township shall be 4:1. The top or toe of any slope
shall be located a minimum of five feet from a property line.
Whenever possible, the side slope and basin shape shall conform to

adequately accommodate the traveling public. In advancing these
principles, the specific intent and purpose of this article is to:
A. Provide adequate land in the public rights-of-way of sufficient width to
comfortably accommodate both present and future vehicular traffic
demands, to accommodate future road widening to service said
demands and to provide for sufficient area for storm drainage facilities

ARTICLE IV
Design Standards
§ 154-17. General principles and requirements.
The following principles of subdivision and land development, general
requirements and minimum standards of design shall be observed by the
applicant in all instances.
A. All portions of a tract being subdivided shall be taken up in lots, streets,
public lands or other proposed uses so that remnants and landlocked
areas shall not be created.
B. When a portion of a tract is being reviewed relative to subdivision and
land development, but where future subdivision or development is
imminent, the applicant shall demonstrate that the remainder of the
tract or parcel may be subdivided or developed in conformance with the
existing zoning classification of land use in a logical and satisfactory
manner, as a condition of approval of his plan.
C. Whenever possible, applicants shall preserve trees, groves, waterways,
scenic points, historic spots and other community assets and
landmarks.
D. Subdivisions and land developments should be laid out so as to avoid
the necessity for excessive cut or fill unless specifically warranted by
terrain or location.
E. Low-lying land subject to periodic flooding shall not be subdivided or
developed for residential development or for such other uses as may
involve danger to health, safety, morals and general welfare.
F. Where no centralized water supply is available to the subdivision or
land development, the Board of Supervisors shall require the
subdivider, developer or builder to obtain from the Montgomery County
Health Department certificates of approval as to the quality and
adequacy of the water supply proposed to be utilized by the subdivider,
developer or builder and approval of the type and construction methods
to be employed in the installation of the individual water supply system,
in accordance with current state regulations and those of the Township.
Consideration should be given to the probability of an eventual
interconnection with a centralized water system in the future.
[Amended 6-2-2008 by Ord. No. 490]
G. Where the subdivision or land development is inaccessible to sanitary
sewers, the Board of Supervisors shall require the subdivider,
developer or builder to obtain from the district sanitarian of the
Department of Environmental Resources certificates of approval of the
sewage disposal facilities to be provided by the subdivider, developer or
builder, in accordance with current state regulations.

151:339
§ 154-18. Streets.
In accordance with the Second Class Township Code,85 all new streets
and widened portions of all existing rights-of-way intended for public use
shall be dedicated to the Township, subject to final acceptance based on
compliance with the following requirements:
H. Applicants shall observe the ultimate rights-of-way for contiguous
existing streets as prescribed by the Ultimate Right-of-Way Map for the
Township.84 Additional portions of the corridors for such streets shall be
offered, when required by the Township, to the governmental agency
having jurisdiction. Applicable building setback lines, as defined by
Chapter 182, Zoning, shall be delineated as measured from the ultimate
right-of-way. [Amended 1-15-1990 by Ord. No. 296]
I. Proposed subdivision and land development shall be coordinated with
the existing nearby neighborhood so that the community as a whole
may develop harmoniously.
J. Improvement construction requirements will be completed under
specifications of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation,
Department of Environmental Protection, the Montgomery County
Conservation District or other appropriate agencies or the
specifications included herein, whichever specifications shall result in
the more favorable interpretation of this chapter. [Amended 6-2-2008
by Ord. No. 490]
K. Construction of facilities. The subdivider, developer or builder shall,
where specified by the governing body, construct and install with no
expense to the Township the streets, curbs, sidewalks, water mains,
sanitary and storm sewers, streetlights, fire hydrants, street signs,
shade trees, monuments and other facilities and utilities specified in
this article. The construction and installation of such facilities and
utilities shall be subject to inspection by appropriate Township officials
during the progress of the work, and the subdivider shall pay for
inspection.
L. Upper Providence Engineering Construction Standards and
Improvement Procedures, as adopted by resolution and as may be
amended from time to time by resolution of the Upper Providence
Township Board of Supervisors. [Added 6-2-2008 by Ord. No. 490]
A. Street system.
(1) Conformance with adopted plans. The proposed street pattern shall
be properly regulated to existing streets, to the Township plan of
streets and to such county and state road and highway plans as
have been duly adopted by that agency.
84.Editor's Note: See Ch. 151, Streets and Sidewalks, Art. IV.
85.Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 66101 et seq.
§ 154-17 UPPER PROVIDENCE CODE § 154-18
151:340
(2) Arrangement. Streets shall be arranged in a manner to meet with
the approval of the governing body, considered in relation to both
existing and planned streets, and located so as to allow proper
development of surrounding properties. Secondary and through
highways shall be connected with such existing streets and
highways so as to form continuations thereof. Residential streets
shall be laid out to discourage their use as secondary streets or
through highways.
(3) Conformity with topography. Streets shall be adjusted to the
contour of the land so as to produce usable lots and streets of
reasonable grade, alignment and drainage.
(4) Grading. The street shall be graded to the full width of the right-ofway
and provision made for slopes beyond the right-of-way, in
conformance with municipal specifications.
(5) Provisions of streets for future development. Access shall be given
to all lots and portions of the tract in the subdivision and to
adjacent unsubdivided territory. Streets giving such access shall be
improved to the limits of the subdivision when required by the
Township. Remnants, reserve strips and landlocked areas shall not
be created. [Amended 1-15-1990 by Ord. No. 296]
(6) New streets. New streets shall be laid out to continue existing
streets at equal or greater right-of-way and cartway widths, where
practical.
(7) Dead-end streets. Dead-end streets are prohibited, unless designed
as culs-de-sac or designed for access exclusively to neighboring
tracts.
(8) Street names. Continuations of existing streets shall be known by
the same name. Names for new streets shall not duplicate or
closely resemble names of existing streets. All street names are
subject to the approval of the Township Planning Commission and
governing body.
(9) Half street. The dedication of half streets at the edges of a new
subdivision is prohibited. If circumstances render this
impracticable, adequate provision for the concurrent dedication of
the remaining half of the street must be furnished by the
subdivider, developer or builder. When there exits a half street in
an adjoining subdivision, the remaining half shall be provided by
the proposed development.
B. Street alignment.
(1) Sight distance on horizontal and vertical curves. Proper sight
distance should be provided with respect to both horizontal and
vertical alignments. Measured along the center line, this should be
800 feet for primary roads, 400 feet for secondary roads and 200
§ 154-18 STREETS AND SIDEWALKS § 154-18
151:341
feet for local residential streets, measured at the center line and at
the driver's eye height of four feet.
(2) Horizontal curves shall be used at all changes in excess of 2°. Long
radius curves shall be used rather than a series of curves
connected by short tangents. Minimum radius curves at the end of
long tangents will not be approved. Flatter or longer curves shall
be used when required by the Township. [Amended 1-15-1990 by
Ord. No. 296]
(a) Curvature. The minimum radius at the center line for
horizontal curves on primary streets shall be 300 feet; for
secondary streets, 200 feet; and for all other streets, 150 feet.
(b) Tangents between curves. For all streets there shall be a
tangent of at least 100 feet, measured at the center line
between reverse curves. [Amended 1-15-1990 by Ord. No.
296]
(3) Vertical curves. [Amended 1-15-1990 by Ord. No. 296]
(a) Vertical curves shall be used at changes in grade of 1% or
more. The minimum length of vertical curves for each 1% of
change in grade shall be as follows:
[1] Controlled access streets: 150 feet.
[2] Collector streets: 50 feet.
[3] Residential streets: 25 feet.
[4] Within 150 feet of the intersection (stop condition): 10
feet.
(b) Crest and sag vertical curves shall not produce excessive
flatness in grade. The minimum vertical curve factors shown
above shall be used.
(4) Street grades.
(a) There shall be a minimum grade of at least 1% on all streets.
(b) Maximum grades. There shall be maximum grade of 7% on
primary and secondary streets and 10% on all other streets for
distances of not more than 1,500 feet. However, grades in
excess of 5% shall be avoided wherever possible. The grade
shall be measured along the center line.
(c) Curve-grade combinations. A combination of minimum radius
horizontal curves and maximum grades will not be approved.
(d) Street intersections. The grade within 50 feet of any side of an
intersection or the outer perimeter of a cul-de-sac shall not
§ 154-18 UPPER PROVIDENCE CODE § 154-18
151:342
exceed 3%. The grade will be measured along the curbline of
the street.
(e) Street grading. All streets shall be graded to the grades shown
on the street profile and cross-section plan submitted and
approved with the preliminary plan of subdivision and land
development. [Amended 1-15-1990 by Ord. No. 296]
(f) The pavement cross slope shall be 1/4 inch (0.021 foot) per
foot. Superelevation shall not be used on any residential roads
unless required by the Township Engineer. [Added 6-2-2008
by Ord. No. 490]
C. Roadway classifications. All roads within the Township, either public or
private, shall be classified as one of the following: limited-access,
controlled-access, semicontrolled-access, collector, feeder, residential
or village roads. These roadway classifications have been shown on the
Township Ultimate Right-of-Way Map.86 [Amended 9-20-1982 by Ord.
No. 232; 1-15-1990 by Ord. No. 296]
(1) Limited-access, controlled-access and semicontrolled-access roads
are roads under the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania or the federal government. As such, the roadway
width will be established by their criteria and approval. The
ultimate right-of-way width shall be established as shown on the
Township Ultimate Right-of-Way Map.
(2) Collector roads. These roads are designed to serve as connections
between feeder roads and residential roads to other feeder roads,
community facilities and major highways with medium traffic
volume. Additionally, collector roads may also serve business or
industrial areas. This type of road shall have a minimum right-ofway
width of 80 feet and a minimum pavement width of 40 feet.
(3) Feeder roads. These roads shall be used as connecting and through
roads to serve residential areas and to connect residential streets
to collector roads and community facilities with light traffic
volumes. This type of road shall have minimum widths of right-ofway
of 60 feet and minimum pavement widths of 38 feet.
(4) Residential roads. These roads shall be used to serve residential
areas. They shall have minimum right-of-way widths of 50 feet and
pavement widths of 32 feet.
(5) Village roads. These roads shall be used in the densely populated
village areas. These roads only apply to the existing village roads,
and the extensions or new roads shall comply with residential road
criteria. The Township retains the right to require the widening of
any existing roads and the offer of dedication of additional rightsof-
way as it deems necessary.
86.Editor's Note: See Ch. 151, Streets and Sidewalks, Art. IV.
§ 154-18 STREETS AND SIDEWALKS § 154-18
151:343
D. Other roadway types. The following roads may be used in various
locations throughout the Township to fulfill roadway design needs:
[Amended 9-20-1982 by Ord. No. 232; 4-20-1987 by Ord. No. 266;
1-15-1990 by Ord. No. 296]
(1) Marginal-access roads. These roads shall be used as minor roads to
serve adjacent properties which have roadway frontage along
limited-access, controlled-access and semicontrolled-access roads.
This type of roadway runs parallel with and adjacent to the limitedaccess
roadway and serves to reduce the number of roadway
access points to the major roads. These roads shall have minimum
right-of-way widths of 50 feet and minimum pavement widths of 32
feet.
(2) Cul-de-sac streets shall be those streets with one end open for
vehicular access and the other terminating in a vehicular
turnaround. All culs-de-sac, whether considered permanent (serve
only the tract to be developed) or temporary (terminated at an
adjacent property line), shall be designed under the following
criteria:
(a) No cul-de-sac shall be approved when a through street is
possible for the tract under consideration. All culs-de-sac must
be approved by the Supervisors, with the Township reserving
the right to reject any and all culs-de-sac proposed. The
following items shall be used in determining the necessity of
the cul-de-sac:
[1] Adverse topography such as a steep terrain, floodplain,
streams, etc.
[2] The shape of the tract does not lend itself to a through
street.
(b) At the request of the Township, the developer shall provide
roadway access to adjacent parcels of land. The Township also
reserves the right to accept or reject any cul-de-sac which is
placed adjacent to an adjoining property line at the request of
the developer. All temporary culs-de-sac must provide
sufficient data to prove the feasibility of such road extension
onto other lands.
(c) All culs-de-sac shall be constructed to the same street and
right-of-way widths and construction improvement
specifications as they relate to the intensity of land use in
which they exist.
(d) Cul-de-sac streets shall have a minimum right-of-way of 50
feet, and additional width shall be provided when required by
the Township. The turnaround at the end of the cul-de-sac shall
have a pavement/curb radius of 50 feet and a right-of-way
radius of 60 feet. The turnaround radius shall be centered on
§ 154-18 UPPER PROVIDENCE CODE § 154-18
151:344
the proposed road center line. A permanent turnaround may
be provided by the developer with a center island minimum
radius of 78 feet and an outer pavement/curb minimum radius
of 100 feet. The road width may be reduced as the radius is
increased, upon approval by the Township. Maintenance of this
island shall be as required by the Township, and the record
plan and the deed of each lot abutting the turnaround shall
note such requirements. The turnaround shall be posted for
one-way operation, and no parking shall be allowed on the
turnaround.
(e) The length of culs-de-sac shall not be more than 600 feet from
the near right-of-way line of the intersecting street to the back
of the right-of-way of the turnaround unless approved by the
Board of Supervisors. The developer must provide justification
for lengths longer than 600 feet.
(f) A cul-de-sac street shall be at least 300 feet in length from the
right-of-way of the near side of the intersecting street to the
farthermost right-of-way of the cul-de-sac turnaround.
(g) Driveways on cul-de-sac streets shall be located, designed and
constructed in such a manner as to not interfere or be
inconsistent with design, maintenance, and drainage of the culde-
sac street. Drive access points in the turnaround area shall
also be combined along property lines when required by the
Township. No more than two drives may be combined at any
one access point. [Amended 8-1-2011 by Ord. No. 517]
(h) The Township may request the developer to provide a
permanent easement for snow removal from the turnaround
area of the cul-de-sac. The location of this easement shall be
provided by the Township. The easement shall have a minimum
length along the right-of-way line of 40 feet and a depth of 15
feet. When curbing is required, a curb depression shall also be
placed in this easement area. No shrubbery, fence, mailbox or
any other obstruction shall be placed within the easement to
hinder the placement of the snow.
(i) Existing temporary culs-de-sac and rights-of-way located on
adjacent parcels, whether open (improved) or not, shall be
used by the developer to tie in their proposed roadway system.
It shall be the responsibility of the developer to complete all
roadway improvements at his expense within the existing
rights-of-way of adjacent parcels to service his tract.
(j) All subdivisions which contain unimproved street rights-of-way
for future extension onto adjacent property shall dedicate such
areas to the Township along with other roadway dedications.
The record plan and adjacent lots shall note that this area has
§ 154-18 STREETS AND SIDEWALKS § 154-18
151:345
been set aside for future road extension and that the area shall
remain only in a grass cover until needed by the Township.
(k) A note shall appear on the record plan which indicates that the
temporary culs-de-sac and improved street rights-of-way to the
adjacent property shown on the plan may be extended as
through streets when the adjacent property is developed.
(3) Alleys. Alleys are prohibited in residential developments. In
commercial or industrial districts without expressly designed
loading areas, alleys with a minimum width of 25 feet shall be
required. Where such alleys dead-end, they shall be provided with a
turnaround having a radius of not less than 25 feet The cartway
shall be a minimum of 20 feet.
(a) Paving. The paving requirements shall be the same as for
street paving.
(b) Intersections of right-of-way lines shall be rounded by a
tangential arc, the minimum radius of which shall be 10 feet,
and the edge of the paving at intersections shall be rounded by
a tangential arc, the minimum radius of which shall be 15 feet.
(c) Obstructions. No fences, hedges, trees, shrubbery, walls,
plantings or other obstructions shall be located within the
right-of-way. Reasonable sight distance shall be provided at
intersections with streets.
E. Street width. The following general standards shall apply to street
widths:
(1) The minimum widths of the right-of-way and paving and the
requirements for curbing shall not be less than those of an existing
street of which the new street is to be a continuation, nor less than
as required above under classification.
(2) The minimum right-of-way width for development along existing
streets shall correspond with the ultimate right-of-way for these
streets, as defined on the Township Ultimate Right-of-Way Map.87
(3) The area between an existing right-of-way line and the ultimate
right-of-way line should be offered for dedication to the authority
having jurisdiction over the road when land is subdivided or
developed along an existing right-of-way.
(4) Islands, medial strips and channelization may be required in any
area where traffic volumes warrant their use for safety and
efficiency and may be permitted in any area at the discretion of the
Board of Supervisors. Such devices on state roads must meet or
87.Editor's Note: See Ch. 151, Streets and Sidewalks, Art. IV.
§ 154-18 UPPER PROVIDENCE CODE § 154-18
151:346
exceed the requirements of the Pennsylvania Department of
Transportation.
(5) Additional width requirements. Additional widths may be required
by the Township:
(a) Where necessary for public safety and convenience.
(b) For parking in commercial or industrial areas.
(c) Where old roads do not provide the proper width and
additional dedication is necessary.
(d) Where necessary at approaches to major intersections or at
approaches to interchanges of the Route 422 Expressway.
[Added 7-7-1997 by Ord. No. 364]
(6) No fences, hedges, trees, shrubbery, walls, plantings or other
obstructions shall be located or be permitted within the right-ofway,
except for ground covers such as grass, ivy, crown vetch or
horizontally spreading shrubs less than one foot high or retaining
walls necessitated by road widening and constructed by the
authority having jurisdiction over the road.
F. Street construction. All street construction must conform to the
Pennsylvania Department of Transportation Specifications, Publication
408, latest edition, and/or the Upper Providence Engineering and
Construction Standards and Improvement Procedures, latest edition,
whichever is more restrictive. All construction must be approved by the
Township Engineer prior to acceptance by the governing body. All
grades, horizontal and vertical curves, intersections, sight distances
and tangents shall conform to the requirements established by this
chapter and shall be subject to the approval of the Township Engineer.
[Amended 9-20-1982 by Ord. No. 232; 1-15-1990 by Ord. No. 296;
6-2-2008 by Ord. No. 490]
G. Street intersections.
(1) Number of intersections. No more than two streets shall cross at
the same point. Four-way intersections are to be avoided in the
layout when three-way or T intersections can be utilized. When
existing streets intersect at odd angles or have more than four
approaches, the subdivider, developer or builder shall be required
to make corrective changes to eliminate the odd angle or reduce
the number of approaches to the intersection by curing the lesser
street.
(2) Minimum angle of intersection. Right angle of intersections shall
be used whenever practicable, especially when local streets empty
into major or secondary streets; there shall be no intersection
angle, measured at the center line, of less than a 60° minimum.
§ 154-18 STREETS AND SIDEWALKS § 154-18
151:347
(3) Center line. Where center lines of residential or secondary streets
open into opposite sides of a major street within 100 feet of each
other, they shall be made to coincide by curving the minor street or
streets.
(4) Primary thoroughfare. Wherever practicable, intersections with
through highways shall be kept to a minimum and shall be located
at least 800 feet apart.
(5) Sight triangles. No building, trees, hedge, shrubbery, or other
obstruction whatsoever will be permitted in the sight triangles

made where the frontage exceeds 300 feet in length.
(8) Where subdivision or land development will allow or require a
series of driveway intersections with primary or secondary streets
only 200 feet apart or less, a marginal-access street should be used;
however, the Board of Supervisors shall have discretion if in its
opinion hazards exist to require a marginal-access street for
driveways more than 200 feet apart.
(9) The Board of Supervisors shall have the authority to approve
driveways intended for the use of two or more families, apartment
developments and commercial and industrial projects where usage
by the occupants constitutes essentially a private street. Driveways
constituting private streets are those accessways used by two or
§ 154-19 UPPER PROVIDENCE CODE § 154-19

A. Automobile parking facilities shall be provided off-street in accordance
with requirements of Chapter 182, Zoning, and this chapter.
B. At no time shall angle or perpendicular parking along the curbs of local,
public or private access roads or streets be permitted. All parking lots
and bays allowing any parking other than parallel shall be physically
separated from the cartway by a minimum of seven feet and confined by
barrier curbing.
C. No one area for off-street parking of motor vehicles in residential areas
shall exceed 36 cars in capacity. Separate parking areas on a parcel
shall be physically separated from one another by ten-foot planting
strips.
D. No less than 20 feet of open space shall be provided between the
curbline of any parking area and the outside wall of the dwelling unit in
residential areas.
E. Parking may be permitted within side and/or rear yards when the side
and/or rear yards abut a district zoned industrial and/or commercial.
However, no parking shall be permitted within five feet of a side or rear
property line unless formal arrangements satisfactory to the Township
have been made for the establishment of common parking facilities.
F. In commercial and industrial districts, the provision of common parking
facilities is hereby encouraged in recognition of their increased
flexibility and efficiency. Subject to the formal arrangements between
the proposed users of the common parking facilities, satisfactory to the
Township, the Zoning Hearing Board may reduce the aggregate amount
of required parking space upon determination that greater efficiency is
affected by the joint use of the common parking area. When common
§ 154-19 UPPER PROVIDENCE CODE § 154-20
151:352
parking facilities are approved, side and/or rear yard parking
requirements may be waived in order to establish unified and
continuous parking areas. In such cases, access drives and sidewalks
shall be so aligned as to maximize parking efficiency and minimize
traffic congestion. Entrances and exits must have good visibility so that,
both going in and coming out, drivers can see and cars can be seen.
G. All dead-end parking lots shall be designed to provide sufficient backup
area for the end stalls.
H. No less than a five-foot radius of curvature shall be permitted for all

L. In order to reduce runoff and/or provide more landscaped area, the
length of parking spaces within a parking lot, excluding parallel parking
spaces, may be reduced to 16 feet where an overhang area of grass or
other pervious material is installed. Such area shall not be less than two
feet in depth for each parking space and shall be separated from the
paved area by a curb stop. Allowance for said reduction in parking
space length shall be at the discretion of the Board of Supervisors, upon
recommendation of the Planning Commission and Township Engineer,
and shall be in addition to any required landscaped area/green space
required in the parking lot by this chapter and/or Chapter 182, Zoning.

A. Where required.
(1) Sidewalks shall be provided along both sides of all streets
excepting where, in the opinion of the governing body, they are
unnecessary for the public safety and convenience.
(2) In land development with common areas, sidewalks should be
located appropriately to serve as accesses between parking areas
and buildings and in common areas to serve as internal site
circulation.
(3) Handicapped ramps shall be constructed at all roadway
intersections and at other locations designated by the Township.
B. Design standards.
(1) Sidewalks shall be a minimum of four feet wide or as shown on the
approved plan. A greater width may be required in areas in which
apartments or business buildings are located or deemed necessary
at the discretion of Board of Supervisors.
(2) Location. On public streets, sidewalks shall be located behind the
curbline a minimum distance of 4 1/2 feet for residential roads and
five feet for all other roads. The grade of the sidewalk shall be
continuous across driveways except in certain cases where heavy
traffic volume dictates special treatment.
C. Crosswalks. Crosswalks shall be not less than six feet wide and with
concrete ADA ramps not less than four feet wide where necessary. They
shall be maintained by the abutting property owners in the same
manner as sidewalks on public streets.

new and widened roads.
B. Belgian block curbing. Belgian block curbing is allowed only by waiver
from the Board of Supervisors and shall be designed and constructed
according to the Upper Providence Township Engineering and
Construction Standards and Improvements Procedures, latest edition.
C. The Board of Supervisors may waive the curbing requirement if the
developer can prove to the Township that a proposed system of welldesigned
swales can perform the drainage function comparable to a
system of curbs and inlets and that the appearance and functioning of
the roadway and parking lot system shall not be impaired by the lack of
curbing.
D. Construction. All curb construction must conform to the Pennsylvania
Department of Transportation Specifications, Publication 408, latest
edition, and/or the Upper Providence Township Engineering and

A. Length. In general, all blocks in a subdivision shall have a minimum
length of 500 feet and a maximum length of 1,200 feet unless special
conditions warrant a variance.
B. Width.
(1) Whenever practicable, blocks shall be of such width as to provide
two tiers of lots of the minimum size permitted under the
applicable zoning classification, except in the case of lots along a
major thoroughfare where the lot fronts on an interior street.
(2) Through lots. Double-frontage lots are to be avoided and generally
will not be permitted except where reversed frontage is desired
away from a major thoroughfare to a street of a lesser traffic
volume.
C. Variations. Blocks for commercial and industrial areas may vary from
the elements of design contained in this section if the nature of the use
requires other treatment. In such cases, off-street parking for
employees and customers will be required along with safe and
convenient limited access to the street system. Space for off-street

loading will also be required with similar access. The extension of
streets, railroad access rights-of-way and utilities shall be provided. The
amount of parking space shall be as required by Chapter 182, Zoning.
A. Area. All lots shall be no smaller than the minimum lot area
requirements of the applicable zoning classification.
B. Depth. Lots excessively deep in relation to width are to be avoided. A
proportion of 2 1/2:1 is generally regarded as the proper maximum for
lots 60 feet or more in width.
C. Width. The minimum width of a lot shall be that width specified for the
applicable zoning district and which is measured along the building
setback line. [Amended 1-15-1990 by Ord. No. 296]
D. Corner lots. Corner lots shall have a minimum lot width of the width
required for the applicable zoning district, plus the front yard
dimension along all roads. This requirement does not apply to lots
which have a minimum lot area of 40,000 square feet or larger.
[Amended 1-15-1990 by Ord. No. 296]
E. Frontage. The frontage shall not be less than the minimum
requirements of Chapter 182, Zoning, except that on the outside of
curved residential streets and on the turnaround of culs-de-sac, a
minimum frontage of 50 feet may be acceptable, provided that proper
lot width is attained at the building setback lines.
F. Side lines. Whenever practicable, the side lines of a lot shall be set at
right angles or radial to the right-of-way line for the full length of the
side lines. [Amended 1-15-1990 by Ord. No. 296]
G. Building lines. Building lines for all lots shall be in conformance with
the minimum front, side and rear yard line requirements of the
applicable zoning district.
H. Lot numbers. For the purpose of development, each subdivision may
have an overall system of lot numbers, the number one being assigned
to a lot in the first section to be developed. (Such system of lot numbers
shall not be confused with the regular house or building numbering
system based on a Township-wide plan.91)
I. Building numbers. House or building numbers shall be assigned by the
municipality based on an overall street plan. Numbers will be assigned
in such a way as to allow for vacant parcels and future developments.
J. Rear lots. When rear lots are utilized in any subdivision, the following
requirements shall apply: [Added 12-16-1991 by Ord. No. 307]
91.Editor's Note: See Ch. 64, Buildings, Numbering of.
§ 154-23 UPPER PROVIDENCE CODE § 154-24
151:356
(1) The lengths of the access strip shall be no longer than 300 feet
from the ultimate right-of-way of the frontage road.
(2) There shall be no bend in the access strip greater than 45°.
(3) No more than two rear lots shall be allowed adjacent to each other.
In such instances, the access strips shall abut each other unless the
applicant can demonstrate that there is a natural or design
constraint dictating otherwise. In instances where the access strips
for two rear lots abut each other, the Board of Supervisors may
require that they share a common access point when such is
warranted for protection of the traveling public's health and safety,
due to circumstances such as, but not limited to, inadequate sight
distance, poor vertical and/or horizontal alignment and high traffic
volumes on the intersecting roadway. In making such a
determination, the Board of Supervisors shall obtain the
recommendations of the Township Planning Commission and
Township Engineer. When a common access point is required, a
common driveway shall also be required, from the edge of the
pavement to a point 50 feet beyond the ultimate right-of-way line,
and from that point either one common driveway can continue or
two individual driveways may be used. At a minimum, the required
length of a common driveway shall be paved in accordance with
§ 154-19B(3) of this chapter. For the entire length of any common
driveway, legal guaranties and cross easements shall be recorded,
assuring perpetual maintenance and right of passage by both
parties. Said guaranties and cross easements shall be as approved
by the Township Solicitor.
(4) Construction easements shall be provided along the access strips
on adjacent parcels when it is determined by design that such
easements would be required.
(5) When a rear lot is subdividable, the Board of Supervisors, at the
recommendation of the Planning Commission, shall require a
roadway profile through the entire length of the access strip. Said
profile shall be in accordance with the requirements for a
residential road contained in this chapter.
(a) A legal guaranty, to the satisfaction of the Township Solicitor,
shall be provided to assure the future construction of said road
and to indemnify the Township of any financial liability for
installation of the road. Said road shall be constructed or
financially guaranteed by the applicant at the time
construction is necessitated.
(b) An overall tentative sketch plan shall be submitted as part of
the original subdivision submission to show how the proposed
rear lotting forms a logical and appropriate first phase in the
subdivision of the entire tract and/or how it will allow
interconnection with adjacent tracts.

§ 154-24.1. Reverse-frontage lot requirements. [Added 8-7-1995 by
Ord. No. 344]
(c) When the road is constructed, any access strips or portions
thereof which are no longer needed shall revert to the owners
of the abutting lots, in accordance with the conditions of
approval for the preliminary plan which created the access
strips.
(d) In any instance in which two abutting rear lots are created in
which either one or both are capable of further subdivision, the
requirements of this section are applicable. The roadway
profile may be located in one access strip or split between the
two strips.
A. Applicability. This section requires visual buffering for reverse-frontage
lots within residential developments containing at least five such lots
which are contiguous to one another, wherein such developments front
on roads of feeder or greater classification, as shown on the Upper
Providence Township Ultimate Right-of-Way Map. It is the intent of this
section to allow for the preservation of the existing rural character of
these roads and to promote the health, safety and welfare of the
residents who live along them. Reverse-frontage lots which are also
corner lots having a side yard abutting a road of lesser classification
shall be included in determining the applicability of this section and
shall be buffered as described herein.
B. Buffer landscape requirements.
(1) Buffer setback area requirement. For any reverse-frontage lot
qualifying under this section, a buffer setback area shall be
provided on the final subdivision plan, in which the buffer shall be
placed. The minimum width of the setback area shall be 25 feet,
measured from the ultimate right-of-way line. The buffer setback
area shall be part of the lot on which it is located and shall be
provided in addition to the required rear yard setback for the
district in which the lot is located. No structures shall be permitted
in the buffer setback area, with the exception of retaining walls and
privacy fences permitted pursuant to Subsection D(2) herein.
(2) General requirements. The developer shall install landscaping in
accordance with the provisions herein in any buffer for reversefrontage
lots which meet the qualifications of Subsection A of this
section. Berming, in accordance with the requirements of
Subsection D herein, shall also be encouraged to be included within
the buffer.
(3) Buffer type. All reverse-frontage lots shall incorporate a Type 2
buffer on the properties bordering the roads of feeder or greater
classification as defined herein. In the case of other required
§ 154-24 UPPER PROVIDENCE CODE § 154-24.1
151:358
buffers, the widest and/or most opaque buffer will take precedence.
[Amended 12-16-2013 by Ord. No. 535]
C. Design standards. The following design standards shall apply to
landscape buffering for reverse-frontage lots:
(1) Where possible, buffer plantings shall meander within the buffer
setback area set aside for the buffer, as required in Subsection B(1)
herein. Straight lines of plant material shall be avoided.
(2) All landscaping to be installed in the buffer shall conform to the
requirements specified in Subsection B of § 154-36, Planting.
[Amended 9-21-1998 by Ord. No. 376]
(3) Existing trees and shrubs should be integrated into the design of
buffers wherever feasible. Section 154-35B, Tree preservation, of
this chapter, shall be enforced for any reverse-frontage buffer when
existing trees are deemed of good health and reasonable character
by a qualified individual, and determined to be appropriate for their
intended use by the Township.
D. Berms. Earthen berms shall conform to the following requirements
when included in the buffer design:
(1) Design standards.
(a) The berms shall conform to the requirements specified in
Subsection D of § 154-36, except that it is recommended that
the length of any berm segment be a maximum of 200 feet;
provided, however, that the length and location of any berm or
berm segment shall be modified if necessary to accommodate
proper stormwater flow and management as prescribed by the
Township Engineer. [Amended 9-21-1998 by Ord. No. 376]
(b) In any design in which a berm is constructed against a
retaining wall, 1/2 of a typical berm section shall be sufficient.
Said arrangement would therefore provide for the high point of
the berm to rest against the wall.
(2) Retaining walls and privacy fences.
(a) When a retaining wall within a berm section is deemed
necessary by the Township Engineer, drainage must be
provided to avoid the collection of water against the wall;
drainage design shall be to the satisfaction of the Township
Engineer.
(b) If the individual lot owner places any privacy fencing within the
buffer setback area, landscaping shall be provided within the
buffer setback area on the street side of the fence. Any fencing
for privacy or security shall also comply with § 182-169.1 and
all other applicable requirements of Article XX, Fences, of
Chapter 182, Zoning. [Amended 2-7-2000 by Ord. No. 389]
§ 154-24.1 STREETS AND SIDEWALKS § 154-24.1
151:359
§ 154-25. Land with existing structures.
No subdivision or land will be approved with the property line extending
through any portion of any existing structure.
E. Landscape plan. For all reverse-frontage lots qualifying Subsection A
herein, a landscape plan shall be prepared for approval by the Township
and shall be submitted with the preliminary plan for the subdivision.
The preparation of said plan shall follow the requirements in
Subsection G of § 154-12. [Amended 9-21-1998 by Ord. No. 376]
F. Maintenance. All efforts shall be made in the planting design to reduce
the maintenance needed for buffer plantings.
(1) Access for maintenance. The following criteria must be provided
for ease in maintenance:
(a) A break in a fence or a gate, either with a minimum width of
three feet, must be provided on each lot on which the owner
has installed a privacy or security fence, to allow access by the
lot owner for maintaining the landscaping within the buffer
area. Any gate must open inward, toward the lot, to allow for
equipment to access the buffer. Gates may be installed on a
property line to allow use by two properties; any required
cross-easements shall be provided.
A. If structure(s) is to remain.
(1) In residential zoning districts of the Township, the lot size and the
lot dimensions of the newly created lot containing the structure(s)
must be in scale with the height and bulk of the structure, even if
this requires a lot area and/or dimensions exceeding the minimum
zoning requirement for that district. Structures proposed on the
vacant portions of lands being subdivided shall conform to the
extent possible to the height, bulk, building material and
architectural character of the existing structures in the immediate
vicinity, and the subdivision plans shall show building plans at
suitable detail.
(2) In other zoning districts of the Township (especially commercial
and industrial districts), the subdivision of the land must provide
adequate service and parking facilities, etc., in keeping with the
minimum requirements of Chapter 182, Zoning, for each lot and
cumulatively for all lots in the subdivision. No subdivision will be
approved in such instances if the servicing and/or parking facilities,
etc., attendant to the existing structure are deemed inadequate or
would be considered to become inadequate with the development
of the now vacant lands. Any new structures contemplated on the
newly subdivided parcels shall be in conformity with the existing
structures in the immediate vicinity to the extent possible in
regards to height, bulk, building material and architectural
§ 154-24.1 UPPER PROVIDENCE CODE § 154-25
151:360
§ 154-26. Grading.92
character, and the subdivision plans shall show building plans at
suitable detail.
(3) Alterations and replacements will be permitted within the existing
structure, but exterior extensions of the building must conform to
the requirements of Chapter 182, Zoning.
B. If existing structure(s) is to be removed. Subdivision approval will be
issued "conditional" upon the expeditious removal of existing structures
in complete conformity with all other pertinent Township procedural
requirements. The subdivision plans shall furthermore show in detail
the proposed development of each parcel of ground and the proposed
development shall not provide less service and parking facilities, etc.,
than now exist. In commercial and industrial areas, plots of land that
have been cleared, as well as the existing vacant portions of such lands,
should be developed in conformity with the long-range needs of the
area to the extent possible, and all developmental requirements
embodied in this chapter and Chapter 182, Zoning, shall be adhered to.
If roadway realignments and other similar requirements are deemed
necessary in the immediate vicinity of the plot being subdivided, they
shall be corrected as part of the subdivision design to the utmost of the
subdivider's ability.
C. If existing structure is to be partly replaced or is to be added on to.
Demolition plans and/or construction plans must be detailed as part of
the subdivision plan review, and subsequent subdivision approval will
be conditional upon compliance with said proposed details. Additions to
existing structures shall be in harmony with existing structures in the
immediate vicinity, especially in respect to height, bulk, building
materials and architectural characteristics. In the case of the partial
demolition of existing structures, the remaining structure must be in
keeping with the existing buildings in the immediate vicinity in relation
to type, bulk, building materials and architectural characteristics.
Renovation work to the remaining portion of a structure following
partial demolition must be completed promptly and expeditiously.
A. Excavation and fill. No permanent excavation or fill shall be made with
a face steeper in slope than three horizontal to one vertical, except
under one or more of the following conditions: [Amended 9-20-1982
by Ord. No. 232]
(1) The material in which the excavation or fill is made is sufficiently
stable to sustain a slope of steeper than three horizontal to one
vertical, and a written statement of a civil engineer in erosion
control, to that effect, is submitted to the Township Engineer and
approved by him. The statement shall state that the site has been

inspected and that the deviation from the slope specified herein
before will not result in injury to persons or damage to property.
(2) A concrete or stone masonry wall constructed according to present
or future designs of the Township of Upper Providence is provided
to support the face of the excavation or fill.
B. Slopes and fences. The top or bottom edge of slopes shall be a minimum
of three feet from property or right-of-way lines of streets or alleys in
order to permit the normal rounding of the edge without encroaching
on the abutting property. All property lines where walls or slopes are
steeper than one horizontal to one vertical and five feet or more in
height shall be protected by a chain link fence four feet in height
approved by the Township. The fence shall be an integral part of the
wall.
C. Site grading plan. The Township Engineer shall require a grading plan
in conjunction with the plan of subdivision or land development in order
to ensure compliance with the above standards.
D. When the approved grades and finish contours are not consistent with
those shown on the construction drawings, they shall be corrected as
required by the Township. [Added 1-15-1990 by Ord. No. 296;
amended 7-7-1997 by Ord. No. 364]
A. General. All stormwater management design shall be in accordance
with this chapter, Chapter 150, Stormwater Management, latest
edition, and/or the Upper Providence Township Engineering and
Construction Standards and Improvements Procedures, latest edition,
whichever is more restrictive.
(1) Lots. All lots shall be graded to secure proper drainage away from
all buildings and to allow the collection of stormwater in water
detention basins or other approved locations. A minimum slope of
2% shall be used for directing water away from structures.
(2) Stormwater runoff. Stormwater runoff shall not be increased above
the predevelopment condition. This discharge shall also take into
consideration point discharge from the tract. Stormwater detention
must be provided unless waived by the Township Supervisors upon
recommendation by the Township Planning Commission and the
Township Engineer.
(3) Unnatural drainage. Whenever construction stops or concentrates
the natural flow of storm drainage in such a way as to affect
adjoining properties, approval of the adjacent property owners
should be obtained in writing and a copy filed with the Township.
§ 154-26 UPPER PROVIDENCE CODE § 154-27
151:362
Approval of plans by the Township does not authorize or sanction
drainage adversely affecting adjoining properties.
(4) Drainage from nonnatural sources. Water originating from other
than natural sources, such as air conditioners, sump pumps or
other dry weather sources, wherever practicable shall be
discharged into natural watercourses on the property. These types
of facilities shall not discharge water under the sidewalk and to the
curbline.
(5) Storm drainage system. The storm drainage system shall be
designed and constructed to adequately control the drainage on
and from the subdivision or land development. The use of pipes,
underdrains, inlets, headwalls, swales, natural drainage channels
or ditches and water detention basins shall be used for such
improvements. Such design and construction shall be approved by
the Township Engineer.
(6) Any development which creates a significant change in the
characteristics of the watershed, thus increasing the volume and
velocity of surface water runoff, shall not be permitted until
methods have been proposed which will reduce the likelihood of
erosion, sedimentation and stormwater drainage. Such
improvements must satisfy the requirements and regulations of the
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection.
B. Design submission.
(1) All plans showing the proposed storm sewer construction must be
accompanied by one set of storm drainage computations which
includes a drainage area map. The design shall be completed by a
registered engineer.
(2) When subdivisions or land developments are submitted to the
Township for approval in sections, a complete storm sewer design
for the proposed subdivision and land development shall be
submitted. The proposed design must include the entire tract and
not a portion.
(3) If only a section of a subdivision or land development is
contemplated for construction, the engineer shall show how he
proposes to handle stormwater from this section in order to
prevent damage to adjacent properties. If temporary construction
is required, the engineer shall include such structures in the plan
submitted.
(4) In the event that such temporary measures cannot ensure
protection to the adjacent properties, then the main outfall line of
the storm sewer shall be included as part of the construction for the
proposed section.

Construction Requirements and Detail Drawings for Wastewater
Facilities, as adopted by resolution and as may be amended from
time to time by resolution of the Upper Providence Township Board
of Supervisors. In areas not presently served by public sanitary
sewers, appropriate sewage disposal must be provided in
accordance with the regulations of the Department of
Environmental Protection (DEP), and in addition, the installation
and capping of sanitary sewer mains and house connections may be
required if studies by the governing body indicate that the
extension of public sanitary sewer trunks or laterals to serve the
property subdivided appears probable or necessary to protect the
public health. [Amended 11-7-1977 by Ord. No. 196; 6-2-2008
by Ord. No. 490]
(2) Consistency with plan.

the applicant must request a revision to the plan in accordance
with Act 537, the Pennsylvania Sewage Facilities Act.93
[Amended 6-2-2008 by Ord. No. 490]
(3) If outfall sewers are not available in the vicinity but are considered
reasonably necessary in the near future by the Township for the
area in question, a system of sewers, together with all necessary
laterals extending from mains to the street right-of-way line, shall
be installed at the expense of the subdivider or applicant. The
sewer lines shall be suitably capped at the limits of the subdivision
or land development and the laterals shall be capped at the rightof-
way line. The sewer installation shall include the construction

§ 154-28 UPPER PROVIDENCE CODE § 154-29
151:366
within rights-of-way or easements to bring the sewer to the future
connection with the Township sanitary sewer system.
(4) If sanitary sewers are not to be installed at the time of subdivision
and development, subdividers shall grant, reserve and set aside
easements in streets and roads for the installation and
maintenance of sewer lines at such time that the subdivision or
land development shall be a part of the Township sanitary sewer
system.
(5) A sewer shall be considered to be planned for extension to a given
area any time after preliminary engineering and related studies
have been completed and the construction of facilities adequate to
serve the area containing the subdivision has been programmed for
completion within a reasonable time.
(6) When capped sewers are provided, on-site disposal facilities shall
also be provided.
(7) All sanitary sewer lines shall have a minimum inside diameter of
eight inches. The sizing of pipe for a subdivision shall include
adequate capacity for all future upstream development located
within the subdivision's drainage basin. When required by the
Township Engineer, the developer shall also upgrade any existing
portion of the sanitary sewer which the Engineer determines to be
inadequate as a result of the proposed development. [Amended
1-15-1990 by Ord. No. 296; 6-2-2008 by Ord. No. 490 ]

watercourses. [Amended 6-26-1978 by Ord. No. 204; 1-15-1990 by
Ord. No. 296]
A. Those areas defined as floodplains by the Floodplain Conservation
District of Chapter 182, Zoning, shall be subject to the requirements
and restrictions contained in Chapter 182, Zoning, and the following
additional regulations which are intended to conform to the
requirements of Section 1910.3d of the National Flood Insurance
Program, P.L. 93-234. It is the purpose of these regulations to:
(1) Regulate the subdivision and development of flood-prone land
areas in order to promote the general health, welfare and safety of
the community.
(2) Require that each subdivision lot or development site in floodprone
areas be provided with a safe building site with adequate
access and that public facilities which serve such sites be designed
and installed to preclude flood damage at the time of initial
construction.
(3) Protect individuals from buying lands which are unsuitable for use
because of flood hazards by prohibiting the subdivision and
development of unprotected flood-prone areas.
(4) Maintain the certification of Upper Providence Township and the
eligibility of the property owners in Upper Providence Township for
the benefits of the National Flood Insurance Program, P.L. 93-234.
B. Preapplication procedures for subdivision and land development:
(1) Prospective developers shall consult the Montgomery County
Conservation District representative concerning erosion and
sediment control measures, the effect of geologic conditions on the
proposed subdivision and land development and the potential
impact of the proposed subdivision and land development on
geologic conditions.
(2) Prospective developers shall consult with the Zoning Officer and, if
necessary, the Township Planning Commission to make a
determination as to whether or not the proposed subdivision or
land development will be affected by an identified flood-prone area.
C. The following requirements shall apply for all subdivision and land
developments proposed in Upper Providence Township:
(1) Where the land is located partially or wholly within the floodplain,
the lowest floor elevation and the one-hundred-year-flood elevation
shall be indicated on all final subdivision and land development
plans. This information shall be maintained by the Township.
[Amended 12-2-1996 by Ord. No. 356]
§ 154-30 STREETS AND SIDEWALKS § 154-30
151:369
(2) The Board of Supervisors may, when it is deemed necessary for the
health, comfort, safety or welfare of the present and future
population of the area and necessary to the conservation of water,
drainage and sanitary facilities, prohibit the subdivision of any
portion of the property which lies within the floodplain of any
stream or drainage course.
(3) In an FA subdistrict of the floodplain, no subdivision or land
development shall be approved if the proposed development or
improvements will, individually or collectively, increase the base
flood elevation more than one foot at any point. [Amended
12-2-1996 by Ord. No. 356]
(4) If the Board of Supervisors determines that only a portion of a
proposed plan can be safety developed, it shall limit development
to that part and shall require that development proceed consistent
with this determination.
(5) When a developer does not intend to develop the plan himself and
the Board of Supervisors determines that additional controls are
required to ensure safe development, it may require the developer
to impose appropriate deed restrictions on the land. Such deed
restrictions shall be inserted in every deed and noted on the record
plan.
D. Where any excavation or grading is proposed or where any existing
trees, shrubs or other vegetative cover will be removed, the developer
shall consult the Montgomery County Conservation District
representative concerning plans for erosion and sediment control and a
report on the soil characteristics of the site in order to determine the
type and magnitude of development the site may safely accommodate.
Before undertaking any excavation or grading, the developer shall
conform to all pertinent laws, regulations and ordinances of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and Upper Providence Township.
E. The finished elevation of proposed streets shall be no more than one
foot below the established flood level or regulatory flood elevation
(where available). Drainage openings shall be sufficient to discharge
flood flows without unduly increasing flood heights. Pervious rather
than impervious materials shall be utilized in the development of any
street, driveway or parking area within a floodplain. The development
of such facilities shall be done according to accepted engineering and
technological practices and in compliance with all applicable provisions
contained in § 154-18 of this chapter. Plans for the development of such
facilities shall be submitted to the Township Engineer for his approval
prior to commencing development. [Amended 12-2-1996 by Ord. No.
356]
F. All sanitary sewer systems located in flood-prone areas, whether public
or private, shall be floodproofed up to a point and 1 1/2 feet above the
established flood level or regulatory flood elevation (where available).
§ 154-30 UPPER PROVIDENCE CODE § 154-30
151:370
(1) The Board of Supervisors may prohibit installation of sewage
disposal facilities requiring soil absorption systems where such
systems will not function due to high groundwater, flooding or
unsuitable soil characteristics. The Board of Supervisors may
require that the developer note on the plan and in any deed of
conveyance that on-site sewage disposal systems are prohibited in
designated flood-prone areas.
(2) The Board of Supervisors may prescribe adequate methods for
waste disposal. If a public sanitary sewer system is located within
or near the proposed subdivision or land development, the Board of
Supervisors shall require the developer to connect to this system,
where practical, and shall prescribe the procedures to be followed
by the developer in connecting to said system.
G. All water systems in flood-prone areas, whether public or private, shall
be floodproofed to a point 1 1/2 feet above the established flood level or
regulatory flood elevation (where available). If there is an existing
centralized water supply system within or near the subdivision or land
development, the Board of Supervisors shall require the developer to
connect to this system, where practical, and shall prescribe the
procedures to be followed by the developer in connecting to said
system.
H. All other public or private utilities and facilities shall be elevated or
floodproofed to a point 1 1/2 feet above the established flood level or
regulatory flood elevation (where available).
I. All continuously flowing natural watercourses shall be maintained in
their natural state, except that the removal of debris and the correction
of severe erosion shall be required.
J. Intermittent watercourses shall be maintained essentially at their
existing alignments and gradients, except that they may be improved by
minor regrading and shall either be planted in grass or provided with
erosion preventive improvements such as riprap. The paving of such
watercourses shall not be allowed, nor shall piping, except under roads,
driveways and walkways.
K. Intermittent watercourses often are significant elements at the
headwaters of larger streams and are usually small in size. Therefore,
developers should be encouraged to design and build around and with
respect for these drainageways, and the Board of Supervisors may
allow rerouting of these drainageways only when serious
considerations so warrant or when the site drainage will be improved
by such proposed alignment changes.
L. Where a subdivision or land development lies partially or completely in
a flood-prone area or where the subdivision or land development
borders on a flood-prone area, the plan shall include detailed
information identifying the following:

supplies and sanitary facilities, building sites, structures, soil types
and proposed floodproofing measures.
(2) Boundaries of the floodplain area and the base flood elevation as
defined in the Floodplain Conservation District of Chapter 182,
Zoning.
M. Waivers. Guidelines for relaxation from the requirements set forth in
this section are as follows:
(1) A waiver shall not be issued within any designated regulatory
floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood
discharge would result.
(2) A waiver shall only be issued if there is:
(a) A showing of good and sufficient cause.
(b) A determination that failure to relax the requirements would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant.
(c) A determination that the relaxing of a requirement will not
result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public
safety, extraordinary public expense or create nuisances, cause
fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing
local laws or ordinances.
(3) A waiver shall only be issued upon a determination that the waiver
is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
(4) The Township shall:
(a) Maintain a record of all waivers, including justification for
their issuance.
(b) Report such decisions issued in its annual report submitted to
the Federal Insurance Administrator.
A. Whenever a centralized water supply system is provided for a
development, the subdivider shall supply a system capable of producing
adequate and sufficient water pressure to supply domestic water needs
and meet fire emergency demand to each lot in a subdivision,
multifamily complex or commercial or industrial development. The
minimum standard for meeting fire emergency demand shall be as set
forth and required and published by the Insurance Services Office of
Pennsylvania.
§ 154-30 UPPER PROVIDENCE CODE § 154-31
151:372
B. Where no centralized water service is available and it would be an
undue hardship for the subdivider to install such a system, the
subdivider may, upon approval of the Board of Supervisors, be
permitted to construct a well on each lot for residential and commercial
development, but no closer than 2,000 feet between wells for industrial
development. (This standard may be waived if the Township Engineer
approves the well spacing plan of the applicant.) All nonsystem wells
shall be constructed according to present rules and regulations or any
future amendments thereto of the Department of Environmental
Protection and the Township, except that nonsystem wells located in
proximity to centralized water facilities shall be required to be
constructed to the specifications of the centralized water system in

Protection and the Township of Upper Providence shall be shown
around each well to denote clear space in which no on-site sewage
system is to be located. [Amended 6-2-2008 by Ord. No. 490]
D. Where centralized water service is furnished, the circles are not
necessary, with the exceptions of those well(s) lying immediately
adjacent to the subdivision. However, the usable area is limited by a
clear zone surrounding the water service line to each house as required
by the Department of Environmental Protection and the Township of
Upper Providence. [Amended 6-2-2008 by Ord. No. 490]
E. Fire hydrants and water mains. Fire hydrants supplied by an eight-inch
or larger main shall be provided in all new subdivisions when public
water is available and in all new townhouses, apartment and other
residential uses, educational institutions, commercial and industrial
developments and other areas, at the direction of the Fire Marshal who
shall consult with the entity supplying the water and an approved rating
bureau before directing such installations. When new streets are
accepted by the Township, all fire hydrants on such streets shall
become public, and thereafter rental charges for the same shall be
borne by the Township.

A. General.
(1) For qualifying tracts, no changes shall be made in the contour of
the land; no grading, excavating, removal or destruction of the
topsoil, trees or other vegetative cover of the land shall be
commenced until such time that a plan for minimizing erosion and
sedimentation has been processed with the Commission or there
has been a determination by the Commission that such plan is not
necessary.
(2) No subdivision or land development plan shall be approved unless:
(a) There has been a plan approved by the Board of Supervisors
that provides for minimizing erosion and sedimentation
consistent with this section and an improvement bond or other
acceptable security is deposited with the Township in the form
of an escrow guaranty which will insure the installation and
completion of the required improvements; or
(b) There has been a determination by the Board of Supervisors
that a plan for minimizing erosion and sedimentation is not
necessary.
(3) The Board of Supervisors in its consideration of any preliminary
plan of subdivision and land development shall condition its
approval upon the execution of measures designed to prevent
accelerated soil erosion and resulting sedimentation, as required
by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection. All
applicable regulations and permit requirements of said
Department, as stipulated in its Soil Erosion and Sedimentation
Control Manual, shall be followed by all parties engaged in
earthmoving activities. The manual is available at the office of the
Montgomery County Conservation District. [Amended 6-2-2008
by Ord. No. 490]
B. Performance principles. The following measures are effective in
minimizing erosion and sedimentation and shall be included, where
applicable, in the control plan:
(1) The stripping of vegetation, regrading or other development shall
be done in such a way that will minimize erosion.
§ 154-31 STREETS AND SIDEWALKS § 154-32
151:375
(2) Development plans shall preserve salient natural features, keep
cut-fill operations to a minimum and ensure conformity with the
topography so as to create the least erosion potential and
adequately handle the volume and velocity of surface water runoff.
(3) Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected
and supplemented.
(4) The disturbed area and the duration of exposure shall be kept to a
practical minimum.
(5) Disturbed soils shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable.
(6) Temporary vegetation and/or mulching shall be used to protect
exposed critical areas during development.
(7) The permanent (final) vegetation and structural erosion control and
drainage measures shall be installed as soon as practical in the
development.
(8) Provisions shall be made to effectively accommodate the increased
runoff caused by changed soil and surface conditions during and
after development. Where necessary, the rate of surface water
runoff will be structurally retarded.
(9) Sediment in the runoff water shall be trapped until the disturbed
area is stabilized by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt
traps or similar measures.
C. Grading for drainage. In order to provide more suitable sites for
building and other uses, improve surface drainage and control erosion,
the following requirements shall be met:
(1) All lots, tracts or parcels shall be graded to provide proper
drainage away from buildings and dispose of it without ponding,
and all land within a development shall be graded to drain and
dispose of surface water without ponding, except where approved
by the Board.
(2) All drainage provisions shall be of such design to adequately handle
the surface runoff and carry it to the nearest suitable outlet such as
a curbed street, storm drain, natural watercourse or properly
designed swale. Where drainage swales are used to divert surface
waters away from buildings, they shall be sodded or planted as
required and shall be of such slope, shape and size as to conform to
the requirements of the Township.
(3) Concentrations of surface water runoff shall only be permitted in
properly designed and maintained swales, watercourses or
detention basins.
(4) Excavation and fills.
§ 154-32 UPPER PROVIDENCE CODE § 154-32
151:376
(a) Cut and fill slopes shall not be steeper than a 3:1 slope unless
compliance is made with § 154-26, Grading. [Amended
9-20-1982 by Ord. No. 232]
(b) Adequate provisions shall be made to prevent surface water
from damaging the cut face of excavations of the sloping
surfaces of fills.
(c) Cut and fills shall not endanger enjoining property.
(d) No increased surface runoff will be permitted to leave the
property being subdivided or developed by way of natural
watercourses or storm drainage pipes without first being
suitably retained in such a way as to maintain runoff volume
existing on the site previous to subdivision or development.
(e) Fill shall be placed and compacted so as to minimize sliding or
erosion of the soil.
(f) Fills shall not encroach on natural watercourses or constructed
channels.
(g) Fills placed adjacent to natural watercourses or constructed
channels shall have suitable protection against erosion during
periods of flooding.
(h) Grading will not be done in such a way so as to divert water
onto the property of another landowner without the expressed
consent of the Board.
(i) During grading operations, necessary measures for dust
control will be exercised.
(j) Grading equipment will not be allowed to cross live streams.
Provisions will be made for the installation of culverts or
bridges.
D. Responsibility.
(1) Whenever sedimentation is caused by stripping vegetation,
regrading or other development, it shall be the responsibility of the
person, corporation or other entity causing such sedimentation to
remove it from all adjoining surfaces, drainage systems and
watercourses and to repair any damage at his expense as quickly as
possible.
(2) The maintenance of all drainage facilities and watercourses within
any subdivision or land development is the responsibility of the
developer until they are accepted by the Township or some other
official agency, after which they become the responsibility of the
accepting agency.
§ 154-32 STREETS AND SIDEWALKS § 154-32
151:377
(3) It is the responsibility of any person, corporation or other entity
doing any act on or across a communal stream, watercourse or
swale or upon the floodplain or right-of-way thereof to maintain, as
nearly as possible in its present state, the stream, watercourse,
swale, floodplain or right-of-way during the pendency of the activity
and to return it to its original or equal condition after such activity
is completed.
(4) The maintenance of drainage facilities or watercourses originating
and completely on private property is the responsibility of the
owner to their point of open discharge at the property line or at a
communal watercourse within the property.
(5) No person, corporation or other entity shall block, impede the flow
of, alter, construct any structure on or deposit any material or thing
on or commit any act which will affect normal or flood flow in any
communal stream or watercourse without having obtained prior
approval from the Township or the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection, whichever is applicable. [Amended
6-2-2008 by Ord. No. 490]
(6) Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, there shall be
provided a drainage easement or right-of-way conforming
substantially with the line of such watercourse and of such width as
will be adequate to preserve natural drainage.
(7) Each person, corporation or other entity which makes any surface
changes shall be required to:
(a) Collect on-site surface runoff and dispose of it to the point of
discharge into the common natural watercourse of the
drainage area.
(b) Handle existing and potential off-site runoff through his
development by designing to adequately handle storm runoff
from a fully developed area upstream.
(c) Pay his proportionate share of the total cost of off-site
improvements to the common natural watercourse, based on a
fully developed drainage area.
(d) Provide and install at his expense, in accordance with
Township requirements, all drainage and erosion control
improvements, temporary and permanent, as required by the
Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook.
E. Compliance with regulations and procedures. [Amended 1-15-1990
by Ord. No. 296]
(1) The Board of Supervisors in its consideration of all preliminary

(2) The installation and design of the required erosion and sediment
control measures shall be in accordance with the standards and
specifications on file with the Township Engineer.
(3) Final plans for minimizing erosion and sedimentation as approved
will be incorporated into the agreement and bond requirements as
required under Article V of this chapter.
(4) The approval of plans and specifications for the control of erosion
and sedimentation shall be concurrent with the approval of the
final plats of subdivision or land development and become a part
thereof.
(5) At the time that a building permit is applied for, a review shall be
conducted by the Township Engineer to ensure conformance with
the plan as approved. During the construction further consultative
technical assistance will be furnished, if necessary, by the Township
Engineer and the Montgomery County Soil and Water Conservation
District. During this development phase, the Township Engineer
shall inspect the development site and enforce compliance with the
approved plans.
(6) Permission for clearing and grading prior to recording of plats may
be obtained under temporary easements or other conditions
satisfactory to the Township.
(7) In the event that the developer proceeds to clear and grade prior to
recording plats, without satisfying conditions specified under
Subsection E(5), the Board may revoke the approval of the
preliminary plan.
A. Bridges and culverts shall be designed to meet current Pennsylvania
Department of Transportation Standards to support expected loads and
to carry expected flows. They shall be constructed to the full width of
the right-of-way.
B. An approval or waiver of permit requirements shall be obtained from
the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection for all
bridges and culverts placed in existing or relocated streams, regardless
of the drainage area. [Amended 1-15-1990 by Ord. No. 296;
6-2-2008 by Ord. No. 490]
C. Where county-owned roads or bridges are involved, the County
Department of Roads and Bridges must review and approve all
proposals.

151:379
§ 154-35. Natural or historic feature preservation.
A. Survey markers.
(1) Survey monuments shall be placed on the right-of-way lines at
corners, angle points, the beginning and ends of curves, at all
corners and changes in directions of the boundary of the tract
under development and at other points as required by the
Township. All monuments, existing and proposed, shall be shown
on the record plans. The monuments shall be placed after all
roadway improvements have been completed.
(2) One of the following types of permanent reference monuments
shall be installed by the developer or property owner at all
locations mentioned above:
(a) A concrete monument with minimum dimensions of 20 inches
by four inches square, with forty-five-degree beveled edges.
(b) Solid steel pins with minimum dimensions of 3/4 inch in
diameter and 24 inches in length.
B. Bench marks. The Township elevations are based on the Township
sanitary sewer system datum. The location and elevation is available to
all engineers and surveyors upon request to the Engineer's office. All
contours and elevations shown on plans must be based on this system.
C. Staking requirements. All lots shall be staked by the registered
engineer or surveyor for the subdivider when final grading has been
completed. This stakeout shall be visible and completed before an
owner or occupant moves into the property. All lot corner markers shall
be permanently located and shall be at least a three-fourths-inch metal
pin with a minimum length of 24 inches, located in the ground to
existing grade.
A. Limit of contract. Where the applicant is offering for dedication or is
required by ordinance to establish a reservation of open space or
preserve an area of scenic or historic importance, a limit of contract,
which will confine excavation, earthmoving procedures and other
changes to the landscape, may be required to ensure the preservation
and prevent destruction of the character of the area in open space.
B. Tree preservation. All trees six inches or more in caliper at breast
height should not be removed unless within the proposed right-of-way
line of a street or impracticable for development. The relocation of
noteworthy plant material should be encouraged where retention is
impracticable.
C. Topsoil preservation. No topsoil shall be removed from the site or used
as spoil. Topsoil must be removed from the areas of construction and
stored separately. Upon completion of the construction, the topsoil
must be redistributed on the site uniformly. All areas of the site shall be

151:380
§ 154-35.1. Preservation of, protection of and transplanting of
existing vegetation. [Added 9-21-1998 by Ord. No. 376]
stabilized by seeding or planting on slopes of less than 10% or more and
planted in ground cover on slopes of 20%, provided that riprap shall be
utilized for banks exceeding 25%.
D. Preserved landscaping. When there is a conscientious effort to preserve
the existing natural integrity and character of a site and where such
preservation includes areas of two woodland and trees comparable to
required planting improvements, i.e., landscaping and buffer screening,
the plan may be received in lieu of additional landscaping
requirements.
A. Preservation of existing vegetation. Each mature tree, tree mass or
woodland on the site shall be designated "TO REMAIN" or "TO BE
REMOVED" in accordance with the following criteria:
(1) All subdivisions and land developments shall be laid out in such a
manner as to minimize the removal of healthy trees and shrubs on
the site. Special consideration shall be given to specimen trees, as
well as those discussed in § 154-35B.
(2) It shall be incumbent on the applicant to prove that vegetation
removal is minimized. If challenged by the Township, the applicant
shall produce evidence, such as written documents or plans
certified by a registered landscape architect or other qualified
professional, showing that no alternative layouts are possible and
that no alternative clearing or grading plan would reduce the loss
of mature trees, tree masses and woodlands.
(3) A mature tree, tree mass or woodland shall be considered "TO
REMAIN" only if it meets all of the following criteria:
(a) The outermost branches of the tree(s) are at least five feet from
any proposed buildings, structures, paving, parking or utilities
(overhead or underground).
(b) The outermost branches of the tree(s) are at least five feet from
any proposed changes in grade or drainage, such as
excavations, mounding or impoundments.
(c) The tree(s) are clear of any proposed sight triangles and do
not, by their location or apparent health, pose any undue
threat to the health, safety and welfare of the community.
(4) Mature trees, tree masses or woodlands that do not fit the above
criteria shall be designated "TO BE REMOVED." These trees will be
removed in the field during the construction process.
B. Protection of existing vegetation. Existing vegetation designated "TO
REMAIN," in accordance with § 154-35.1A(2), as part of the of the
§ 154-35 STREETS AND SIDEWALKS § 154-35.1
151:381
§ 154-36. Planting. [Amended 9-21-1998 by Ord. No. 376]
landscaping of a subdivision or land development shall be identified
in the field prior to any clearing and shall be physically protected
throughout the construction process. A temporary physical barrier,
such as a snow fence, shall be erected a minimum of one foot outside
the dripline on all sides of individual trees, tree masses or woodlands
prior to major clearing or construction. The barrier shall be placed to
prevent disturbance to or compaction of soil inside the barrier and shall
remain until construction is complete. The barrier shall be shown on
the landscape plan.
C. Hydrology. Alteration of existing drainage patterns and water supply for
the protected vegetation shall be minimized.
D. Transplanting existing plant material. Specimen trees or individual
trees from woodlands or tree masses designated "TO BE REMOVED"
are encouraged to be transplanted from one area of the site to another.
Transplanted trees must conform to all applicable requirements of
§ 154-36 of this chapter.
A. Lot siting, planting and beautification for subdivisions and land
developments. In order to promote the highest environmental quality
possible, the success to which the applicant of a subdivision or land
development plan has preserved existing salient natural features and
land forms intrinsic to the site shall be assessed. Terms of approval of a
plat may be subject to the manner in which the layout or design or the
plan has preserved existing natural features.
B. Landscaping. For all apartment, commercial and industrial districts, the
developer should incorporate sufficient planting into his design so as to
gain approval of the Township Planning Commission. It should be of a
type recommended by the Planning Commission, including open
spaces, planting strips, screening, formal gardens, shade trees, natural
barriers or other types of acceptable growth. The following standards
shall apply to all landscaping, including landscaping in buffers, general
required landscaping or shade tree installations, as applicable:
(1) The location, dimensions and spacing of required plantings should
be adequate for their proper growth and maintenance, taking into
account the size of such plantings at maturity and their present and
future environmental requirements, such as wind, soil, moisture
and sunlight.
(2) Plantings should be selected and located where they will not
contribute to conditions hazardous to public safety. Such locations
include, but are not limited to, public street rights-of-way,
underground and aboveground utilities and sight triangle areas
required for unobstructed views at street intersections.

feet in height at planting.
(6) All deciduous shade trees shall have a minimum of 2 1/2 inch
caliper at planting.
(7) Provisions shall be made for a replacement guaranty of at least 18
months for all plant material. If material fails to survive during this
period, replacement shall be made at the beginning of the first
successive planting season. All replacements shall have a guaranty
equal to that stated above. A performance bond is required in
accordance with § 154-41, Required improvements.
C. Shade (street) trees.
(1) Shade trees shall be required:
(a) Along all existing streets when they abut or lie with the
proposed subdivision or land development.
(b) Along (both sides of) all proposed streets.
(c) Along access driveways that serve five or more residential
dwelling units.
(d) Along access driveways that serve two or more nonresidential
properties.
(e) Along major walkways through parking lots and between
nonresidential buildings, as recommended by the Planning
Commission.
(2) The shade tree requirement may be waived by the Board of
Supervisors where existing vegetation is considered sufficient to
maintain scenic views of open space, farmland, natural features or
other valued features.
(3) Shade trees shall be located between the ultimate right-of-way line
and the building setback line and shall meet the following
standards:
(a) Trees shall be planted a minimum distance of five feet and a
maximum distance of 15 feet outside the ultimate right-of-way
line. However, in certain cases, as follows, the Board of
Supervisors may permit trees to be planted within the ultimate
right-of-way:
§ 154-36 STREETS AND SIDEWALKS § 154-36
151:383
[1] In areas, such as existing villages, where front yards may
be located within the ultimate right-of-way.
[2] In cases where closely spaced rows of shade trees may be
desirable and future street widening is considered
unlikely.
(b) In nonresidential developments, trees shall be located within a
planting bed within the front yard setback, at least 10 feet in
width, planted in grass, shrubs or ground cover.
(c) Trees shall be planted so as not to interfere with the
installation and maintenance of sidewalks and utilities. Trees
shall be planted a minimum distance of five feet from curbs and
sidewalks, 15 feet from overhead utilities and 10 feet from
underground utilities.
(d) Trees shall be planted at a ratio of at least one tree per 50
linear feet of frontage or fraction thereof. Trees shall be
distributed along the entire frontage of the property, although
they need not be evenly spaced.
(e) Shade trees shall be comprised predominantly of species
native to the area.
(f) No more than 10 shade trees of the same species shall be
planted in a group unless a specialized design concept is
desired. Alternating species within a group shall be avoided.
(4) Recommended shade trees are contained in § 154-36.1 herein.
D. Buffer planting requirements. The land surrounding any permitted use
shall be landscaped, except for paved areas and necessary parking and
service areas, and each apartment house, group apartment
development or nonresidential use shall make such other suitable
screening provisions as are necessary to safeguard the character of an
adjacent area. A buffer area shall be lawns or trees, except for
necessary accessways. Such buffer shall include a suitable and
uninterrupted coniferous planting screen of sufficient height and
density to give maximum protection and immediate screening to the
abutting district. Such screening shall be permanently maintained and
replaced where necessary to present an attractive appearance. Buffer
planting requirements shall be applicable to parking lot facilities, along
the areas fronting major or secondary roads and along the areas
adjacent to other properties. The following requirements shall apply to
all buffers which are required to be installed pursuant to the
requirements of this article.
(1) All buffers are to be landscaped. Unless specifically noted herein,
landscape buffers may also consist of earthen berms, fences and
masonry walls. To prevent a linear wall appearance, no segment of
§ 154-36 UPPER PROVIDENCE CODE § 154-36
151:384
a berm, fence or masonry wall shall exceed 50 feet without a break
or offset.
(2) Earthen berms shall vary in height, length and width, but shall not
exceed a 3:1 slope or a four-foot height. Berms shall be laid out in a
curvilinear manner whenever space allows.
(3) Every buffer shall include some plants from each of the following
categories: evergreen trees, deciduous trees, flowering ornamental
trees, deciduous and evergreen shrubs, and ground cover.
(4) All shade and ornamental trees installed in a buffer shall be planted
with an understory of shrubs.
(5) Buffering specifications. The following specifications shall be
considered minimum in all cases. Specifications are arranged by
buffer type. Specifications for a specific buffer type shall be utilized
for each situation in which that buffer type is required under the
provisions of this article. Existing vegetation should be integrated
into the design of buffers wherever feasible.
(a) Buffer Type 1: A buffer shall be provided equal to a width no
less than the setback width, at least half of which shall be
planted. The buffer may be located anywhere within the
setback area and may incorporate foundation plantings into a
cohesive landscape design. The buffer shall consist of a
minimum of 20% evergreen material and 80% deciduous
material. Required shade trees may be incorporated into this
area.
(b) Buffer Type 1A: In addition to Buffer Type 1 specifications,

§ 154-36.1. Recommended planting lists. [Added 9-21-1998 by Ord.
No. 376; amended 8-1-2011 by Ord. No. 517]
Planting recommendations are included within the Upper Providence
Engineering and Construction Standards and Improvement Procedures, on
file in the Township offices. Applicants are encouraged to consult with
Upper Providence Township's landscape architectural consultant for any
species installations.
§ 154-36.2. Design standards for developments in the Interchange
Office, Retail, Service, and Recreation (IO-3) District. [Added
8-7-2006 by Ord. No. 462; amended 10-1-2007 by Ord. No. 476]
The design of buildings and adjacent landscaping shall be governed by the
following criteria:
(5) Stormwater management facility slopes shall be seeded in
PennDOT Formula "L" modified seed mix or an appropriate
naturalized seed mix approved by the Township.
(6) There shall be a minimum of one shade tree and two shrubs for

tree planting shall be placed on the fill area of a berm.
G. Maintenance.
(1) Required plant material shall be maintained for the life of the
project to achieve the required visual effect to the buffer or screen.
It shall be the ultimate responsibility of successive property owners
to insure that the required plantings are properly maintained. Dead
or diseased plant material shall be removed or treated promptly by
the property owner and replaced at the next growing season.
(2) All sight triangles shall remain clear, and any plant material that
could endanger safety such as unstable limbs, shall be removed and
the plant material replaced if necessary. It shall be the
responsibility of the property owner to maintain all plantings and
architectural elements to ensure a safe environment.
(3) Maintenance guidelines for the plantings are encouraged to be
published by the planting plan designer, to be used by grounds
maintenance personnel to ensure that the design's buffering and
screening concepts are continued.
A. The project shall be planned and constructed as a unified development,
with compatible architectural design for all components, including any
structured parking. Buildings should be sited in a manner compatible
with adjacent buildings, landscaping and the streetscape.
Consideration should be given to size and height relationships with
adjacent buildings. All buildings within the development shall be
§ 154-36 STREETS AND SIDEWALKS § 154-36.2
151:387
similarly treated on all sides, with the exception of any side that is
hidden or otherwise not within view of customers.
B. Architectural style of the development shall be designed to avoid the
massive scale and uniform impersonal appearances of a "big box"
commercial center through facade ornamentation, building offsets,
window treatments, variation in rooflines, entry treatments and
upgraded building materials. The focus should be on varying the spaces
among groups of buildings to avoid creating a walled corridor of long
unbroken rows of buildings along a setback or a monotonous pattern of
buildings across a site. Facades should be divided into increments
through the use of architectural features such as bay windows, offsets,
recesses and other devices that break or minimize scale. Strong vertical
and horizontal reveals, offsets and three-dimensional details between
surface planes should be incorporated into building design to create
shadow lines and to further break up flat surfaces.
(1) In addition to facade ornamentation, proposed buildings along the
primary drive or main thoroughfare that function as street walls
shall include facades that appear to be two stories in height and
have architectural features that complement those of the ground
floor. Corner buildings help to anchor blocks and street
intersections and should be given more prominence. Sixty percent
of the street wall shall be two stories in height or appear to be two
stories in height, and all buildings proposed on corner locations
shall be or appear to be two stories. When a corner location does
not contain a building, a compatible architectural feature shall be
provided at the corner and be of a height similar to a two-story
facade.
C. Building facades greater than 100 feet in length, including separate
buildings that are attached, shall incorporate one or more architectural
features over at least 20% of the length of the facade. There shall be no
uninterrupted length of facade that exceeds 100 feet.
D. Smaller retail stores with individual entrances can help to break up a
long facade. Retail stores or restaurants of less than 25,000 square feet
shall have glass facades between the height of three and eight feet for
no less than 60% of the horizontal length of the building facade.
E. The ground floor of buildings should provide pedestrian interest and
activity. Each building facade, including separate buildings which are
attached, exceeding 100 feet in length shall have clearly defined, highly
visible customer entrances that include at least two of the following:
(1) Weather protection features and entrance details such as awnings,
canopies or porticos; overhangs; recesses/projections; arcades;
raised cornice parapets over the door; peaked roof forms; and/or
arches;
(2) Outdoor patios;
§ 154-36.2 UPPER PROVIDENCE CODE § 154-36.2
151:388
(3) Architectural details such as file work and moldings which are
integrated into the building structure and design;
(4) Integral planters or wing walls than incorporate landscaped areas
and/or places for sitting.
F. The use of arcades, colonnades or awnings to provide pedestrian
protection is encouraged. Weather protection features should extend
out from the building and provide cover within 30 feet of all customer
entrances and to extend at least three feet wider than the entrance.
G. Variations in rooflines shall be used to screen HVAC equipment, to
provide interest, and to reduce the scale of large buildings. Roofs
should provide a variety of vertical dimensions. Multiplaned and
intersecting rooflines are encouraged. Flat-roofed designs are
discouraged. However, if utilized, flat roofs shall include architecture
details such as cornices, decorative facings and arches to provide
interest to the roofline. Additionally, all roof types should have at least
one of the following features:
(1) Overhanging eaves of at least three feet;
(2) Sloping roofs with an average slope of between 3:1 and 1:1 that do
not exceed the average height of the supporting walls;
(3) Three or more roof slope planes.
H. All ground-mounted exposed HVAC units or other utility equipment
shall be screened from customer views. This shall be accomplished
through the use of masonry walls and landscaping; see § 154-36.2Q(6)
in this chapter for masonry wall requirements.
I. Exterior building materials and colors contribute significantly to the
visual impact of a building. The exterior building skin shall be
composed of one dominant facing material and not more than two
additional materials. The dominant material shall comprise sixty
percent (60%) or greater of each building elevation, with the exception
of any side that is hidden or otherwise not within view of customers.
(1) Dominant exterior materials may include:
(a) Wood.
(b) Brick.
(c) Stone, or stone veneer (cultured stone or equivalent).
(d) Concrete masonry unit (CMU). CMU allowed only as split-face
block or block molded with a textured surface.

style of the building. Detailed elevations with facade treatment
examples, complete with color choices, shall be submitted to the
Township for approval. High-intensity colors, metallic colors and black
are prohibited.
K. Trim and accent colors should be complementary to the facade
treatment and are subject to approval by the Township. Colors, utilized
specifically in the branding or identity of an establishment, such as
logos or emblems, will be given special consideration by the Township.
L. Pedestrian use of the development shall by encouraged by:
(1) Reducing walkway distances and providing short cuts.
(2) Providing protection from wind and rain especially at main building
entrances and over public walkways.
(3) Increasing the character and visual diversity of walkways by
varying the paving material. However, the type and change in
materials should be an obvious designed feature and complement
the architecture immediately adjacent to the walkway. Acceptable
sidewalk treatments can be any of the following:
(a) Concrete, with smooth trowel edging and broom finish;
(b) Stamped concrete;
(c) Unit/brick pavers;
(d) Bluestone, flagstone, cobblestone;
(e) Asphalt, only for fitness trails or trails located in open space.
(4) Providing pedestrian amenities such as benches, planters, plazas,
drinking fountains and water features.
(5) Providing sufficient walkway widths to allow for easy flow of

convenience and safety of the patrons of the development. All lighting
shall comply with the standards of § 154-140 of this chapter.
O. A gateway feature is required to define the main entry point(s) of a
development. Materials used in the construction of the gateway feature
shall be of a type that is consistent with the overall appearance of the
development. Landscaping shall be designed in conjunction with the
gateway feature, but in no case shall the landscaping or the gateway
feature impact on required sight distances. It is the intent of the
gateway feature to create a unique identity or branding for the
development at the points of highest traffic and visibility. All gateway
features shall be approved by the Board of Supervisors. Examples of
gateway features include, but are not limited to:
(1) Monument signs.
(2) Wing walls.

§ 154-40.1 STREETS AND SIDEWALKS § 154-40.2
151:401
§ 154-40.3. Physical criteria for open space lands.
The following criteria shall be used in determining if proposed open space
or recreation spaces incorporated in a land development proposal are
acceptable as lands to be set aside.
Zoning, subsequent to the enactment of this article. These regulations
shall apply to any land so provided, including any that may exceed the
minimum requirements of said districts.
B. For nonresidential zoning districts, including Chapter 182, Zoning,
Article XI, in Institutional District, these regulations shall apply to any
and all open space and/or recreation areas set aside through the land
development process. All land developments shall be required to set
aside 1,300 square feet of open space or recreation facilities for each
2,000 square feet of new or additional gross floor area of construction.
C. For any open space requirements contained within this section that may
conflict with requirements with other Township regulations and
requirements, the largest open space area or recreation requirement
required to be provided shall apply.
A. An open space area(s) shall be developed to complement and enhance
the man-made environment. In the selection of the location of such
areas, consideration shall be given to the preservation of natural and
man-made features which will enhance the attractiveness and value of
the remainder of the property to be subdivided or developed. Such
features are floodplains, including streams and ponds; wetlands; slopes
equal to or greater than 15%; mature, permanent vegetation; an
exceptional view; cultural and historical amenities; and other
community assets as determined by the Board of Supervisors.
B. Said area(s) shall be at a location conveniently accessible to the
residents or employees to be served.
C. Said area(s) shall be located and designed so that it does not become a
barrier to the handicapped, aged or people with baby strollers.
D. Said area(s) specifically designated for open space shall be fully usable
and suitable for that purpose and shall have all improvements required
by this chapter.
E. The size and shape of said areas shall be such as to be usable for
passive and/or active recreation.
F. Said area(s) shall comprise a single parcel of land, except where the
Board of Supervisors concurs that the creation of two or more parcels
would be in the public interest and determines that, where feasible, a
connecting path or strip of land is in the public interest.
G. Safe and easy access to said open space area(s) shall be provided either
by adjoining public road frontage, public easements or paths and/or
§ 154-40.2 UPPER PROVIDENCE CODE § 154-40.3
151:402
sidewalks. At the discretion of the Board of Supervisors, an open space
area(s) may be permitted to cross a public road if specific
circumstances related to the location of natural features, site layout
and/or intended use of the open space so dictate. The Parks and
Recreation Committee and Planning Commission shall make specific
recommendations to the Board concerning any proposed road crossing
in their review pursuant to § 154-40.4D herein.
H. Said area(s) shall be easily accessible to essential utilities such as
water, sewage and electric power, to the greatest extent practical.
I. Said area(s) shall be free of fuel, electric power and other transmission
lines, whether underground or overhead, except where these may
provide opportunities for trails and/or connections to other open space
lands.
J. Said area(s) shall be free of all structures, except those related to
outdoor recreational use. Should any existing structure(s) be located in
an area(s) proposed for open space, the applicant shall demonstrate
how said structure(s) will be used in connection with their plans for
recreational activities for the site, as required in § 154-40.4D herein.
K. Steep slopes, streams, lakes, watercourses, ponds, wetlands and
floodplains may comprise no more than 40% of the open space land
requirement. In all instances, a minimum of 60% of the open space land
requirement shall be suitable for dry ground recreational use. Fifty
percent of the dry ground recreational use area shall not exceed 2%
finished grade; the Board of Supervisors may agree to waive this
requirement in cases of exceptional topography, watercourses and tree
coverage.
L. The location, form, overall design and use of the required open space
area(s) shall be as approved by the Board of Supervisors.
(1) At the discretion of the Board of Supervisors, a portion(s) of the
open space may be permitted on abutting land which has a
different zoning classification than the development which it
serves, if it forms an integral part of the open space for the
development or for the Township's overall open space network.
M. Areas defined as open space or recreation sites shall not include areas
less than 45 feet in width or land area within 10 feet of any building,
community facility, or other accessory use.
N. Areas defined as open space or recreation sites shall have a minimum of
25 feet of street frontage.
O. Areas defined as open space or recreation sites shall not contain
stormwater management facilities, unless those facilities are directly

§ 154-40.3 STREETS AND SIDEWALKS § 154-40.3
151:403
§ 154-40.4. Improvement requirements for open space lands.
P. The areas set aside for open space or recreation shall be reasonably
accessible to the residents or employees, as applicable.
A. When the Board of Supervisors approves open space area(s) bisected
by a public road pursuant to the provisions of § 154-40.3G herein,
grade-separated pedestrian walkways (bridges or tunnels) shall be
required whenever the roadway being crossed is of greater than feeder
classification.
B. At least one accessway shall be provided to each open space area which
shall be sufficiently wide so that maintenance equipment shall have
reasonably convenient access to said area. In all instances, said open
space area(s) shall be maintained in a careful and prudent manner.
C. When an open space area is intended to serve residents of a large
number of dwelling units or lots, more than one pedestrian access to
said area shall be provided. The exact number and locations of said
accesses shall be based upon the design of the development and the
location of any recreational facilities proposed within the open space
area. The Board of Supervisors shall require additional pedestrian
accesses or the relocation of an accessway(s) when it believes that
adequate access is not being provided for the majority of the
development's residents. Pedestrian access may share any accessway
provided for maintenance vehicles pursuant to Subsection B of this
section.
D. Recreational facilities shall be provided in the open space area(s) to
service the needs of the residents of the development for which the
area(s) is being set aside. Facilities to be provided may include, but not
be limited to, the following: tot lots; playgrounds; tennis courts;
basketball courts; and multipurpose fields. The precise number and
extent of facilities proposed shall be based upon information supplied
by the developer, including projected number, age breakdown, income
and other applicable characteristics of the development's residents;
and the number and types of recreational facilities nearby and available
to the proposed development. Based upon said analysis, the applicant
shall propose a plan for the facilities proposed to be reviewed by the
Parks and Recreation Committee and Planning Commission. These
bodies shall then make a recommendation to the Board of Supervisors,
who shall make the final determination as to the facilities to be
installed.
E. Sufficient parking shall be provided for the recreational facilities to be
installed.
(1) The exact number of spaces shall be approved by the Board of
Supervisors upon recommendation of the Planning Commission
and coordination with the Parks and Recreation Department. The
adequacy of pedestrian access to serve the recreational facilities
§ 154-40.3 UPPER PROVIDENCE CODE § 154-40.4
151:404
§ 154-40.5. Ownership and maintenance provisions for open space
lands.
shall be evaluated in the determination of the number of necessary
parking spaces.
(2) For parking areas of more than 20 cars, a minimum of 10% of the
parking lot shall be devoted to interior parking lot landscaping,
exclusive of any other landscaping or buffering which may be
required by the zoning district in which the development is located.
The minimum dimension of a planting island shall be nine feet by
18 feet.
F. If lighting is proposed for nighttime use of recreational facilities, it shall
be so arranged as to not produce glare on neighboring or nearby
dwellings. Parking lots shall also be lit if facilities they serve are to be
used after dark.
G. The joint use of stormwater management facilities and recreational
facilities may be permitted if the presence of the stormwater
management facilities directly relates to the proper function and
drainage of the recreation facility.
H. Recreational facilities shall be interconnected with recreational
facilities on abutting parcels or with existing parkland, wherever
possible, by the provision of pedestrian trails.
I. Recreational facilities shall be coordinated with applicable open space
and recreation plans or any federal, state, county, regional, adjacent
municipal or private organization to complement various programs
increasing the utility of the open space and recreation network.
J. All areas devoted to open space and/or recreational facilities shall be
suitably landscaped either by retaining existing vegetation and wooded
areas and/or by a landscaping plan for enhancing the areas through
plantings which are consistent with the purposes of this section and
which minimize maintenance costs.
A. All land set aside for open space and recreational purposes shall first be
offered for dedication to the Township for public use.
(1) Size, shape, access, topography and other physical characteristics
of the open space area(s) and recreation facilities shall be
considered in the determination of the acceptance of facilities and
land offered for dedication.
(2) When the Board of Supervisors deems it to be in the public interest
to accept dedicated land, such acceptance shall be by means of a
signed resolution to which a property description, recorded deed
and plan of the dedicated open space/recreational area(s) shall be
attached.
§ 154-40.4 STREETS AND SIDEWALKS § 154-40.5
151:405
§ 154-40.6. Fee in lieu of open space land dedication, residential
zoning districts.
§ 154-40.7. Fee in lieu of open space land dedication,
nonresidential zoning districts.
B. In which any or all land is not to be dedicated, there shall be adequate
provisions to assure the retention and future maintenance of said
area(s) and any recreational facilities located within them. At the option
of the Township, lands designated for dedication, but not accepted,
shall be retained in private ownership by an association of landowners
or homeowners, by a land conservation organization, or by a state or
county government. Lands not dedicated to the Township shall be made
subject to such agreement with the Township and such deed
restrictions duly recorded in the office of the Recorder of Deeds as may
be required by the Board of Supervisors for the purpose of preserving
and maintaining the land for recreation or open space use.
A. Where the Board of Supervisors agrees with the developer that,
because of the size, shape, location, access, topography or other
physical features of the land, it is impractical to dedicate land to the
Township or set aside an open space area(s) or recreation facility(ies),
the Board shall require a payment of a fee in lieu of dedication of such
land and recreational facilities. Said fee shall be payable to the
Township prior to approval of the final plan of the subdivision and/or
land development by the Board of Supervisors or at such other time as
determined by the Board.
(1) When a subdivision or residential development is phased, the
Board may permit the fee to be paid in amounts proportionate to
the number of lots or dwelling units in each phase.
B. The amount of any fee for residential development shall be equal to the
value of the land and recreational facilities that would normally be
preserved and developed for open space and recreation use. Said fee
shall be paid on a per-dwelling-unit or per-lot basis. The amount of said
fee, for residential uses, shall be established by resolution of the Board
of Supervisors.
C. All funds collected in lieu of land dedication shall be deposited in an
interest-bearing account, known as the "open space capital reserve
fund." All interest earned on this account shall become funds of the
account. Upon request of any party who paid a fee, the Township shall
refund such fee, plus any interest accumulated thereon from the date of
payment, if the Township has not used the funds to meet the purposes
set forth in this article within three years from the date such fee was
paid.
A. Where the Board of Supervisors agrees with the developer that,
because of the size, shape, location, access, topography or other
physical features of the land, it is impractical to dedicate land to the
§ 154-40.5 UPPER PROVIDENCE CODE § 154-40.7
151:406
Township or set aside an open space area(s) or recreation facility(ies),
the Board shall require a payment of a fee in lieu of dedication of
such land and recreational facilities. Said fee shall be payable to the
Township prior to approval of the final plan of land development by the
Board of Supervisors or at such other time as determined by the Board.
B. Determination of fees.
(1) The amount of any fee shall be equal to the value of the land and
recreational facilities that would normally be preserved and
developed for open space and recreation use. Said fee shall be paid
on a per-employee basis as follows:
Use Fee
Office $700 per employee (for the first
100 employees)
$140 per employee (for each
employee over 100)
Commercial $420 per employee (for the first
100 employees)
$140 per employee (for each
employee over 100)
Industrial $140 per employee (all
employees)
Institutional $140 per employee (for each
employee)
If the institutional use includes
residential care of any sort, the
following also apply:
$210 per unit (for the first 100
units);
$140 per unit (for each bed over
100 units)
(2) If a proposed development cannot provide the number of new
employees that a given development will employ, the Township will
determine the probable number of employees based on a ratio as
follows:
Use Number of Employees
Office 6.5 employees per 1,000 square
feet of gross floor area
Retail/Commercial 1.25 employees per 1,000
square feet of gross floor area
Industrial/Manufacturing 1 employee per 2,000 square
feet of gross floor area
Institutional 1 employee per 2,000 square
feet of gross floor area
§ 154-40.7 STREETS AND SIDEWALKS § 154-40.7
151:407
(3) In the event the Township and the developer agree that the formula
does not yield a payment in lieu of set-aside that reasonably
approximates the value of the land set aside, the Township and
developer can enter negotiations to determine the exact fee in lieu
when open space or recreation or recreation facilities are not
dedicated to the Township.
C. All funds collected in lieu of land dedication shall be deposited in an
interest-bearing account, known as the "open space capital reserve
fund." All interest earned on this account shall become funds of the
account. Upon request of any party who paid a fee, the Township shall
refund such fee, plus any interest accumulated thereon from the date of
payment, if the Township has not used the funds to meet the purposes
set forth in this article within three years from the date such fee was
paid.

Improvements
§ 154-41. Required improvements. [Amended 9-20-1982 by Ord. No.
232]
A. The applicant shall agree, in writing, to construct streets and other
improvements required by this chapter from the lot or lots to be sold or
built upon to an existing improved street, subject to the provisions of
§ 154-5 herein. The work shall be performed in strict accordance with
approved plans and the Township standards and specifications or the
applicable provisions of the Pennsylvania Department of Highways
Specifications 408, latest edition, or any subsequent number or section
thereof. No plan shall be finally approved until the developer has
completed all of the necessary and appropriate improvements as
required as a condition for final approval of a plan or until such time as
the applicant has provided a proper guaranty in the form of
performance bond or bonds with surety satisfaction to the Township or
by the deposit of funds or securities in escrow or by the presentation of
an irrevocable letter of credit from a federal- or commonwealthchartered
lending institution. Such financial security shall be posted
with a bonding company or federal- or commonwealth-chartered
lending institution chosen by the developer, builder or subdivider
posting the financial security, provided that said bonding company or
lending institution is authorized to conduct business within the
commonwealth. When requested by the applicant, to facilitate
financing, the Township shall furnish him with a signed copy of a
resolution indicating approval of the final plat contingent upon the
applicant obtaining satisfactory financial security. The final plat or
record plan shall not be signed nor recorded until the financial security
agreement is executed. The resolution of contingent approval shall
expire and be deemed to be revoked if the financial security agreement
is not executed within 90 days unless written extension is granted by
the Board of Supervisors. Such extension shall be placed in writing. The
amount of financial security shall be equal to 110% of the cost of the
required improvements for which the financial security is to be posted,
estimated as of 90 days following the date scheduled for completion by
the applicant. The cost of the improvements shall be based upon an
estimate prepared by a professional engineer licensed in the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Said estimate shall be certified by said
engineer to be a fair and reasonable estimate of such cost. The
Township, upon recommendation of the Township Engineer, may refuse
to accept said estimate for good cause shown. If the applicant and
Township are unable to agree upon an estimate, the estimate shall be
recalculated and recertified by another licensed professional engineer,
who shall mutually be chosen by the applicant and the Township. The
estimate certified by the third engineer shall be presumed fair and
reasonable and shall be the final estimate. Fees for the services of said
third engineer shall be paid equally by the Township and applicant. The
applicant shall also guarantee that no lot will be sold or building

constructed in any flood-prone area prior to completion of all
floodproofing measures planned for such lot and necessary access
facilities. [Amended 12-16-1991 by Ord. No. 307]
B. Such financial security shall provide for and secure to the public the
completion of all subdivision improvements for which such security is
being posted by the date fixed in the subdivision plan or subdivision
agreement for completion of such improvements. Annually, the
Township may adjust the amount of financial security by comparing the
actual cost of the improvements which have been completed and the
estimated cost for completion of the remaining improvements as of the
expiration of the 90th day after either the original date scheduled for
completion or a rescheduled date of completion to complete the
required improvements. The Township may require the applicant to
post additional financial security to assure that it equals the required
110% of the cost of completing the required improvements as
reestablished by using the above procedure. [Amended 12-16-1991
by Ord. No. 307]
C. In the case where development is projected over a period of years, the
Board of Supervisors may authorize the submission of final plans by
sections or stages of development, subject to such requirements or
guaranties as to improvements in future sections or stages of
development as it finds essential for the protection of any finally
approved section of the development.
A. As the work of installing the required improvements proceeds, the
party posting the financial security may request the Board of
Supervisors to release or authorize the release from time to time of
such portions of the financial security necessary for payment to the
contractor(s) performing the work. Any such request shall be in writing,
addressed to the Board of Supervisors and subject to the provisions for
release as established in Section 509 of Act 247, the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code.98
B. If a partial release is not authorized as stated in Subsection A, the
financial security shall be released only upon the complete installation
of the required improvements in accordance with the approved
improvement construction plan. Strict compliance with the procedures
established by Section 510 of Act 247, the Pennsylvania Municipalities
Planning Code,99 shall be followed with respect to the release of the
performance bond or other security. If the Board fails to comply with
the time limitations of said Section 510, all improvements will be
deemed to have been approved and the developer shall be released
from all liability pursuant to the performance bond. If the required

§ 154-43. Public utilities and laterals.
All sewers (capped and operative), water, gas, electric, telephone and other
pipes and conduits and all service connections or laterals shall be laid to
the full width of the ultimate right-of-way, where the need therefor can be
reasonably anticipated, before streets are paved. The arrangements for said
service connections or laterals shall be the responsibility of the subdivider,
developer or builder.
§ 154-44. Inspection of work and materials.
§ 154-45. Off-site improvements.
Certain improvements beyond the geographical boundaries of a site to
be subdivided and/or developed, including but not limited to road
improvements, may be required to be constructed where it can clearly be
demonstrated that such improvements have been made necessary solely
through the additional burden imposed by the subdivision and/or
development of the site. The Solicitor shall render final judgment in any
instances where a dispute arises as to the direct causal relationship for
the improvement(s). The subdivider or developer may be required to cover
costs which must be incurred by the Township or other governmental
jurisdiction in order to make these improvements feasible (for example,
but not limited to, right-of-way acquisitions). The legal and financial
arrangements to cover costs of the off-site improvements shall be the same
as those herein prescribed for § 154-41, Required improvements.
improvements are not completely installed within the required time
period, the Board shall declare the performance bond in default and
authorize the Township Manager to collect the amount payable
thereunder. Upon receipt of such amount, the Township shall install
such improvements as were covered by the bond and are
commensurate with the extent of the building development which has
taken place in the subdivision or land development, not exceeding in
cost, however, the amount collected upon the bond.
A. Notice.
(1) The Township Engineer shall be notified 48 hours in advance of the
commencement of any construction or installation operation, in
order that provision may be made for inspection by the Township.
(2) Construction and installation operations shall also be subject to
inspection by Township officials during the progress of the work,
and the subdivider, developer or builder shall pay for all
inspections.
B. Samples of materials. Samples of materials shall be furnished to the
Township in the same manner as is required of contractors under the
highway and sanitary drainage specifications.

A. Existing roads. The implementation and scheduling of the
improvements required by the Township in relation to existing roads
shall be addressed by the Township as part of the final plan approval.
B. Proposed roads. All improvements within the roadway right-of-way
shall be completed along all lots or units before any use and occupancy
permit shall be issued for the lot or unit which abuts the roadway
improvements. The only exception to this requirement shall be the
placement of the pavement wearing course which shall be placed upon
completion of the project. This required work shall also include those
improvements which are required on the lot or unit for which the use
and occupancy permit is required.100

requirements of this chapter including those sections referenced above,
and other applicable regulations are met. The following regulations of
this article apply to mobile home developments, as defined in this
chapter.
B. Mobile home developments. The provisions of this article shall be
followed in the construction or alteration of all mobile home
developments, as defined in this chapter, planned for tracts of land 15
acres or greater in size in accordance with Article X, Mobile Home
Development District, of Chapter 182, Zoning. These regulations are in
addition to those set forth in Article X of Chapter 182, Zoning, and other
applicable regulations of this chapter, and compliance with all
regulations of both chapters is required.
A. Arrangement of structures and facilities. The tract, including mobile
home stands, patios, other dwellings and structures and all tract
improvements, shall be organized in relation to topography, the shape
of the plot and the shape, size and position of structures and common
§ 154-47 STREETS AND SIDEWALKS § 154-50
151:413
facilities. Special attention shall be given to new mobile home designs
and to common appurtenances that are available.
B. Adaption to tract assets. Each mobile home unit or other dwelling or
structure shall be fitted to the terrain with a minimum disturbance of
the land and a minimum elevation difference between the floor level of
the unit and the ground elevation under it. Existing trees and shrubs,
rock formations, streams, floodplains, steep slopes and other natural
features of the tract shall be preserved to the maximum extent
practical. Favorable views shall be emphasized by the plan.
C. Courts and spaces. Groups or clusters of units, so placed as to create
interior spaces and courtyards, shall be incorporated whenever
feasible.
D. Orientation. Mobile homes are encouraged to be arranged in a variety
of orientations and are strongly encouraged to have many units with
their long sides facing the street rather than their ends, in order to
provide variety and interest. Site layout shall be designed to ensure that
mobile home units are offset to block long uninterrupted vistas between
the units.
E. Street layout. Gridiron layouts and street patterns unrelated to the
topography of the site are to be avoided.
F. Roadways.
(1) Standards. All applicable standards for streets and roads contained
in this chapter, and as subsequently amended, shall be adhered to
for all public roads in and abutting mobile home developments. In
those developments wherein the roads are to be maintained as
private internal roadways owned and maintained by the mobile
home park operator or owned and maintained in common by the
residents/owners of the individual lots, the standards shall be as
follows:
(a) Right-of-way. There shall be an equivalent right-of-way, as
defined herein, reserved along those streets which are
designed to function as feeder or collector roads and which
connect major exterior roadways, form major loops, traverse
the development or provide major or important access to
adjacent parcels. No equivalent right-of-way is required on
other roads. On those roads where an equivalent right-of-way
is required, parallel parking may be permitted, but
perpendicular or angle parking is discouraged.
(b) Pavement. Pavement width of all residential streets serving as
accesses to mobile home lots shall not be less than 26 feet,
except that this may be reduced to less than 20 feet on a street
serving as an access to no more than 20 mobile home lots
where parking is prohibited along the road and off-street
§ 154-50 UPPER PROVIDENCE CODE § 154-50
151:414
visitor parking is provided in common areas within 300 feet of
all dwelling units at a rate of 0.3 space per mobile home.
(c) Grades. Gradients on all residential streets shall not exceed
10%.
(d) Culs-de-sac. A paved turnaround area with a minimum radius
of 60 feet shall be provided at the closed end of any cul-de-sac
road serving as the sole access to four or more mobile home
lots. No permanently closed cul-de-sac street shall exceed 500
feet in length or serve as the sole access to more than 20
mobile home lots.
(e) Other requirements. All other applicable requirements of this
chapter relating to grades, vertical curves, horizontal curves,
tangents between curves, sight distance, construction
specifications, intersection alignment, intersection radius,
interconnection of adjacent parcels and similar regulations
shall be adhered to in all mobile home park developments.
(2) Access limitations. Mobile home lots may have direct access only
onto minor internal streets. Direct access from a mobile home lot
shall not be permitted onto the street(s) from which the mobile
home development gains primary access.
(3) Conversions. Any road built as a private road and later proposed for
conversion to a public road shall be brought up to the applicable
standards for public roads prior to being ordained as a public way,
unless this requirement is waived by the governing body
subsequent to determining that compliance with the requirement
would have a negative effect on the mobile home development.
G. Pedestrian circulation.
(1) General requirements. All mobile home developments shall provide
safe, convenient, all-season pedestrian walkways of adequate width
for the intended use, durable and convenient to maintain, between
individual mobile homes, mobile home development streets, all
community facilities provided for the residents and off-site
pedestrian traffic generators, such as schools, bus stops,
commercial centers, etc. These pedestrian walkways may parallel
vehicular roadways, where they shall only be required on one side,
or they may form a separate but coordinated system away from
streets. Walkways must be provided wherever pedestrian traffic is
concentrated and where school children congregate, but may be
waived elsewhere if the applicant successfully demonstrates a lack
of need.
(2) Common walk system. Where a common walk system is provided
and maintained between locations, such common walks shall have
a minimum width of four feet. Where these walks parallel
§ 154-50 STREETS AND SIDEWALKS § 154-50
151:415
roadways, they shall be separated from the road pavement by a
distance of at least four feet.
(3) Individual walks. All dwellings shall be connected to common walks
or to streets or to driveways or parking spaces connecting to a
paved street. Such individual walks shall have a minimum width of
two feet.

(1) Spaces required. Two paved off-street parking spaces shall be
provided for each dwelling either on the same lot therewith or in
common parking facilities, provided that parking areas contained
therein are within 150 feet of the mobile home lots for which they
are intended. Parking for any commercial or other nonresidential
use shall follow the requirements otherwise applicable for such
uses.
(2) Common parking areas.
(a) Aisle width. Where common parking facilities are to be used,
the standards contained in Article IV, § 154-20I, for aisle width
shall be utilized.
(b) Required green areas. Ten percent of all common parking
areas on each tract shall be devoted to green areas consisting
mostly of natural vegetation which must be interspersed within
the paved parking areas to channel traffic or divide parking
areas. The green areas required by this section shall not
constitute a portion of any green area or common open space
otherwise required by this chapter or any other ordinance or
regulation of the Township. The exact design and location of
the green areas required by this section shall be indicated on a
development or subdivision or other similar plan and be
permanently maintained as such.
I. Common open space.
(1) The requirements of §§ 182-78 and 182-185A of Chapter 182, shall
apply.
(2) Recreation. Recreation areas and facilities shall be provided to
meet the anticipated needs of the residents of the development and

J. Buffers.
§ 154-50 UPPER PROVIDENCE CODE § 154-50
151:416
(1) General requirements. Along all exterior property boundary lines
except those which abut another mobile home development, there
shall be a permanent buffer at least 15 feet in depth, unless this is
waived pursuant to Subsection J(4) or (5) below. A screen buffer, as
defined herein, shall be provided wherever the mobile home
development abuts existing residential uses, with the exception of
mid-rise or high-rise structures, and where abutting other types of
uses when deemed necessary by the Township governing body to
provide sufficient buffering and transition. A softening buffer, as
defined herein, shall be provided wherever the mobile home
development abuts existing mid-rise or high-rise residential uses;
existing commercial, office, industrial and institutional uses; any
existing street [as modified by Subsection J(3) below], drive or
parking area; or open, not wooded, undeveloped land. An open
buffer shall be provided wherever the mobile home development
abuts wooded undeveloped land or where more extensive buffers
are deemed unnecessary by the governing body.
(2) Components. The minimum component of each type of buffer shall
be as follows:
(a) Screen buffer. The primary component of a screen buffer shall
be a row of evergreen trees at a height of not less than six feet
when planted, spaced not more than 10 feet apart on center,
and these trees shall be of such species to attain a height at
maturity of not less than 20 feet. Also required as a secondary
component of the buffer is one of the following: mounding (the
use of which is encouraged), provided that the slopes shall be a
maximum of three to one; visually opaque fencing not greater
than six feet in height; or coniferous shrubbery. Any
combination of evergreen trees, coniferous shrubs, mounding,
fencing or other natural vegetation or man-made materials is
allowable, provided that an effective visual screen at least 15
feet in height above the adjacent ground elevation in the
mobile home development is achieved within a reasonable
time. But whenever only vegetation is used, there shall be at
least a double row of evergreen trees, with the trees in one row
offset five feet from the trees in the other row and the rows at
least five feet apart.
(b) Softening buffer. The primary component of a softening buffer
shall be a row of trees spaced not more than 25 feet apart oncenter,
at least 25% of which shall be evergreens. The
evergreen trees shall be at least six feet in height when planted
and shall attain at least 20 feet in height at maturity. Any
deciduous trees shall be at least 1 1/2 inches in caliper and
eight feet in height when planted and shall attain a height of
not less than 20 feet at maturity. These trees shall be
interspersed with other allowable components, including any
other type of trees, shrubs, mounding, fencing and/or similar
§ 154-50 STREETS AND SIDEWALKS § 154-50
151:417
natural or man-made elements having a visible vertical
dimension, or any combination thereof.
(c) Open buffers. The open buffer shall as a minimum consist of
grass, ground cover and/or similar vegetative material and
may include trees, shrubs or other natural or man-made
landscaping materials, but it shall be mostly vegetative with
minimal paved areas, if any.
(3) Street boundaries. Rather than the extensive buffers described in
Subsection J(2) above, the use of a single row of deciduous trees at
least eight feet in height when planted and at least 20 feet in height
at maturity, with a spacing of not more than 40 feet on center, may
be provided along all property boundaries which abut a street,
wherever necessary for adequate sight distance or where the
governing body determines this to be a sufficient buffer to protect
the welfare and safety of the community.
(4) Existing buffers. In cases where an edge(s) of a mobile home
development occurs along natural features which function as
buffers, including but not limited to mature vegetation, significant
grade changes or stream valleys, which are likely to be
permanently preserved, buffering may be waived along that
edge(s) upon approval of the governing body.
(5) Buffer alternative. Buffers may also be waived by the governing
body where the mobile home development abuts a single-family
residential use, if only detached modular homes or conventionally
built single-family detached dwellings, but not mobile homes, are
constructed within 200 feet of that property boundary.
(6) Maintenance. All vegetation shall be maintained permanently and
in the event of death or other destruction shall be replaced within
one year by the persons responsible for maintenance when the
death or destruction occurred.
(7) Buffer landscape plan. A landscaping plan shall be submitted with
the final plans, showing all pertinent information, including the
location, size and species of all individual trees and shrubs to be
preserved or planted or, alternately, the general characteristics of
existing vegetation masses which are to be preserved.
K. Drainage considerations. The following site drainage requirements
shall apply to all mobile home developments:
(1) Surface water. The ground surface in all parts of the development
shall be graded and equipped to drain all surface water in a safe,
efficient manner. [Amended 6-2-2008 by Ord. No. 490]

ARTICLE IX
Act 209 Traffic Impact Fees
[Added 6-17-2019 by Ord. No. 578]
§ 154-59. Title.
This article shall be known as the "Upper Providence Township
Transportation Impact Fee Ordinance."
§ 154-60. Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to establish a transportation impact fee to
ensure that the cost of needed capital improvements be applied to new
developments in a manner that will allocate equitably the cost of those
improvements among property owners such that the transportation system
of the Township is available and adequate to support new growth and
development. To advance this objective, there is hereby created a
transportation impact fee payable to the Township at the time of issuance of
the building permit(s).
§ 154-61. Findings and conclusions.
The Board, pursuant to Act 209, hereby finds and declares:
A. The conditions and standards for determination and imposition of a
transportation impact fee set forth herein are those set forth in Act 209
and consist of:
(1) The recitals set forth above;
(2) The analysis, advice and recommendations of the Committee;
(3) The Land Use Assumptions Report as prepared by the Committee
and approved by the Board on the above date;
(4) The Roadway Sufficiency Analysis as prepared by the Committee
and approved by the Board on the above date;
(5) The Transportation Capital Improvement Plan as prepared by the
Committee and approved by the Board on the above date; and
(6) Such other conditions and standards as the Board may by
resolution from time to time identify as being relevant, material
and necessary to the imposition of a Transportation Impact Fee and
consistent with the provisions of Act 209 and any amendments
thereto.
B. The amount of the per-peak-hour-trip transportation impact fees shall
be set forth in Section 59-13, "Calculation of Per-Peak-Hour-Trip Fee for
the Transportation Service Area" of this article.
§ 154-59 STREETS AND SIDEWALKS § 154-61

The terms and definitions as set forth in 53 P.S. § 10502-A, Definitions, of
Act 209 are hereby adopted, referenced and incorporated as if more fully
set forth herein.
§ 154-63. Enactment and imposition of transportation impact fees.
There is hereby enacted a transportation impact fee to be imposed upon
new subdivision and new development, as defined in the Act, for the
purpose of funding off-site public transportation improvements as
authorized by Act 209 and as described in the Roadway Sufficiency Analysis
approved by the Board and the Capital Improvements plan approved by
the Board. The transportation impact fees shall apply to all subdivisions
or new developments (as such term is defined under 53 P.S. § 10502-A)
within the transportation service area as hereinafter defined and identified
(the "transportation service area") and shall be due and payable to the
Township at the time of issuance of a building permit(s), such payment
being a condition precedent to the issuance and validity of such building
permit(s).
§ 154-64. Uses.
Transportation impact fees collected pursuant to this article may be
expended for those costs incurred for improvements identified in the
analysis and plan which are attributable to subdivision or new development,
including the acquisition of land and rights-of-way, engineering, legal and
planning costs and all other costs which are directly related to road
improvements within the transportation service area, including debt
service, and further including such proportionate amount of the preparation
of the Roadway Sufficiency Analysis as is permitted pursuant to Act 209.

§ 154-66. Special transportation studies.
§ 154-67. Uniform applicability of transportation impact fees.
This article shall be uniformly applicable to all subdivision and new
developments that occur within the transportation service area.
§ 154-68. Imposition and payment of transportation impact fee as
condition to issuance of building permit.
No building permit shall be issued for a subdivision or new development
within the transportation service area until such time as the applicant
thereof has paid to the Township the transportation impact fee imposed by
and calculated pursuant to this article.
C. The Transportation Capital Improvements Plan as approved by
Resolution No. 2019-22; and
D. The Transportation Service Areas Map as prepared by McMahon
Associates, Inc., attached as Exhibit "A" to the Transportation Capital

attached hereto.
A. Where intended to assist in the determination of the appropriate
amount of the transportation impact fee, the Township may require an
applicant to prepare a special transportation study (the "special
transportation studies") to determine the traffic generation and
circulation patterns in new nonresidential developments or
subdivisions; provided, however, that no studies may be required when
the proposed development will not require a deviation from the land use
assumptions resulting in increased density, intensity or trip generation.
The special transportation study shall be prepared by a qualified traffic
or transportation engineer in accord with generally accepted
transportation planning and engineering standards and shall be
submitted prior to the imposition of a transportation impact fee and
shall be considered in determination of same. The applicant shall be
responsible for all costs associated with the special transportation
studies.
B. Where a new nonresidential development is proposed which deviates
from the land use assumptions resulting in increased density, intensity
or trip generation, the developer shall be required to prepare a special
transportation study in order to assist the Township in determining
traffic generation or circulation and to serve as the basis for the
determination of the amount of the transportation impact fee for such
development or subdivision. Such transportation studies shall conform
with the requirements of the Township's Subdivision and Land
Development Ordinance. Any such studies shall be submitted prior to
the imposition of the impact fee and shall be considered in the
determination of the fee.

§ 154-69. Method of calculation.
§ 154-70. Establishment of transportation service areas.
A. The transportation impact fee shall be based upon the total costs of
road improvements or portions thereof included in the analysis and
plan within a given transportation service area that are attributable to
and necessitated by subdivision and/or new development within the
transportation service area, as calculated in accordance with the Act
and herewith, divided by the number of anticipated peak-hour trips
generated by all subdivision and/or new development consistent with a)
the land use assumptions, as approved, and b) calculated in accordance
with the Trip Generation Manual published by the Institute of
Transportation Engineers, 10th or subsequent editions, as amended,
which is hereby approved by the Township, to equal the per-trip cost for
transportation improvements within the transportation service area.
B. The transportation impact fee for a specific subdivision or new
development within the transportation service area for road
improvements shall be determined as of the date of preliminary
subdivision or new development approval by multiplying the per-trip
cost established for the transportation service area by the estimated
number of peak-hour trips to be generated by the subdivision or new
development using the 10th edition or later of the Trip Generation
Manual published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers.
C. If the subdivision or new development contains a mix of uses, the
applicant must separately calculate the transportation impact fee due
for each type of use.
D. The Board may authorize or require the preparation of a special
transportation study in order to determine the traffic generation or
circulation for a new nonresidential development to assist in the
determination of the amount of the transportation fee for such
subdivision or new development.
A. Transportation service areas are established as shown on the map,
entitled "Transportation Service Areas," as included in the analysis and
plan and as further attached hereto as Exhibit "A" and incorporated
fully herein by reference.104 As shown therein, this article recognizes a

which credit was provided.
C. Establishment and maintenance of accounts. The Township shall
establish appropriate trust fund accounts and shall maintain records
whereby transportation impact fees collected can be segregated for
each transportation service area.
D. Maintenance of records. The Township shall be responsible for the
separate and proper accounting of any transportation impact fees
received pursuant to this article. The Township shall maintain and keep
adequate financial records for each account, which shall show the
source and disbursement of all revenues, which shall account for all
monies received, and which shall ensure the disbursement of funds
from each account shall be used solely and exclusively for the provision
of projects specified in the analysis and plan for the transportation
service area.

151:434
approved by the Township and shall be administered by the Township in
accordance with the provisions of this article.
§ 154-75. Credit.
Any applicant who shall perform off-site improvements, at its own expense
and with the consent and agreement of the Board, shall be eligible for a
credit from a transportation impact fee otherwise due in the amount for
the actual cost of such off-site improvements as approved by the Township
Engineer. Such credit shall not exceed the amount of the transportation
impact fee that would have been charged if a credit was not due. The Board,
at its sole discretion, may direct the Township to provide the applicant:
A. A credit against the transportation impact fee otherwise due in the
amount of the fair market value of any land dedicated by the applicant
to the Township for future right-of-way, realignment or widening of any
existing roadways. The fair market value of the land dedicated by the
applicant shall be determined as of the date of the submission of the
subdivision or new development application to the Township.
B. A credit against the transportation impact fee otherwise due for the
value of construction of road improvements contained in the analysis
and plan which are performed at the applicant's expense. The amount
of such credit for any transportation capital improvements constructed
shall be the amount allocated in the analysis and plan, including
contingency factors, for such work.
C. Any applicant who shall perform, at his own expense, and with the
consent and agreement of the Board, off-site improvements, as herein
defined, shall be eligible for a credit from the transportation impact fee
otherwise due in the amount of the actual cost of such off-site
improvements as approved by the Township Engineer, only if all of the
following criteria are met:
(1) The applicant shall enter into an agreement (the "improvement
agreement") with the Township prior to the issuance of a building
permit. The improvement agreement shall establish the estimated
cost of the off-site improvements, the schedule for initiation and
completion of the off-site improvements, a requirement that the offsite
improvements be completed to Township and Pennsylvania
Department of Transportation standards and design criteria and
other such terms and conditions as deemed necessary by the
Board;
(2) The Township shall review the improvement agreement, verify
costs and time schedules, determine if the improvement is
contained in the analysis and plan, and determine the amount of
the applicable credit for such improvement to be applied against
the otherwise due transportation impact fee; and
§ 154-74 STREETS AND SIDEWALKS § 154-75
151:435
§ 154-76. Refunds.
Transportation impact fees collected pursuant to this article shall be
refunded, together with earned accrued interest thereon from the date
of payment, to the payer of the impact fees under any of the following
circumstances:
(3) The applicant shall be required to supply financial security
sufficient, in the judgment of the Township, to cover the cost of any
such improvement installed by the applicant for which the credit is
sought.
D. In no instance shall any credit authorized by the Board pursuant to this
article exceed the amount of the transportation impact fee actually due.
A. In the event the Township terminates or completes the analysis and
plan for a transportation service area and there remains at the time of
termination or completion undisbursed funds in the account(s)
established for that purpose, the respective payors shall be entitled to a
share of the fund balance in the same portion as the payor's
transportation impact fee payment plus interest earned bears to the
total transportation impact fees collected plus interest. Any allocations
of a refund shall be determined by generally accepted accounting
practices. The Township shall provide written notice by certified mail to
those persons who previously paid the transportation impact fees which
remain undispersed. Such notice shall advise of that person's
proportionate share of the fund balance that is available for refund to
such person. Such notice shall be provided to the last known address
provided by the payor of the transportation impact fee to the Township.
In the event any of the funds remain unclaimed following one year after
notice, the Township shall be authorized to transfer any funds
remaining to any other fund in the Township without further obligation
to refund such funds. It shall be the responsibility of the payor to
provide the Township at all times with a current address for such
notice.
B. In the event the Township fails to commence construction of any
transportation service area road improvements (the "transportation
capital improvement") within three years of the scheduled construction
date set forth in the analysis and plan, any person who paid any
transportation impact fees pursuant to that analysis and plan shall,
upon written request to the Township, receive a refund of that portion
of the transportation impact fee attributable to the contribution for the
uncommenced transportation capital improvement, plus interest
accumulated thereon from the date of payment. However, no refund
shall be payable or paid with respect to any project actually commenced
prior to the receipt of such refund request, and the failure of a payor to
make such written request prior to the commencement of such project
shall be deemed a waiver of any right to such refund.
§ 154-75 UPPER PROVIDENCE CODE § 154-76
151:436
§ 154-77. Additional and supplemental requirement.
The transportation impact fee is additional and supplemental to, and not in
substitution of, any other requirements by the Township on the subdivision
or development of land or the issuance of building permits. Nothing herein
contained shall be deemed to alter or affect the Township's existing
ordinances and regulations regarding on-site improvements. In no event
shall a property owner be obligated to pay for transportation capital
improvements in an amount in excess of the amount calculated pursuant
to this article; provided, however, that a property owner may be required
to pay, pursuant to Township ordinances, regulations or policies, for other
public facilities as an addition to the transportation impact fee as provided
herein.
§ 154-78. Retroactive application.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, transportation
impact fees may be imposed on those projects involving subdivisions, new
developments or planned residential developments for which an application
has been filed on or after the first publication of notice of the Township's
intent to adopt this article; provided, however, that such retroactivity does
not exceed 18 months after the adoption of the resolution that created the
committee in connection herewith.
§ 154-79. Repealer.
All ordinances or parts of ordinances inconsistent herewith or in conflict
with any of the specific terms enacted hereby, to the extent of said
inconsistencies or conflicts, are hereby specifically repealed.
C. In the event that, upon completion of any road improvements project,
the actual expenditure for the project is less than 95% of the costs
budgeted for such project, the Township shall refund the pro rata
difference between the budgeted costs and the actual expenditures,
including interest accumulated thereon from the date of payment, to
the person(s) who paid the transportation impact fees for such
improvements.
D. If the new subdivision or new development for which the transportation
impact fees were paid is not commenced prior to the expiration of the
building permits issued for the project within the time limits
established by the applicable building codes within the Township, the
transportation impact fees paid with accumulated interest shall be
refunded to the payor. Further, if the building permit as issued for the
project is altered and the alteration results in a decrease in the amount
of the transportation impact fee due in accordance with the calculations
set forth under § 154-69, Method of calculation, the difference between
such amount and the amount actually paid shall be refunded. The payor,
at its option, may roll over the transportation impact fees attributable to
an expired building permit to cover fees incurred by a new permit.

In the event that any section, sentence, clause, phrase or word of this
article shall be declared illegal, invalid or unconstitutional by any court
of competent jurisdiction, such declaration shall not prevent, preclude or
otherwise foreclose enforcement of any of the remaining portions of this
article.

This article shall become effective five days after the date of adoption.
§ 154-83. Failure to enforce not a waiver.
The failure of Upper Providence Township to enforce any provision of this

under § 160-4B(2), the employer shall withhold the tax for the
remainder of that calendar year. The employer shall withhold from
the person, for the first payroll period after receipt of the
notification under § 160-4B(2), a lump sum equal to the amount of
tax that was not withheld from the person due to the exemption
claimed by the person under this subsection, plus the per-payroll
amount due for that first payroll period. The amount of tax withheld
per payroll period for the remaining payroll periods in that
calendar year shall be the same amount withheld for other
employees. In the event the employment of a person subject to
withholding of the tax under this subsection is subsequently
severed in that calendar year, the person shall be liable for any
outstanding balance of tax due, and Upper Providence Township
may pursue collection under this article.
(4) Except as provided in § 160-4B(2), it is the intent of this subsection
that employers shall not be responsible for investigating exemption
certificates, monitoring tax exemption eligibility or exempting any
employee from the local services tax.
C. Refunds. Upper Providence Township, in consultation with the
Collector and DCED, shall establish procedures for the processing of
refund claims for any tax paid by any person who is eligible for
exemption, which procedures shall be in accord with provisions of the
general municipal law relating to refunds of overpayments and interest
on overpayments. Refunds made within 75 days of a refund request or
75 days after the last day the employer is required to remit the tax for
the last quarter of the calendar year, whichever is later, shall not be
subject to interest. No refunds shall be made for amounts overpaid in a
calendar year that do not exceed $1: Upper Providence Township or the
Collector shall determine eligibility for exemption and provide refunds
to exempt persons.
A. Each employer within Upper Providence Township, as well as those
employers situated outside Upper Providence Township but who
engage in business within Upper Providence Township, is hereby
charged with the duty of collecting the tax from each of his employees
engaged by him or performing for him within Upper Providence
Township and making a return and payment thereof to the Collector.
Further, each employer is hereby authorized to deduct this tax for each
employee in his employ, whether said employee is paid by salary, wage
or commission and whether or not all such services are performed
within Upper Providence Township.
B. A person subject to the tax shall be assessed by the employer a pro-rata
share of the tax for each payroll period in which the person is engaging
in an occupation. The pro-rata share of the tax assessed on the person

151:444
§ 160-6. Returns.
Each employer shall prepare and file a return showing a computation of the
tax on forms to be supplied to the employer by the Collector. If an employer
fails to file the return and pay the tax, whether or not the employer makes
collection thereof from the salary, wages or commissions paid by him to an
employee, except as provided hereafter in this article, the employer shall be
for a payroll period shall be determined by dividing the rate of the
tax levied for the calendar year by the number of payroll periods
established by the employer for the calendar year. For purposes of
determining the pro-rata share, an employer shall round down the
amount of the tax collected each payroll period to the nearest 1/100 of
a dollar. Collection of the tax shall be made on a payroll-period basis for
each payroll period in which the person is engaging in an occupation,
except as provided in Subsection D of this section. For purposes of this
subsection, "combined rate" shall mean the aggregate annual rate of
the tax levied by the school district and the municipality.
C. No person shall be subject to the payment of the local services tax by
more than one political subdivision during each payroll period.
D. In the case of concurrent employment, an employer shall refrain from
withholding the tax if the employee provides a recent pay statement
from a principal employer that includes the name of the employer, the
length of the payroll period and the amount of the tax withheld and a
statement from the employee that the pay statement is from the
employee's principal employer, and the employee will notify other
employers of a change in principal place of employment within two
weeks of its occurrence. The employee's statement shall be provided on
the form approved by DCED.
E. The tax shall be no more than $52 on each person for each calendar
year, irrespective of the number of political subdivisions within which a
person may be employed. Upper Providence Township shall provide a
taxpayer a receipt of payment upon request by the taxpayer.
F. No employer shall be held liable for failure to withhold the tax or for the
payment of the withheld tax money to Upper Providence Township if the
failure to withhold taxes arises from incorrect information submitted by
the employee as to the employee's place or places of employment, the
employee's principal office or where the employee is principally
employed. Further, an employer shall not be liable for payment of the
local services tax in an amount exceeding the amount withheld by the
employer if the employer complies with the provisions of Subsection B
of § 160-4 of this article and this section and remits the amount so
withheld in accordance with this article.

determine the number of employees from whom such tax shall be deducted
and paid over to the Collector on or before the 30th day following the end
of each calendar quarter of each such tax year.
§ 160-8. Self-employed individuals.
Each self-employed individual who performs services of any type or kind
or engages in any occupation or profession within a primary place of
employment within Upper Providence Township shall be required to comply
with this article and pay the pro-rata portion of the tax due to the Collector
on or before the 30th day following the end of each quarter.

employed in more than one political subdivision.
§ 160-10. Nonresidents subject to tax.
All employers and self-employed individuals residing or having their places
of business outside of Upper Providence Township but who perform services
of any type or kind or engage in any occupation or profession within Upper
Providence Township do, by virtue thereof, agree to be bound by and
subject themselves to the provisions, penalties and regulations promulgated
under this article with the same force and effect as though they were
residents of Upper Providence Township. Further, any individual engaged
in an occupation within Upper Providence Township and an employee of a
A. The situs of the tax shall be the place of employment on the first day the
person becomes subject to the tax during each payroll period. In the
event a person is engaged in more than one occupation, that is,
concurrent employment, or an occupation which requires that the
person work in more than one political subdivision during a payroll
period, the priority of claim to collect the local services tax shall be in
the following order:
(1) First, the political subdivision in which a person maintains his
principal office or is principally employed;
(2) Second, the political subdivision in which the person resides and
works if the tax is levied by that political subdivision;
(3) Third, the political subdivision in which a person is employed and
which imposes the tax nearest in miles to the person's home.
B. In case of dispute, a tax receipt of the taxing authority for that calendar
year declaring that the taxpayer has made prior payment constitutes
prima facie certification of payment to all other political subdivisions.

§ 169-25. Applicability and scope.
This article is enacted under authority of § 6109(a)(22) of the Vehicle Code
and gives authority to the township to remove and impound vehicles that
are parked overtime on any street in the township in violation of any
provision of Article I or Article III of this chapter.
§ 169-26. Authority to remove and impound.
The township shall have authority to remove and impound, or to order
the removal and impounding, of any vehicle parked overtime or otherwise
illegally, provided that the circumstances of its parking were within the
conditions stated in § 168-25 of this article and provided that no such
vechile shall be removed or impounded except in strict adherence to the
provisions of this article.
§ 169-27. Designation of approved storage garages; bonding;
towing and storage.
Removal and impounding of vehicles under this article shall be done only
by approved storage garages that shall be designated from time to time
by the Board of Supervisors. Every such garage shall submit evidence
to the Board of Supervisors that it is bonded or has acquired liability
insurance in an amount satisfactory to the Board of Supervisors as sufficient
to indemnify owners of impounded vehicles against loss or damage to
those vehicles while in the custody of the garagekeeper for the purpose of
towing or storage. The approved storage garage shall submit to the Board
of Supervisors its schedule of charges for towing and storage of vehicles
under this article, and when the schedule is approved by the Board of
Supervisors, those charges shall be adhered to by the approved storage
garage. No different schedule of charges shall be adopted without approval
of the Board of Supervisors, and no different charges shall be demanded of
or collected from any person whose vehicle is removed or impounded under
this article by any approved storage garage. The Board of Supervisors shall
delete from its list of approved storage garages any garage that makes any
unapproved charge in connection with any vehicle removed or impounded
under this article.
§ 169-28. Notification of removal and impounding.
Within 12 hours from the time of removal of any vehicle under authority
granted by this article, notice of the fact that the vehicle was removed shall
be sent by the Township to the owner of record of the vehicle. The notice
shall designate the place from which the vehicle was removed, the reason
for its removal and impounding and the garage in which it was impounded.
§ 169-25 (RESERVED) § 169-29
165:477
§ 169-29. Effect of payment of towing and storage charges.
The payment of any towing and storage charges authorized by this article
shall, unless payment is made under protest, be final and conclusive and
shall constitute a waiver of any right to recover the money so paid. If
payment of any towing or storage charges is made under protest, the
offender shall be entitled to a hearing before a District Justice. Payment
of towing and storage charges shall not relieve the owner or driver of any
vehicle from liability for any fine or penalty for the violation of the provision
of this chapter for which the vehicle was removed or impounded.
§ 169-30. Records of vehicles removed and impounded.
The Township shall cause a record to be kept of all vehicles impounded
under this article and shall be able at all reasonable times to furnish the
owners or the agents of the owners of those vehicles with information as to
the place of storage of the vehicle.
§ 169-31. Restrictions upon removal of vehicles.
No vehicle shall be removed under the authority of this article if, at the
time of the intended removal, the owner or the person for the time being in
charge of the vehicle is present and expresses a willingness and intention
to remove the vehicle immediately.

adopted thereunder, shall have the meanings ascribed to them, except
where the content clearly indicates a different meaning:
BOARD  The Upper Providence Township Board of Supervisors.
CAPACITY  Except in the case of free-flowing wells, the "capacity" is
construed to mean the daily capacity of the pumps installed and not the
contemplated draft.[Amended 9-17-1990 by Ord. No. 301]
DRILLING  All action necessary to construction of wells such as drilling,
boring, coring, washing, digging, driving or letting. This shall not apply to
the drilling of blast holes in quarries or to core holes 31/2 inches or less in
diameter drilled for exploration or investigation.
PERSON  A corporation, partnership, municipal authority or association,
as well as a natural person.
UNDERGROUND WATERS  Waters of underground streams, channels,
artesian basins or other bodies of water in or under the ground, whether
percolating or otherwise.

dug or otherwise constructed for the location, diversion or acquisition of
underground waters or the charging of water into underground strata.
WELL DRILLER  Any water well contractor, his employees or
representative in responsible charge of drilling or otherwise constructing a
well.
§ 176-3. Compliance required.
No well may be drilled within Upper Providence Township except in strict
accordance with the provisions of this article and the well-drilling
regulations adopted by the Board hereunder. Such regulations shall be

A. Short title. This article shall be known and may be cited as the "Upper
Providence Township Well Ordinance of 1978."
B. Purpose. The purpose of this article is to promote and protect the
general health and welfare of the residents of the township by
conserving the supply of underground waters and preventing the
pollution thereof.

§ 176-7. Reports.
All well drillers shall, upon completion of the drilling of any well, file a
report in the form to be supplied by the Board.
§ 176-8. Sealing of abandoned wells.
The owner of any well shall, upon abandonment of any existing well or test
hole, effectively seal and fill such wells and test holes in accordance with
rules prescribed by the Board. A well not in operation for three or more
years or improperly maintained to prevent contamination may be deemed
to have been abandoned.
A. It shall be unlawful for any person to locate, drill or have drilled any
well, to install or have installed any related pumping equipment or to
alter an existing well or its pumping equipment until a permit for such
location, drilling, installation or alteration shall have been issued by the
duly appointed township officer. [Amended 9-17-1990 by Ord. No.
301]
B. Any well driller desiring to drill to an excess of 200 feet in depth or to
tap an underground flow of excess of eight gallons per minute shall
specifically notify the Board of Supervisors, and the Board shall have
the authority to impose such conditions and make such requirements
and limitations as may, in its opinion, be necessary to protect the
citizens of the township and may issue limited and revocable permits
for such wells.
C. Anyone desiring to drill for purposes of service to multiple-unit
residential developments, apartment buildings or commercial or
industrial users shall give the exact spot of drilling to the township
inspector. The inspector will then establish the proximity of other deep
wells in the vicinity. If there is no deep well within 11/2 miles or if wells
closer than that distance are being used at less than 75% of capacity,
the permit will be granted; otherwise it will be denied.

§ 182-5. Lot requirements.
Any lot, as well as the open space reserved on it, must equal or exceed the
minimum sizes prescribed by this chapter for the district in which the lot is
located.
§ 182-5.1. Corner lots. [Added 2-20-2001 by Ord. No. 401]
Corner lots shall have a front yard on each street which the lot abuts
and therefore must have a minimum of two front yards. The remaining
yards shall be side or rear yards. There shall be a minimum of one rear
yard and one side yard. The lot owner or developer may designate which
yard is the rear yard and which is the side yard. If the shape of the
lot is such that following the requirements of this provision is unclear or
infeasible, the Zoning Officer shall determine the yard designations for the
lot. The designation of the various yards shall be included on any record
plan of subdivision and be included in the deed for each corner lot. The
designations of the various yards is a single designation and, once made, is
applied to the lot in perpetuity.

The areas within the Township limits as assigned to each district and the
location of boundaries of the districts established by this chapter are shown
upon the Zoning Map, which is declared to be a part of this chapter and
shall be kept on file by the Township Manager.114
§ 182-7. District boundary lines.
Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of the various
districts as shown on the Zoning Map, the following rules shall apply:
A. Boundaries indicated as approximately following the center line of
streets, highways or alleys shall be construed to follow center lines.
B. Boundaries indicated as approximately following plotted lot lines shall
be construed as following such lines.
C. Boundaries indicated as approximately following Township boundaries
shall be construed as following such boundaries.
D. Boundaries indicated as following railroad lines shall be construed to be
midway between the main tracks.
E. Boundaries indicated as following streams and rivers shall be construed
to follow the center lines of the same.
F. Boundaries indicated as parallel to or extensions of features indicated
in Subsections A through E above shall be so construed. Distances not

§ 182-8. Lots of record. [Amended 9-20-1982 by Ord. No. 231]
For a lot of public record in single and separate ownership at the time of
enactment of this chapter or applicable amendment thereto which does not
meet the minimum area or lot width requirements of the district in which it
is located, the provisions of § 182-177 herein shall apply.
§ 182-9. Reduction of lot area.
No lot shall be so reduced that the area of the lot or the dimensions of the
required open space shall be less than herein prescribed.
§ 182-10. Visibility at intersections.116
On corner lots, no physical improvements on planting areas shall be
erected, altered or maintained within the required yards which shall cause
obstruction to drivers' vision from the abutting intersection. A sight triangle
is a triangle whose legs are the sides of a cartway and an access way which
intersects it, with each leg being not less than 30 feet from the point of
intersection of the two legs.
specifically indicated on the Zoning Map shall be determined by the
scale of the map.
G. (Reserved)115
H. Where physical features existing on the ground are at a variance with
those shown on the Official Zoning Map or in other circumstances not
covered by Subsections A thorough G above, the Zoning Officer shall
make an initial determination. Thereafter, any party may appeal his
decision to the Zoning Hearing Board, which, upon appeal, shall
interpret the district boundaries.
I. When a district boundary line divides a lot held in single and separate
ownership as of the effective date of this chapter or a subsequent
amendment thereto, the regulations as to use in the less restrictive
district may, when authorized as a special exception, extend over the
portion of the lot in the more restrictive district, to the nearest lot line,
but in no case a distance greater than 50 feet; provided, however, that
the setbacks, coverages, height and all other developmental regulations
of the less restrictive district shall not be so extended. The Zoning
Hearing Board may require suitable buffering if the use on the abutting
lot is different than the use being extended by application of this
provision; provided, however, that this provision does not imply
permission to extend uses into either the Floodplain Conservation
District or the Steep Slope Conservation District which are not normally
permitted in those districts. [Added 12-16-1991 by Ord. No. 307]

No. 211; 9-20-1982 by Ord. No. 231; 12-16-2013 by Ord. No. 535]
No structure shall be erected without direct access over the same lot.
Such access shall be at least 50 feet wide and shall extend from the
structure to a public road. This section shall not be construed to apply
to access to individual units within the R-3 and R-4 Residential Districts,
which is provided for under §§ 182-52B(5) and 182-60B(5), respectively,
and access to parcels within the VCO District, which is provided for under
§ 182-96.3B8(a). Additionally, the Board of Supervisors may require that
access be taken from a private road with access to a public road, if a
private road borders the proposed site; all easements and other required
documentation shall be filed with the Township.

231]
Existing lots for which access to a public road is not in compliance with
§ 182-11 may be built upon only when authorized by a variance. In
computing the area of such lots, the area of the strip of ground connecting
the lot with the public road shall not be included. The strip of ground
connecting the lot with the public road shall be used as access to only the
particular lot of which it is a part.
§ 182-12.1. New rear (interior) lots. [Added 12-16-1991 by Ord. No.
307]
Newly created rear lots may be allowed only upon approval of the Board of

A. Purposes for use of rear lots. Rear lots may be allowed when one or
more of the following purposes are served:
(1) To preserve existing farmland and/or rural appearance and
character by locating building areas remote from existing road
frontage.
(2) To permit reasonable subdivision of land which is physically
constrained by unusual configuration of the tract or limited road
frontage and which could not be subdivided in a desirable manner
using traditional road and lotting patterns.
(3) When future subdivision of a tract is contemplated and supported
by a tentative sketch of the entire parcel and when rear lotting
serves to reduce the number of access points from existing roads
by providing for a common access driveway along an access strip
which is reserved for future use as a road right-of-way.
(4) To permit an alternative to the construction of new residential
roads, where such roads cannot be justified in terms of the number
of lots served, volume of traffic generated and/or the need to
extend access to adjacent tracts.

frontage lot containing at least the minimum lot width at the
building setback line for the applicable zoning district. The
frontage lot shall be located in front of and adjacent to the rear lot
being created.
(2) The access strip shall be a fee simple part of the rear lot and extend
from the public road to the developable portion of the lot which it
serves. The access strip shall not be a separate lot or easement
over another lot.
(3) The access strip shall be a minimum of 50 feet in width for its entire
length from the road right-of-way to the developable portion of the
lot, unless additional width is necessary or desirable for drainage,
grading or preservation of natural features.
(4) The area of the access strip shall not be part of the minimum lot
area required for the applicable zoning district.
(5) The minimum front yard depth shall be measured along the
property line which most nearly parallels the street upon which the
rear lot fronts.

§ 182-21.1 UPPER PROVIDENCE CODE § 182-21.1
176:544
(3) Conditional use authorization required. Tower-based WCFs are
permitted in certain zoning districts by conditional use and at a
height necessary to satisfy their function in the WCF applicant's
wireless communications system. No WCF applicant shall have the
right under these regulations to erect a tower to the maximum
height specified in this section unless it proves the necessity for
such height. The WCF applicant shall demonstrate that the
antenna/tower/pole for the tower-based WCF is the minimum
height necessary for the service area.
(a) Prior to the Supervisors' approval of a conditional use
authorizing the construction and installation of tower-based
WCF, it shall be incumbent upon the WCF applicant for such
conditional use approval to prove to the reasonable satisfaction
of Supervisors that the WCF applicant cannot adequately
extend or infill its communications system by the use of
equipment such as redoes, repeaters, antenna(s) and other
similar equipment installed on existing structures, such as
utility poles or their appurtenances and other available tall
structures. The WCF applicant shall further demonstrate that
the proposed tower-based WCF must be located where it is
proposed in order to serve the WCF applicant's service area
and that no other viable alternative location exists.
(b) The conditional use application shall be accompanied by a
propagation study evidencing the need for the proposed tower
or other communication facilities and equipment, a description
of the type and manufacturer of the proposed transmission/
radio equipment, the frequency range (megahertz band)
assigned to the WCF applicant, the power in watts at which the
WCF applicant transmits, and any relevant related tests
conducted by the WCF applicant in determining the need for
the proposed site and installation.
(c) The conditional use application shall also be accompanied by
documentation demonstrating that the proposed tower-based
WCF complies with all state and federal laws and regulations
concerning aviation safety.
(d) Where the tower-based WCF is located on a property with
another principal use, the WCF applicant shall present
documentation to the Supervisors that the owner of the
property has granted an easement for the proposed WCF and
that vehicular access will be provided to the facility.
(e) The conditional use application shall also be accompanied by
documentation demonstrating that the proposed tower-based
WCF complies with all applicable provisions of the Upper
Providence Township Zoning Ordinance.123

176:545
(4) Engineer inspection. Prior to the Township's issuance of a permit
authorizing construction and erection of a tower-based WCF, a
structural engineer registered in Pennsylvania shall issue to the
Township a written certification of the proposed WCF's ability to
meet the structural standards offered by either the Electronic
Industries Association or the Telecommunication Industry
Association and certify the proper construction of the foundation
and the erection of the structure. This certification shall be
provided during the conditional hearings or at a minimum be made
as a condition attached to any approval given such that the
certification be provided prior to issuance of any building permits.
(5) Visual appearance and land use compatibility. Tower-based WCFs
shall employ stealth technology, which may include the tower
portion to be painted silver or another color approved by the
Supervisors, or shall have a galvanized finish. All tower-based
WCFs and related equipment shall be aesthetically and
architecturally compatible with the surrounding environment and
shall maximize the use of a like facade to blend with the existing
surroundings and neighboring buildings to the greatest extent
possible. The Supervisors shall consider whether its decision upon
the subject application will promote the harmonious and orderly
development of the zoning district involved; encourage
compatibility with the character and type of development existing
in the area; benefit neighboring properties by preventing a
negative impact on the aesthetic character of the community;
preserve woodlands and trees existing at the site to the greatest
possible extent; and encourage sound engineering and land

shall demonstrate that the proposed tower-based WCF cannot be
accommodated on an existing or approved structure or building, or
sited on land owned and maintained by Upper Providence
Township. The Supervisors may deny an application to construct a
new tower-based WCF if the WCF applicant has not made a good
faith effort to mount the commercial communications antenna(s) on
an existing structure. The WCF applicant shall demonstrate that it
contacted the owners of tall structures, buildings, and towers
within a radius of 1/4 of a mile of the site proposed, sought
permission to install an antenna on those structures, buildings, and
towers and was denied for one of the following reasons:
(a) The proposed antenna and related equipment would exceed
the structural capacity of the existing building, structure or
tower, and its reinforcement cannot be accomplished at a
reasonable cost.
(b) The proposed antenna and related equipment would cause
radio frequency interference with other existing equipment for
§ 182-21.1 UPPER PROVIDENCE CODE § 182-21.1
176:546
that existing building, structure, or tower and the interference
cannot be prevented at a reasonable cost.
(c) Such existing buildings, structures, or towers do not have
adequate location, space, access, or height to accommodate
the proposed equipment or to allow it to perform its intended
function.
(d) A commercially reasonable agreement could not be reached
with the owner of such building, structure, or tower.
(7) Permit required for modifications. To the extent permissible under
applicable state and federal law, any WCF applicant proposing the
modification of an existing tower-based WCF, which increases the
overall height of such WCF, shall first obtain a permit from the
Township. To the extent permissible under law, nonroutine
modifications shall be prohibited without a permit.
(8) Gap in coverage. A WCF applicant for a tower-based WCF must
demonstrate that a significant gap in wireless coverage or capacity
exists in the applicable area and that the type of WCF being
proposed is the least intrusive means by which to fill that gap in
wireless coverage. The existence or nonexistence of a gap in
wireless coverage or capacity shall be a factor in the Township's
decision on an application for approval of tower-based WCF.
(9) Additional antennas. As a condition of approval for all tower-based
WCFs, the WCF applicant shall provide the Township with a written
commitment that it will allow other service providers to co-locate
antennas on tower-based WCFs where technically and
economically feasible. To the extent permissible under state and
federal law, the owner of a tower-based WCF shall not install any
additional antennas without obtaining the prior written approval of
the Township.

§ 182-25. Statutory authorization; legislative intent.
A. The Legislature of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has, by the
passage of the Pennsylvania Flood Plain Management Act of 1978,132
delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt
floodplain management regulations to promote public health, safety,
and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the Board of Supervisors
of Upper Providence Township does hereby order as follows.
B. In addition to the purpose and statement of community development
objectives found in Article 1, § 182-2, the specific intent of this district
shall be to protect areas of the floodplain subject to and necessary for
the containment of floodwaters and to permit and encourage the
retention of open space land uses which will be so located and utilized
as to constitute a harmonious and appropriate aspect of the continuing
physical development of Upper Providence Township. Furthermore, in
light of the Township's certification as eligible for federal flood
insurance, and to comply with the Pennsylvania Flood Plain
Management Act of 1978, it is the intent of this district to provide
adequate protection for flood-prone properties within Upper
Providence.
C. In advancing these principles and the general purpose of this chapter
and the Comprehensive Plan, the following shall be the specific
objectives of the Floodplain Conservation District:
(1) To combine with present zoning requirements certain restrictions
made necessary for flood-prone areas to promote the general
health, welfare and safety of the Township.
(2) To prevent the erection of structures in areas unfit for human usage
by reason of danger from flooding, unsanitary conditions, or other
hazard.
(3) To minimize the danger to public health by protecting the quality
and quantity of surface and subsurface water supplies adjacent to
and underlying flood hazard areas and promoting safe and sanitary
drainage.
(4) To permit only those uses which can be appropriately located in the
floodplain as herein defined and which will not impede the flow or

storage of floodwaters or otherwise cause danger to life and
property at, above or below their locations along the floodplain.
(5) To protect those individuals who might choose, despite the flood
dangers, to develop or occupy land on a floodplain.
(6) To protect adjacent landowners, and those both upstream and
downstream, from damages resulting from development within a
floodplain and the consequent obstruction or increase in flow of
floodwaters.
(7) To protect the entire Township from individual uses of land which
may have effect upon subsequent expenditures for public works
and disaster relief and adversely affect the economic well-being of
the Township.
(8) To maintain the undisturbed ecological balance between those
natural systems' elements, including wildlife, vegetation and
marine life, dependent upon watercourses and water areas.
(9) To protect other municipalities within the same watershed from the
impact of improper development and the consequent increased
potential for flooding.
(10) To provide areas for the deposition of flood-borne sediment.
(11) To require that uses vulnerable to floods be developed so as to be
protected from flood damage, in accordance with the requirements
of the Federal Flood Insurance Program, P.L. 93-234.133
A. The Floodplain District is defined and established as those areas of the
Township subject to flooding as defined below:

as part of the FIS, for the Township of Upper Providence,
Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, as prepared by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), available at the
Township offices, and effective as of March 2, 2016. All referenced
FIS and FIRMs, and any subsequent revisions and amendments,

cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation by more
than one foot at any point. This term shall also include
floodway areas which have been identified in other available
studies or sources of information for those special flood hazard
areas where no floodway has been identified in the FIS and
FIRM.
[1] Within any floodway area, no encroachments, including
fill, new construction, substantial improvements, or other
development shall be permitted unless it has been
demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
performed in accordance with standard engineering
practice that the proposed encroachment would not result
in any increase in flood levels within the community during
the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
[2] No new construction or development shall be allowed,
unless a permit is obtained from the Department of
Environmental Protection Regional Office.
(b) The AE Area/District shall be those areas identified as an AE
Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for

and floodway information from other federal, state, or other
acceptable source shall be used when available. Where other
acceptable information is not available, the elevation shall be
determined by using the elevation of a point on the boundary
of the Floodplain Conservation District which is nearest the
construction site. In lieu of the above, the municipality may
require the applicant to determine the elevation with
hydrologic and hydraulic engineering techniques. Hydrologic
and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by
professional engineers or others of demonstrated
qualifications, who shall certify that the technical methods

dry up to at least 1 1/2 feet above base flood elevation; and
(b) Designed to prevent pollution from the structure or activity
during the course of a base flood.
(c) Any such structure, or part thereof, that will be built below the
regulatory flood elevation shall be designed and constructed in
accordance with the standards for completely dry
floodproofing contained in the publication Flood-Proofing
Regulations (United States Army Corps of Engineers, June
1972 as amended March 1992), or with some other equivalent
watertight standard.
(5) If a variance for a recreational vehicle is granted, the following
shall apply:

§ 182-33. Additional standard for approval of uses by variance.
A property owner of a lot of record, as of the date of the enactment of this
article, who is able to prove that the strict enforcement of this article would
create undue hardship by denying a reasonable use of an existing lot which
is situated either wholly or partially in the Floodplain Conservation District,
may seek relief by applying for a variance from the Zoning Hearing Board.
§ 182-34. Boundary disputes and appeals procedure.
(6) Whenever a variance is granted, Upper Providence Township shall
notify the applicant in writing that:
(a) The granting of the variance may result in increased premium
rates for flood insurance.
(b) Such variances may increase the risks to life and property.
A. The Zoning Hearing Board, after deciding upon the merits of the
application, may permit the applicant to make some reasonable use of
the property in question, while ensuring that such use will not violate
the basic objectives of this district as specified in § 182-25 herein.
B. In considering a use as a variance, the Zoning Hearing Board shall
consider those standards outlined in § 182-32 herein.
C. Requests for variances shall be considered by the Zoning Hearing
Board in accordance with the following:

Board upon:
(a) A showing of good and sufficient cause;
(b) A determination that failure to grant the appeal would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
(c) A determination that the granting of an appeal will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety or
extraordinary public expense or create nuisances, cause fraud
on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local
laws or ordinances.
(2) Affirmative decisions shall only be issued upon determination that
it is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to
provide relief.
D. Should any variances be issued to permit fully or partially enclosed
spaces below the lowest floor (including basement) for a structure in
the floodplain, the design requirements of Section 60.3(d) of the
National Flood Insurance Program shall be enforced.

§ 182-35. Nonconforming uses or structures.
Following the adoption of this article, any use or structure which is situated
within the boundaries of the Floodplain Conservation District and which
does not conform to the permitted uses specified in § 182-28 herein shall
become a nonconforming use or structure, regardless of its conformance to
the district in which it is located, without consideration of this article.
A. Should a dispute concerning any identified floodplain boundary area
arise, an initial determination shall be made by Upper Providence
Township, and any party aggrieved by this decision or determination
may appeal to the Township Zoning Hearing Board. The burden of proof
shall be on the applicant.
B. Any party aggrieved by the decision of the Zoning Officer as to the
boundaries of the Floodplain Conservation District as defined above,
which may include the grounds that said map referred to therein is or
has become incorrect because of changes due to natural or other
causes or changes indicated by future detailed hydrologic and hydraulic
studies, may appeal to the Zoning Hearing Board as provided in Article
XIV of this chapter and §§ 182-31, 182-32 and 182-33 herein. The
burden of proof in such an appeal shall be on the appellant.
C. Insofar as various natural conditions, including the Floodplain
Conservation District as herein defined, may change, such changes may
be validated by detailed on-site survey techniques approved by the
United States Army Corps of Engineers, Philadelphia District. Whether
a proposed use is within the Floodplain Conservation District shown on
the Floodplain Conservation District Map shall, upon appeal from the
decision of the Zoning Officer, be determined by the Zoning Hearing
Board upon receipt of the findings of the detailed on-site survey by the
petitioner. The Zoning Hearing Board, in addition to other evidence and
standards, may consider the recommendations of the Township
Planning Commission and the validation of the United States Army
Corps of Engineers, Philadelphia District, and/or other municipal
agencies.
D. The Zoning Hearing Board shall request a review and recommendation
of the Soil Conservation Service at least 30 days prior to the public
hearing.
E. All changes to the boundaries of the Floodplain Conservation District
are subject to the review and approval of the Federal Insurance
Administrator.
A. The expansion or continuance of nonconforming use or structure which
is nonconforming with respect to the district in which it is located,
without consideration of this article, shall be governed by the
requirements of Article XXI of this chapter. However, the Zoning
Hearing Board shall ensure that the standards contained in § 182-32
§ 182-34 WATER § 182-35
176:615
§ 182-36. Rebuilding of destroyed structures.
Structures located within the floodplain may be rebuilt if destroyed by fire
or other catastrophe, provided that the reconstruction will not result in an
increase in the base flood elevation, as referenced in the Flood Insurance
Study, Township of Upper Providence. Such reconstruction must be in
compliance with the floodproofing or elevation requirements of this article.
§ 182-37. Municipal liability.
§ 182-38. Interpretation.
This chapter supersedes any other conflicting provisions which may be in
effect in the Floodplain Conservation District. However, any other ordinance
provisions shall remain in full force and effect to the extent that those
provisions are more restrictive. If there is any conflict between any of the
provisions of this chapter, the more restrictive shall apply.
herein are applied to the expansion or continuance of said
nonconforming use or structure.
B. The expansion or continuance of a nonconforming use or structure
which is rendered nonconforming by the adoption of this district shall
be governed by the standards contained in § 182-32 herein. The Zoning
Hearing Board shall ensure that these standards are enforced with
respect to said nonconforming use or structure.
A. The grant of a zoning permit or approval of a subdivision plan in the
Floodplain Conservation District shall not constitute a representation,
guarantee or warranty of any kind by the Township or by any official or
employee thereof of the practicability or safety of the proposed use and
shall create no liability upon the Township or its officials or employees.
B. The degree of flood protection sought by the provisions of this chapter
is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on
acceptable engineering methods of study. Larger floods may occur or
flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes, such as
ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris. This chapter does not
imply that areas outside any identified floodplain areas, or that land
uses permitted within such areas, will be free from flooding or flood
damages.
C. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of Upper Providence
Township or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that
result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision
lawfully made thereunder.

R-1 Residential-Agricultural District
§ 182-39. Legislative intent.
In expansion of the statement of community development objectives
contained in § 182-2 of this chapter, it is hereby declared to be the intent of
this article with respect to R-1 Residential-Agricultural Districts to establish
reasonable standards of performance and to promote the desirable benefits
which agricultural uses and single-family detached dwellings will have in
those areas of Upper Providence Township not presently served by public
sewer and water facilities.
§ 182-40. Permitted uses. [Amended 2-21-1978 by Ord. No. 197]
In an R-1 Residential-Agricultural District, a building may be erected,
altered or used and a lot or premises may be used or occupied for any of the
following uses and no other:
A. Agricultural uses, provided that a tract of not less than five acres is
available and further provided that any building used in the keeping or
raising of livestock or poultry shall be located not less than 100 feet
from an ultimate right-of-way line and not less than 50 feet from any
other property line.139

tower, existing building or other existing structure, and
communications equipment buildings, only upon a showing, in
addition to any other that may be required under this chapter, that
denial of such a special exception would have the effect of
prohibiting the provision of personal wireless service.
Communications towers are not permitted. [Added 6-1-1998 by
Ord. No. 372]

Ord. No. 342; 2-7-2000 by Ord. No. 388]
In cases where development of a tract of land of at least 15 acres is to
be undertaken, the developer shall provide community areas, playgrounds
and tot-lots for the comfort and convenience of the prospective residents
in this district. In this regard, the developer shall provide at least 10%
of the total site area as usable open space. Such open space shall be
governed by the provisions of Article IVA, Open Space and Recreational
Facilities Chapter 154, Subdivision and Land Development. At the discretion
of the Board of Supervisors, the developer may provide a fee in lieu of
dedication as an alternative to setting aside open space. Said fee shall be
provided in accordance with § 154-40.6 of Chapter 154, Subdivision and
Land Development. For development of a tract of fewer than 15 acres,
a fee in lieu of dedication shall be required, also in accordance with the
provisions of § 154-40.6 of Chapter 154, Subdivision and Land
Development.
§ 182-44. Flexible lot sizes. [Added 4-4-1988 by Ord. No. 280]
A. Intent. It is the intent of this section to provide a means of developing
single-family detached dwellings on lots some of which are larger and
some of which are smaller than is otherwise required, incorporating
areas of open space within the development; all lots, when combined,
represent the average lot size of 30,000 square feet as stated herein. It
is further the intent of this option to:
(1) Consolidate otherwise scattered development.
(2) Encourage the creation of internalized development patterns.
(3) Preserve open space through a combination of deed-restricted
easements and consolidation of common areas, similar to the
concept of clustering allowed in other articles of this chapter.
B. Minimum tract size. In order to qualify for subdivision pursuant to this
section, a tract of land shall contain not less than 35 acres in area.
Flexible lotting may be permitted on tracts smaller than 35 acres as a
conditional use when approved by the Board of Supervisors pursuant to
the procedures contained in § 182-204 of this chapter, and provided
that the applicant demonstrates that one or more of the following
criteria are met: [Amended 2-20-2001 by Ord. No. 401]
(1) A significant portion of the tract contains natural features which
would be lost under traditional lotting. Features which would be
considered include, but are not limited to, floodplains, wetlands,
steep slopes, ponds or other water bodies, woodlands, and
hedgerows.
(2) The open space preserved through flexible lotting would preserve
one of the properties, or a portion thereof, as identified in the
§ 182-43 WATER § 182-44
176:623
Township's Open Space and Environmental Resource Protection
Plan (1995) or subsequent amendments thereto, or properties
identified for preservation in the currently adopted Township
Comprehensive Plan. The open space preserved through flexible
lotting could also serve to link open spaces either currently
preserved or identified for preservation in the aforementioned
documents.
(3) An historic farmstead, its ancillary uses and/or buildings or
structures would be preserved and proposed for viable reuse.
(4) The use of flexible lotting would better achieve the Township's
goals for maintaining its rural character than would development
under standard R-1 requirements.
C. Lot size. A minimum lot size of 20,000 square feet and a maximum lot
size of five acres (217,800 square feet) shall be permitted. An overall
average lot size of 30,000 square feet shall be required.
D. Required yard areas. A front yard of at least 40 feet from the ultimate
right-of-way line must be provided. Two side yards of not less than 20
feet each with an aggregate width of 50 feet shall be provided. The rear
yard shall be the normally provided rear yard in an R-1 Residential-
Agricultural District of 50 feet.
E. A lot width of at least 100 feet shall be provided. Section 154-24D of
Chapter 154, Subdivision and Land Development, regarding corner lot
sizes, shall not apply to subdivisions pursuant to this section; provided,
however, that corner lots shall have a minimum width of 125 feet on
each street on which they abut. The maximum building coverage shall
not exceed 15% of the lot.
F. Open space requirements. An open space area of not less than 20% of
the gross land area of the entire tract shall be provided. Such open
space shall be governed by the provisions of Article IVA, Open Space
and Recreational Facilities, of Chapter 154, Subdivision and Land
Development; ownership and maintenance for the open space shall be
governed by the provisions of § 154-40.5 therein. All common open
space shall be reasonably accessible to the residents in the proposed
subdivision. In calculating the open space requirement, excluded from
the gross land area shall be existing rights-of-way for roadways and
utilities. [Amended 8-7-1995 by Ord. No. 342; 6-1-1998 by Ord.
No. 373; 2-20-2001 by Ord. No. 401]
G. Calculation of density. Each site is unique; it has physical features
which are rarely duplicated precisely on another site. Portions of sites
that contain valuable nonreproducible natural resources will be left
protected and undisturbed. The purpose of this section is to determine
the appropriate intensity of use to which a specific tract may be put.
Initially, when applying for the lot-averaging alternative pursuant to
this section, an applicant shall submit a plan accurately delineating
§ 182-44 UPPER PROVIDENCE CODE § 182-44
176:624
woods and tree lines, steep slopes, floodplains and wetlands, as well
as a road and lot layout drawn pursuant to the normal R-1 Residential-
Agricultural District requirements. In addition to any other information
required herein, this plan shall comply in all respects with the
requirements for a tentative sketch plan, pursuant to § 154-11 of
Chapter 154, Subdivision and Land Development, as well as all other
applicable requirements of that chapter and of the Township Zoning
Ordinance. It is the intent of this section to protect the environmentally
sensitive areas as well as the existing character of the Township.
However, the applicant shall be entitled to the total number of dwelling
units permitted pursuant to the R-1 Residential-Agricultural District
regulations. Once the number of dwelling units that is achievable
through the R-1 District has been ascertained through the review of the
submitted plan, then that number of dwelling units may be incorporated
into a plan pursuant to this section. [Amended 6-18-1990 by Ord. No.
299]
H. Further subdivision. Any lot which under the R-1 Residential
Agricultural District would be capable of further subdivision shall not
be included in determining average lot area unless the possibility of
further subdivision is eliminated by deed restriction in a form
acceptable to the Township Solicitor and duly recorded in the office of
the Recorder of Deeds for the County of Montgomery.
I. Sewer and water. Any development pursuant to this cluster
development alternative shall provide public sewers and a centralized
water system.
J. Berms, buffers and large lots. In addition to the preservation of
environmentally sensitive areas, the intent of this section is to preserve
the rural atmosphere of Upper Providence Township. Consequently, any
plan submitted hereunder shall internalize the development, and lots
fronting on all existing public roads must create the impression of a
rural community through the use of large lots, landscaping and/or
berming or any combination of these items. [Amended 12-16-1991 by
Ord. No. 307]
(1) The phrase "large lots" shall be defined as those meeting the
following dimensional criteria:
(a) Minimum lot width at the building line: 200 feet.
(b) Minimum front yard setback: 100 feet.
(c) Minimum lot area: 1.5 acres.
(2) Where residential development other than a large lot, as defined
above, occurs adjacent to any existing roads in the areas deemed
appropriate by the Board of Supervisors, a fifty-foot landscaped
buffer of deciduous and coniferous plant materials shall be
installed, forming a substantially visually impervious buffer at a
minimum height of eight feet at the time of installation and which
§ 182-44 WATER § 182-44
176:625
may be maintained at a minimum height of not less than 15 feet
upon maturity. An earth berm of a minimum height of six feet may
be constructed, in which case the Board of Supervisors may lessen
its requirements for plant materials. The Board of Supervisors may
waive the requirements for buffering if equivalent screening is
provided by parks or by topography or other natural conditions.
Such a buffer area is required to diminish the visual encroachment
of residential development on scenic rural areas and roadways.
(3) Buffer areas shall be measured horizontally and at right angles to
either a straight lot or street lines or the tangent lines of a curved
lot or street lines. No above-surface structure or activity, storage of
materials or parking or vehicles shall be permitted in the buffer
area. All buffer areas shall be planted and maintained with grass or
ground cover, together with a dense screen of trees, shrubs or
other plant materials meeting the following requirements:
(a) Planting plans shall be prepared by a registered landscape
architect and shall be so certified.
(b) Plant materials used in screen planting shall be at least six feet
in height when planted and be of such density as deemed
appropriate for the activities involved. The plant materials
shall be of a species common to the area, be of nursery stock
and shall be free of insects and disease.
(c) Buffer areas shall be permanently maintained, and plant
material which does not live shall be replaced within one year
or one growing season.
(d) The screen planting shall be so placed that at maturity the
plant material will be no closer than three feet from any street
or property lines.
(e) The Board, at its discretion, may consult with a landscape
architect regarding the appropriateness of the landscaping
plan as it relates to the physical characteristics of the site.

ARTICLE VI
R-3 Residential District
§ 182-50. Legislative intent.
In expansion of the statement of community development objectives
contained in § 182-2 of this chapter, it is hereby declared to be the intent of
this Article with respect to R-3 Residential Districts to establish reasonable
controls and standards of performance for single-family, two-family and
townhouse dwellings in those areas of Upper Providence Township where
the existing community character and the presence or planned extension of
sewer and water facilities would most readily accommodate. Furthermore,
it is the intent of this Article to encourage the optional intermixing of twofamily
and townhouse dwellings and/or single-family detached dwellings
on smaller tracts and the required intermixing of at least two of these
dwellings on larger tracts in order to promote a variety of income levels
and life styles within a single, planned development in the Township's
developing neighborhoods, which would have the essential facilities, open
spaces and amenities to support such an intermixing, for the benefit of the
residents of the development and in furtherance of the general welfare of
Upper Providence Township.
§ 182-51. Permitted uses.
In an R-3 Residential District, a building may be erected, altered or used
and a lot may be used or occupied for any of the following uses or a
combination of the following uses and no others:
A. Single-family detached dwellings.
B. Two-family dwellings.
C. Townhouses.
D. Parks, playgrounds, tot-lots and open spaces.
E. Mixed-dwelling-type developments, including a single-family detached
dwelling, two-family dwellings and townhouses or combinations of any
two of these uses in accordance with the requirements of § 182-54
herein.
F. Cluster development, as a conditional use, subject to the provisions of
Article IX and § 182-204. [Amended 9-20-1982 by Ord. No. 231]
G. The following additional conditional uses, when authorized by the
Board of Supervisors, in compliance with § 182-204: [Amended
9-20-1982 by Ord. No. 231]
(1) An indoor recreation facility, community center or similar use,
provided that it is intended solely for the prospective residents of
the development.
§ 182-50 WATER § 182-51
176:631
§ 182-52. District regulations.
The following regulations shall apply in the R-3 Residential District, except
as specifically provided for in § 182-53 herein, concerning townhouse
developments; § 182-54 herein, concerning mixed-dwelling-type
(2) A professional office or studio use in conjunction with a residential
development, provided that such use(s) shall not exceed 10% of the
total floor area of each principal building, unless it is included
within a commercial development as described in Article XII
herein.
(3) Limited, small-scale commercial use(s) such as retail shops and
stores and service businesses intended primarily for the needs of
residents of the development, when proposed in conjunction with a
development plan of at least 50 acres. In no case, however, shall
such uses occupy more than 10% of the total acreage of a proposed
development in the R-3 Residential District, and further provided
that the area proposed for commercial development shall be
subtracted from the area used in calculating the maximum number
of dwelling units proposed for development. All commercial uses
shall comply with the requirements of Article XII, NC
Neighborhood-Convenience Commercial District, of this chapter, as
well as the requirements of the signs and off-street parking and
loading articles of this chapter.

use.
I. Home occupations, provided that all of the requirements of § 182-21.4
herein shall be met. [Added 2-21-1978 by Ord. No. 197; amended
3-15-2004 by Ord. No. 436]
J. A principal use permitted herein, other than a single-family detached or
two-family dwelling owned in fee simple, may be constructed on the
same lot with another permitted principal use(s). [Added 12-16-1991
by Ord. No. 307]
K. As a special exception only, communications antennas, in accordance
with the provisions of § 182-21.1, mounted on an existing public utility
transmission tower, existing building or other existing structure, and
communications equipment buildings only upon a showing, in addition
to any other that may be required under this chapter, that denial of such

relaxed in accordance with § 182-57 herein. The plan shall clearly
designate the proposed use(s) of each area of the tract.
(4) Development stages and permits. The development of a tract
carried out in either a single phase or in stages shall be executed in
accordance with a development agreement. The owner, developer
and Township shall enter into said agreement embodying all details
regarding compliance with this article to assure the binding nature
thereof on the overall tract and its development, which agreement
shall be recorded with the final development plan.
(5) Community impact. The application for development in the R-3
Residential District shall be accompanied by a community impact
statement, prepared by qualified professionals. The purpose of this

facilities may be restricted to the residents of the development,
where practical, and may be maintained by the developer, a
homeowners' association or similar instrument. Any common area
shall be first offered to the Township by the developer; however, the
Township need not accept dedication of the open space but shall
maintain first option to acquire with 12 months' notice, if said open
space shall ever become available.
(7) Lighting facilities. Lighting facilities shall be provided as needed
and arranged in a manner which will protect the highway and
neighboring properties from unreasonable direct glare or
hazardous interference of any kind. Lighting facilities shall be

controls and standards of performance for garden-apartment dwellings in
those areas of Upper Providence Township where the existing community
character, superior highway access, proximity to commercial and
employment centers and the presence or planned extension of sewer and
water facilities would most readily accommodate the highest intensity of
residential dwelling types permitted in the Township, for the benefit of the
residents of the development and in furtherance of the general welfare of
Upper Providence Township.

undeveloped land in the Township.
C. To provide for creative use of land in areas where it is desirable to
preserve open space, stream valleys, agricultural land heritage, tree
cover, historic buildings and other natural and man-made amenities.
D. To allow for a modest increase in permitted density in return for the
preservation of extensive areas of open space and/or parkland.
E. To encourage the creation of individual neighborhoods unified by the
open space features of the development.
F. To permanently protect areas of open space and parkland from future
development, and in so doing, implement the goals and
recommendations of the Township's adopted Open Space and
Recreation Plan.

in locations logical to provide pedestrian movement between
residential areas, between residential areas and parkland and between
parkland and its associated parking lots. Said pedestrian
accommodations shall be encouraged in the common open space areas
and may replace some portions of traditional sidewalk if, in the opinion
of the Township, the pedestrian accommodations satisfy all of the
functions that the traditional sidewalk would serve. For any crossings of
roadways with a feeder or higher classification in accordance with the
Township's Ultimate Right-Of-Way Map, which would be required for
residents to access any parkland, appropriate signals, crosswalks and
other safety devices, as required by the Township, shall be installed. For
such a crossing of a roadway of lesser classification, suitable markings
and signage shall be provided to alert motorists of the crossing.
D. Any change to proposed lots, buildings, circulation, parking, open space
configuration, landscaping or extent of natural features preservation
which is substantive in the opinion of the Board of Supervisors will
necessitate a revised master plan to be submitted, approved and
recorded to replace any prior master plan(s). The Board may permit
modifications, including but not limited to minor modifications to the
layout of residential lots within the same neighborhood or cluster,

ratio of open space provided on the development tract and a tabulation
of the number of dwelling units proposed and tract-wide density which
will result once said units are constructed. Said tabulations shall be
kept current through the most recently approved subdivision and/or
land development. A revised master plan must be recorded
simultaneously with the recording of each subsequently approved
subdivision and/or land development in order that the open space ratio
is continually updated.
F. Phasing of a development in the OSR District is expected due to its
scale. Phasing shall be reflected on the master plan, with changes to the
phasing required to be reflected on a revised master plan. Subdivisions
and/or land developments to implement all or a portion of any phase
shall be processed in accordance with the requirements for the same in
Chapter 154 of the Township Code; their depiction on the master plan is
required once they are approved by the Township.
A. Provisions for the establishment of a homeowners' association(s) or
other similar entity as approved by the Township, with mandatory
membership by the current owner of each dwelling unit represented in
the master plan.
B. Parties to the declaration of restrictive covenants shall be bound by all
restrictions contained therein and shall include, at a minimum,
members of the aforementioned association(s), developer, mortgagees
of any lot and/or building on the tract, any additional legal entity

other similar improvements be prohibited on any lots to be utilized
solely for open space purposes, as indicated on the most currently
approved master plan.
E. Provisions stipulating each lot owner/resident's rights with respect to
common areas.
F. Any additional restrictions which will be applied to the development
which are stricter than existing Township regulations.
G. Any change to cross easements, maintenance responsibilities or other
applicable restrictions which is substantive in the opinion of the Board
of Supervisors will necessitate an amendment to the declaration of
restrictive covenants to be submitted, approved and recorded to
replace any prior such document. No subdivision or land development

development meets the criteria specified in § 182-63.20 of this article, and
that the procedural requirements for conditional uses, set forth in § 182-204
of this chapter, are followed. An "age-restricted residential community"
shall be construed to mean a planned development consisting of residential
use(s) as permitted herein, along with recreational and community uses
incidental to such a development, as hereinafter provided.
A. To recognize housing needs for residents as they get older and life-style
preferences changes.
B. To provide for developments consistent with the provisions of the
Federal Fair Housing Act amendments of 1988, or as subsequently
amended.

regarding compliance with this article to assure the binding nature
thereof on the overall tract and its development, which agreement shall
be recorded with the final development plan for the tract, or phases(s)
or portion(s) thereof, as appropriate. Should any final plans be amended
subsequent to original recording, an approved amended final plan shall
be recorded, together with an amended development agreement, as
necessary.
A. Density. The maximum density for development pursuant to this article
shall be 2.5 dwelling units per developable acre. A density increase of
up to .25 dwelling unit per developable acre may be permitted as a
conditional use by the Board of Supervisors (for a potential maximum of
2.75 dwelling units per developable acre) in the event a minimum of
10% additional open space, above and beyond that which is required by
§ 182-63.22C herein, is provided. Regardless of the proposed ownership
of the by right required open space, said additional open space shall be
offered for dedication to the Township, which shall have the discretion
to accept or reject the offer. In the computation of density, whether by
right or as a conditional use, the number of units shall be rounded down
to the nearest whole number. Compliance with the standards in this
article does not guarantee that the maximum number of dwelling units
will be achievable in all cases. The applicant's ability to develop the
maximum number may be reduced as a result of the applicant's choices
of dwelling types, building and/or lot sizes, physical constraints of the
development site, or other factors.
B. Lotting exclusion. In order to allow the maximum flexibility in site
design and ownership arrangements, lotting is not required in any
development built pursuant to this article, nor is any minimum lot size.
However, in cases wherein lots are not utilized, however:

dedication to and accepted by the Township, shall be maintained by
a homeowners' association or similar entity, as approved by the
Township Board of Supervisors.
D. Access restriction. No dwelling unit within the age-restricted
residential community may take access directly from any road with a
feeder or higher classification, regardless of whether said road is
existing or proposed. All dwelling units shall gain access from
residential roads, internal access roads, drives, courts, or similar
arrangements.
E. Public road and property boundary setback. There shall be a minimum
setback to any lot line or equivalent lot line of 50 feet from the ultimate
right-of-way of any existing frontage roadway or proposed public road
of feeder or higher classification and from any property boundary of an
age-restricted residential development.
F. Other building setbacks. In addition to those prescribed in other

§ 182-64. Legislative intent.
In expansion of the statement of community development objectives
contained in § 182-2 of this chapter, it is hereby declared to be the intent
of this article with respect to VP Village Preservation Districts to encourage
the preservation of the existing character and residential life-styles of the
Mont Clare portions of Upper Providence Township which exhibit a mixture
of single-family detached and two-family dwellings on smaller lot sizes
than those found throughout the Township. Furthermore, it is the intent
of this district to guide the future development or redevelopment of these
neighborhoods in the Township by providing strict control of conversions
to multiple-family dwellings, home occupations and the introduction of
incompatible uses or activities within the designated Village Preservation
Districts in order to preserve and enhance their present character and,
thus, avoid rapid deterioration or transition to the detriment of the local
residents and the general welfare of Upper Providence Township.
§ 182-65. Permitted uses.
In a VP District, a building may be erected, altered or used and a lot may be
used or occupied for any of the following uses and no other:
A. Single-family detached dwellings.
B. Two-family dwellings (twins and duplexes).
C. The following uses when authorized as a special exception:
(1) Home occupations, except that a clinic, barbershop, beauty parlor,
tearoom, tourist home, animal hospital or any similar use shall not
be deemed to be a home occupation and that no goods shall be
publicly displayed on the premises.
(2) Conversions of residential structures. The conversion of a singlefamily
dwelling or other building into a dwelling for two or more
families, subject to the following requirements:
(a) Each dwelling unit shall not have less than 600 square feet of
floor area, plus an additional 100 square feet of floor area for
each additional bedroom in excess of one.
(b) The lot area per family may not be reduced to an amount less
than 33% of that required by this article.
(c) No more than three families shall be permitted to occupy such
buildings.
(d) The off-street parking requirements of this chapter shall be
met.
§ 182-64 WATER § 182-65
176:709
§ 182-66. Development regulations.
The following regulations shall apply in the VP District:
(e) The conversion shall be authorized only for a large dwelling
with relatively little economic usefulness as a conforming use.
(f) The Zoning Hearing Board may prescribe such further
conditions and restrictions as they may consider appropriate to
preserve the character of the surrounding neighborhood.
D. Accessory uses on the same lot with and customarily incidental to any
permitted use.
E. As a special exception only, communications antennas, in accordance
with the provisions of § 182-21.1, mounted on an existing public utility
transmission tower, existing building or other existing structure, and
communications equipment buildings only upon a showing, in addition
to any other that may be required under this chapter that denial of such
a special exception would have the effect of prohibiting the provision of

CL Cluster Development District
§ 182-67. Legislative intent.
In expansion of the statement of community development objectives
contained in § 182-2 of this chapter, it is hereby declared to be the intent of
this article with respect to CL Cluster Development Districts to encourage a
creative approach to the use of land, the creation of usable open space areas
throughout the Township and more efficient development patterns in terms
of roads and utilities, where applied for as a conditional use to the Board of
Supervisors. Specifically, this article is intended to provide for a variation in
the normally required lot sizes for single-family detached dwellings in the
R-2 and R-3 Residential Districts, so that the present permitted densities of
dwelling units contemplated by the minimum lot sizes prescribed therefor
are maintained on an overall basis, and desirable open space, tree cover,
historic sites, recreation areas, scenic vistas, stream valleys or other lands
for public purposes are preserved within these developments for the benefit
of the residents of the development and in furtherance of the general
welfare of Upper Providence Township.
§ 182-68. Prerequisites for cluster development.
The following necessary conditions must be satisfied by an applicant
seeking to develop in a clustered fashion before the Board of Supervisors
will grant a preliminary plan approval for a subdivision plan prepared in
accordance with the requirements of this article.
A. Tract size. The tract of land to be developed shall not be less than 25
acres in area.
B. Ownership. The tract of land to be developed shall be in one ownership
or shall be the subject of an application filed jointly by the owners of the
entire tract, and it shall be agreed that the tract will be developed
under single direction in accordance with an approved plan.
C. Natural and man-made amenities. At least 15% of the gross land area of
the tract to be subdivided must contain any one or combination of the
following natural and manmade amenities:
(1) A floodplain, as defined in Article III. [Amended 12-16-1991 by
Ord. No. 307]
(2) Slopes of 15% or greater, as defined in Article XV.
(3) Mature permanent vegetation.
(4) Other natural features of irreplacable value.
(5) Historic sites, as identified by the Montgomery County Resource
Protection Plan, or other sites supported by appropriate
documentation or endorsement of local historic societies.

§ 182-69. Application of cluster development concept. [Amended
2-21-1978 by Ord. No. 197; 9-2-1982 by Ord. No. 231]
Following the review and recommendations of the Township Planning
Commission and according to the procedures outlined in § 182-204, the
Board of Supervisors may:
(6) Land suitable for active recreational use, located adjacent to and as
an integral part of the features of the site detailed in Subsection
C(1) through (5) above.
D. Sewer and water facilities. The cluster development shall be served by
centralized water facilities and public sewer facilities, which may
include capped sewers, deemed acceptable by the Board of
Supervisors, upon recommendation of the Township Engineer.
E. Development plan. The application for development shall be
accompanied by a plan or plans in accordance with § 182-71 showing
the detailed use of the entire tract, which plan or plans shall also
comply with all requirements of Chapter 154, Subdivision and Land
Development, and other applicable ordinances, unless these
requirements are relaxed in accordance with § 182-69H. The plan shall
clearly designate the proposed use of each area of the tract.
F. Development stages and permits. The development of a tract carried
out in either a single phase or in stages shall be executed in accordance
with a development agreement. The owner, developer and Township
shall enter into said agreement embodying all details regarding
compliance with this article to assure the binding nature thereof on the
overall tract and its development, which agreement shall be recorded
with the final development plan.
A. Authorize a reduction of not less than 10% and not more than 20% in
the required lot area per single-family detached dwelling in the R-2
Residential District when both capped sewers are installed by the
developer and public water facilities are available, a reduction of not
less than 20% and not more than 30% in the required lot area per
single-family detached dwelling in the R-2 Residential District when
both public sewer and water facilities are available and a reduction of
not less than 10% in the required lot area per single-family detached
dwelling in the R-3 Residential District when both public sewer and
water facilities are available. The totals, shall be 15% and 25%,
respectively, while the total average reduction for R-3 Residential
Districts shall be 15%.
B. The number of dwelling units permitted by utilizing the provisions of
this article shall be determined by the procedure set forth in § 182-71B
herein.
C. Permit modification of the yard and other area requirements of the R-2
and R-3 Residential Districts, provided that in no case shall a building
§ 182-68 UPPER PROVIDENCE CODE § 182-69
176:714
be located less than 25 feet or 20 feet from the ultimate right-of-way
line in accordance with the respective required lot areas in the R-2
Residential District, and in no case shall a building be located less
than 20 feet from the ultimate right-of-way line in the R-3 Residential
District.
D. Permit modification of the required side yards as follows: Each building
shall have two side yards of not less than seven feet in the R-2 and R-3
Residential Districts, but the aggregate width of the side yards shall not
be less than 30 feet and 25 feet in accordance with the respective
required lot areas in the R-2 and R-3 Residential Districts.
E. No reduction in the required rear yard shall be allowed in either
district.
F. Permit modifications of the lot width requirements of not more than
30% and 25% in accordance with the respective lot sizes in the R-2
Residential District and not more than 25% in the R-3 Residential
District. Properties abutting a cul-de-sac or curvilinear street shall have
a width at the ultimate right-of-way line of not less than 50 feet in the
R-2 Residential District and not less than 40 feet in the R-3 Residential
District.
G. Permit an increase of the maximum building coverage in the R-2
Residential District to 20% and 25% in accordance with the respective
lot sizes in the R-2 Residential District and 30% in the R-3 Residential
District.
H. Permit modification of Chapter 154, Subdivision and Land
Development, and/or this chapter as follows: The uniqueness of each
proposal for cluster development may require that the specifications for
the width and surfacing of roads, alleys, ways for public utilities, curbs,
gutters, sidewalks, streetlights, stormwater drainage, water supply and
sewage collection shall be subject to modification from the
specifications established in other provisions of said chapters. The
Board of Supervisors may, therefore, waive or modify the specifications
otherwise applicable for a particular aspect of a cluster development,
where the Board finds that such specifications are not required in the
interest of the residents of the cluster development and that the
modification of such specifications will not be inconsistent with the
interest of the entire Township. Proposed specifications and standards
that are inconsistent with those required under prevailing Township
regulatory codes shall be reviewed by the Township Engineer.
I. A summary of the normal requirements of applicable sections of the R-2
and R-3 Residential Districts is included in the following table. A
summary of the clustering modifications which may be authorized by
this section is also included.146

Transfer of Development Rights District
[Added 12-15-2008 by Ord. No. 495]
§ 182-71.1. Legislative intent.
In expansion of the community development objectives contained in Article
I, § 182-2 of this chapter, it is hereby declared that the intent of this
article with respect to the TDR Transfer of Development Rights District to
establish reasonable standards and criteria to protect unique and valuable
environmental features and preserve areas identified through Township
plans as important open space. It shall be further the intent of this District:
§ 182-71.2. Statutory authority; conditional use requirement.
§ 182-71.3. Establishment of sending and receiving districts.
A. To preserve such lands entirely within the R-1 Residential Agricultural
District (R-1) and the R-2 Residential District (R-2), or other areas
consistent with the recommendations of the Township's Comprehensive
Plan and Open Space and Environmental Resource Protection Plan, and
to ensure that lands are preserved for such use for the future.
B. To reduce the negative impacts of suburbanization and sprawl within
the receiving districts.
C. To protect property rights by allowing landowners whose immediately
developable land, without the need for remediation, is intended for
preservation to transfer their rights to develop to other areas of the
Township deemed more appropriate for development based upon the
availability of community facilities and infrastructure.
A. This district is enacted pursuant to the authority granted by Sections
603(c)(2.2) and 619.1 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning
Code, under the terms of which development rights are acknowledged
to be severable and separately conveyable from a sending area to a
receiving area.
B. A conditional use approval, pursuant to the regulations herein and the
procedural requirements of § 182-204 of this chapter, shall be
prerequisite to the use of the transfer of development rights option.
A. The R-1 and R-2 Districts shall be the sending district for the purposes
of the TDR program. Parcels shall be entirely within either one or both
of these districts.
B. Sending tract.
(1) A sending area tract shall comply with at least one of the following
requirements:
§ 182-71.1 WATER § 182-71.3
176:719
§ 182-71.4. Use regulations.
(a) The sending area tract shall be identified within the Township's
most recently amended Open Space and Environmental
Resource Protection Plan. Such parcels shall either be located
in designated preservation areas or be an individual parcel
recommended for preservation.
(b) The property has at least a portion of any boundary along the
banks of the Schuylkill River or Perkiomen Creek.
(c) More than 33% of the site shall contain wetlands, steep slopes,
floodplains, native woodlands worthy of protection, as
determined by the Township, or a combination of such
features. Such constraints shall be accurately delineated in the
required sending area yield plan based on documented source
material.
(d) An established agricultural operation shall be occurring on at
least 85% of the site; this specifically excludes those operations
which are considered commercial composting by industry
standards (i.e., 500 cubic yards throughput per annum);
composting which is accessory to an on-site agricultural
operation need not be excluded. If a site with a composting
operation meeting these standards is remediated to the
satisfaction of the Township Engineer or other appointed
Environmental Professional, the site can then be reevaluated
by the Township as a potential sending site.
(2) Determination as to the qualifications of any tract as a sending area
tract based on the criteria contained herein shall rest solely with
the Township.
C. The maximum number of transferable development rights available to
owners of eligible lots shall be determined by submission of a yield
plan, drawn pursuant to the requirements § 182-44G of this chapter,
and approved by the Township. Any fractional yield shall be rounded
down to the next whole number.
D. A development right shall be transferable (by sale or otherwise) only to
qualifying properties within the following receiving districts: R-1 and
R-2 Districts pursuant to the requirements of § 182-71.5A.
A. Land from which TDRs have been sold may be used only for the
following purpose:
(1) Permanent preservation of open space or agricultural land by
appropriate deed restriction or legal mechanism acceptable by the
Township. Prior to determining the ownership of the property to be
preserved (restricted), the applicant may offer it for dedication to
the Township. In deciding whether or not to accept any public open
space, the Board of Supervisors may obtain the recommendation of
§ 182-71.3 UPPER PROVIDENCE CODE § 182-71.4
176:720
the Parks and Recreation Board, Planning Commission, or
Township staff. Any preserved property, if not to be accepted for
dedication by the Township, shall be maintained in the same
manner as it was prior to the transfer of development rights or in a
manner acceptable to the Township. This land can be managed by a
homeowners' association, a recognized conservation organization,
the landowner severing his/her rights, or other group as approved
by the Township, once the mechanism for conservation is in place.
If the managing organization is a homeowners' association, the
organization and governing documents must adequately provide
for the preservation and conservation of the land to the satisfaction
of the Township.
B. Transfer of development rights.
(1) The transferor may transfer only up to the number of lots indicated
on the approved yield plan drawn pursuant to the requirement of
§ 182-71.3C herein to an appropriate R-1 or R-2 property as defined
in § 182-71.5A herein. If only a portion of the lots based on the yield
plan are transferred, the remaining land may be developed
pursuant to applicable zoning standards and subject to all other
applicable regulations of this chapter and of Chapter 154,
Subdivision and Land Development, or as open space, agricultural
land, in the same state as prior to the transfer of development
rights, or in a manner agreeable to the Township; provided,
however, that a minimum of 50% of the sending tract must be
restricted from future development as the result of utilizing
transfer of development rights.
(2) All parties involved in any transfer of development rights
conditional use application must submit with that application a
statement of ownership or equitable ownership of the receiving
parcel and a letter of agreement from the transferor to sell
development rights from the sending parcel.
(3) No TDRs created by this article shall be transferable beyond the
boundaries of Upper Providence Township.
(4) TDRs may only be transferred to a qualifying tract as defined in
§ 182-71.5A herein, unless the Township purchases or accepts
them in accordance with the provisions of Subsection B(5) herein.
(5) The Township may purchase development rights, may accept
ownership of development rights through transfer by gift, and may
resell or retire development rights. If they are resold, they must be
resold in accordance with all applicable provisions of this article.
(6) If a single-family home and/or farmstead remains on a sending tract
after the transfer of development rights transaction has been
completed, the owner will retain all rights for that singledevelopment
unit; this will include the ability to build farm related
buildings, including and similar to: storage buildings, barns, silos,
§ 182-71.4 WATER § 182-71.4
176:721
animal coops/pens, and other out-buildings typical to residential or
farm development, as long as all development complies with the
applicable zoning standards.
(7) Nothing within this article is meant to preclude the county,
commonwealth, or other conservation organization from
purchasing the development rights from any tract within the
Township and holding them in perpetuity.
C. Severance of transferable development rights.
(1) Transferable development rights which have been permanently
severed shall be conveyed by a deed of transferable development
rights duly recorded in the office of the Recorder of Deeds in and
for Montgomery County. The deed of transferable development
rights shall specify the tract or tracts of land within eligible
receiving area(s) to which the rights shall be permanently attached
or that the rights shall be transferred to the Township, retained by
the transferor, in gross. Such deeds of transferable development
rights shall be suitable in form and in substance to the Township
Solicitor.
(2) The deed of transferable development rights which severs the
development rights from the sending area tract(s) shall be
accompanied by appropriate legal instrument, as provided in
§ 182-71.4A(1), in a form and substance acceptable to the Township
Solicitor and subsequently will be recorded in the office of the
Recorder of Deeds in Montgomery County.
(3) All deeds of transferable development rights shall be accompanied
by a title report for the sending area tract(s). Such title report shall
be prepared within 10 days prior to submission of the deed of
transferable development rights and shall be suitable in form and
in substance to the Township Solicitor.
(4) If less than all of the development rights eligible for transfer
hereunder are to be transferred, the applicant and/or sending area
landowner shall indicate in the deed of transferable development
rights the disposition of any retained development rights.
D. Sending area conservation restrictions.
(1) Final plan approval for any plan utilizing transferred development
rights shall be conditioned upon the recording of the deed of
transferable development rights and the restrictive covenant(s) or
conservation easement in the office of the Recorder of Deeds in and
for Montgomery County.
(2) If the owner of the sending tract is not retaining the parcel, the
restrictive covenant(s), deed restriction, or conservation easement
shall designate the Township, a bona fide conservation organization
§ 182-71.4 UPPER PROVIDENCE CODE § 182-71.4
176:722
§ 182-71.5. Development regulations.
acceptable to the Township or homeowners' association, at the
Township's sole discretion, as the beneficiary or grantee.
(3) The restrictive covenant(s), deed restriction, or conservation
easement shall apply to the sending area tract(s) from which
development rights are sold and shall specify the number of
development rights so severed as well as any to be retained. No
portion of the sending area tract(s) used to calculate the number of
development rights which shall be severed shall be used to satisfy
minimum yard setbacks, lot area or any other area and bulk
requirements for any development rights which are to be retained
for any other future development.
(4) All owners from the tract(s) from which development rights are
severed shall execute the deed of transferable development rights
and any restrictive covenant(s) or conservation easement. All lien
holders of the tract from which development rights are severed
shall execute a joinder and/or consent to the deed, restrictive
covenant(s) and/or conservation easement.
A. Standards for single-family detached residential development using
TDRs. TDRs may be utilized only for the development of single-family
detached dwellings. A single-family detached residential development
utilizing TDRs shall be known as a "subdivision with transferable
development rights."
(1) Development rights previously severed or land previously
restricted from development by covenant or deed restriction are
not eligible for severance and transfer and shall be subtracted from
any applicable TDR calculations.
(2) Tracts eligible for receiving TDRs must be at least seven acres in
area and shall be located entirely within one or both of the R-1 or
R-2 Districts.
(3) The receiving tract must have direct access to a feeder or higher
classification roadway as defined by the Township's adopted
Ultimate Right-Of-Way Ordinance and Map.
(4) At least some portion of the perimeter of the receiving tract shall be
adjacent to a commercial, office, or industrial district or be
adjacent to a R-3 or R-4 District or a residential development with
an average lot size of 30,000 square feet or less.
(5) The receiving area tract shall not be identified within the
Township's most recently amended Open Space and Environmental
Resource Protection Plan, as located in designated preservation
areas therein as interpreted by the Township, nor shall it be an
individual parcel recommended for preservation, or be a property
fronting the Schuylkill River or Perkiomen Creek.
§ 182-71.4 WATER § 182-71.5
176:723
(6) At least 85% of the receiving tract shall be free of environmental
constraints, including steep slopes, woodlands, floodplains, and
wetlands or other features which would preclude more intensive
development than the traditional existing zoning without benefit of
TDR.
(7) If any side of the TDR subdivision is adjacent to a residential
district or use with lots of 30,000 square feet or greater and/or a
vacant, developable parcel, a Buffer Type 2, as described in
§ 154-36D(5)(c) of Chapter 154, Subdivision and Land
Development, shall be required.
(8) Where the boundary of the tract proposed for development of a
TDR subdivision abuts a tract zoned and/or used for nonresidential
purposes, a Buffer Type 3 pursuant to § 154-36D(5)(e) of Chapter
154, Subdivision and Land Development, is required. However, a
fifteen-foot buffer with plants and proportional requirements
associated with a Buffer Type 2, pursuant to § 154-36D(5)(c) of
Chapter 154, Subdivision and Land Development, may be used
instead if the applicant chooses to provide a solid fence along the
portion of the common boundary line which is adjacent to the
above-mentioned districts and/or uses.
(9) Houses in a TDR subdivision that are not otherwise subject to
specified buffers within this section shall be set back a minimum of
30 feet from adjacent properties not part of a subdivision with
transferable development rights.
(10) All required buffer areas shall be maintained by a homeowners'
association or other group as approved by the Township.
(11) The maximum number of lots which may developed on a qualifying
receiving tract shall be the sum of the number of lots identified
through the yield plan for the receiving tract [reference:
§ 182-71.5A(13) herein], plus the number of lots to be transferred
to the receiving parcel, in addition to a number equal to no more
than 20% of lots to be transferred to the receiving tract.
(a) Should it not be possible to construct all of the lots to be
transferred from a sending tract to a single qualifying
receiving tract, said lots may be distributed among two or
more qualifying receiving tracts. Any fractional yield shall be
rounded down to the next whole number.
(b) Compliance with the standards in this article does not
guarantee that the maximum number of dwelling units will be
achievable in all cases. The applicant's ability to develop the
maximum number may be reduced as a result of the applicant's
choices of dwelling types, building and/or lot sizes, physical
constraints of the development site, or other factors.
§ 182-71.5 UPPER PROVIDENCE CODE § 182-71.5
176:724
§ 182-71.6. Dimensional regulations.
(12) Tracts eligible for receiving TDRs must be serviced by public sewer
and public water.
(13) To determine the maximum number of lots which could be
permitted on a receiving tract prior to the addition of transferred
development rights, a yield plan of the tract must be submitted
using standard existing zoning requirements, drawn pursuant to
the requirements of § 182-44G of this chapter, and approved by the
Township.
B. All single-family detached dwellings proposed for construction in a
subdivision with transferable development rights shall follow the design
guidelines in § 154-36.4 of Chapter 54, Subdivision and Land
Development.

MH Mobile Home Development District
[Added 12-10-1979 by Ord. No. 209]
§ 182-72. Legislative intent.
§ 182-73. Use regulations.
Mobile home developments are allowed only as a conditional use in the R-3
Residential District, provided that the tract to be used as a mobile home
development meets the criteria specified in § 182-74B of this article. The
uses which are permissible in a mobile home development are as follows:
A. In addition to the statement of community development objectives set
forth in § 182-2 of this chapter, it is hereby declared to be the specific
intent of this article with respect to the MH Mobile Home Development
District to establish standards of performance and promote the
desirable benefits which planned mobile home developments may have
upon the community and the residents within them. It is further the
intent of this article to ensure the interdependency and compatibility of
proposed mobile home developments with essential utilities and
surrounding land uses in the Township.
B. It shall further be the intent of this district to:
(1) Reflect the changes in the technology of home building and land
development so that resulting economies may inure to the benefit
of those who need homes.
(2) Further the general welfare by extending greater opportunities for
better and more affordable housing to all present and prospective
residents of Upper Providence Township.
(3) Provide for better quality and greater variety in type, design and
layout of mobile home developments than has been evident in many
mobile home parks in the past by enforcing uniform standards,
desirable design criteria and encouraging innovative site design
approaches.
(4) Provide for a diversity in housing types and prices.
(5) Encourage mobile home developments that are beneficial rather
than detrimental to property values and the general welfare of the
area in which they are proposed.
A. Residential uses. A mobile home development may include mobile
homes of single width or multiple width or both, single-family detached
modular homes, conventionally built single-family detached homes or
any combination thereof, but shall not include travel trailers or motor
homes. No more than 40% of the total number of dwelling units in a
mobile home development may be conventionally built or modular
single-family detached dwellings. No mobile or modular home may be
§ 182-72 WATER § 182-73
176:727
occupied before furnishing the Township a copy of the Structural
Engineering Bulletin(s) indicating approval by the United States
Department of Housing and Urban Development of the dwelling or the
components of the dwelling.
B. Areas for nonresidential uses.
(1) No part of any mobile home development shall be used for
nonresidential purposes, except such uses that are required for the
direct servicing, recreation and well-being of the residents and for
the management and maintenance of the development and are not
otherwise prohibited by any provisions of this article; provided,
however, that a convenience commercial center may be allowed by
the governing body if no similar use exists or is actively proposed
within one mile of the mobile home development by accessway
available for use by the general public, and the applicant
demonstrates to the governing body's satisfaction through a
market study that such use is justifiable and will be supported
primarily by the residents of the mobile home development; such
market study shall be conducted using the standards outlined in
§ 182-89A. No such commercial center shall be opened until at
least 50% of the dwelling units in the mobile home development are
occupied. Signs, parking requirements and similar factors shall be
controlled by the same regulations that apply to commercial uses
located in other zones in the Township. In addition, the maximum
number of residential dwelling units permitted on the tract shall be
reduced by one for each 8,000 square feet of land or a part thereof
devoted to the convenience commercial center.
(2) Nothing in this article shall be deemed as prohibiting the rental,
sale or resale of a mobile home located on a mobile home stand and
connected to the pertinent utilities. Similarly, a model or display
area is permissible on a temporary basis provided those models are
developed in accordance with all applicable regulations of this
article and other applicable ordinances and the use of the models
for sales or rental promotion ceases when the project is fully
developed.
C. Accessory uses.
(1) Accessory uses and structures customarily incidental to the
maintenance, servicing and well-being of mobile home
development residents shall be permitted only as part of an
approved development plan for the site.
(2) Accessory uses on individual mobile home lots, customarily
incidental to mobile homes or other dwellings, such as storage
sheds, shall be permitted on the individual mobile home lots,
provided that the provisions of §§ 182-76 and 182-77 and other
applicable ordinances are complied with.
§ 182-73 UPPER PROVIDENCE CODE § 182-73
176:728
§ 182-74. Conditional uses.
(3) Added rooms specifically designed by the mobile home
manufacturers for the enlargement of mobile homes and other
additions architecturally compatible with the unit may be joined
onto a mobile home, provided that all requirements of § 182-77 and
other applicable ordinances are met.
D. No-impact home-based businesses shall be permitted by right in an MH
District in accordance with the standards set forth in § 182-21.3 herein.
[Added 3-15-2004 by Ord. No. 436]
A. Procedure.
(1) Conditional use application. Any conditional use application shall
be processed in conformance with Article XXIV, § 182-204A, of this
chapter.
(2) Public hearing. A public hearing shall be held in compliance with
Article XXIV, § 182-204B, of this chapter.
(3) Development plan. If conditional use approval is granted for the
use of a tract of land for a mobile home development, within three
years after the date of conditional use approval, the development
plan shall be submitted and then processed and acted upon by the
normal procedures established in Chapter 154, Subdivision and
Land Development, for all other subdivision and/or land
development plans. If development plans are not submitted within
the specified time period, the conditional approval is voided.
B. Criteria. A mobile home development may be allowed by the governing
body as a conditional use in the R-3 Residential District only pursuant to
the procedure specified in § 182-74A and subject to the following
standards. The burden of proving compliance with these standards
shall be on the applicant.
(1) The tract of land to be developed shall be in one ownership or shall
be the subject of an application filed by the owners of the entire
tract, and it shall be agreed that the tract shall be developed under
single direction and in the manner approved.
(2) Any parcel to be used as a mobile home development must have a
minimum tract area of 15 contiguous acres of land.
(3) At least 50% of the site must be composed of developable land as
defined in this chapter.
(4) Any site proposed for a mobile home development shall not be
subject to adverse environmental influence such as swamps,
marshes, garbage or rubbish disposal areas or other potential
breeding places for insects or rodents.
§ 182-73 WATER § 182-74
176:729
(5) Any site proposed for a mobile home development shall not be
subject to any hazard or nuisance such as excessive noise,
vibration, smoke, toxic matter, radiation, heat, odor or glare, as
defined by the governing body and all appropriate ordinances.
(6) The location of all mobile home developments shall be protected by
screening or other appropriate means against any undesirable offsite
views or any adverse influence, such as heavy commercial or
industrial use, heavy traffic or brightly lighted activities, from
adjoining streets and areas.
(7) Mobile home developments shall not be located directly abutting
conventionally built single-family detached housing or significantly
different unit value and density than the proposed mobile homes,
except where extensive natural buffering exists and will be
retained or can be created so as to functionally and visually
separate the two sites or where compatible units of modular or
conventionally built homes will be located in the mobile home
development adjacent to the existing residences. The developer
shall provide any necessary transition between differing residential
structural types, unit values and densities within the mobile home
development tract.
(8) Any site proposed for a mobile home park shall, in the opinion of
the governing body, be easily accessible to essential community
facilities and services, such as employment centers, shopping
centers, schools and police and fire protection. [Amended
10-17-1994 by Ord. No. 329]
(9) Every area to be used as mobile home park must be served
exclusively by the municipal sanitary waste disposal system and a
centralized water supply system, if those facilities are available
within 2,500 feet of any point on the boundary of the mobile home
park tract, and if each system is found to contain the available
capacity to serve the proposed development, or, alternately, the
area to be used as a mobile home development must, if it cannot
connect to either or both the centralized water supply and
municipal sanitary sewer systems, be served by a common single
water supply system serving all dwelling units and other structures
in the development and/or a common single sanitary sewer system
doing likewise, either or both of which, as applicable, must have
the approval of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Protection. Furthermore, those on-site facilities must, when
constructed, meet the following criteria: [Amended 10-17-1994
by Ord. No. 329; 6-2-2008 by Ord. No. 490; 6-2-2008 by Ord.
No. 490]
(a) The satellite system shall be designed and constructed in a
manner that will permit adequate connection to the centralized
or public system in the future.
§ 182-74 UPPER PROVIDENCE CODE § 182-74
176:730
(b) The administrative structure for the satellite system shall be
organized in a manner that will facilitate easy interconnection
of the two systems.
(c) The developer shall be required to show proof that the satellite
system intended to serve the proposed development will not
interfere with any existing sewage disposal system or any
existing water supplies, be they wells for nearby properties or
sources of water for other community systems.
(d) At such time as the centralized or public system is constructed
to be within 2,500 feet of any point on the boundary of the
mobile home park tract, connection to it shall be mandatory,
and the cost of the eventual interconnection shall be borne by
the developer or the organization that is set up to own and
operate the satellite system.
(e) If after development occurs, the satellite water system is
deemed to be the cause of interference with existing water
supplies or the satellite sewer system is deemed to be the
cause of any pollution, extension of the centralized or public
systems may be required at that time. The cost of the extension
and hookup shall be borne by the developer or organization
owning and operating the satellite system.
(10) Any tract intended for a mobile home development must have
direct access to a feeder road (or a road of a higher classification),
as defined by Article IV of Chapter 151, Streets and Sidewalks,
which the Township governing body deems capable of
accommodating the transport of mobile home units, upon
recommendation of the Township Engineer. Plans evidencing the
provision for safe and effective ingress and egress to and from the
public streets and highways servicing the Mobile Home
Development District, without causing undue confusion or
interference with the normal traffic flow, shall be submitted to the
Township governing body and must be approved by the Township
Engineer, who shall make the determination based on the adequacy
of the thoroughfare to carry the additional traffic generated by the
mobile home development.
(11) The applicant shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the municipal
governing body that he has complied with or will comply with all
requirements of Chapter 179 of Title 25, Part I, Subpart D, Article
II, of the Rules and Regulations of the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection and with all other pertinent regulations
of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania which are applicable to
mobile home parks. [Amended 6-2-2008 by Ord. No. 490]
§ 182-74 WATER § 182-75
176:731
§ 182-75. Density.
The total number of lots in a mobile home development shall not exceed
a maximum density of five per developable acre. All area not contained
in developable acreage as defined in this chapter shall be excluded from
density calculations. If for any reasons this maximum density is not
attainable on a particular tract due to the need to conform to the
requirements of §§ 182-77K and 182-78, the maximum permissible density
shall be reduced accordingly.
§ 182-76. Site design for conventionally built and modular homes.
§ 182-77. Site design for mobile homes.
A. The lot size required under the R-3 Residential District may be reduced
a maximum of 20% for lots which will be used for modular homes or
conventionally built single-family detached homes located within the
mobile home development. In addition, lot widths and setbacks may be
reduced for these lots in conformance with the Cluster District's
requirements (Article IX) for the R-3 District; specifically, the permitted
standards are as follows:
(1) Maximum lot width reduction: 25%.
(2) Minimum lot width at right-of-way line: 40 feet.
(3) Minimum front yard: 20 feet.
(4) Side yards.
(a) Minimum one side: seven feet.
(b) Minimum total for two sides: 25 feet.
(5) Minimum rear yard (no reduction): 40 feet.
(6) Maximum building coverage: 30%. (For all other lots in the MH
District, the maximum building coverage shall be governed by
§ 182-77I herein.)
B. All other requirements applicable to mobile homes as specified in
§ 182-77 remain applicable to modular homes and conventionally built
single-family homes.
A. Setback from tract boundary. No mobile home or other primary building
may be located closer than 40 feet to any boundary of a mobile home
development, regardless of whether that boundary abuts a lot, water
body, road or other right-of-way. In the event that a mobile home
development abuts another such development, this may be reduced to
25 feet.
B. Setback from streets. In no case shall the long side of a mobile home, or
any side of another primary building or accessory use, be located closer
§ 182-75 UPPER PROVIDENCE CODE § 182-77
176:732
than 25 feet to the ultimate right-of-way line of any public street or to
the edge of the cartway or the equivalent right-of-way line, if applicable,
of a private interior roadway or to the edge of any common pedestrian
walkway, within a mobile home development; provided, however, that
the short side of a mobile home may be located no closer to these
facilities than 15 feet. No more than six homes in a row shall have the
same setback; where varied setbacks are utilized, the difference shall
be at least four feet.
C. Setback from common parking facilities. No mobile home or accessory
use shall be located within 25 feet of any common parking area.
D. Lot size. Individual mobile home lots in a mobile home development,
regardless of tenure, shall have a minimum lot size of no less than 5,000
square feet when on-lot parking is provided, excluding the area of any
access leg to a rear lot, except that this may be reduced to no less than
4,500 square feet when common parking is provided.
E. Lot width. No individual mobile home lot shall be less than 55 feet in
width at the building setback line, although this may be reduced to 45
feet where roofed additions are prohibited or where the applicant can
demonstrate that roofed additions can be added without violating the
provisions of Subsections F and H herein. No individual mobile home lot
shall be less than 25 feet in width at the right-of-way line of a public
street or the equivalent right-of-way line or the edge of the pavement of
a private street, as applicable.
F. Side and rear setbacks. No mobile home or accessory building may be
located closer than four feet to any side or rear lot line of an individual
mobile home lot; provided, however, that all minimum requirements of
Subsection H must be met, and provided further that accessory
buildings may be located on the lot line if physically joined to each other
with a common wall located on the property line.
G. Unit location on individual lots. Mobile homes placed on individual lots
are encouraged to utilize the minimal setbacks specified in Subsection
F and to be placed off-center on the lots so as to provide a large usable
open yard space and outdoor living area in one section of the lot.
H. Distance between structures. Mobile homes and roofed structures or
areas attached thereto shall be separated from each other and from
other buildings and structures other than accessory structures at their
closest points by a minimum of 20 feet; provided, however, that
whenever two mobile homes have their longest sides parallel or
essentially parallel to each other for more than 25% of the length of
either, the minimum distance between the two mobile homes shall be 30
feet. The sides shall be considered essentially parallel if they form an
angle of less than 45° when extended to intersect.
I. Lot coverage. The maximum coverage of any individual mobile home lot
by all primary and accessory buildings and structures, including
covered patios or decks, shall be no greater than 25%.
§ 182-77 WATER § 182-77
176:733
§ 182-78. Common open space.
At least 20% of the site area of the mobile home development must be in
common open space as defined herein, no more than 1/3 of which may be
required buffer area. The configuration and location of the common open
space must be consistent with the requirements of § 154-50I of Chapter
154, Subdivision and Land Development.
J. Height. No structure built in a Mobile Home Development District shall
exceed a height of three stories or a maximum of 35 feet.
K. Preservation of natural features. No mobile home or other structure
shall be located within an area defined as floodplain by the Township
floodplain ordinances,147 nor shall any mobile home be placed on steep
slope land having a natural grade of 15% or greater (as defined by
Article XVIII of this chapter, the Steep Slope Conservation District), nor
shall said steep slope land be graded to a lesser-percentage slope for
the purpose of accommodating a mobile home.
L. Design alternative. In order to allow clustering of lots designed to
encourage flexibility in site design and the preservation of natural
features and to maximize creation of accessibility of recreation areas,
the distance between structures, minimum lot width and minimum lot
size may be reduced up to a maximum of 10% upon approval of the
governing body, provided that at least 50% of all lots so reduced shall
directly abut a part of the common open space for a distance of at least
20 feet. An area equal to that by which each lot is reduced shall be
added to the minimum common open space specified in § 182-78. All
other regulations remain as stated herein.

ARTICLE XVIA
IO-2 Interchange Office Support District
[Added 8-6-1990 by Ord. No. 300]
§ 182-120.1. Legislative intent.
In expansion of the community development objectives contained in Article
I, § 182-2 of this chapter, it is hereby declared to be the intent of this
article with respect to IO-2 Interchange Office Support Districts to provide
standards for office uses and developments which will provide
complementary services for nearby Interchange Office District
developments.
A. To encourage the development of office and related services in locations
at or near interchanges of State Route 422 (the Pottstown Expressway)
that are convenient to the larger-scale corporate headquarters and
office developments in IO Districts.
B. To provide such areas either immediately abutting or surrounded by
existing IO Districts.
C. To function as a service district to the IO District, IO-2 Districts should
only be applied to the Township Zoning Map subsequent to the
development of a sufficient amount of nearby development in an IO
District, or alternatively, upon final approval of a sufficient amount of
such development, so as to provide demonstrated need for such support
services as would be provided in the IO-2 Districts.
D. To provide ancillary commercial uses, as conditional uses, which
provide retail goods and/or services for the employees in this district.
E. To provide for a limited array of freestanding commercial uses, also as
conditional uses, which will provide certain essential services for
employees of the broader employment centers around the Route 422
interchanges, including developments in both IO and IO-2 Districts.
F. To be applied in locations so as to reduce conflicts and traffic
congestion on major arterial highways which traverse these areas, by
minimizing travel outside the interchange area.
G. To provide certain development flexibility afforded by permitting a
limited amount of land subdivision for tracts of land whose physical
characteristics discourage creation of a singular development site, and
to ensure that when such subdivision is permitted, it is done in strict
conformity with a recorded master plan and accompanying set of
restricted covenants, assuring continual adherence to an approved
development concept.
H. To provide development regulations which ensure the preservation of
the Township's rural character.

Supervisors. Once approved, said plan shall be recorded prior to or
simultaneously with the recording of the initial subdivision and/or land
development plan for any portion of the tract. The following are the
minimum requirements for said plan:
A. At a minimum, said plan shall be drawn to tentative sketch plan
requirements, pursuant to § 154-11 of Chapter 154, Subdivision and
Land Development. The master plan shall show relationships among the

B. Preservation of natural features shall be assured; demonstration of this
shall be documented through the master plan and on subsequently
required subdivision and/or land development plans and landscape
plans. The following shall be addressed in terms of natural features
preservation:
(1) Floodplains and wetlands shall be protected in accordance with
Article III, Floodplain Conservation District, of this chapter, and
§ 154-12C(5)(d) of Chapter 154, Subdivision and Land
Development, respectively, as well as all applicable state and
federal regulations.
(2) Steep slopes shall be protected in accordance with Article XVIII,
Steep Slope Conservation District, of this chapter. When, in the
opinion of the Township Engineer, soils information does not
adequately depict steep slopes, topographic information shall be
used to supplement it.

installation of pedestrian paths may be deferred for a maximum of six
months from the date the occupancy permit is issued for the final
building in said land development to provide sufficient time to observe
actual pedestrian movements.
D. Any change to proposed lots, buildings, circulation, parking,
landscaping or extent of natural features preservation which is
substantive in the opinion of the Board of Supervisors will necessitate a
revised master plan to be submitted, approved and recorded to replace
any prior master plan(s). No subdivision or land development for any
development on the subject development tract shall be approved
without a current recorded master plan.
E. The most current recorded master plan must contain a tabulation of the
ratio of open space provided on the development tract, current through
the most recently approved subdivision and/or land development. A
revised master plan must be recorded simultaneously with the
recording of each subsequently approved subdivision and/or land
development in order that the open space ratio is continually updated.
In addition, as each land development plan is approved on an individual
lot, a perpetual deed restriction shall be placed on that lot restricting
any further subdivision of that lot, and further restricting the amount of
impervious coverage, to that percentage which was approved as part of
the land development plan.
A. Provisions for the establishment of an association with mandatory
membership by the current owner of each lot represented in the master
plan.
B. Parties to the declaration of restrictive covenants shall be bound by all
restrictions contained therein, and shall include, at a minimum, the

In implementing these principles and the general purposes of the
Comprehensive Plan, the Open Space and Recreation Plan, the Open Space
and Environmental Resource Protection Plan and this chapter, the following
specific objectives are intended to be accomplished by the adoption of the
Steep Slope Conservation District:
A. To combine with other zoning requirements, as an overlay, certain
restrictions for steep slope areas to promote the general health, safety
and welfare of the residents of Upper Providence Township.
B. To prevent inappropriate development of steep slope areas in order to
avoid potential dangers for human usage caused by erosion, stream
siltation, soil failure leading to structural collapse or damage and/or
unsanitary conditions and associated hazards.
C. To minimize danger to public health and safety by promoting safe and

landscape buffers. [Amended 12-16-2013 by Ord. No. 535]
(2) Any corner lot in a commercial or industrially zoned area may not
have erected any fence, wall, structure, shrub, hedge or plant
growth higher than three feet above the elevation of the center line
of the street, measured 30 feet in either direction from a point
defined by the intersection of the front lot line and the exterior side
lot line.

provided, however, that when a required building setback is
greater than 100 feet, the fence may be no higher than six feet
between said one-hundred-foot distance and the prescribed
setback. For chain link fences, the prescribed heights shall be
exclusive of barbed wire topping. Buffering shall be installed on the
outside of the fence. At a minimum, a Buffer Type 3 shall be
installed, in accordance with the requirements of § 154-36D(5)(e)
of Chapter 154, Subdivision and Land Development, unless, in the
opinion of the Township, existing vegetation serves as an
equivalent or superior buffer.

opaque; walls shall only be permitted if they meet this
criterion.
(3) At all entries to a public street and for a minimum distance of 400
feet on either side of an entry drive/road, any fencing proposed
shall be ornamental and architecturally compatible with the
development on the tract being fenced. The height of said fencing
shall depend upon its distance back from the ultimate right-of-way
line as prescribed in Subsections C(1) and (2) of this section.
However, when said fences may impede sight distance, a reduced
height shall be required to maintain proper vehicular and
pedestrian safety. Said height shall be determined by the Township
Engineer. Fences provided for in this subsection shall be no more
than 50% opaque; walls shall only be permitted if they meet this
criterion. Decorative pillars shall be installed on either side of each
entry drive/road when fencing or walls are proposed. Additional

width (or diameter if round) of two feet and may extend higher than
the fence, up to 1 1/2 feet above the top of the fence sections. All
such pillars shall be of a complementary design to the fence or wall.
(4) Any fence on top of which barbed wire, razor wire or other security
device is proposed to be installed shall require conditional use
approval. The applicant shall demonstrate that such security device
adds the minimum practical additional height to the fence and has
been properly considered in the buffering for the fence.
(5) Should there be any conflict between heights permitted in the
various subsections of this section, the lower height shall prevail.
(6) Regardless of any requirement to the contrary herein, chain link
fencing may be provided along the frontage of a limited access
highway. Said fence shall not exceed eight feet in height (exclusive
of barbed wire topping).

intent to abandon such use and any subsequent use of land shall conform to
the regulations of this chapter.
A. No structural alterations or additions or enlargements of any
nonconforming building, structure or land will be permitted which
would violate the side, front or rear yard setback lines or building
coverage of the zone in which the building, structure or land is located,
provided that in residential zones where there is a nonconforming use
as to side, front or rear yard setback line, a permissible alteration or
addition may be built on the line with the existing side, front or rear
nonconforming building line, respectively, except that a violation of a
setback line not previously violated shall not be permitted. [Amended

of the effective date of this chapter or subsequent amendment thereto
at which time the use became nonconforming. The "area devoted to the
use" shall mean the total of the gross floor area and, for any portions of
the use not conducted in a building, the lot area actually utilized in
connection with the nonconforming use; provided, further, that any
expansion shall be limited to the lot on which the building, structure or
use is located, as that lot was defined when the building, structure or
use became nonconforming. [Added 8-7-1995 by Ord. No. 343]

nonconforming use as a special exception, with the approval of the Zoning
Hearing Board, upon a finding that the new use is the same or of a more
restrictive nature than the existing nonconforming use. If an existing

or lot width requirements of the district in which it is located shall be
considered a nonconforming lot. Said lot may be developed consistent with
the use and dimensional standards of the district in which it is located,
provided that if any setback standards cannot be met, the applicant shall
apply to the Zoning Hearing Board for request of the necessary variance(s).
Provided further, however, that if the area of the lot in question is less than
50% of the required minimum for the district in which it is located and if two
or more lots with continuous frontage in a single ownership are of record at
the time of passage or applicable amendment of this chapter, the land shall
be considered an undivided parcel and shall be combined and redefined in
such a way as to meet the requirements of this chapter to the maximum
possible extent.
A. In the event that a nonconforming use in any district is destroyed or
partially destroyed by fire, explosion or other cause or otherwise
damaged either to the extent of two or more times its assessed
valuation (as determined from the assessment rolls effective at the date
of damage or destruction) or 1/2 the bulk of all buildings, structures or
other improvements on the lot, such nonconforming uses shall
terminate and the lot shall thereafter be used only for conforming uses.
