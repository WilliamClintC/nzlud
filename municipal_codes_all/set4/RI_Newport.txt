the City of Newport, Rhode Island

Beginning with Supp. No. 26, 1-09 
Supplemented by Municipal Code Corporation

PREFACE 
    The Codified Ordinances of the City of Newport, Rhode Island, originally published by Book Publishing Company in 1994, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Matthew Bender & Company, Inc., its successor in interest. 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 26, 1-09, Municipal Code Corporation will be keeping this Code current by regular supplementation. 
    During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company under the direction of Mr. Frank Edwards, city manager. 
    The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
    In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 26, 1-09, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
    A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers. 
    This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance No. 2019-24, passed June 12, 2019.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
    This Code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this Code. 
Numbering System. 
    The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
    A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this Code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
    Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be added between 2.04, City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney. 
Section. 
    Each section of the code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
    There are many tables of contents in this Code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
    At the end of each code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 26, 1-09, a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross referenced to the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
    The statutory references direct the code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
    When a code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" code references in the new code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
    As of Supplement No. 26, 1-09, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
    To find a specific ordinance in the code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezonings, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the Code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 26, 1-09, this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 26, 1-09, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
    If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this Code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
    The index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended. 
Insertion Guide. 
    Each supplement to the new Code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. This sheet will tell the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
    When originally published, this Code was numbered with consecutive page numbers. As it is amended, new material may require the insertion of new pages that are numbered with hyphens. (Example: 31, 32, 32-1.) Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) are left unnumbered but the number is "reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission. 
    In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version. You can send files to us as an e-mail attachment, by FTP, on a diskette or CD-ROM. Electronic files enable us not only to get you your code more quickly but also ensure that it is error-free.

SUPPLEMENT HISTORY TABLE 
    The table below allows users of this Code to quickly and accurately determine what ordinances have been considered for codification in each supplement. Ordinances that are of a general and permanent nature are codified in the Code and are considered "Included." Ordinances that are not of a general and permanent nature are not codified in the Code and are considered "Omitted." 
    In addition, by adding to this table with each supplement, users of this Code of Ordinances will be able to gain a more complete picture of the Code's historical evolution.

OF THE 
CITY OF NEWPORT, RHODE ISLAND 
Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- The Charter of the City of Newport, Rhode Island, was approved by the voters on November 4, 1952. Chapter III (Elections) became effective on such date. All other provisions became effective on November 1, 1953. Years appearing in parentheses indicate that the section was enacted, amended or repealed in the year indicated. At the direction of the City, per email of Sept. 28, 2015, the City of Newport Charter has been revised to reflect gender neutrality. 

PREAMBLE 
    We, the people of the City of Newport, in order to secure for ourselves the benefits of local self government under the provisions of the Constitution of the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, do ordain and establish this Charter for the government of said City of Newport. 
CHAPTER I. - GENERAL PROVISIONS. 

SECTION 1-1. - FORM OF GOVERNMENT. 
    The municipal government provided by this Charter shall be known as the "Council-Manager Government." Pursuant to its provisions and subject only to the limitations imposed by the State Constitution and by this Charter, all powers of the City shall be vested in an elective Council, hereinafter referred to as "the Council," which shall enact local legislation, adopt budgets, determine policies, and appoint the City Manager, who shall execute the laws and administer the government of the City. 
SECTION 1-2. - POWERS OF CITY. 
    All powers of the City shall be exercised in the manner prescribed by this Charter, or if the manner be not prescribed, then in such manner as may be prescribed by ordinance or resolutions of the Council. The City also shall have all the powers granted to the City by the laws of this State together with all the implied powers necessary to carry into execution all the powers granted. The City may acquire property within or without its corporate limits for any City purpose, in fee simple or any lesser interest or estate, by purchase, gift, devise, lease or condemnation, and may sell, lease, mortgage, hold, manage and control such property as its interests may require; and, except as prohibited by the Constitution of this State or restricted by this Charter, the City shall and may exercise all municipal powers, functions, rights, privileges and immunities of every name and nature whatsoever. The enumeration of particular powers by this Charter shall not be deemed to be exclusive, and in addition to the powers enumerated therein or implied thereby, or appropriate to the exercise of such powers, it is intended that the City shall have and may exercise all powers which, under the Constitution of this State, it would be competent for this Charter specifically to enumerate. 
SECTION 1-3. - EXISTING ORDINANCES, RESOLUTIONS, RULES AND REGULATIONS TO CONTINUE IN EFFECT. 
    Except insofar as they are inconsistent with this Charter, all the ordinances, rules, resolutions and regulations heretofore made by the representative Council or the Board of Aldermen, or any board or commission, shall continue in effect until superseded by action of the Council. 
SECTION 1-4. - SAVING CLAUSE. 
    All laws relating to the City of Newport are hereby superseded to the extent that the same are inconsistent with the provisions of this Charter, except such laws that are enacted in accordance with powers reserved to the General Assembly by the Constitution of the State. 
CHAPTER II. - THE COUNCIL.

The City Clerk shall present such charges to the Council at its next regular meeting, and the Council shall set a place and time for the holding of a public hearing thereon, public notice thereof to be given by the City Clerk, and to be held not less than five nor more than ten (10) days after said meeting of the Council. Members of the Council other than the member or members charged as aforesaid shall be the hearing body and shall be the judge of the qualifications of its members. 
SECTION 2-9. - OFFICERS NOT TO MAKE CONTRACTS IN WHICH THEY ARE INTERESTED. 
    No officers or employees of the City shall directly or indirectly make a contract with the City or receive any compensation, discount, bonus, gift, contribution or reward from or any share in, the profits of any person, firm or corporation making or performing such contract unless, immediately upon learning of the existence of such contract, or that such contract is proposed, they shall notify the Council in writing of the nature of their interest in such contract, and shall abstain from doing any official act on behalf of the City with reference thereto. In case of any such interest on the part of any officers whose duty is to sign such contract on behalf of the City, the contract may be signed by any other officer of the City duly authorized by the City Manager. When a contractor with the City is a corporation or a voluntary stock association, the ownership of less than five percent of the stock or shares actually issued shall not be considered as involving an interest in the contract within the meaning of this section, and such ownership shall not affect the validity of the contract unless the owner of such stock or shares is also an officer or agent of the corporation or association, or solicits or takes part in the making of the contract. 
SECTION 2-10. - CONTRACT TO BE VOIDABLE; PENALTIES. 
    A violation of any provision of the preceding section shall render the contract with respect to which such violation occurs voidable in whole or in part at the option of the City. Any person violating the provisions of said section shall be punished by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000), or by imprisonment for not more than one year, or both. A conviction for a violation of said section shall be deemed a crime involving moral turpitude. 
SECTION 2-11. - RATIFICATION OR AVOIDANCE OF CONTRACT. 
    Whenever any contract made by or on behalf of the City is voidable under the terms of this Charter, the City Manager shall, on behalf of the City, within ten days after the Manager shall acquire knowledge of facts sufficient to make such contract voidable, either ratify or avoid such contract, in whole or in part, by rendering in writing upon said contract the Manager's decision with regard thereto and a reason therefor, and by forwarding forthwith to the City Clerk a copy thereof, which copy shall be a public record. Such decision of the City Manager shall be final. 
(As amended by Sec. 1, Chapter 520, P.L. 1985) 
SECTION 2-12. - ACTION BY RESIDENT OR TAXPAYER. 
    If the Manager shall fail to perform any act required of him or her by the preceding section of this Charter, any resident or taxpayer may require him or her to perform such act by filing with the City Clerk a demand in writing signed by such resident or taxpayer for such performance, which shall contain a recital of the facts upon which such demand is based.

SECTION 2-13. - POWER OF INITIATIVE. 
    The electors shall have the power to propose any ordinance, except an ordinance appropriating money or authorizing the levy of taxes, and to adopt or reject the same at the polls, such power being known as the initiative.

SECTION 2-14. - POWER OF REFERENDUM. 
    The electors shall have power to approve or reject at the polls any ordinance passed by the Council, or submitted by the Council to a vote of the electors, such power being known as the referendum.

Within thirty (30) days after the enactment by the Council of any ordinance, a petition signed by qualified electors of the City equal in number to at least ten percent of the number of persons registered to vote at the last regular Municipal election may be filed with the City Clerk requesting that any such ordinance be either repealed or submitted to a vote of the electors. A majority of those casting votes at such election shall determine whether such ordinance is repealed or sustained. 
    When a referendum petition has been certified as sufficient by the City Clerk, the ordinance specified in the petition shall not go into effect, or further action thereunder shall be suspended if it shall have gone into effect, until and unless approved by the electors, as hereinafter provided. 
(As amended by Sec. 1, Chapter 40, P.L. 2009.) 
SECTION 2-14a. - SIGNATURES ON INITIATIVE AND REFERENDUM PETITIONS. 
    The signatures on all initiative petitions and referendum petitions under Sections 2-13 and 2-14 of this Charter need not all be affixed to one petition, but to each separate petition there shall be attached an affidavit of the circulator that all signatures appended thereto was made in the presence of the petitioner and is a genuine signature of the person whose name it purports to be.

In making a determination as to the practicability of competitive sealed bidding for purposes of these regulations, the purchasing agent shall consider all factors he or she deems relevant to the particular procurement, including the following:

4.  Whether the contract is expected to involve combined, multiple, complex or diverse services or elements of performance that lend themselves to an evaluation of offers on a basis other than lowest qualified bid price or lowest qualified evaluated bid price; 
5.  Whether optional offers are desired and encouraged; 
6.  Whether judgment is required in evaluating competing proposals and it is in the best interest of the city to require a balancing of price, quality, experience and other factors, and 
7.  Whether clarification, development and negotiation of the terms and conditions of the contract are necessary or desirable to achieve the city's goals in the transaction. 
B.

A police officer who may already be a graduate of the municipal police training school, upon valid certification of that fact, shall serve a one-year probationary period from the time of appointment. The probationary period shall be regarded as an integral part of the evaluation process and shall be utilized for closely observing the employee's work, for obtaining the most effective adjustment of a new employee to his position and for separating any new employee whose performance does not meet the required standards.

The first report is due at the end of three months' employment and the second is due at the end of the fifth month (third, eighth and eleventh months for those employees serving the one-year probationary period). 
    The probationary period, applicable to both new and promoted employees, is an extension of the examining process. It enables supervisors to observe the individual employee on the job and to determine the presence or absence of various factors necessary for successful job performance which cannot be determined or measured by pre-employment examination or interview. 
B.  The status of the appointment shall not be changed from probationary to regular until a certification is made by the department director to the city manager that the employee's services are satisfactory. An employee shall not acquire full status as a regular employee until approved by the city manager. If, after a period of one week, the department director does not certify to regular appointment, the employee shall be removed from the position immediately. 
C.  Employees appointed to part-time positions may receive regular or temporary appointments as appropriate. 
D.  Temporary appointment indicates that the employee is to work for the city for a period of less than nineteen (19) consecutive weeks.

The pay of temporary employees shall be computed on an hourly basis and no pay shall be given for time not worked, except as otherwise provided herein. Temporary employees may be separated at any time within the nineteen (19) weeks of appointment when their services are no longer required. The separation is not subject to the rules under Chapter 3.32.

3.12.030. - Position classification studies. 
    The city manager shall make position classification studies of individual positions or groups of positions whenever he or she deems it necessary, whenever the duties or responsibilities of existing positions have undergone significant changes or whenever new positions are to be created. 
(Prior code § 278.03) 
3.12.040. - Class specifications. 
    In determining the class to which any position shall be allocated, the specification of each class shall be considered as a whole. The class specifications shall be descriptive and explanatory and are not restrictive. The use of a particular expression or illustration as to duties, qualifications or other attributes shall not be held to exclude others not mentioned, if such others are similar in kind or quality, and shall not limit the power of supervisors to alter the detailed tasks involved in the duties of a position. Qualifications expected of all incumbents of positions, such as a valid driver's license (if the position requires driving), good physical condition, freedom from disabling defects which, in the opinion of the city manager, would adversely affect work performance, honesty, sobriety, courtesy and industry, shall be deemed to be implied in the qualification requirements of each class even though not specifically mentioned in the class specification. 
(Prior code § 278.04) 
3.12.050. - Interpretation of class specifications. 
    The class specifications shall be descriptive and explanatory and are not restrictive. The use of a particular expression or illustration as to duties, qualifications or other attributes shall not be held to exclude others not mentioned if such others are similar in kind or quality, nor to limit the power of supervisors to alter the detailed tasks involved in the duties of a position. 
(Prior code § 278.05) 
3.12.060. - Allocation of positions-Change of duties-New positions. 
    Supervisors shall notify the city manager through channels promptly of each change of duties, responsibilities or work assignment. Whenever a new position is established, supervisors shall submit, in writing, a comprehensive job description describing in detail the duties of such position. The city manager shall thereupon investigate the actual or suggested duties and shall classify the position by assigning it to the appropriate class or initiate the establishment of a new class. 
(Prior code § 278.06) 
3.12.070. - Requests for reclassification. 
    Any employee who considers his position improperly classified shall first submit his request for reclassification to his supervisor who shall review such request as to its justification. If the supervisor finds that there is merit in the request, he shall immediately transmit his recommendation to the city manager. If the supervisor finds that the request is not justified, he shall so advise the employee of the decision and also of the employee's right to appeal under the grievance procedure set forth in Chapter 3.36. 
(Prior code § 278.07) 
3.12.080. - Method of filling reclassified positions. 
    Upon the reclassification of a position from one class to another class of the same level, a lower level or a higher level, the method of filling the position shall be determined in accordance with the rules regarding transfers, demotions or promotions, as may be appropriate. 
(Prior code § 278.08) 
3.12.090. - When employee to remain in reclassified position. 
    An employee occupying a reclassified position at the same grade level shall continue in the position if the change is in class title only, or if the change is in recognition of a gradual change in duties and the employee has been satisfactory or better in performance of the duties of the position. 
(Prior code § 278.09) 
3.12.100. - Evidence of fitness for reclassified positions. 
    The city manager may, before recognizing an employee's right to retain a position reclassified to a higher level, require evidence of the qualifications and fitness of the incumbent, including hearings, investigations and noncompetitive examinations. 
(Prior code § 278.10) 
Chapter 3.16. - PAY PLAN 

3.16.010. - Establishment of pay plan. 
    Council shall determine the pay plan in the form of a salary ordinance and may amend the plan from time to time. The pay plan shall be re-examined annually by the city manager who shall submit recommendations for changes to council. In making such re-examination and recommendations, the city manager shall include and give appropriate consideration to the following factors: 
A.  Maintenance of equitable relationships between classes based on their relative duties; 
B.  The general level of rates in the appropriate labor markets for comparable work under similar working conditions; and 
C.  Current recruitment and retention experiences and the city's financial position and resources. 
(Prior code § 280.01) 
3.16.020. - Compensation in lieu of fees, commissions, etc. 
    The compensation of officers and employees, as fixed or otherwise provided for by Chapters 3.04 through 3.52, shall be in full payment for all official services of such officers or employees and shall be in lieu of any and all fees, commissions and other compensation which may be receivable by such officers in the performance of the duties of their offices. Such fees, commissions and compensation shall belong to the city, shall be collected and accounted for by such officers and shall be paid over to the city. 
(Prior code § 280.02) 
3.16.030. - Fringe benefits. 
A.  Section 3.16.020 does not preclude the granting of fringe benefits, such as overtime pay, vacations, retirement, insurance, etc. 
    All full time city employees who regularly work no less than thirty-five (35) hours per week and maintain continuous regular full time employment are eligible to enroll in one of the group health insurance and dental insurance plans offered by the city. 
    Changes to health and dental insurance plans can be made during the annual open enrollment period or following a qualifying life event, such as a marriage or birth of a child. 
    For new hire enrollment, eligible coverage in a family or individual city group health and dental insurance plan will occur on the first day of the month following a new hire's original date of city employment and upon completion of the required forms. 
B.  Non-union supervisory employees shall receive the same fringe benefits as that which accrue to Council 94 nonsupervisory employees, including any enhancements, unless specifically exempted by the city council. 
C.  With regard to insurance premiums, all city employees shall be required to contribute towards the cost of the healthcare premiums, which shall be deducted biweekly from the employee's salary or paid directly to the city by the employee (i.e. COBRA, leave without pay). Employee cost shares are determined by the collective bargaining agreement between the city and the employee organization/union representing the employee classification. For non-union Supervisory employees, an employee contribution of ten (10) percent of the health plan's premium is required from employee's earning less than forty-two thousand dollars ($42,000.00) per annum or fifteen (15) percent of the health plan's premium for salaries greater than forty-two thousand dollars ($42,000.00) per annum. Unclassified employee contributions shall be the same as non-union supervisory employees unless specified differently by the city council.

(Ord. No. 2013-014, § 1, 10-9-2013) 
3.16.040. - Rates for full-time and part-time employment. 
    The rates of pay prescribed are for full-time employment. Compensation for a work week of less than the full-time schedule (see Chapter 3.24) shall be in proportion to the time actually worked, except as otherwise specifically provided in Chapters 3.04 through 3.52. 
(Prior code § 280.04) 
3.16.050. - Studies of factors affecting salary levels. 
    The city manager shall make comparative studies of factors affecting the level of salary ranges at least once each fiscal year. On the basis of information derived from the studies, requests for adjustments in salary ranges shall be initiated by the city manager and submitted to council for adoption by ordinance. 
(Prior code § 280.05) 
3.16.060. - Pay schedule for classified service. 
    Following is the pay schedule showing salaries on an annual basis. Any revision of the pay schedule shall take effect on the first pay period pursuant to the fiscal accounting year associated with the adoption of the annual operating budget.

A.  Meet difficult recruiting problems or to obtain a person with markedly superior qualifications; 
B.  Correct salary inequalities or give credit for prior service; or 
C.  Recognize outstanding performance. 
(Prior code § 280.08) 
3.16.090. - Beginning rate for former employees. 
    A former employee who is rehired at the same grade level or at a lower grade may be appointed at any merit step rate that does not exceed the existing salary applicable to the highest step rate previously obtained as a city employee. 
(Prior code § 280.09) 
3.16.100. - Requirement for pay increases. 
    For each employee to become eligible for an increase in pay, the director of the department for which the employee works shall submit a written statement with a personnel evaluation form to the city manager at least twenty (20) days prior to the increase date as to the manner in which the employee has performed his assigned duties since the original appointment or last advance in pay. The department directors shall submit written recommendations that the employee be granted or denied an advance in pay. If the employee's work has been properly and diligently performed, has been satisfactory in light of the length of service in the position and has shown the improvement normally to be expected with increased periods of service and other factors considered relevant to employment, the department director shall recommend that the employee be granted the next regular increase in pay. If, in the judgment of the department director, the employee's work has been below standards that are expected, he shall recommend that no increase be granted. The city manager shall authorize or deny pay increased for city employees as recommended by department directors, unless, in the employee's opinion and based on supporting information, the recommendation is unsound. In those cases, a department director shall notify the employee in writing of the recommended action, including the reason therefor, at the same time he notifies the city manager. Ordinarily, salary increases shall be limited to one per year, with an exception for outstanding service. 
(Prior code § 280.10)

A.  Leaves of absences with pay, and leaves of absences of thirty (30) days or less without pay, shall not interrupt continuous service and are completely creditable. 
B.  Absences on leave without pay in excess of thirty (30) days shall be deducted from total creditable service, but shall not constitute a break in continuous service. 
C.  Absences for extended service in the armed forces of the United States are completely creditable in computing total service. 
D.  Absences without leave of one work-week or more shall interrupt continuity of service and shall be deducted from total service. 
E.  Leave for injury in line of duty is completely creditable. 
(Prior code § 280.11) 
3.16.120. - Salary increase for exceptional service generally. 
    An employee who performs the duties and responsibilities in his or her position in an outstanding manner may be considered for an increase for exceptional service in an amount of five percent of his or her pay, and this increment may be authorized for periods of three, six or nine months. The recommendation shall be written in detail to the city manager, showing precise justification and use of strict criteria. This increase shall be approved by council upon the recommendation of the city manager. As standards for exceptional service, the following are recommended: 
A.  Exceptional service means that the employee, on his or her own initiative and by his or her own efforts and abilities, is rendering service above the level of proficiency normally expected in the class or is producing results consistently superior to that normally expected or employees in the class. 
B.  Exceptional service does not include usual acts or results which are caused by unusual conditions beyond the control of the employee, to which he or she demonstrated a normal reaction under the circumstances. 
C.  The following are some examples of the kinds of performance which might be considered exceptional service: 
1.  Developing or discovering a concept, technique, practice or procedure related to the work of the class which improves the quality of the service or results in financial savings. Developments of this character unrelated to the employee's own class or work should be recognized through a suggestion and award system; 
2.  Performing the work of his or her class at a standard consistently above that normally expected, with resulting improvement of service or financial savings; 
3.  Consistently demonstrating ingenuity in the solution of difficult problems, with resulting improvement of service or financial savings; and 
4.  Activity in community service or professional organizations on the employee's own time which contribute measurably to enhancing the prestige of the public service. 
(Prior code § 280.12) 
3.16.130. - Pay rates after promotion, demotion or transfer. 
    When an employee is promoted, demoted or transferred, his or her rate of pay in the new position shall be established in accordance with the following: 
A.  Upon promotion, an employee shall be placed in the first step of his or her new pay grade, except that in cases where the first step should not be a one-step increase, the promoted employee shall be placed in such step in the new pay grade as may be necessary to give a one-step increase. A fire captain, fire lieutenant, police captain, police lieutenant or police sergeant shall reach his maximum salary upon satisfactory completion of his six months probationary period. 
B.  Upon demotion, an employee normally shall receive a one-step decrease in pay. However, it shall be the responsibility of the city manager in each instance to determine the amount of the pay decrease, if any, upon demotion of an employee.

A.  Any indebtedness pursuant to Section 3.32.010; and 
B.  Sick leave advanced prior to accrual, unless the separation is for disability. Separation because of pregnancy shall be considered a resignation and shall not be considered for disability. 
(Prior code § 288.02) 
3.32.030. - Resignation and retirement. 
A.  Purpose. To set forth administrative guidelines for the proper and timely separation from service for employees of the city. 
B.  Policy. When a city employee leaves municipal service, of his or her own volition, a number of administrative tasks are required, including, but not limited to: computing any earned severance benefits, initiating process for pension benefits, reclaiming and cataloguing any city-issued equipment or inventorying other property, formally issued to the employee, for which the city claims or retains ownership. The enactment of an employee separation process will expedite the formal notification of appropriate supervisors and department heads of an impending employee separation and subsequent work force vacancy. This procedure is intended to provide reasonable and adequate notice of an employee departure to appropriate city supervisors and administrators, and is not intended to supersede, contradict or circumvent, any codified employee protection, right, or privilege. Further, it is not intended to limit, alter, or restrict any state or federal employee protection or law, or provision of an employee's collective bargaining agreement. 
C.  Procedure. Prior to resigning or retiring from city employment, an employee must provide a letter to his or her department head, indicating the employee's intention to leave service and specifying the employee's last projected date of work. Subsequently, the department head shall prepare an employee separation report, and forward the same, with the employee's letter, to the human resources administrator. With such notification from the employee, the department head shall also execute appropriate department-level internal procedures to separate the employee from service, such as: inspecting, collecting, and cataloguing from the employee all department-issued equipment and other property belonging to the city. 
    With receipt of the employee separation report, the human resources administrator shall schedule an exit interview with the employee, at which time the employee will be provided with information concerning severance, post-employment benefits, obligations, and/or duties. Subsequently, the employee separation report will be forwarded to the city manager for approval. The form shall specify circumstances, benefits, contingencies and/or conditions related to the employee's separation; consistent with provisions of the city of Newport Codified Ordinances, R.I. General Laws, and the employee's employment conditions (including provisions of any applicable collective bargaining agreement). 
    Failure on the part of an employee to submit a letter of intended separation from employment, or delays in the completion of employee separation report, or the subsequent exit interview, may create administrative delays in the computation and delivery of severance and post-employment benefits for the employee leaving city service. 
(Ord. 2006-34 § 1, 2006) 
3.32.040. - Lay-off.

B.  The city manager shall determine the order of lay-off of employees on the basis of seniority, that is, those with the least seniority shall be laid off first, insofar as job classification permits. Whenever it becomes necessary to increase the working forces, laid-off employees shall be recalled in reverse order of their lay-off before any new help is hired. 
C.  Regular employees subject to lay-off shall be notified, in writing, two calendar weeks prior to the effective date, whenever possible. 
D.  Employees who are laid off shall, upon request, be placed on the open examination list for any class for which they are qualified.

4.  Insubordination that constitutes a serious breach of discipline; 
5.  Conviction of a criminal offense; 
6.  Notoriously disgraceful personal conduct; 
7.  Unauthorized absences or abuse of leave privileges; 
8.  Acceptance of any valuable consideration which was given with the expectation of influencing the employee in the performance of his duties; 
9.  Falsification of records or use of official position for personal advantage. 
B.  The employee shall be furnished an advance written notice containing the nature of the proposed action, the reasons therefor and his or her right to answer the charges, orally or in writing. This notice shall be furnished at least one calendar week prior to the proposed effective date of the action. 
C.  During the advance notice period, the employee may be retained in duty status, placed on leave or suspended with or without pay, at the discretion of the city manager. 
D.  If the employee fails to respond to the advance notice, the proposed action of the city manager shall be effective on the date specified with no need for further action. Otherwise, the city manager shall carefully consider the reply of the employee before making a final decision, and at the earliest possible moment shall transmit to the employee a letter containing his final decision.

The city may require an examination at its expense and performed by a physician of its choice. 
(Prior code § 288.07)

(Prior code § 297.03)

A.  Scope of Services. The scope of services for the particular project shall be developed by the department requesting the service. The scope should define the project in specific terms and identify the various project components and phases. The degree, if any, of federal or state participation should also be defined at this time since certain planning and design criteria may be prerequisites for federal or state assistance. 
    A memorandum transmitting the scope of services to the city manager for presentation to council should define the need for the project, identify a budget estimate for the project and suggest the source of funds for payment to the consultant. 
B.  Organization of Screening Committee. The city manager shall serve as chairman of the staff screening and selection committee and the director of finance as vice-chairman. The department head requesting the project or his or her representative shall attend all committee meetings to provide data and recommendations on the project and to implement actions directed by the committee. 
C.  Expression of Interest. Letters requesting an expression of interest should ask the consultants to indicate their interest in the particular project, set forth special qualifications they may wish to call to the attention of the committee, describe previous experience with similar jobs and indicate their capability to perform the service within any time limitations. If the consultant does not have a brochure or resume on file, he or she should be asked to present that information.

1.  Firms submitting detailed proposals should be asked to provide a resume of their proposed project supervisor, the name of the principal who would be responsible for the work, the amount of work presently under way, the ability of the firm to meet required time schedules, a description of how the project would be conducted and monitored, an evaluation of the adequacy of funds available to accomplish the proposed project, the proposed method of determining fees, with alternatives, if desired, the amount of administrative assistance during the first phases of the project and the amount of supervision during the construction phase of the project, as well as other facts they wish to present in favor of their firm. 
2.  The contract form for consulting services should, in general, follow the standards of the American Institute of Architects, the National Society of Professional Engineers or the American Society of Civil Engineers, as applicable to the specific project. 
3.  These firms shall also be advised that city policy requires that an equal employment opportunity and affirmative action program be provided prior to execution of a contract. 
F.  Interview and Selection. Upon receipt of the detailed proposals, the staff selection and screening committee shall be convened to review the proposals, interview the prospective consultants, review fee determination methods and rank the consultants for negotiation of fees. Association consultants who would be used by the primary consultant should be identified at this time. 
    Selection for negotiation should be based upon qualifications, availability, staffing, professional competence and such other matters as the committee may deem proper. 
G.  Contract Negotiation. The selected firm shall then be requested to come in for a final conference with the responsible department head to define precisely the scope of service to be provided and to submit a proposal covering the compensation requirements for the work. Consultant firms employing four or more people shall also be required to submit their equal employment opportunity and affirmative action program at this time. A fee shall then be negotiated with the funds available for the project and a contract shall be prepared and submitted to the city solicitor for review and then submitted to the city manager for presentation to council for approval. 
    If, after reasonable effort, a contract cannot be negotiated within available funds, the negotiations with the designated consultant shall be terminated in writing and negotiations shall be started with the next consultant recommended. 
H.  Contract Approval. The final action to implement consultant selection is approval of the consultant contract. All contracts are to be approved by council after thorough review by the city solicitor.

(Prior code § 297.04) 
3.40.050. - Contract extensions-Exceptions to regulations. 
A.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, where the scope of services states that the project may include additional services which are a logical extension of the original services, and if continuation or extension of the project is economically feasible and the evaluation of services performed to date is satisfactory, the city manager, with the final approval of council, may negotiate the continued employment of the same consultant without following procedural steps set forth in Section 3.40.030 and Section 3.40.040(A) through (F). 
B.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, council may, by resolution, authorize the city manager to negotiate the employment of a consultant without following the steps set forth in this chapter, for reasons of economy or expediency, or because selection of a consultant by following such steps would be, for any reason, impractical.

Chapter 8.12. - NOISE ABATEMENT 

8.12.010. - Statement of public policy. 
    Council finds and declares that: 
A.  Excessive unreasonably loud, or disturbing noise is a serious hazard to the pubic health and welfare and the quality of life in a densely populated city and can violate the well-being, tranquility, and privacy of the home. Excessive noise can also deprive the residents of Newport of the fundamental right they have to the peaceable enjoyment of their homes. 
B.  A substantial body of science and technology exists by which excessive noise can be substantially abated without serious inconvenience to the public. 
C.  Certain of the noise producing equipment in this community is essential to the qualify of life herein and should be allowed to continue at reasonable levels with moderate regulation. 
D.  Each person has a right to an environment reasonably free from unwelcome noise which jeopardizes health or welfare, degrades the quality of life, or violates the well-being, tranquility, and privacy of the home. 
E.  When enacting restrictions on expressive activities by way of laws or ordinances, the protections of the First Amendment must be paramount and restrictions imposed by such laws and ordinances must be enacted without reference to the content of any expressive activity. However, reasonable restrictions may be made to control the time, place and manner of any such expressive activity, so long as those restrictions are content-neutral and narrowly-tailored to serve a significant governmental interest and leave open ample alternative channels of communication. 
F.  The city of Newport is a destination for millions of visitors each year, including those who seasonally rent homes. A vast majority of homes in Newport are located in densely populated neighborhoods that are in close proximity to commercial districts. City officials are inundated with complaints from residents of overcrowding, disorderly behavior, and unreasonably loud and disturbing noise in such neighborhoods. A significant amount of these complaints involve unreasonably loud and disturbing noise in these neighborhoods caused by the human voice or voices late at night or in the early morning hours. There is an urgent need at this time to enact reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions narrowly tailored so as to protect persons from such activity and from unreasonably loud, disturbing or unwelcome noise in general, and to especially protect the wellbeing, tranquility, and privacy of the home. 
G.  It is the declared policy of the city to promote an environment free from excessive, unreasonably loud, or disturbing noise, otherwise properly called noise pollution, which unreasonably jeopardizes the health and welfare of the public, violates and disturbs the well-being, tranquility and privacy of the home, or otherwise degrades the quality of the lives of the residents of this community, without unduly prohibiting, limiting or otherwise regulating the function of certain noise-producing equipment which is not amenable to such controls and yet is essential to the quality of life in the community, and at the same time keeping the protections of the First Amendment paramount in enacting any provisions prohibiting noise disturbances without reference to the content of any expressive activity. 
(Ord. 2004-17 § 1 (part), 2004) 
8.12.020. - Purpose, title and scope. 
A.  The purpose of this chapter is to establish standards for the control of noise pollution in the city by setting maximum permissible sound levels for various activities to protect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
B.  This chapter may be cited as the "Noise Abatement Chapter" of the city. 
C.  This chapter shall apply to the control of all noise originating within the limits of the city or originating from properties lying outside the limits of the city, owned or controlled by the city, except where either: 
1.  A state or federal agency has adopted a different standard or rule than that prescribed in this chapter and has so preempted the regulation of noise from a particular source as to render this chapter inapplicable thereto; or 
2.  Council has determined that, by reason of public acceptance of the activity producing a particular noise, such noise is deemed acceptable to the residents of the city.

B.  The provisions of this chapter which prohibit a person from making or continuing noise disturbances, or causing the same to be made or continued, across a real property boundary or within noise sensitive areas, shall be enforced by the police division, zoning division, or any other city department or division designated by the director of public safety. 
C.  To implement and enforce this chapter, the police division, or any other duly designated city agency, shall have the power to: 
1.  Conduct research, monitoring and other studies related to sound; 
2.  Conduct programs of public education regarding the causes, effects and general methods of abatement and control of noise, as well as the actions prohibited by this chapter and the procedures for reporting violations; 
3.  Coordinate the noise control activities of all city departments;

5.  Issue sound variances pursuant to Section 8.12.180; 
6.  Prepare recommendations for consideration by council, after publication of notice and after a public hearing, for establishing the boundaries of noise sensitive areas. 
D.  Whenever a violation of this chapter occurs and two or more persons are present in or on the lot from which the sound emanates, and it is impossible to determine which of such persons is the violator, the owner of the lot, if present, shall be presumed responsible for the violation. In the absence of such owner, the tenant or tenants of such lot or any person present with the direct consent of the owner shall be held responsible for the violation. 
E.  In the case of continuing violations, the city solicitor may institute an action for injunctive relief against the owner and/or tenant of the lot.

(Ord. 2001-32 (part), 2001) 
12.32.125. - Prohibition of smoking on public beaches, in public parks and cliff walk-findings and intent. 
A.  The use of tobacco for smoking purposes is being found to be increasingly dangerous, not only to the person smoking but also to the nonsmoking person who is required to breathe the contaminated air. A pervasive intrusion of the nonsmoker's right to unpolluted air space is the uncontrolled smoking on beaches and in public parks. 
B.  The city of Newport is committed to keeping its beaches and public parks clean, safe, healthy, and pleasant for everyone. 
c.  Smoking is hazardous to health and numerous studies have shown that secondhand smoke is a significant public health hazard. 
D.  Smoking in public places, including beaches and public parks, endangers children by exposing them to secondhand smoke. 
E.  The United States Environmental Protection Agency has classified secondhand smoke as a group A carcinogen, the most dangerous class of carcinogen. 
F.  The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has found that secondhand smoke causes children to suffer from lower respiratory tract illnesses, such as bronchitis and pneumonia, exacerbates childhood asthma, and increases the risk of chronic middle ear infection in children. 
G.  Discarding cigarettes butts, cigar butts, and tobacco waste on beach sand and in public parks is unsightly, unclean, and particularly hazardous to small children who handle and sometimes ingest them. 
H.  Cigarette butts are the top pollutant on beaches and, if uncollected, may wash directly into ocean waters to the detriment of marine life and all ocean users. Cigarette butts do not biodegrade and they contain two hundred (200) known poisons, sixty-three (63) of which are shown to cause cancer. 
I.  Prohibiting smoking and the improper disposal of tobacco products on beaches and in public parks under the jurisdiction of the city of Newport and the department of public services is necessary to protect the public health, safety, and welfare of all residents and visitors. The city intends, by the enactment of this section, to protect the health and atmospheric environment of the nonsmoker by regulating smoking on public beaches and parks. 
Definitions as used in this chapter: 
(1)  "Smoking" or "to smoke" or "smoke" means and includes the inhaling, exhaling, burning; or

A.  Newport Water Division (NWD). 
1.  On new installations, NWD will provide an on-site evaluation and/or inspection of plans in order to determine the type of backflow preventer that will be required by NWD for containment. In any case, a minimum of a dual check valve will be required in any new construction. 
2.  For premises existing prior to the start of this program, NWD will perform surveys and follow-up inspections of plans and/or the premises and inform the owner by letter of any corrective action deemed necessary, the method of achieving the correction, and the time allowed for the correction to be made. Ordinarily, ninety (90) days will be allowed. However, this time period may be shortened or extended depending upon the degree of hazard involved, the complexity of the upgrade and the history of the device(s) in question. 
3.  NWD will not allow any cross-connection to remain unless it is protected by an approved backflow preventer for which a permit has been issued and which shall be regularly tested to assure satisfactory operation. 
4.  NWD will inform the owner by letter, of any failure to comply, by the time of the first reinspection. NWD will allow an additional fifteen (15) days for the correction. In the event the owner fails to comply with the necessary correction by the time of the second reinspection, NWD will inform the owner by letter, that the water service to the owner's premises will be terminated within a period not to exceed five days. In the event that the owner informs NWD of extenuating circumstances as to why the correction has not been made, a time extension may be granted by NWD but in no case will exceed an additional thirty (30) days. 
5.  If NWD determines at any time that a serious threat to the public health exists, the water service will be terminated immediately. 
6.  NWD will conduct initial premises surveys to determine if a containment backflow prevention device already exists, the nature of existing hazards and corrections to be made. Initial focus will be on high hazard industries and commercial premises with concurrent emphasis on residential properties. 
7.  NWD shall have on its staff a person who is a certified backflow prevention device surveyor. NWD shall have on file a list of private contractors who are certified backflow device testers. 
B.  Owner. 
1.  The owner, after having been informed by a letter from NWD, shall at his/her expense install, maintain, and test, or have tested, any and all backflow preventers on the premises. 
2.  The owner shall correct any malfunction of the backflow preventer which is revealed by periodic inspecting. This shall include the replacement of parts or the replacement of the backflow preventer, if deemed necessary by NWD. 
3.  The owner shall inform NWD of any proposed or modified cross-connections and also existing cross-connections of which the owner is aware, but has not been found by NWD. 
4.  The owner shall not install a by-pass around any backflow preventer unless there is a backflow preventer of the same type on the by-pass. Owners who cannot shut down operations for testing of the device(s) must supply additional devices necessary to allow inspecting to take place. 
5.  The owner shall install backflow preventers in a manner and location approved by NWD. At a minimum, the owner shall install, at his own expense, an approved device at the water service entrance. 
6.  The owner shall only install backflow preventers approved by NWD.

The owner will be required to install a high hazard backflow preventer at the service entrance if a private water source is maintained, even though it is not cross-connected to the NWD water system. 
8.  In the event the owner installs plumbing to provide potable water for domestic purposes which is on the NWD side of the backflow preventer, such plumbing must have its own backflow preventer installed. 
9.  The owner shall be responsible for the payment of all fees for permits, annual or semi-annual device inspections, retesting in the case that the device fails to operate correctly, and second reinspections for noncompliance with NWD requirements. 
10.  All residential buildings will be required to install a residential dual check valve device immediately downstream of the water meter. If NWD determines that the degree of hazard warrants a different device, the owner shall comply with this decision. 
11.  Commercial customers shall install a backflow prevention device commensurate with the degree of hazard, as determined by NWD immediately downstream of the water meter. The customer shall also maintain and inspect the device as required by NWD, and submit records of said inspections/test results as required. 
12.  The owner should be aware that installation of a backflow device results in a potential closed plumbing system with the residence. As such, provisions may have to be made by the owner to provide for thermal expansion within the closed loop system, i.e., the installation of thermal expansion devices and/or pressure relief valves.

13.08.030. - Building sewers and connections. 
A.  No unauthorized person shall uncover, make any connection with or opening into, use, alter or disturb any public sewer or appurtenance thereof without first obtaining a written permit from the director of water pollution control. 
B.  There shall be two classes of building sewer permits: Class A permits which shall authorize the connection of residential or commercial buildings to public sewers; and Class B permits which shall authorize the connection of establishments producing industrial wastes to a public sewer. In either case, the owner or his or her agent shall make application for a permit on a form provided by the director. Each application shall be accompanied with the plans and specifications for the sewer connection and such other information relating to the building and the wastes to be discharged as may be considered pertinent by the director. Any required permit and inspection fee shall be paid to the city at the time the application is made. 
C.  No unauthorized person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any wastes into a public sewer without prior approval of the director. The director shall be notified at least forty-five (45) days in advance of the institution of the proposed discharge, or if any proposed substantial change in volume or character of pollutants over that being discharged into the waste water treatment works, or of a proposed new discharge into the waste water treatment works of pollutants from any source discharging more than two thousand (2,000) gallons per day. 
D.  The owner of a swimming pool shall, at least seven days in advance, request from the director authority for a proposed discharge of water from such pool into any public sewer. The director is authorized to approve or deny the request. In approving the same, he or she shall designate the time and rate of flow permitted and he or she shall be permitted to enter upon the premises to inspect the project prior to and during the operation. If an owner fails to make such request or fails to comply with instructions of the director, the owner shall be liable for any damage that may be caused from such discharge and shall be liable to prosecution for a violation of this section. 
E.  All costs and expenses incident to installation and connection of any building sewer shall be borne by the owner, and the issuance of a building sewer permit shall be contingent upon the owner indemnifying the city against any loss or damage caused by the installation of such building sewer. 
F.  Old building sewers may be used in connection with new buildings only when they are found, on examination and test by the director, to meet all requirements of this chapter. 
G.  All excavations required for the installation of a building sewer shall be open trench work unless otherwise approved by the director. Pipe laying and backfill shall be performed in accordance with ASTM specifications current at the time of such excavations, except that no backfill shall be placed until work has been inspected by the director. 
H.  The size and slope of a sewer service line shall be subject to the approval of the director, but in no event shall the diameter be less than six inches or the slope of the six-inch pipe be less than one-quarter inch per foot. Pipe larger than the minimum size specified herein shall be used when and as the size of the structure, numbers and kinds of fixtures to be drained and other conditions may make it prudent or necessary to provide proper drainage. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the director may permit the use of pre-existing pipe of less than six inches if its use will not conflict with the general intent of this chapter. 
I.  Whenever practical, a building sewer shall be brought to the building at an elevation below the basement floor. No sewer service line shall be laid parallel to, or within three feet of, any bearing wall, where the probability exists that the same will be weakened. The depth of such installation shall be at least four feet to afford protection from frost. The sewer service line shall be laid to a uniform grade and in straight alignment insofar as possible. Changes in direction shall be made only with properly curved pipe and fittings. 
J.  In all buildings in which any building drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the nearest usable public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such sewer shall be lifted by an approved means at the owner's expense. The good function, repair, operation and maintenance of the lift equipment shall be the responsibility of the owner. 
K.  The sewer service line shall be constructed of extra-strength vitrified clay or cast-iron soil pipe. Joints shall be gasketed or leaded. Cement joints shall not be permitted. 
L.  Connection of a sewer service line into a public sewer shall be at a "Y" branch if provided at a suitable location. Where no "Y" is available, a saw-cut tap shall be made by the owner, unless the director deems it in the best interest of the city to have the work done by agents of the city, in which case the owner shall be charged for the work at reasonable rates. Such connection shall be made at the location specified by the director and in accordance with the city's specifications. 
M.  An applicant for a building sewer permit shall notify the director when the building sewer is ready for inspection and connection to the public sewer. The director shall be notified not less than forty-eight (48) hours in advance of the time when any connection is to be made to any public sewer or drain, or to any other existing drain, pipe or similar structure connected thereto and discharging therein, or intended to be so connected and to so discharge. Such connection shall be made only in the presence of the director, affording him or her sufficient opportunity to oversee the construction of all parts of any sewer connected or intended to be connected to any public sewer or drain and to obtain and record the location thereof and other pertinent facts with respect to the same. This same requirement shall apply to repairs or alterations to sewers, drains or pipes discharging thereto. 
N.  No sewer service line or connection to a public sewer shall be covered until it has been inspected by the director and found to conform to the requirements of established standards in all respects and to be satisfactory as to the quality of the workmanship and materials. 
O.  The director shall keep a record of all connections made to public sewers under this chapter, of all repairs and alterations made to sewers and of sewer service lines connected and discharging into public sewers of the city or intended to so discharge. All persons concerned with such connections, repairs or alterations shall assist the director in securing data needed for such records. 
P.  When any building or other structure previously served by a connection to any public sewer or drain is demolished, destroyed, abandoned or altered so that any drain or portion of an abandoned plumbing system which is directly or indirectly connected to any public sewer or drain is no longer used and is no longer connected to the drainage system of the building or structure, the open end of such drain which discharges, directly or indirectly, into a public sewer or drain shall be promptly closed and sealed off so that no water or waste not otherwise permitted to enter the public sewer or drain shall be discharged into the public sewer or drain. The director shall be notified promptly of such abandonment or discon-tinuance and all sealing of sewer service lines shall be done by the owner or anyone acting in his or her behalf, to the satisfaction of the director. 
Q.  The requirements of local building and plumbing codes shall be observed with respect to fixtures inside of or immediately adjacent to buildings and within areas of jurisdiction of such several codes, subject only to the general requirements of this chapter. Pipe more than five feet outside the inner walls of any structure shall conform to all requirements of this chapter, including those relating to permits, materials and workmanship. 
R.  No person shall connect roof downspouts, foundation drains, areaway drains or other sources of surface runoff or ground water to a building sewer or building drain which in turn is connected directly or indirectly to a public sanitary or combined sewer, unless such connection is approved by the director. 
S.  All excavations for building sewer installation shall be adequately guarded with barricades and lights to protect the public from hazard. Streets, sidewalks, parkways and other public property disturbed in the course of the work shall be restored to their prior condition in a manner satisfactory to the city. 
T.  A separate and independent sewer service line shall be provided for every building, except that when two or more buildings are so situated that a separate and independent sewer service line for each building would involve practical difficulties and impose unnecessary hardships, the director may authorize the connection of such buildings to the public sewer through a single sewer service line, subject to such terms and conditions as to easement, design and construction as he or she may require. 
U.  A valid permit shall be required for any connection to or use of any city sewer. Permits shall be renewable at yearly intervals. Permits shall not be transferable, but may be modified at the discretion of the director.

B.  No person, other than those working for, and/or under the supervision or direction of, the city, shall make any excavation for, or construct, install, lay, repair, alter or remove, any sewer, drain, sewer connection or appurtenance thereof, within the city, which is in any way connected to, or will discharge to or into, any public sewer or drain in the city, or is intended in the future to be so connected or to so discharge, until such person has applied for and secured from the director of water pollution control a permit for such work. 
C.  Permits will only be issued to drainlayers licensed to lay drains in the city, except that a permit may be issued to a homeowner for work on his or her own home if the director determines that such person is capable of performing the work in compliance with this chapter. No permit shall be issued, except in cases of emergency, to dig up or make any excavation in a public way until the applicant files with the director proof of notification to all existing public utilities. The issuance of a sewer service line permit shall be contingent upon the drainlayer indemnifying the city against any loss or damage that may be caused by the installation of the sewer service line and its function. No permit shall be issued to any drainlayer for work hereunder, unless he or she has filed with the director and the finance director a certificate of insurance (indemnity) in minimum amounts as follows: 
Public liability $100,000 - $300,000 Property damage $50,000 - $100,000  
    Such insurance shall be maintained during those times that work is being performed pursuant to this chapter. Drainlayers shall post a bond payable to the finance director in the amount of five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) to guarantee satisfactory completion of their work. 
D.  The following may construct, repair, alter or remove sewers and drains, subject to supervision and approval of the director: 
1.  The city, its agents, servants or employees, and contractors engaged by it; 
2.  Any public utility corporation or company authorized by law to install, construct, maintain and utilize pipes, conduits, ducts or cables in highways within the city while engaged in work incidental to its regular and normal operation.

3.  A licensed drainlayer or contractor working for private parties. 
E.  The limitations as to who may construct, alter or repair sewers, drains and sewer service lines shall not restrict the usual work of plumbers or others when operating in accordance with the plumbing and building laws, rules and regulations of the city or the state, provided that no drainlayer or other person shall make any connection to any public sewer or drain of the city without a permit therefor. 
F.  Each owner and contractor shall be responsible for the faithful performance of all work performed under any license or permit issued to either for the conduct of all work and for all materials furnished on work by the employees or agents of either. No work shall be sublet by a contractor under any permit or license issued to it in any manner to relieve such contractor of primary responsibility for all materials used in such work and for competent and workmanlike performance of such work. Only competent persons shall be employed on work performed under such a permit or license and only suitable material conforming to the standards established by the city shall be used on such work. 
G.  Should the director find that any owner or contractor has failed to conform to the requirements of this chapter or the rules and regulations of any permit or license issued hereunder, or that such owner or contractor has not been faithful in the performance of work or the furnishing of materials under such permit or license, or that the work being performed constitutes a safety hazard to the public, the city may revoke or suspend such permit or license, or both. The city may, in such event, take appropriate action against any bond furnished in relation to such work and such other action as may be lawful and appropriate. 
H.  Every application for a permit or license made under this chapter shall be in writing on forms to be provided by the director for that purpose and shall be signed by the licensed applicant, his or her agent, servant or authorized employee.

No person shall place, deposit or permit to be deposited in an unsanitary manner upon public or private property within the city, or in any area under the jurisdiction of the city, any human or animal excrement, garbage or other objectionable waste, or any substance which causes any interference or pass-through, as defined by federal regulations. 
B.  No person shall discharge into any natural outlet within the city, or in any area under the jurisdiction of the city, any waste water or other polluted waters, except where suitable treatment has been provided in accordance with subsequent provisions of this chapter, except that the director of water pollution control may waive this provision if he or she deems it in the best interest of the city for persons possessing a permit from the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the United States Environmental Protection Agency or the Rhode Island Department of Health, Division of Water Pollution Control. 
C.  The owner of all properties used for human occupancy, employment, recreation or other purposes intended for the benefit of human beings, situated within the city and abutting on any street, alley or right-of-way in which there is now located, or in the future will be located, a public sanitary sewer in the city, shall, at his or her expense, connect sanitary sewerage facilities directly with such sewer or make provision for such connection to a known proposed sewer in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, provided that such public sewer is determined to be accessible and available by the director. The director may, in writing, order any owner or occupant to fill up and destroy any cesspool, privy vault, drain or other arrangement on such land for the reception of sewage. Service of such order may be made personally upon such owner or occupant or by certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid. Upon the service of any such order, or a copy thereof, upon any such owner or occupant to connect the sewage as aforesaid, or to fill up or destroy any cesspool, privy vault, drain or other arrangement for the reception of sewage, such owner or occupant shall comply therewith within thirty (30) days from the time of service of such order or within such extended period as the director may determine. If noncompliance continues for forty-five (45) days after service of such order, the director may cause such cesspool, privy vault, drain or other arrangement for the reception of sewage which is the subject of such order to be filled up and destroyed and the sewage from such land to be connected with a public sewer or interceptor. The pendency of any appeal from any such order shall not affect the power of the director, after the expiration of such period of forty-five (45) days, to cause such cesspool, privy vault, drain or other arrangement for the reception of sewage to be forthwith filled up and destroyed. Such remedy shall be in addition to the penalty provided in Section 13.08.200. 
D.  Whenever the director causes any cesspool, privy vault, drain or other arrangement for the reception of sewage to be connected with a public sewer, he or she shall keep careful account of the cost of such work and of any expense necessarily incurred by the city by reason of such noncompliance with such order, and upon the completion of such work, the director shall file a statement of such cost and expense with the finance director and thereupon the amount of such cost and expense shall be charged to the offending party and such charge shall become a lien upon the land, including improvements thereon, for which such cost and expense were incurred and the same may be collected in such manner as may be permitted by law. 
E.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the director, upon application, may extend the period for connection by reason of poverty or physical or mental incapacity of the offending party. 
(Prior code § 1040.05) 
13.08.120. - Use of public sewers. 
A.  No person shall discharge into or put into any public sewer or drain of the city, or into any sewer, drain or fixtures which thereafter discharge into any public sewer, drain or appurtenance thereof, any waste or substance other than such kinds or types of water or water-carried wastes for the conveyance of which the particular sewer, drain or appurtenance is intended, designed or adapted. 
B.  Except as specifically provided with reference to some particular sewer, sanitary sewers shall be used only for the conveyance and disposal of sanitary sewage. No sanitary sewer shall be used to receive and convey or dispose of any storm or surface water, subsoil drainage, any continuous flow of water seeping into buildings or excavations from soils or underground sources, flows of natural springs or ground waters, surplus from flowing wells, or the discharges from roofs, roof conductions, yard drains or street or highway drains. Noncontact cooling waters shall also be excluded except that the director, upon a finding or special circumstnaces, may permit their discharge into a sanitary sewer. 
C.  Storm water and all other unpolluted drainage shall be discharged into storm sewers or into a natural outlet approved by the director. Noncontact industrial cooling water or unpolluted process waters may be discharged, upon approval by the director, into a storm sewer or natural outlet. However, no material, the discharge of which into natural streams, ponds, lakes or other natural bodies of water is prohibited by state or federal law or regulations, shall be discharged into any storm sewer. 
D.  If the proceedings for the layout and con-struction of any particular sewer or for its acquisition by the city do not indicate what kind of sewer or drain it is or was to be or what wastes could or could not be discharged therein, the director shall consider the pertinent facts and determine what kind of sewer or drain such sewer is to be considered for the application of the provisions of this chapter and what waste or waste waters shall be permitted to be discharged thereinto or shall be excluded therefrom. 
E.  The fact that wastes have been discharged into a particular sewer which was not intended or designed for that purpose shall not create a right to continue to so discharge, unless such discharge is permitted by this chapter. 
F.  The sewage flow from a structure served by a private water supply which subsequently discharges, directly or indirectly, into the public sewer, shall be estimated on a per capita or fixture unit basis, or shall be metered at the owner's expense, and such owner shall be responsible for the upkeep and maintenance of the meter or metering equipment.

    Pollutants, substances, or wastewater prohibited by this section shall not be processed or stored in such a manner that they could be discharged to the NWPCF. 
C.  National Categorical Pretreatment Standards. The categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N, Parts 405-471 are incorporated. 
1.  Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the director may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(c). 
2.  When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the director shall impose an alternate limit using the combined wastestream formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e). 
3.  A user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment standard if the user can prove, pursuant to the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.13, that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by EPA when developing the categorical pretreatment standard. 
4.  A user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15. 
D.  Local Limits. The following pollutant limits are established to protect against pass through and interference. No person shall discharge wastewater containing in excess of the following daily maximum limitations in mg/l (unless otherwise noted):

These records must be provided to the director or other authorized city inspector on demand, and must be kept for a minimum of three years. Collected materials shall not be introduced into the NWPCF and must be disposed of through a privately hired rendering service. Records of such rendering service use must be provided to the director or other authorized city inspector on demand. 
d.  All existing establishments must have installed recovery devices according to the aforementioned conditions within a year of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter. 
4.  Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter. 
C.  Within one year of being designated as significant industrial user (SIU), all SIU's will be evaluated on whether or not each SIU needs a plan or procedure to control slug discharges. The director may require any user to develop, submit for approval, and implement such a plan. Alternatively, the director may develop such a plan for any user. An accidental discharge/slug control plan shall address, at a minimum, the following: 
1.  Description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch discharges; 
2.  Description of stored chemicals; 
3.  Procedures for immediately notifying the director of any accidental or slug discharge, as required by Section 13.10.080(F) of this chapter; and

Such waste shall not violate Section 13.10.040 of this chapter or any other requirements established by the city. The director may require currently licensed waste disposal contractors to obtain wastewater discharge permits. 
2.  The director shall require haulers of industrial waste to obtain wastewater discharge permits. The director may require generators of hauled industrial waste to obtain wastewater discharge permits. The director also may prohibit the disposal of hauled industrial waste. The discharge of hauled industrial waste is subject to all other requirements of this chapter. 
3.  Industrial waste haulers may discharge loads only at locations designated by the director. No load may be discharged without prior consent of the director. City staff may collect samples of each hauled load to ensure compliance with applicable standards. The director may require the industrial waste hauler to provide a waste analysis of any load prior to discharge. 
4.  Industrial waste haulers must provide a waste-tracking form for every load. This form shall include, at a minimum, the name and address of the industrial waste hauler, permit number, truck identification, names and addresses of sources of waste, and volume and characteristics of waste. The form shall identify the type of industry, known or suspected waste constituents, and whether any wastes are RCRA hazardous wastes.

13.10.080. - Reporting requirements. 
A.  Baseline Monitoring Reports. 
1.  Within either one hundred eighty (180) days after the effective date of a categorical pretreatment standard, or the final administrative decision on a category determination under 40 CFR 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing categorical users currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge to the NWPCF shall submit to the director a report which contains the information listed in subsection B of this section. At least ninety (90) days prior to commencement of their discharge, new sources, and sources that become categorical users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable categorical standard, shall submit to the director a report which contains the information listed in subsection B of this section. A new source shall report the method of pretreatment it intends to use to meet applicable categorical standards. A new source also shall give estimates of its anticipated flow and quantity of pollutants to be discharged. 
2.  Users described above shall submit the information set forth below. 
a.  Identifying Information. The name and address of the facility, including the name of the operator and owner. 
b.  Environmental Permits. A list of any environmental control permits held by or for the facility. 
c.  Description of Operations. A brief description of the nature, average rate of production, and standard industrial classifications of the operation(s) carried out by such user. This description should include a schematic process diagram which indicates points of discharge to the NWPCF from the regulated processes. 
d.  Flow Measurement. Information showing the measured average daily and maximum daily flow, in gallons per day, to the NWPCF from regulated process streams and other streams, as necessary, to allow use of the combined wastestream formula set out in 40 CFR 403.6(e). 
e.  Measurement of Pollutants. 
i.  The categorical pretreatment standards applicable to each regulated process. 
ii.  The results of sampling and analysis identifying the nature and concentration, and/or mass, where required by the standard or by the director, of regulated pollutants in the discharge from each regulated process. Instantaneous, daily maximum, and long-term average concentrations, or mass, where required, shall be reported. The sample shall be representative of daily operations and shall be analyzed in accordance with procedures set out in subsection J of this section. In cases where the standard requires compliance with a best management practice or pollution prevention alternative, the user shall submit documentation as required by the city or the applicable standards to determine compliance with the standard. 
iii.  Sampling must be performed in accordance with procedures set out in subsection K of this section. 
f.  Certification. A statement, reviewed by the user's authorized representative and certified by a qualified professional, indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not, whether additional operation and maintenance (O and M) and/or additional pretreatment is required to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements. 
g.  Compliance Schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or O and M will be required to meet the pretreatment standards, the shortest schedule by which the user will provide such additional pretreatment and/or O and M. The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment standard. A compliance schedule pursuant to this section must meet the requirements set out in subsection B of this section. 
h.  Signature and Certification. All baseline monitoring reports must be signed and certified in accordance with Section 13.10.060(F). 
B.  Compliance Schedule Progress Reports. The following conditions shall apply to the compliance schedule required by subsection (A)(2)(g) of this section: 
1.  The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the applicable pretreatment standards (such events include, but are not limited to, hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts for major components, commencing and completing construction, and beginning and conducting routine operation); 
2.  No increment referred to above shall exceed nine months; 
3.  The user shall submit a progress report to the director no later than fourteen (14) days following each date in the schedule and the final date of compliance including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if appropriate, the steps being taken by the user to return to the established schedule; and 
4.  In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such progress reports to the director. 
C.  Reports on Compliance with Categorical Pretreatment Standard Deadline. Within ninety (90) days following the date for final compliance with applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the NWPCF, any user subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the director a report containing the information described in subsections (A)(2)(d) through (A)(2)(f) of this section. For users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR 403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long-term production rate. For all other users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. All compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with Section 13.10.060. In cases where the pretreatment standard requires compliance with a best management practice or pollution prevention alternative, the user shall submit documentation required by the city or the pretreatment standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the user. At the discretion of the city and in consideration of such factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, etc., the city may modify the months during which the above reports are to be submitted. 
D.  Periodic Compliance Reports. 
1.  All significant industrial users shall, at a frequency determined by the director but in no case less than twice per year (in June and December), submit a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by pretreatment standards and the measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with Section 13.10.060(F). In cases where a local limit requires compliance with a best management practice or pollution prevention alternative, the user may submit documentation required by the city to determine compliance status of the user. 
2.  All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. 
3.  If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the director, using the procedures prescribed in subsection K of this section, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report. 
E.  Reports of Changed Conditions. Each user must notify the director of any planned significant changes to the user's operations or system which might alter the nature, quality, or volume of its wastewater at least thirty (30) days before the change. 
1.  The director may require the user to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under Section 13.10.060(E). 
2.  The director may issue a wastewater discharge permit under Section 13.10.060(G) or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit under Section 13.10.070(D) in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions. 
3.  For purposes of this requirement, significant changes include, but are not limited to, flow increases of twenty (20) percent or greater, and the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants. 
F.  Reports of Potential Problems. 
1.  In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a noncustomary batch discharge, or a slug load, that may cause potential problems for the NWPCF, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the director of the incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the user. 
2.  Within five days following such discharge, the user shall, unless waived by the director, submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the NWPCF, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this chapter. 
3.  A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a discharge described in subsection A of this section. Employers shall ensure that all employees, who may cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the emergency notification procedure. 
G.  Reports from Unpermitted Users. All users not required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the director as the director may require. 
H.  Notice of Violation/Repeat Sampling and Reporting. If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify the director within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the director within thirty (30) days after becoming aware of the violation. The user is not required to resample if the director monitors at the user's facility at least once a month, or if the director samples between the user's initial sampling and when the user receives the results of this sampling. 
I.  Notification of the Discharge of Hazardous Waste. 
1.  Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the NWPCF, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division director, and state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the NWPCF of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than one hundred (100) kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the NWPCF, the notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following twelve (12) months. All notifications must take place no later than one hundred eighty (180) days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this paragraph need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under subsection E of this section. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of subsections A, B, and D of this section. 
2.  Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of subsection A of this section, during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than fifteen (15) kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than fifteen (15) kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
3.  In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the director, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within ninety (90) days of the effective date of such regulations. 
4.  In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. 
5.  This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this ordinance, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law. 
J.  Analytical Requirements. All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by EPA. 
K.  Sample Collection. 
1.  Except as indicated in Section B, below, the user must collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection techniques. In the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the director may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits. 
2.  Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques. 
L.  Timing. Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern. 
M.  Users subject to the reporting requirements of this chapter shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this chapter and any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements, including documentation associated with best management practices. Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or the city, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the director. 
(Ord. 2008-37 § 1 (part), 2008; Ord. 2000-22 § 1, 2000) 
13.10.090. - Compliance monitoring. 
A.  Right of Entry-Inspection and Sampling. The director shall have the right to enter the premises of any user to determine whether the user is complying with all requirements of this ordinance and any wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder. Users shall allow the director ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties. 
1.  Where a user has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, the director will be permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities. 
2.  The director shall have the right to set up on the user's property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the user's operations. 
3.  The director may require the user to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the user at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated at the manufacturer's recommended frequency to ensure their accuracy. 
4.  Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user at the written or verbal request of the director shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be born by the user. 
5.  Unreasonable delays in allowing access to the user's premises shall be a violation of this chapter. 
B.  Search Warrants. If the access to a building, structure, or property, or any part thereof has been refused, and there is probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program of the city designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the director may seek issuance of a search warrant from the Municipal Court of the city. 
(Ord. 2000-22 § 1, 2000) 
13.10.100. - Confidential information. 
    Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge permits, and monitoring programs, and from the direct inspection and sampling activities, shall be available to the public without restriction, unless the user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the director, that the release of such information would divulge information, processes, or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable state law. Any such request must be asserted at the time of submission of the information or data. When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that such information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to the RIPDES program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other "effluent data" as defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will not be recognized as confidential information and will be available to the public without restriction. 
(Ord. 2000-22 § 1, 2000) 
13.10.110. - Publication of users in significant noncompliance. 
    The director shall publish annually, in the largest daily newspaper published in the municipality where the NWPCF is located, a list of the users which, during the previous twelve (12) months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. The term significant noncompliance shall mean: 
1.  Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those in which sixty-six (66) percent or more of all of the measurements taken for the same pollutant parameter during a six-month period exceed (by any magnitude) a numeric pretreatment standard or requirement, including instantaneous limits, as defined by 40 CFR 403.3(1); 
2.  Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in which thirty-three (33) percent or more of all of the measurements taken for the same pollutant parameter during a six-month period equal or exceed the product of the numeric pretreatment standard or requirement, including instantaneous limits, as defined by 40 CFR 403.3(1) multiplied by the applicable TRC (TRC-1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oil, and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH); 
3.  Any other violation of a pretreatment standard or requirement as defined by 40 CFR 403.3(1) (daily maximum, long-term average, instantaneous limit, or narrative standard) that the POTW determines has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference, or pass through including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public; 
4.  Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment to the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the director exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge; 
5.  Failure to meet, within ninety (90) days of the scheduled date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final compliance; 
6.  Failure to provide within thirty (30) days after the due date, any required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules; 
7.  Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or 
8.  Any other violation(s) which the director determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program. 
(Ord. 2008-37 § 1 (part), 2008; Ord. 2000-22 § 1, 2000) 
13.10.120. - Administrative enforcement remedies. 
A.  Notification of Violation. When the director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this ordinance, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the director may serve upon that user a written notice of violation. Within ten days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the director. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the director to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation. 
B.  Consent Orders. The director may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to Sections 13.10.120(D) and 13.10.120(E) of this chapter and shall be judicially enforceable. 
C.  Show Cause Hearing. The director may order a user which has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the Newport city council and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least seven days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
D.  Compliance Orders. Compliance orders will be issued by the utilities director to achieve or restore to compliance by a date certain. These orders may be negotiated with the user or required by the utilities director. These orders may be issued when a user has neglected or refused to develop or comply with the conditions of the Industrial Pretreatment Program, spill prevention programs and/or related city of Newport sewer use chapters. 
    The utilities director or his or her designee will prepare the compliance order. The compliance order outlines the noncompliance and the required corrective actions to be accomplished by date certain. Compliance orders may by accompanied by an assessment of an administrative fine. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
E.  Cease and Desist Orders. When the director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the director may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to: 
1.  Immediately comply with all requirements; and 
2.  Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. 
    Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
F.  Administrative Fines. 
1.  When the director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the director may fine such user in an amount not to exceed twenty-five thousand ($25,000) dollars. Such fines shall be assessed on a per violation, per day basis. In the case of monthly or other long term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation. 
2.  Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after thirty (30) calendar days, be assessed an additional penalty of ten percent according to the provisions of the City of Newport Codified Ordinances. The city reserves the right to impose a lien against the user's property for unpaid charges, fines, and penalties. 
3.  Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for the director to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine amount within thirty (30) days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has merit, the director may convene a hearing on the matter. In the event the user's appeal is successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user. The director may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine. 
4.  Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
G.  Emergency Suspensions. The director may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The director may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the NWPCF, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment. 
1.  Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the director may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the NWPCF, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The director may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the director that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in Section 13.10.120H are initiated against the user. 
2.  A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the director prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under Sections 13.10.120C or 13.10.120H. 
    Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section. 
H.  Termination of Discharge. In addition to the provisions in Section 13.10.070F, any user who violates the following conditions is subject to discharge termination: 
1.  Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions; 
2.  Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge; 
3.  Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge; 
4.  Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or 
5.  Violation of the pretreatment standards in Section 13.10.040. 
    Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under Section 13.10.120C why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the director shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(Ord. 2000-22 § 1, 2000) 
13.10.130. - Judicial enforcement remedies. 
A.  Injunctive Relief. When the director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the director may petition the Newport municipal court though the city's attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this chapter on activities of the user. The director may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. 
B.  Civil Penalties. 
1.  A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to the city for a maximum civil penalty of not less than twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00) per violation, per day. In the case of a monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation. 
2.  The director may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the city. 
3.  In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the violation, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice requires. 
4.  Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. 
C.  Criminal Prosecution. 
1.  A user who willfully or negligently violates any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall, upon conviction, punishable by a fine of not more than twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00) per violation, per day. 
2.  A user who knowingly makes any false statements, representations, or certifications in any application, record, report, plan, or other documentation filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this chapter, wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this chapter shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00) per violation. 
D.  Remedies Nonexclusive. The remedies provided for in this chapter are not exclusive. The director may take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant user, to include injunctive relief for any violation, as well as initiate any appropriate action to recover damages, penalties and associated costs and attorney fees. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the city's enforcement response plan. However, the director may take other action against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the director is empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant user. 
(Ord. 2000-22 § 1, 2000) 
13.10.140. - Supplemental enforcement action. 
A.  Performance Bonds. The director may decline to issue or reissue a wastewater discharge permit to any user who has failed to comply with any provision of this chapter, a previous wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless such user first files a satisfactory bond, payable to the city, in a sum not to exceed a value determined by the director to be necessary to achieve consistent compliance. 
B.  Liability Insurance. The director may decline to issue or reissue a wastewater discharge permit to any user who has failed to comply with any provision of this chapter, a previous wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless the user first submits proof that it has obtained financial assurances sufficient to restore or repair damage to the NWPCF caused by its discharge. 
C.  Water Supply Severance. Whenever a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, water service to the user may be severed. Service will only recommence, at the user's expense, after it has satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to comply. 
D.  Public Nuisances. A violation of any provision of this ordinance, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement is hereby declared a public nuisance and shall be corrected or abated as directed by the director. Any person(s) creating a public nuisance shall be subject to the provisions of this code governing such nuisances, including reimbursing the city for any costs incurred in removing, abating, or remedying said nuisance.

A.  Upset. 
1.  For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
2.  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection (A)(3) of this section are met. 
3.  A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
a.  An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset; 
b.  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and 
c.  The user has submitted the following information to the director within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days): 
i.  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
ii.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
iii.  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
4.  In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
5.  Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
6.  Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails. 
B.  Prohibited Discharge Standards. A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in Section 13.10.040A or the specific prohibitions in Sections 13.10.040(B)(3) through 13.10.040(B)(17) if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either: 
1.  A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or 
2.  No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its RIPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements. 
C.  Bypass. 
1.  For the purposes of this section: 
a.  "Bypass" means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a user's treatment facility; and 
b.  "Severe property damage" means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
2.  A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of subsections (c)(3) and (c)(4) of this section. 
3.  a.  If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the director, at least ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
b.  A user shall submit oral notice to the director of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within twenty-four (24) hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The director may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within twenty-four (24) hours. 
4.  a.  Bypass is prohibited, and the director may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless: 
i.  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
ii.  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
iii.  The user submitted notices as required under paragraph (3) of this section. 
b.  The director may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the director determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsection (4)(a) of this section.

No person shall operate a rooming house unless he or she holds a valid rooming house permit issued by the chief of the division of inspection in the name of the operator and for the specific dwelling or dwelling unit. The operator shall apply to the chief for such permit, which shall be issued by the chief upon compliance by the operator with the applicable provisions of this chapter and any rules and regulations adopted pursuant thereto. This permit shall be displayed in a conspicuous place within the rooming house at all times. No such permit is transferable. Every person holding such a permit shall give notice in writing to the chief within twenty-four (24) hours after having sold, transferred, given away or otherwise disposed of ownership of, interest in or control of any rooming house. Such notice shall include the name and address of the person succeeding to the ownership or control of such rooming house. Every rooming house permit shall expire at the end of one year following its date of issuance, unless sooner suspended or revoked. 
B.  Any person whose application for a permit to operate a rooming house has been denied may request and shall be granted a hearing on the matter before the chief under the procedure provided in Section 15.12.030. 
C.  Whenever, upon inspection of any rooming house, the chief finds that conditions or practices exist which are in violation of any provision of this chapter or of any rule or regulation adopted pursuant thereto, the chief shall give notice in writing to the operator of such rooming house that unless such conditions or practices are corrected within a reasonable period, to be determined by the chief, the operator's rooming house permit will be suspended. At the end of such period, the chief shall reinspect such rooming house, and if he or she finds that such conditions or practices have not been corrected, he or she shall give notice in writing to the operator that the latter's permit has been suspended. Upon receipt of such notice of suspension, such operator shall immediately cease operation of such rooming house, and no person shall occupy for sleeping or living purposes any rooming unit therein. 
D.  Any person whose permit to operate a rooming house has been suspended, or who has received notice from the chief that his or her permit is to be suspended unless existing conditions or practices at his or her rooming house are corrected, may request and shall be granted a hearing on the matter before the chief, under the procedure provided in Section 15.12.030. However, if no petition for such hearing is filed within ten days following the day on which such permit was suspended, such permit shall be deemed to have been automatically revoked. 
E.  At least one flush water closet, lavatory basin and bathtub or shower, properly connected to a water and sewer system approved by the chief and in good working condition, shall be supplied for each eight persons or fraction thereof residing within a rooming house, including members of the operator's family wherever they share the use of such facilities. However, in a rooming house where rooms are let only to males, flush urinals may be substituted for not more than one-half the required number of water closets. All such facilities shall be so located within the dwelling as to be reasonably accessible from a common hall or passageway to all persons sharing such facilities. Every lavatory basin and bathtub or shower shall be supplied with adequate hot water at all times. No such facilities shall be located in a basement except by written approval of the chief. 
F.  The operator of every rooming house shall change supplied bed linen and towels therein at least once every week and prior to the letting of any room to any occupant. The operator shall be responsible for the maintenance of all supplied bedding in a clean and sanitary manner. 
G.  Every room occupied for sleeping purposes by one person shall contain at least seventy (70) square feet of floor space, and every room occupied for sleeping purposes by more than one person shall contain at least fifty (50) square feet of floor space for each occupant thereof. 
H.  Every rooming unit shall have safe, unobstructed means of egress leading to safe and open space at ground level, as required by the laws of the state and the city. 
I.  The operator of every rooming house shall be responsible for the sanitary maintenance of all walls, floors and ceilings and for maintenance of a sanitary condition in every other part of the rooming house. He or she shall be further responsible for the sanitary maintenance of the entire premises where the entire structure or building is leased or occupied by the operator. 
J.  Every provision of this chapter which applies to rooming houses shall also apply to hotels, except to the extent that any such provision may be found to be in conflict with the laws of the state or the lawful regulations of any state board or agency.

Chapter 15.24. - FLOOD HAZARD AREA DEVELOPMENT[1] 

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Section 1 of Ord. No. 2010-07, adopted March 10, 2010, deleted Ch. 15.24, and added in lieu thereof, provisions to read as herein set out. Former Ch. 15.24 consisted of §§ 15.24.010-15.24.100, pertained to the same subject matter and derived from the prior code and Ord. No. 16-90, 1990. 

15.24.010. - Statement of purpose. 
    The purpose of this chapter is to ensure public safety; minimize hazards to persons and property from flooding, to protect watercourses from encroachment, and to maintain the capability of floodplains to retain and carry off floodwaters. This chapter and accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM) assure City of Newport compliance with the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (P.L. 90-488, as amended). 
(Ord. No. 2010-07, § 1, 3-10-2010) 
15.24.020. - Applicability. 
A.  The special flood hazard areas are herein established as a floodplain overlay district. The district includes all special flood hazard areas within the City of Newport designated as Zone A, AE, AH, AO, A99, V, or VE on the Newport County Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) and Digital FIRM issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for the administration of the National Flood Insurance Program. The map panels of the Newport County FIRM that are wholly or partially within the City of Newport are panel numbers 44005C0089J, 44005C0093J, 44005C0176J, 44005C0177J, 44005C0178J, 4005C0179J, 44005C0179, 44005C0181J and 44005C0183J, dated September 4, 2013. The exact boundaries of the district may be defined by the 100-year base flood elevations shown on the FIRM and further defined by the Newport County Flood Insurance Study (FIS) report dated September 4, 2013. The department of zoning and inspections is responsible for floodplain management. The FIRM and FIS report and any revisions thereto are incorporated herein by reference and are on file with the building official. 
B.  Building Permit. All proposed construction or other development within a special flood hazard area shall require a permit. 
    The National Flood Insurance Program Special Flood Hazard Area requires permits for all projects that meet the definition of development, not just "building" projects. Development projects include any filling, grading, excavation, mining, drilling, storage of materials, temporary stream crossings. If the construction or other development within a special flood hazard area is not covered by a building permit, all other non-structural activities shall be permitted by either the Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council and/or the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management as applicable. Therefore if another state agency issues a permit, the local building official must have the opportunity for input and keep a copy of the respective permit in their files. 
    Prior to the issuance of a building or development permit, the applicant shall submit evidence that all necessary permits and approvals have been received from all government agencies from which approval is required by federal or state law. 
    A permit fee (based on the cost of the construction) may be required to be paid to the City of Newport and a copy of a receipt for the same shall accompany the application. An additional fee may be charged if the code enforcement officer and/or board of appeals needs the assistance of a professional engineer." 
    A flood hazard development permit fee of one hundred dollars ($100.00) is required to be paid to the City of Newport and a copy of a receipt for the same shall accompany the application. An additional fee may be charged if the code enforcement officer and/or board of appeals need the assistance of a professional engineer. 
    Cost. As related to substantial improvements, the final arbiter of cost is the building official. 
    Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection required by the ordinance is considered reasonable but does not imply total flood protection. 
    Exemptions. Certain provisions of the special flood area development may not apply to historic structures. Authorities having jurisdiction over historic structures, e.g., state historic preservation officer, local preservation planner, may be consulted to determine if the proposed work allows the structure to retain its established historic designation. If the structure does not retain its established historic designation, the special flood area development standards apply. 
    Severability. If any section, provision, or portion of this chapter is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court, the remainder of the ordinance shall not be affected. 
    Abrogation and Greater Restriction. This chapter shall not in any way impair/remove the necessity of compliance with any other applicable laws, ordinances, regulations, etc. Where this chapter imposes a greater restriction, the provisions of this chapter shall control. 
    Enforcement. The building official shall enforce all provisions as applicable in reference to RIGL § 23-27.3-108.1. 
    Penalties. Every person who shall violate any provision of this code shall be subject to penalties put forth in RIGL § 23-27.3-122.3. 
(Ord. No. 2010-07, § 1, 3-10-2010; Ord. No. 2013-010, § 1, 8-28-2013)

This term includes structures that have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. For purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however, include either: 
1.  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 
2.  Any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure". 
    "Variance" means a grant of relief by a community from the terms of the floodplain management ordinance that allows construction in a manner otherwise prohibited and where specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. 
    "Violation" means failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management ordinance. A structure or other development without required permits, lowest floor elevation documentation, flood-proofing certificates or required floodway encroachment calculations is resumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

Chapter 15.26. - SOIL EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL 

15.26.010. - Purpose. 
A.  The Newport city council finds that excessive quantities of soil are eroding from certain areas that are undergoing development for nonagricultural uses such as housing developments, industrial areas, recreational facilities, and roads. Soil erosion necessitates: costly repairs to gullies, unnecessary cleaning of storm drains and catch basins; and results in washed out fills, roadways, and embankments. Moreover, the resulting sediment clogs the storm sewer systems and road swales, muddies streams, leaves deposits of silt in ponds and reservoirs, and is considered a major water pollutant by state and federal agencies. 
B.  The purpose of this chapter is to prevent soil erosion and sedimentation from occurring as a result of nonagricultural development within the city of Newport by requiring the use of appropriate best management practices (BMP), proper provisions for water disposal, and the protection of soil surfaces during and after construction, in order to safeguard persons, protect property, prevent damage to the environment and promote the general welfare of the city of Newport. This chapter is established in accordance with R.I. General Laws, Section 45-46-3, Soil Erosion and Sediment Control. 
C.  This chapter provides for a determination of applicability to be made by the director of public works or designee. The purpose of the determination of applicability is to determine whether a soil erosion and sediment control plan is required from a petitioner who desires to engage in soil disturbing activities. The ordinance codified in this chapter further defines minimum requirement for such plans, and establishes review and approval procedures.

Five copies of the plan shall be submitted to the director of public works or designee. 
B.  Plan Contents. The soil erosion and sediment control plan shall include sufficient information about the proposed activities and land parcel(s) to form a clear basis for discussion and review and to assure compliance with all applicable requirements of this chapter. The plan shall be consistent with the data collection, data analysis, and plan preparation guidelines in the current "Rhode Island Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook," prepared by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service, R.I. Department of Environmental Management, R.I. State Conservation Committee, and at a minimum, shall contain: 
1.  Narrative. A narrative describing the proposed land disturbing activity and the soil erosion and sediment control measures and stormwater management measures to be installed to control erosion that could result from the proposed activity. Supporting documentation, such as a drainage area, existing site, and soil maps shall be provided as required by the director of public works or designee. 
2.  Construction Drawings. Construction drawings illustrating in detail existing and proposed contours, drainage features, and vegetation; limits of clearing and grading, the location of soil erosion and sediment control and stormwater management measures, detail drawings of measures; stock piles and borrow areas; sequence and staging of land disturbing activities; and other information needed for construction. 
3.  Erosion and Sediment Controls. A description, including construction details appropriate to the site, for both vegetative and structural practices. Vegetative BMPs are designed to preserve exiting vegetation where attainable and revegetate open areas as soon as practicable after construction or grading. Structural BMPs divert flows from exposed soils, filter runoff, storm flows or otherwise limit runoff from coming into contact with exposed, unvegetated areas of the site and to prevent sediments and/or other pollutants from leaving the site. 
4.  Other Information. Other information or construction plans and details as deemed necessary by the director of public works or designee for a thorough review of the plan prior to action being taken as prescribed in this chapter. Withholding or delay of information may be reasons for the director of public works or designee, to judge the application as incomplete and providing grounds for disapproval of the application. 
5.  Maintenance. A description of procedures to maintain, in good and effective operating condition, vegetation, stormwater control measures, and other protective measures identified in the site plan.

Before approving an erosion sediment control plan, the director of public works or designee may require the applicant/owner to file a surety company performance bond, deposit of money, negotiable securities, or other method of performance guarantee as specified by the director of public works or designee. When any land disturbing activity is to take place within one hundred (100) feet of any watercourse, water body, or coastal feature or within an identified flood hazard district, or on slopes in excess of ten (10) percent, the filing of a performance bond shall be required. The amount of the bond, as determined by the public works department, shall be sufficient to cover the cost of implementing all erosion and sediment control measures as shown on the plan. 
2.  The bond, performance guarantee, or negotiable security filed by the applicant shall be subject to approval of form, content, amount, and manner of execution by the director of public works as well as the city solicitor. 
3.  A performance bond for an erosion sediment control plan for a subdivision may be included in the requisite performance bond of the subdivision. The posting of the bond as part of the subdivision performance bond does not, however, relieve the owner of any requirements of this chapter. 
B.  Notice of Default on Performance Secured by Bond. 
1.  Whenever the director of public works or designee finds that a default has occurred in the performance of any terms or conditions of the bond or in the implementation of measures secured by the bond, written notice shall be made to the applicant and to the surety of the bond by the city solicitor. The notice shall state the nature of default, work to be done, the estimated cost, and the period of time deemed by the director of public works or designee to be reasonably necessary for the completion of the work. 
2.  Failure of the applicant to acknowledge and comply with the provisions and deadlines outlined in the notice of default will result, without further notice of proceedings whatsoever, in the institution of the city solicitor of appropriate measures to utilize the performance bond, to cause the required work to be completed by the city of Newport, by contract or through other appropriate means as determined by the city solicitor. 
C.  Notice of default on performance secured by cash or negotiable securities deposit. If a cash or negotiable securities deposit has been posted by the applicant, notice and procedure are the same as provided for in subsection (A)(3) of this section. 
D.  Release from Performance Bond Conditions. The performance bonding requirement shall remain in full force and effect for twelve (12) months following completion of the project, or longer if deemed necessary by the director of public works or designee. The applicant/owner may request the release of his/her performance bond from the director of public works twelve (12) months after the final site inspection has been completed and approved.

H.  Wetlands. Except as otherwise provided in the R-60, R-120 and R-160 districts, no main structure shall be located within one hundred (100) feet of the mean high water level of tidal waters or within one hundred (100) feet of a wetland so designated by the State Department of Environmental Management and no septic system or any part thereof shall be located within two hundred (200) feet of the mean high water level of tidal waters or within two hundred (200) feet of a wetland so designated by the State Department of Environmental Management. 
I.  Off-street Parking and Loading. It is the intent of the off-street parking and loading provisions to ensure that off-street parking and loading spaces are provided to accommodate the motor vehicles of all persons normally using or visiting a use or structure at any one time. For any permitted use, to include changes from one permitted use to another permitted use, such spaces shall be provided in accordance with the standards hereinafter specified and as amended. However, if the existing and proposed uses are permitted by right and the change of use is occurring within a structure that exists at the time of the adoption of this amendment, (Ord. No. 2010-25), and the new use requires an equal or less amount of off-street parking as required under other provisions of this Code, then such additional spaces shall not be required. All spaces required to be provided by this zoning code shall be permanently maintained and made available for occupancy in connection with and for the full duration of the use of land or structures for which such spaces are herein required. 
J.  Damage or Destruction. For any existing conforming or legally nonconforming building or use which subsequently thereto is damaged or destroyed by fire, collapse, explosion or other cause, and which is reconstructed, reestablished or repaired within one year, off-street parking or loading facilities need not be provided within such period of reconstruction, re-establishment or repair; except that parking or loading shall be restored or continued in operation. However, in no case shall it be necessary to restore or maintain parking or loading facilities in excess of those required by this zoning code for equivalent new uses or construction. 
    In those instances where the building official certifies that the condition of the building is structurally unsound and a hazardous safety situation to the general public exists, the preceding approval process need not be followed.

Chapter 17.72. - SUBSTANDARD LOTS AND NONCONFORMING USES 

17.72.010. - Substandard lots of record. 
A.  Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 17.72.030(C) to the contrary, a permitted use by right may be established on a single lot of record on the effective date of adoption or amendment of the zoning code, regardless of lot area or width, provided there is compliance with the limitations imposed by other provisions of this zoning code or relief from the same is obtained by way of a dimensional variance provided, however, where such substandard original lot is unimproved and has one or more common boundaries with another unimproved lot owned by the same owner or his/her affiliate, such lots shall be combined in accordance with the provisions of this section. 
B.  If two or more unimproved lots or combinations of such lots or portions of such lots with continuous frontage in single ownership are of record at the time of passage or amendment of this zoning code, and if all or parts of the lots do not meet the requirements established for lot width and area, and a building or other use is proposed which utilizes such lots in combination, the land involved shall be consolidated. In this manner no portion of the lot created through consolidation may be used or sold in a manner which diminishes compliance with any of the requirements established by this zoning code. 
C.  If three or more unimproved lots or parcels of land in any residential zoning district, having one or more than one common boundary with another lot owned by the same owner or his/her or its affiliate, and one or more of these lots fails to meet the requirements established by zoning code for minimum lot width and area, such unimproved lots shall be considered to be an individual, undivided parcel of land for the purpose of this chapter. If the total lot width or lot area of such contiguous unimproved lots of record is less than required by this zoning code, such lots may be considered as a single nonconforming lot of record for the purpose of this chapter. 
D.  The provisions of subsections B and C of this section do not apply to any lot which has been assessed as a separate tax assessor's lot and which contains at least eighty thousand (80,000) square feet. 
E.  The provisions of this section shall apply to all the districts specified in this zoning code and in merging substandard lots of record consideration shall be given to the availability of infrastructure, the character of the neighborhood, and the consistency with the comprehensive plan.

17.72.020. - Nonconforming development. 
    Within the districts established by this zoning code or by amendments that may later be adopted there exist or may exist uses, structures or lots which were lawful before this zoning code was passed or amended, but which would be noncomplying under the provisions of this zoning code or any such amendment. Such uses, structures and lots are termed nonconformities. It is the intent of this chapter to permit these nonconformities to continue until they are removed or abandoned. Abandonment of a nonconforming use shall consist of some overt act, or failure to act, which would lead one to believe that the owner of the nonconforming use neither claims nor retains any interest in continuing the nonconforming use unless the owner can demonstrate an intent not to abandon the use. An involuntary interruption of nonconforming use, such as by fire and natural catastrophe, does not establish the intent to abandon the nonconforming use, however, if any nonconforming use is halted for a period of one year, the nonconforming use will be presumed to have been abandoned, unless that presumption is rebutted by the presentation of sufficient evidence of intent not to abandon the use.

17.72.030. - Alteration to nonconforming development. 
A.  Nothing in this zoning code shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any structure or part thereof declared to be unsafe by decree of any official charged with protecting the public safety, provided that such work does not increase the nonconformity thereof. Nothing in this zoning code shall be deemed to prohibit ordinary repair and maintenance of a nonconforming structure or replacement of existing materials, provided that such work does not increase the nonconformity thereof. 
B.  No nonconforming use of land shall be moved to another part of a lot or outside the lot, and no nonconforming use of a building shall be moved or extended to any other part of the building not expressly arranged and designed for such use at the time the use became nonconforming, and no building containing a nonconforming use shall be moved, unless the result of such move is to end the nonconformity. No nonconforming building shall be moved, unless the result of such moving is to reduce or eliminate its nonconformity. 
C.  Nonconforming by Use. No nonconforming use of land or nonconforming use of a structure shall be changed except to a conforming use or structure. No nonconforming use of land or nonconforming use of a structure, if once changed to conform, shall thereafter be changed so as to be nonconforming by use again. 
    Dimensionally Nonconforming-Excepting Proposed Decks (as defined in the Rhode Island State Building Code and regulations adopted thereby). Alteration to dimensionally nonconforming structures that otherwise conform to the use regulations of the zoning district shall be allowed as a matter of right if the alteration in and of itself: (1) conforms to the current dimensional requirements of the zoning district in which the property is located; and (2) does not increase or intensify the element(s) of the dimensional nonconformity. 
    A structure or land which is nonconforming by dimension, but the use of which is a use permitted by right in the district in which the land or structure is located, shall only be altered, changed, enlarged or subject to addition or intensification with respect to its nonconforming element(s) by obtaining a special use permit from the zoning board of review. 
D.  A use established by variance or special use permit shall not acquire the rights of this section.

Chapter 17.74. - HISTORIC STONE WALLS 

17.74.010. - Intent. 
    It is the intent of this chapter to provide for the retention, enhancement, and stabilization of Newport's historic stone walls within the city limits, which are important cultural resources contributing to the aesthetic character of the city. It is not the intent of this chapter to deprive a citizen use of their property, detract from that property's value or cause financial hardship. 
(Ord. No. 2014-020, § 1, 8-27-2014) 
17.74.020. - Definition. 
    For the purpose of this chapter, the following definition shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning. 
    "Historic stone wall" means a human-made linear or curvilinear structure, freestanding or semi-attached to another structure, comprised primarily of aligned, stacked, and/or cemented natural stone, originally constructed in the 17th, 18th, 19th, or early 20th centuries, to designate a property boundary or to segregate activities within a single property. 
(Ord. No. 2014-020, § 1, 8-27-2014) 
17.74.030. - General provisions. 
A.  Alteration or removal of historic stone walls located within a designated historic district shall require prior review and approval from the historic district commission. Alteration or removal of historic stone walls not located within a designated historic district shall require prior review and approval from the planning board. After commission board approval is granted to alter or remove an historic stone wall, the applicant shall obtain any further approvals required by law from the building official, if applicable, prior to work commencing. 
B.  Building and site improvements shall be designed to avoid impacts to historic stone walls to the greatest extent feasible while allowing for reasonable use of property. Special consideration shall be given to the preservation of historic stone walls flanking or abutting city and state roads, demarcating historic burial grounds, and/or contributing to the character of a historic structure or site. 
C.  Alteration to a historic stone wall shall be designed in a way that requires minimal changes to the design, materials, and construction methods that characterize the wall, which may include but not be limited to: coursing, stone type, joint width, stacking pattern, cementation, height, thickness, vertical angle/profile, footprint, end treatments, and pattern of breaks or openings. Alterations shall ensure the structural stability of the wall is maintained.

Chapter 17.76. - SIGNS 

17.76.010. - Intent. 
    There is a need for regulations that recognize the benefits of signage and provide clear guidelines for installation of signs so as to help maintain and complement the City of Newport's diversity of distinct neighborhood, each with its own charm and character: 
The regulation of signs protects public safety by assuring signs do not obstruct lines of sight for drivers or sidewalks for pedestrians; 
Sign regulation promotes general welfare in minimizing accumulation of debris and promoting sensitivity to the physical environment; 
These regulations enhance property values and increase business opportunities through reduction of visual clutter; and 
Sign regulation promotes a heightened aesthetic environment by encouraging distinctive and appealing signs. 
    It is the intent of this chapter to: 
A.  Establish rules and regulations to control and regulate all signs in the city; 
B.  Maintain a high degree of excellence in the quality of all signs; 
C.  Prevent the proliferation of signs which cause visual clutter and disharmony; and 
D.  Encourage a rational pattern of signs with regard to the area where such signs are located to promote community aesthetics and public safety.

Former Ch. 17.80 consisted of §§ 17.80.010-17.80.090, pertained to the same subject matter and derived from the prior code; Ord. 65-94, 1994; Ord. 99-6, 1999; Ord. 99-24, 1999; Ord. 2000-4, 2000; Ord. 2005-20, 2005; Ord. 2006-36, 2006; and Ord. No. 2010-01, adopted Jan. 13, 2010. 

17.80.010. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of historic district zoning in the City of Newport is to protect our historic assets and to guide new growth in ways that enrich and maintain Newport's sense of place and authentic historic character, for now and for future generations. 
    Newport has a remarkable built environment recognized as unique among American cities, including the most extensive collection of extant 17th and 18th century colonial structures in the nation; a broad array of mid-19th century resort architecture, much of it designed by the leading architects of that era; an unparalleled set of elaborate gilded age "cottage" mansions and numerous residential, commercial, military, industrial and institutional buildings reflecting the city's long maritime history. Even more significant is that this environment reflects architectural and social values over centuries of historical development unequalled by any other city in the country. 
    Newport's architectural vitality is dependent on the context within districts including streetscapes, neighborhoods, and vistas as well as the quality and character of individual buildings that make up its districts. 
    The preservation of structures of historic and architectural value and historic cemeteries, wherever located within the City of Newport, are declared to be a public purpose and the city council, by this Chapter, does hereby regulate the construction, alteration, repair, moving, and demolition of these structures within the limits of the designated historic districts of the City of Newport. It is recognized that the purpose of this Chapter is to: 
1.  Safeguard the heritage of the City of Newport by preserving districts in the City of Newport which reflect elements of its cultural, social, economic, political and architectural history; 
2.  Stabilize and improve property values in those districts; 
3.  Foster civic beauty; 
4.  Strengthen the local economy; and 
5.  Promote the use of the historic districts for the education, pleasure, and welfare of the citizens of the City of Newport. 
(Ord. No. 2010-28, § 1, 8-25-2010) 
17.80.020. - Definitions. 
    The following terms shall have the following meanings: 
    "Alteration" means an act that changes one or more of the exterior architectural features of a structure or its appurtenances, including, but not limited to, the erection, construction, reconstruction, or removal of any structure or appurtenance. 
    "Appropriate" - see "Certificate of appropriateness". 
    "Appurtenances" means features other than primary or secondary structures which contribute to the exterior historic appearance of a property, including, but not limited to, paving, doors, windows, signs, materials, decorative accessories, fences, and historic landscape features. 
    "Certificate of appropriateness" means a certificate issued by the Newport historic district commission indicating approval of plans for alteration, construction, repair, removal, or demolition of a structure or appurtenances of structure within a historic district. Appropriate for the purpose of passing upon an application for a certificate of appropriateness means not incongruous with those aspects of the structure, appurtenances, or the district which the commission has determined to be historically or architecturally significant. 
    "Complete application" means an application for certificate of appropriateness that is deemed to contain all of the required and necessary information in order for the commission to render a decision. 
    "Conceptual approval" means a preliminary and limited approval by the commission of the location, size, scale and massing of proposed new construction or major alteration. 
    "Construction" means the act of adding to an existing structure or erecting a new principal or accessory structure or appurtenances to a structure, including, but not limited to, buildings, extensions, outbuildings, fire escapes, and retaining walls. 
    "Contributing structure" means a structure designated contributing based on application of the Newport Historic Structures Inventory Standards or one which the commission has determined to be contributing because it adds to the local district's sense of time, place, character, or historical development by location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, or association. To be so designated the structure should conform to the character of the local district as defined in that district's "nominating papers". The rationale for such designation should be explicit and provided to the homeowner upon request by the commission or designated staff. Newport's historic district is currently composed of eight unique local districts each with its own distinct character. These districts are: Bellevue Avenue, Bellevue Avenue-Casino, Fort Adams, Kay-Catherine-Old Beach, Newport National Landmark District (Easton's Point-Washington Square-Historic Hill and Harbor), Ocean Avenue, Ochre Point-Cliffs, and Rose Island. A substantially deteriorated structure may still be deemed a contributing structure. 
    "Demolition" means an act or process that destroys a structure or its appurtenances in part or in whole. 
    "Historic designed landscape" means a landscape that was consciously designed or laid out by a landscape architect, master gardener, architect, or horticulturist according to design principles or a gardener working in a recognized style or tradition. The landscape may be associated with significant person(s), trend, or event in landscape architecture; or illustrate an important development in the theory and practice of landscape architecture. Aesthetic values play a significant role in designed landscapes. Examples include parks, campuses, walking trails and estates. Importantly, Newport has a number of nationally significant landscapes, now exempted from review; the commission should recognize and encourage the preservation of such historic designed landscapes. 
    "Historic district," is as defined in Section 17.08.010 and 17.80.030 of this zoning code. A historic district may include one or more structures. 
    "Historic landscape features" means features which characterize the historic and designed character of a property's setting, including, but not limited to, decorative or retaining walls, gates, fences, statuary or other objects of art, seating or other furnishings, arbors, trellises, fountains, paths, walkways, driveways, curbing, the contour and elevations of landforms and designed grades, and under certain circumstances, trees. 
    "In-kind replacement" means replacement of an architectural feature, damaged or deteriorated beyond repair, where the new feature will match the feature being replaced in dimensions, design, configuration, texture and visual appearance, and match materials as closely as possible. Replacement which differs from the existing in material, design, configuration, texture, dimensions and other visual qualities is an alteration and not an in-kind replacement. 
    "Major alteration" means an alteration which significantly affects the historic, cultural, or architectural integrity, interpretability, or character of a building, structure, site or district. Generally includes the kind of work which is normally done with the aid of a professional drafter or professional quality plans. 
    "Minor alteration" means an alteration which does not significantly affect the historic, cultural, or architectural integrity, interpretability, or character of a building, structure, site or district. Generally it includes the kind of work which is normally done without the aid of a professional drafter or professional quality plans. 
    "Minor modification" means a revision to approved plans that is deemed to be minor in nature and not incongruous with all other approved elements of that plan. 
    "New construction" means a new principal or accessory freestanding structure which does not alter character-defining historic materials. 
    "Newport historic structures inventory" means an inventory of structures within the historic district, identified as contributing or noncontributing, as adopted and approved by the Newport City Council. In the absence of inclusion in a completed inventory, the designation of a structure as contributing or noncontributing will be based on application of the "Newport historic structures inventory standards." 
    "Newport historic structures inventory standards" means standards defined by the City of Newport Historic Planner and adopted and approved by the Newport City Council that are used in determining if a structure located within a designated historic district is contributing or noncontributing. 
    "Newport standards for the treatment of historic properties" or "Newport standards," is as defined in Section 17.80.040 of this zoning chapter. 
    "Noncontributing structure" means a structure that is designated noncontributing based on application of the Newport historic structures inventory standards, or one that the commission has determined to be noncontributing because it does not add to the local district's sense of time, place, character or historical development as defined in that district's "nominating papers." Even for those structures that retain certain features which reflect the character of the district, the structure may still be considered noncontributing if it has lost its integrity due to substantial changes in location, design, setting, materials or workmanship. 
    "Ordinary maintenance" means work, other than replacement, meant to remedy damage or deterioration of a structure or its appurtenances, involving no change in materials, dimensions, design, configuration, texture or visual appearance. 
    "Reconstruction" means the act or process of depicting, by means of new construction, the form, features, and detailing of a documented nonsurviving site, landscape, building, structure, or portion thereof for the purpose of replicating its appearance at a specific period of time and in its historic location. 
    "Removal" means a relocation of a structure on its site or to another site. 
    "Repair" means a change intended to remedy damage or deterioration of a structure or its appurtenances. 
    "Standards for maintenance of properties" means documented maintenance criteria as developed by the City of Newport and approved and adopted by the city council for existing properties. 
    "Structure" means anything constructed or erected, the use of which requires permanent or temporary location on or in the ground, including, but not limited to, buildings, gazebos, billboards, outbuildings, decorative and retaining walls, and swimming pools. 
(Ord. No. 2010-28, § 1, 8-25-2010) 
17.80.030. - Designation of historic districts. 
    For the purposes of this chapter, the boundaries of historic districts are established as shown on a map entitled "Historic District Zoning Map," which map is filed in the office of the city clerk. Such map is hereby incorporated as a part of this Chapter. 
(Ord. No. 2010-28, § 1, 8-25-2010)

2.  The commission shall: 
a.  Adopt and publish all rules, regulations and procedures necessary to carry out its functions under the provisions of this chapter; and 
b.  Adopt and publish standards which shall be in harmony with the Newport standards for the treatment of historic properties to inform historic district residents, property owners, and the general public of those criteria by which the commission shall determine whether to issue a certificate of appropriateness. The commission may, from time to time, amend these standards as reasonably necessary, and it shall publish all such amendments. Such amendments shall be in harmony with the Newport standards for the treatment of historic properties. 
c.  The commission may delegate to the director of planning, zoning, development and inspections for the City of Newport, or his/her designee, authority to issue a certificate of appropriateness for: (1) Minor alterations; (2) Major alterations to noncontributing structures; and (3) In-kind replacement. The commission may also authorize said department or officer to approve [1] extensions to already approved certificates of appropriateness; [2] minor modifications to plans previously approved by the commission; [3] waiver of application fees for demonstrated financial hardship; and [4] such other alterations and administrative matters that it may delegate to said department or officer pursuant to Chapter 24.1 of Title 45, General Laws of Rhode Island 1956, as amended. However, at no time may said department or officer deny a certificate of appropriateness but shall refer such action to the commission for consideration and decision.

(Ord. No. 2010-28, § 1, 8-25-2010) 
17.80.050. - Powers and procedures of the commission. 
A.  Certificate of Appropriateness Required. 
1.  Before a property owner may commence construction, alteration, repair, removal or demolition affecting the exterior appearance of a structure or its appurtenances within any designated historic district, or affecting an historic cemetery located in the City of Newport, the owner must apply for and receive a certificate of appropriateness from the commission approving such construction, alteration, repair, removal or demolition. 
2.  In applying for a certificate of appropriateness, a property owner must comply with the application procedures as established by the commission pursuant to Chapter 45-24.1 of the General Laws, as amended, and the provisions of this Chapter. 
3.  A certificate of appropriateness is necessary whether or not state law requires a permit from the building official. The building official shall not issue a building permit until the commission has issued a certificate of appropriateness. 
B.  Application for Certificate of Appropriateness. 
1.  Applications for certificates of appropriateness shall be filed with the office of planning, zoning, development and inspections. The director or his/her designee shall determine if such application is complete and shall forward complete applications, together with all maps, plans, and other data to the commission. Incomplete applications shall be returned to the applicant within seven working days of receipt by the department of planning, zoning, development and inspections. 
2.  The commission shall require the applicant to submit information which is reasonably necessary to evaluate the proposed construction, alteration, repair, removal or demolition including, but not limited to, site plans, elevation drawings, photographs or other information deemed appropriate by the commission and set forth in the commission's rules, regulations, procedures and standards, adopted pursuant to this Chapter, which information may be submitted in digital format acceptable to the commission. 
3.  In the case of a historic cemetery, the owners must comply with all provisions of law and make suitable and appropriate provisions for the reinternment of any human remains in an established cemetery. Original or existing headstones and markers shall be preserved and installed at the site of the reinternment. 
C.  The Commission's Review of Applications for Certificate of Appropriateness. 
1.  In deciding whether to issue a certificate of appropriateness, and in making the determination that the proposed alteration is not incongruous with those aspects of the structure, appurtenances, or the district that the commission has determined to be historically or architecturally significant, the commission shall give consideration to: 
a.  The historic and architectural significance of the structure and its appurtenances; 
b.  The way in which the structure and its appurtenances contribute to the historical and architectural significance of the district; and 
c.  The appropriateness of the general design, arrangement, texture, materials, and siting proposed in the plans. 
The commission shall also apply the Newport standards for treatment of historic properties (the Newport standards). The Newport standards, adapted from the Secretary of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings, 36 CFR 671, as amended, are basic principles to be applied in a reasonable manner to preserve historic districts and structures, while allowing for reasonable change, architectural variety, innovation and imagination. The Newport standards are intended to insure that properties in Newport's historic districts are not altered improperly. The goal is to set up clear rules that everyone will understand. 
2.  In conducting its review, the commission shall apply the Newport Standards and shall also take into account the relative architectural and historic significance of structures: the integrity and condition of historic fabric; the reasonableness of the proposed alteration; and the practical realities of alternatives that minimize harm to the historic district. 
3.  The commission shall pass only on exterior features of a structure and its appurtenances and shall not consider interior arrangements. Doors, window sash and frames covered by storm doors or windows shall be considered exterior features. 
4.  The commission may give conceptual approval for proposed new construction or major alterations. Conceptual approval does not assure that the commission will issue a certificate of appropriateness. Final approval is contingent upon acceptance of all stylistic and historic details including, but not limited to, window choice, siding choice, trim choice and materials. 
5.  Decisions of the commission. All decisions of the commission shall be in writing. The commission shall articulate and explain the reasons and basis of each decision on a record and in the case of a decision not to issue a certificate of appropriateness, the commission shall include the basis for its conclusion that the proposed activity would be incongruous with those aspects of the structure, appurtenances, or the district which the commission has determined to be historically or architecturally significant. In addition, the commission may, upon request of the applicant, include an outline of reasonable alternatives, methods, materials or other conditions under which the activity would likely be approved. The commission shall send a copy of the written decision to the applicant. 
(Ord. No. 2010-28, § 1, 8-25-2010) 
17.80.060. - The Newport standards for treatment of historic properties. 
    The Newport standards for treatment of historic properties are: 
A.  For Contributing Structures. The commission shall apply the following standard of review to contributing structures: 
1.  Retain Historic Character. Retain and preserve the historic character of a contributing structure. The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and spaces that characterize a contributing structure should not be undertaken. 
2.  Avoid Conjecture. The buildings of Newport are a physical record of their time, place and use. Avoid changes that create a false sense of historical development, such as adding a conjectural feature or architectural elements from other buildings. 
3.  Maintain Significant Alterations. Retain and preserve changes to a contributing structure that have acquired historic significance in their own right. 
4.  Preserve Character, Defining Features and Workmanship. Preserve distinctive features, finishes and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a contributing structure. 
5.  Repair before Replacement. The historic materials out of which contributing structures buildings are constructed are significant and once lost, they cannot be recovered. Every effort should be made to repair rather than replace deteriorated historic fabric and features. When the severity of deterioration requires replacement of features or fabric, the replacement should match the old in materials, dimensions, design, configuration, texture and visual appearance. 
6.  Avoid Damaging Treatments. Do not use chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause damage to historic materials. 
7.  Minimize Harm from Alterations. Undertake exterior alterations, including new additions, in such a manner that minimizes harm to historic materials and that if removed will not change the essential form and integrity of a contributing structure. Make proposed additions or exterior alterations to a contributing structure compatible with the existing materials, features, size, visual relationships and massing to protect the integrity and scale of the original historic structure or site. Make new alterations or additions clearly discernible from the old. The differentiations may or may not be stylistic, and may be as subtle as a change in footprint or material. 
B.  For Noncontributing Structures and Existing Walls, Gates, Gateposts and Fences Made Subject to Review by Section 17.80.100(6) of this Chapter. The commission shall apply the following standard of review to noncontributing structures: 
1.  Compatibility. The alteration of a noncontributing structure or existing walls, gates, gateposts and fences made subject to review pursuant to Section 17.80.100(6) of this Chapter shall be generally of such size, scale, siting, massing, setback, materials, and detail as will be compatible with other structures in the surrounding historic district. 
2.  Preserving Character Defining Features. The commission may encourage but shall not require owners to preserve distinctive features, finishes, construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that are present in a noncontributing structure or existing walls, gates, gateposts and fences made subject to review pursuant to Section 17.80.100(6) of this Chapter which add to the character of the surrounding district. 
C.  For New Construction, Reconstruction and New Walls, Gates, Gateposts and Fences Made Subject to Review Pursuant to Section 17.80.100(6) of this Chapter. The commission shall apply the following standard of review to new construction or reconstruction: 
1.  Compatibility. New construction, reconstruction and new walls, gates, gateposts and fences made subject to review pursuant to Section 17.80.100(6) of this Chapter shall be compatible with the surrounding historic area in terms of size, scale, siting, massing, setback, materials and details. 
2.  Architectural Quality. New construction, reconstruction and new walls, gates, gateposts and fences made subject to review pursuant to Section 17.80.100(6) of this Chapter should be of thoughtful and considered architectural design. 
3.  Appearance. New construction, reconstruction and new walls, gates, gateposts and fences made subject to review pursuant to Section 17.80.100(6) of this Chapter may clearly read as such and need not present a false historic appearance. 
D.  For Demolition: 
1.  Demolition shall be deemed by the commission to be a major alteration. 
2.  The commission shall not approve the demolition of contributing historic structures that retain integrity of condition. If a request for demolition is based on structural instability or advanced deterioration, a technical report prepared by a professional engineer or architect that details the nature and extent of specific problems shall be submitted. A standard condition of approval for demolition of a contributing historic structure shall be the documentation of the existing building's elevations, including details and architectural features. 
(Ord. No. 2010-28, § 1, 8-25-2010) 
17.80.070. - Special considerations regarding valuable historic resources and demolition. 
A.  In the case of an application for construction, repair, or alteration, removal, or demolition affecting the exterior appearance of a structure or its appurtenances, which the commission deems so valuable to the city, state or nation that the loss thereof will be a great loss to the city, state or nation, the commission shall endeavor to work out with the applicant an economically feasible plan for the preservation of such structure. 
B.  Unless the commission is satisfied that the retention of such structure constitutes a hazard to public safety, which hazard cannot be eliminated by economic means available to the applicant, including the sale of the structure to any purchaser willing to preserve such structure or unless the commission votes to issue a certificate of appropriateness for the proposed construction, alteration, repair, removal, or demolition, the commission shall file with the building official its rejection of such application. 
C.  In the absence of change in such structure arising from casualty, no new application for the same or similar work shall be filed within one year after such rejection. 
D.  In the case of any structure deemed to be valuable for the period of architecture it represents and important to the neighborhood within which it exists, the commission may file with the building official its certificate of appropriateness for such application if any of the circumstances under which a certificate of appropriateness might have been given under the proceeding paragraphs are in existence, or if: 
1.  Preservation of such structure is a deterrent to a major improvement program which will be of substantial benefit to the community; 
2.  Preservation of such structure would cause undue or unreasonable financial hardship to the applicant, taking into account the financial resources available to the applicant including sale of the structure to any purchaser willing to preserve such structure; or 
3.  Preservation of such structure would not be in the interest of the majority of the community. 
E.  When considering an application to demolish or remove a structure of historic or architectural value, the commission shall assist the applicant in identifying and evaluating alternatives to demolition, including sale of the structure and its present site. In addition to any other criteria, the commission also shall consider whether there is a reasonable likelihood that some person or group other than the applicant is willing to purchase, move and preserve such structure and whether the applicant has made continuing bona fide and reasonable efforts to sell the structure to any such purchaser willing to move and preserve such structure. 
F.  Demolition Through Owner Neglect. The city council, in consultation with the historic district commission, may identify structures of historical or architectural value whose deteriorated physical condition endangers the preservation of the structure or its appurtenances. The City of Newport shall publish standards for maintenance of properties within the historic district. Upon the petition of the historic district commission that the historic structure is so deteriorated that its preservation is endangered, the council may establish a reasonable time not less than thirty (30) days within which the owner must begin repairs. If the owner has not begun repairs within the allowed time, the council shall hold a hearing at which the owner may appear and state his or her reasons for not commencing repairs. If the owner does not appear at the hearing or does not comply with the council's orders, the council may cause the required repairs to be made at the expense of the city and cause a lien to be placed against the property for repayments. 
G.  No less than fifteen (15) days after receiving an application to demolish or to remove an historic cemetery, the commission shall forward the application to the commission to study historic cemeteries. The commission shall also immediately forward to the commission to study historic cemeteries its finding of fact, if any, together with its action on the application. 
(Ord. No. 2010-28, § 1, 8-25-2010) 
17.80.080. - Failure of the commission to act. 
    The commission shall file with the building official its certificate of appropriateness or rejection of all plans submitted to it for review. No work shall begin until the certificate has been filed but, in the case of rejection, such decision is binding upon the building official and no permit shall be issued in such a case. The failure of the commission to act within forty-five (45) days from the date of an application filed with it, unless an extension is agreed upon mutually by the applicant and the commission is deemed to constitute approval. In the event, however, that the historic district commission makes a finding of fact that the circumstances of a particular application require further time for additional study and information than can be obtained within the period of forty-five (45) days, then the commission has a period of up to ninety (90) days within which to act upon the application. 
(Ord. No. 2010-28, § 1, 8-25-2010) 
17.80.090. - Advisory role. 
    In order to assist the city, its agencies, boards, commissions, staff, mayor and council on matters of historic preservation, the commission shall provide its expertise and advice, as appropriate, at the request of any of said agencies, boards, commissions, staff or elected officials. 
(Ord. No. 2010-28, § 1, 8-25-2010) 
17.80.100. - Exceptions. 
    Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent painting or ordinary maintenance and repair of any structure or appurtenance within a historic district, provided that such painting or ordinary maintenance and repair does not result in any change of design, type of material, or appearance of the structure or appurtenance; nor shall anything in this chapter be construed to prevent the construction, alteration, repair, moving, or demolition of any structure under a permit issued by the building official prior to the passage of this chapter. The following are actions or items which are exempt from commission review: 
1.  Paint colors, surface preparation or paint composition; 
2.  Decorating-holiday or other; 
3.  Landscaping, including shrubs, trees, flowers, window flower boxes, and other plantings, exterior lighting, flags and flagpoles, lawn furniture, park benches and birdbaths; 
4.  Window air conditioning units; 
5.  Ground-mounted air conditioning units generators (one hundred (100) amps or less), if not visible from any public way, in compliance with zoning setback requirements, and if screened by fencing or shrubbery; 
6.  Fences, gates, gateposts and walls, except historic stone walls as provided for in Chapter 17.74. 
7.  Historic designed landscapes; 
8.  All ordinary maintenance and repair of any existing exterior features of a structure or appurtenance that does not result in any change of design, type of material, or appearance of the structure or appurtenance; 
9.  Temporary structures or signs that are temporary and whose duration will not exceed any guidelines established by the commission; 
10.  Storm windows and storm doors; 
11.  Paving, patios and driveways; 
12.  The reconstruction in the same design of a building, structure or exterior architectural feature damaged or destroyed by fire, storm or other disaster, provided such reconstruction is begun within one year and is continued to completion without substantial interruption and provided that sufficient and reliable evidence exists, such as from detailed as-built drawings or reasonable photo documentation, of the exterior features of the building, structure or architectural feature prior to the casualty causing the damage or destruction. 
(Ord. No. 2010-28, § 1, 8-25-2010; Ord. No. 2014-021, § 1, 8-27-2014) 
17.80.110. - Appeals. 
    An aggrieved party with respect to a decision of the historic district commission shall have the right to appeal such decision to the zoning board of review. When hearing appeals from the commission decisions, the zoning board of review shall not substitute its own judgment for that of the commission, but must consider the issue upon the findings and the record of the commission. The zoning board of review shall not reverse a commission decision except on a finding of prejudicial procedural error, clear error or lack of support by the weight of the evidence in the record. The zoning board of review shall articulate and explain the reasons and basis of each decision of the record and the zoning board of review shall send a copy of the decision to the aggrieved party, to the historic district commission, and to all parties entering an appearance. An aggrieved party may appeal the decision of the zoning board of review on a matter appealed under this chapter to the superior court of Newport County. 
(Ord. No. 2010-28, § 1, 8-25-2010) 
17.80.120. - Enforcement. 
    Where there is a violation of any of the provisions of this chapter or of any section taken thereunder, the zoning officer or building official may institute an appropriate action to prevent, enjoin, abate or remove such violation. The zoning officer may bring an action against any property owner who fails to comply with the requirements of the chapter.

Chapter 17.92. - CRITICAL AREA REVIEW-OCEAN DRIVE DISTRICT 

17.92.010. - Legislative intent. 
    The critical area review is a development plan review process designed to protect the unique natural resources located in the subject district and is in accordance with recommendations of element two (land use) of the comprehensive land use plan for the city. The intent of this section is to foster sensitive development activity in the southern shoreline area of the city, commonly known as Ocean Drive, which typically exhibit large lot sizes and to minimize adverse impacts of development on such critical natural elements as vegetation, soil erosion, water quality, natural habitats, and scenic quality. The requirements of this section are developed to protect, conserve, and foster the natural, scenic, historical and economic qualities of lands along the city's Ocean Drive. The critical area review process is not intended to deny an applicant a permitted use of the property as established by this zoning code but rather to review, comment, refine, and develop site design elements within the development plan especially those which pertain to the physical characteristics of the site and its surrounding environment. 
(Ord. 4-97 § 1 (part), 1994: prior code § 1262.05.01) 
17.92.020. - Usages. 
    "Critical area review committee" means a five member committee established to carry out the purposes of this section and hereinafter referred to as committee for the purposes of this section. 
    "Greenway" means a corridor of protected open space managed for conservation, recreation or transportation purposes as defined by Title 42 Chapter 125 Paragraph 3 of the General Laws. 
    "Critical area review approval" means an approval granted by the committee upon a complete review and acceptance of the proposed development activity which is subject to the requirements of this section. 
    "Scenic highway" means any road, street, avenue, drive or other vehicular, pedestrian or bicycle route which has been designated as a component of the state system of scenic highways pursuant to Title 24 Chapter 15 of the General Laws. 
    "Scenic vista" means a defined angle of perception within the landscape which limits the view to a particular part of the landscape while providing the viewer with an unobstructed sight line to distant land, water, structure of historic or cultural significance or in the continuation of a series of such sight lines or vistas. This shall include all scenic vistas along a designated scenic highway. 
(Ord. 4-97 § 1 (part), 1994: prior code § 1262.05.02) 
17.92.030. - Designation of critical area. 
    For the purposes of this section, the R-120 and R-160 zones as established by this zoning code and the zoning map shall together comprise the boundaries of the critical area-Ocean Drive district. All development activity including new construction and subdivision of land within the two districts shall be subject to the requirements of this section. It is recognized that the lot sizes prevalent within the R-120 and R-160 districts are desirable to retain the area character and to protect, conserve, and foster the natural, scenic, historical and economic qualities of this truly unique area of Newport. Furthermore, the current lot sizes and density in this area is suitable for the application of the critical area review process. This section shall in no manner enlarge upon nor decrease the number or type of uses permitted in the underlying R-120 and R-160 zoning districts. 
(Ord. 4-97 § 1 (part), 1994: prior code § 1262.05.03) 
17.92.040. - Critical area review committee. 
A.  Establishment. There is established a critical area review committee to carry out the purposes of this section. 
B.  Membership and Appointment. 
1.  The committee shall consist of five members of which one shall be a member of the tree commission and so nominated by it, one shall be a member of the planning board and so nominated by it, one shall be a member of the historic district commission and so nominated by it. The remaining two members, one of whom shall be a landscape architect or an arborist or equivalent recognized by his/her peers and the other one, a resident of either the R-120 or R-160 district, shall be appointed by the mayor of the city of Newport with the consent of the city council. 
2.  The concurring vote of a majority but no less than three members of the committee shall be necessary for approval of any development plans subject to the requirements of this section. All decisions of the committee, in writing, shall articulate and explain the reasons and basis for each decision and in the case of a decision not to issue a critical area review approval, shall include the basis for its conclusion that the proposed development plan does not comply with the intent and/or requirements of this section.

A.  With respect to a development proposal subject to the requirements of this section, an application for a critical area review approval shall be submitted together with six copies of the development plan and supporting documents to the department of planning, zoning, development and inspections, which shall serve as the coordinator for the critical area review plans. At the time the development plan is submitted to the city for review, a fee of fifteen (15) dollars shall be paid to the city. 
B.  After the site development plan, related materials and fee have been submitted the committee shall review the application and prepare its findings in writing within forty-five (45) days of the receipt of the application. The committee may solicit comments and/or recommendations from the various city departments in its review of the application. 
C.  If the proposed development, subdivision and/or alteration requires approval from the zoning board of review, historic district commission or planning board then such approval must be received prior to the submission of a development plan. In granting the critical area review approval, the committee may add to the requirements of the zoning board of review, the planning board and/or the historic district commission. 
D.  The failure of the committee to act within forty-five (45) days from the date of a completed application shall be deemed to constitute approval, unless an extension is agreed upon mutually by the applicant and the committee. 
(Ord. 4-97 § 1 (part), 1994: prior code § 1262.05.06) 
17.92.070. - Design standards. 
    The purpose of this section is to establish standards which will protect the unique character of natural resources located in the designated Ocean Drive district. It is the intent of these design standards to continue to preserve established street patterns, ensure building layouts to reflect adjacent building mass and incorporate terrain, vegetation and scenic vistas into the overall design process. 
A.  Public scenic vistas shall not be obstructed by new development whenever possible. Other desirable views from public areas and existing buildings to historically significant buildings or natural features shall be retained, whenever possible. 
B.  Site grading shall insure positive drainage of water away from the proposed buildings in such a manner as to prevent ponding or sheeting at walks and parking areas. Runoff generated by the proposed site development or alteration must be disposed of in a manner so as not to affect adjacent properties or rights-of-way. 
C.  Retention of natural grades and recognition of off-site grades shall be the objective of all grading plans. It is improper to place a building designed for a largely level site on a sloped site in a manner that interrupts the natural ground line. Prominent flat areas or bank cuts around buildings are discouraged. 
D.  All setback areas shall be maintained in their natural state except in cases where covenants or deed restrictions existing prior to the adoption of the critical area review district prohibit a property owner from adhering to this standard. 
E.  There shall be a minimum setback of seventy-five (75) feet from either a designated wetland or a coastal feature as defined by the coastal resources management council. This setback shall be maintained in its natural state. 
F.  If the proposed development requires cutting down of trees and/or disturbance of ground cover, then all such loss of vegetation shall be replaced to the greatest extent possible on the site in equal measure and in a manner approved by the committee. 
G.  Street trees are required for every development and should be planted at a maximum thirty (30) feet on-center unless such planting schedule shall result in the diminishing of a scenic vista. Minimum tree size shall be fifteen (15) gallons. Species are to be as specified by the committee in consultation with the tree warden. Street trees should be planted at a minimum of two feet from the face of the curb. Where trees are proposed in an area with a monolithic sidewalk wider than four feet, tree grates shall be used to protect the base of the tree and provide pedestrian safety. 
H.  All accessory uses such as garages and boat houses, whether attached or detached to main building shall be considered to be an integral part of the overall design concept. The siting of any accessory use shall not be unnecessarily prominent and in instances where such uses are attached to the main building, they shall appear as an addition with access preferably from the rear or the side. 
I.  Due to the area's fragile vegetation, potential for storm and sea flooding, erosion, and poor septic system drainage posing the threat of ground water pollution during seasonal high water table, the high areas within the site are better suited for development. However, the placing of buildings on higher elevations require extra care while designing especially with regards to massing and roof shapes. Shapes that emphasize verticality are discouraged. 
(Ord. 4-97 § 1 (part), 1994: prior code § 1262.05.07) 
17.92.080. - Critical area plan review prerequisite for building permit. 
    In the case of any development activity subject to the requirements of this section, no building permit shall be issued to construct, erect or alter any building or structure, or develop, change, or improve land unless such activity is approved in the manner prescribed in this section and a critical area review approval has been issued. The approved development plan and any applicable conditions shall become part of the application for a building permit and shall be binding on any building permit issued. It shall be unlawful for any person to construct, erect or alter any building or structure, or develop, change, or improve land for which approval is required under this section without such approval. The city may restrain any unlawful act hereunder by a stop work order, and by appropriate court action. 
(Ord. 4-97 § 1 (part), 1994: prior code § 1262.05.08) 
17.92.090. - Appeals. 
    An applicant may appeal the decision of the committee to the zoning board of review within fifteen (15) days of the filing of such a decision.

Chapter 17.108. - VARIANCES AND SPECIAL USES 

17.108.010. - Variances. 
A.  The zoning board of review shall have the power and duty to authorize, upon appeal in specific cases, such variance from the provisions of this zoning code where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provision of this zoning code would result in unnecessary hardship. Financial detriment shall not be considered an unnecessary hardship. 
B.  Procedure. 
1.  A written application for a variance may be made by any person, group, agency, or corporation and shall be submitted to the zoning officer demonstrating that: 
a.  Special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the land, structure or building involved and which are not applicable to other lands, structures or buildings in the same district; 
b.  A literal interpretation of the provisions of this zoning code would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other property owners in the same district under the provisions of this zoning code; 
c.  Special conditions and circumstances do not result from the actions of the applicant. Purchase or lease of property shall not constitute such an action in this instance. 
2.  The zoning officer shall immediately transmit each application to the zoning board of review and shall also transmit a copy of each application for use variance to the planning board. 
3.  The zoning board of review may request that the planning board and/or staff report it's findings and recommendations, including a statement on the general consistency of the application with the goals and purposes of the comprehensive plan, in writing to the zoning board of review within thirty (30) days of receipt of the application from the board. 
4.  The zoning board of review shall hold a public hearing in an expeditious manner after receipt of a complete application. Public notice shall be given at least fourteen (14) days prior to the date of the hearing in a newspaper of general circulation in the city which shall specify date, time, place, purpose of the hearing, and street address of the subject property. Notice of hearing shall be sent by first class mail fourteen (14) days prior to the date of the hearing to the applicant and to all those who would require notice under Section 17.112.070. The cost of notification shall be borne by the applicant. 
5.  In granting a variance, the zoning board of review shall require that evidence of the following standards shall be entered into the record of the proceedings: 
a.  That the reasons set forth in the application justify the granting of the variance and that the variance, if granted, is the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the land, building or structure; 
b.  That the variance will not be injurious to the neighborhood or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare, and will not impair the intent or purpose of the zoning code or the comprehensive plan upon which this zoning code is based; 
c.  That the hardship from which the applicant seeks relief is due to the unique characteristics of the subject land or structure and not to the general characteristics of the surrounding area; and is not due to a physical or economic disability of the applicant; and 
d.  That the hardship is not the result of any prior action of the applicant and does not result primarily from the desire of the applicant to realize greater financial gain. 
6.  The zoning board of review shall, in addition to the above standards, require that evidence be entered into the record of the proceedings showing that: 
a.  In granting a use variance the subject land or structure cannot yield any beneficial use if it is required to conform to the provisions of the zoning code. Nonconforming use of neighboring lands or structures in the same district and permitted use of lands or structures in an adjacent district shall not be considered in granting a use variance; and 
b.  In granting a dimensional variance, that the hardship that will be suffered by the owner of the subject property if the dimensional variance is not granted shall amount to more than a mere inconvenience. The fact that a use may be more profitable or that a structure may be more valuable after the relief is granted shall not be grounds for relief; 
c.  In granting any variance the zoning board of review may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this zoning code. Violations of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this zoning code.

17.108.020. - Special use permits. 
A.  While this zoning code is based upon the division of the city into districts, within each of which the use of land and structures and the bulk and location of structures in relation to the land are substantially uniform, it is recognized that there are certain other uses and features that would be appropriate in such districts if controlled as to number, area, location or relation to the neighborhood so as to promote the public health, safety, welfare, order, comfort, convenience, appearance, prosperity or general welfare. When provided elsewhere in this zoning code, such uses and features shall be treated as special use and shall be deemed to be permitted in their respective districts subject to the satisfaction of the requirements and standards set forth herein, in addition to other requirements of this zoning code. All such uses are declared to possess such special characteristics that each shall be considered as an individual case. 
B.  In accordance with the procedures, standards and conditions hereinafter specified, the zoning board of review may grant a special use permit for the establishment of one or more of the uses for which a special use permit must be secured from such board as required by the provisions of this zoning code. All requirements of this chapter are in addition to other requirements applicable in the district in which the special use is to be located. Prior to approval of an application for a building permit for a special use permit, approval must be given by the zoning board of review as provided in this chapter. Nothing herein shall be construed to prevent the zoning board of review from varying the terms of a special use permit except as it pertains to the maximum number of dwelling units allowed per lot. 
C.  Any substantial revision of an approved special use permit application and any reconstruction, enlargement, extension, moving or structural alteration of an approved special use permit or any building or structure in connection therewith shall require submission of a new special use permit application as for the original application. 
D.  The granting of a special use permit shall not empower the applicant to carry out any uses permitted as of right within the zoning district in which the property is located unless the approved special use permit has expired or cancelled or the special use has been abandoned. A new special use permit application shall be required as for the original application where an applicant desires to add to an existing special use any use permitted as of right within the zoning district in which the property is located. 
E.  Any use existing under an approved special use permit application shall not be deemed a nonconforming use. 
F.  Approval of an application for a special use permit under this section shall constitute approval conditioned upon:
