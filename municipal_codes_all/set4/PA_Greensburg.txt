50:124
(b) Over a period beginning not later than the required beginning
date and extending over the life of such participant or over the
lives of such participant and a designated beneficiary (or over a
period not extending beyond the life expectancy of such
participant, or the joint life expectancies of such participant
and a designated beneficiary).
(2) If a participant who is entitled to benefits under this plan dies prior
to the date when the entire interest has been distributed after
distribution of benefits has begun in accordance with Subsection
C(1)(b) above, the remaining portion of such benefit shall be
distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution
being used under Subsection C(1)(b) as of the date of death.
(3) If a participant who is entitled to benefits under this plan dies
before distribution of the benefit has begun, the entire interest of
such employee shall be distributed within five years of the death of
such employee, unless the following sentence is applicable. If any
portion of the employee's interest is payable to (or for the benefit
of) a designated beneficiary, such portion shall be distributed over
the life of such designated beneficiary (or over a period not
extending beyond the life expectancy of such beneficiary), and such
distributions begin not later than one year after the date of the
employee's death or such later date as provided by regulations
issued by the Secretary of the Treasury; then, for purposes of the
five-year rule set forth in the preceding sentence, the benefit
payable to the beneficiary shall be treated as distributed on the
date on which such distributions begin; provided, however, that
notwithstanding the, preceding sentence, if the designated
beneficiary is the surviving spouse of the participant, then the date
on which distributions are required to begin shall not be earlier
than the date upon which the employee would have attained age
70 1/2 and, further provided, if the surviving spouse dies before the
distributions to such spouse begin, this section shall be applied as if
the surviving spouse were the employee.
(4) For purposes of this section, the following definitions and
procedures shall apply:
(a) "Required beginning date" shall mean April 1 of the calendar
year following the later of the calendar year in which the
employee attains age 70 1/2 or the calendar year in which the
employee retires.
(b) The phrase "designated beneficiary" shall mean any individual
designated by the employee under this plan according to its
rules.
(c) Any amount paid to a child shall be treated as if it had been
paid to the surviving spouse if such amount will become
payable to the surviving spouse upon such child's reaching
§ 54-12 (RESERVED) § 54-12
50:125
majority (or other designated event permitted under
regulations issued by the Secretary of the Treasury).
(d) For purposes of this section, the life expectancy of an employee
and/or the employee's spouse (other than in the case of a life
annuity) may be redetermined but not more frequently than
annually.
D. Direct rollovers.
(1) This section applies to distributions made on or after December 31,
2001. Notwithstanding any provision of the plan to the contrary
that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this
section, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner
prescribed by the Plan Administrator, to have any portion of an
eligible rollover distribution that is equal to at least $500 paid
directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in
a direct rollover.
(2) For purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply:
DIRECT ROLLOVER  A payment by the plan to the eligible
retirement plan specified by the distributee.
DISTRIBUTEE  Includes an employee or former employee. In
addition, the employee's or former employee's surviving spouse
and the employee's or former employee's spouse or former spouse
who is the alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations
order, as defined in Code Section 414(p), are distributees with
regard to the interest of the spouse or former spouse.
ELIGIBLE RETIREMENT PLAN  A qualified trust described in
Code Section 401(a), an individual retirement account described
in Code Section 408(a), an individual retirement annuity described
in Code Section 408(b), an annuity plan described in Code Section
403(a), an annuity contract described in Code Section 403(b), an
eligible plan under Section 457(b) of the Code which is maintained
by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or
instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state and
which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into
such plan from this plan.
ELIGIBLE ROLLOVER DISTRIBUTION 
Any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the
credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover
distribution does not include: any distribution that is one of
a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less
frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy)
of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies)
of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary,
or for a specified period of 10 years of more; any distribution
to the extent such distribution is required under Code Section
(a)
§ 54-12 GREENSBURG CODE § 54-12
50:126
§ 54-13. Termination of employment.
401(a)(9); and the portion of any distribution that is not
includible in gross income (determined without regard to the
exclusion for net unrealized appreciation with respect to
employer securities).
For purposes of the direct rollover provisions in this section
of the plan, a portion of a distribution shall not fail to be
an eligible rollover distribution merely because the portion
consists of after-tax employee contributions that are not
includible in gross income. However, such portion may be paid
only to an individual retirement account or annuity described
in Section 408(a) or (b) of the Code, or to a qualified defined
contribution plan described in Section 401(a) or 403(a) of
the Code that agrees to separately account for amounts so
transferred, including separately accounting for the portion of
such distribution which is includible in gross income and the
portion of such distribution which is not so includible.
(b)
E. Nonduplication of benefit. To avoid any duplication of benefits, a
participant who is receiving a retirement benefit under this plan and
who shall resume employment shall have benefit payments suspended
until the first day of the month coincident with or next following the
date such employment shall cease. Upon resumption of benefit
payments, such participant shall receive the greater of the amount of
the suspended benefit or the amount of benefit based upon final
monthly average salary and years of continuous service as of the date
that such period of resumed employment shall cease.
F. Personal right of participant. The right to receive any benefits under
this plan is a personal right of the participant and shall expire upon the
death of the participant. No heir, legatee, devisee, beneficiary, assignee
or other person claiming by or through a participant shall have any
interest in any benefits hereunder unless clearly and expressly so
provided by the terms of this plan. A participant's election, failure to
make an election or revocation of an election hereunder shall be final
and binding on all persons.
A. Rights of terminated employees. A participant who shall cease to be an
employee except as otherwise hereinbefore provided shall have all
interest and rights under this plan limited to those contained in the
following subsections of this § 54-13.
B. Distribution of accumulated contributions. A participant whose
employment with the employer shall terminate for any reason other
than death or total and permanent disability prior to attainment of
normal retirement age shall be entitled to receive a distribution of
accumulated contributions. Upon receipt of such accumulated
contributions, said participant and beneficiary shall not be entitled to
any further payments from the plan.
§ 54-12 (RESERVED) § 54-13
50:127
§ 54-14. Administration.
C. Deferred retirement benefit. A participant who shall have completed at
least 12 years of continuous service and whose employment shall
terminate for any reason other than due to death or total and
permanent disability prior to attainment of normal retirement age shall
be entitled to elect to receive a deferred retirement benefit in lieu of a
distribution of accumulated contributions under § 54-13B. Such an
election shall be made in writing and delivered to the Chief
Administrative Officer within two weeks of the date of employment
termination. Such deferred retirement benefit shall be equal to the
participant's accrued benefit as of the date employment terminates and
shall commence after application pursuant to § 54-9E and not earlier
than the date which would be the participant's normal retirement date
under the plan if the participant remained in employment until such
date.
A. Plan Administrator. The Police Retirement Commission shall be the Plan
Administrator and shall have the power and authority to do all acts and
to execute, acknowledge and deliver all instruments necessary to
implement and effectuate the purpose of this plan. The Plan
Administrator may delegate authority to act on its behalf to any persons
it deems appropriate.
B. Police Retirement Commission. The pension fund shall be under the
care and control of a commission known as the Police Retirement
Commission which shall consist of the Mayor, all members of Council,
the City Administrator, and the City Treasurer, whose terms shall be
concurrent with their tenure in office; and seven members of the Police
Department who shall be elected yearly to serve on the Commission by
the members of the Police Department. The Mayor shall be the
President of the Commission, the City Administrator shall be the
secretary of the Commission and the City Treasurer shall be the
Treasurer of the Commission. The Commission shall have the power
and the right to collect and disburse all moneys due or owing to said
fund. The Commission may, upon the passage of an appropriate
resolution, delegate the custody and management of the assets of the
pension fund to a corporate fiduciary, as may be appointed by Council.
The Commission shall, upon the selection of a corporate fiduciary by
Council, enter into an appropriate agreement with the corporate
fiduciary, specifying the rights and duties of the parties to such
agreement and the manner of management of the funds entrusted to
the fiduciary. The Commission shall retain all powers necessary to make
determinations of membership in the plan and determination of all
matters pertaining to disbursements from the pension fund. The
Commission shall submit at least annually a financial report to Council
of the condition of the pension fund or any other report that Council
may require.
C. Authority and duties of the Plan Administrator.
§ 54-13 GREENSBURG CODE § 54-14
50:128
(1) The Plan Administrator shall have full power and authority to do
whatever shall, in its judgment, be reasonably necessary for the
proper administration and operation of the plan. The interpretation
or construction placed upon any term or provision of the plan by
the Plan Administrator or any action of the Plan Administrator
taken in good faith shall be final and conclusive upon all parties
hereto, whether employees, participants or other persons
concerned. By way of specification and not limitation and except as
specifically limited hereafter, the Plan Administrator is authorized:

(f) To prepare and distribute, in such manner as may be required
by law or as the Plan Administrator deems appropriate,
information explaining the plan;

information as shall be necessary for the proper administration
of the plan; and
(h) To appoint and retain any individual to assist in the
administration of the plan, including such legal, clerical,
accounting, actuarial and investment services as may be
required by any applicable law or laws.
(2) The Plan Administrator in its capacity as Plan Administrator shall
have no power to add to, subtract from or modify the terms of the
plan or change or add to any benefits provided by the plan, or to
waive or fail to apply any requirements of eligibility for benefits
under the plan. Further, the Plan Administrator shall have no power
to adopt, amend, or terminate the plan, or to determine or require
any contributions to the plan, said powers being exclusively
reserved to the Council in its capacity as the governing body of the
employer.
D. Plan administration expense. All reasonable expenses incident to the
functioning of the Plan Administrator, including but not limited to fees
of accountants, counsel, actuaries and other specialists and other costs
of administering the plan, may be paid from the pension fund upon
approval by the Plan Administrator to the extent permitted under
applicable law and not otherwise paid by the employer.

50:129
E. Hold harmless. No member of the Council nor the Plan Administrator
nor the actuary nor any other person involved in the administration of
the plan shall be liable to any person on account of any act or failure to
act which is taken or omitted to be taken in good faith in performing
their respective duties under the terms of this plan. To the extent
permitted by law, the employer shall, and hereby does agree to,
indemnify and hold harmless the Plan Administrator and each
successor and each of any such individual's heirs, executors and
administrators, and the Plan Administrator's delegates and appointees
(other than any person, bank, firm or corporation which is independent
of employer and which renders services to the plan for a fee) from any
and all liability and expenses, including counsel fees, reasonably
incurred in any action, suit or proceeding to which he is or may be made
a party by reason of being or having been the Plan Administrator or a
delegate or appointee of the Plan Administrator, except in matters
involving criminal liability, intentional or willful misconduct. If the
employer purchases insurance to cover claims of a nature described
above, then there shall be no right of indemnification except to the
extent of any deductible amount under the insurance coverage or to the
extent of the amount the claims exceed the insured amount.
F. Approval of benefits. The Chief Administrative Officer shall review and
approve or deny any application for retirement benefits within two
weeks following receipt thereof or within such longer time as may be
necessary under the circumstances. Any denial of an application for
retirement benefits shall be in writing and shall specify the reason for
such denial.
G. Appeal procedure. Any person whose application for retirement
benefits is denied, who questions the amount of benefit paid, who
believes a benefit should have commenced which did not so commence
or who has some other claim arising under the plan ("claimant"), shall
first seek a resolution of such claim under the procedure hereinafter set
forth.
(1) Any claimant shall file a notice of the claim with the Plan
Administrator which shall fully describe the nature of the claim.
The Plan Administrator shall review the claim and make an initial
determination approving or denying the claim.
(2) If the claim is denied in whole or in part, the Plan Administrator
shall, within 90 days (or such other period as maybe established by
applicable law) from the time the application is received, mail
notice of such denial to the claimant. Such ninety-day period may
be extended by the Plan Administrator if special circumstances so
require for up to 90 additional days by the Plan Administrator's
delivering notice of such extension to the claimant within the first
ninety-day period. Any notice hereunder shall be written in a
manner calculated to be understood by the claimant and, if a notice
of denial, shall set forth the specific plan provisions on which the
denial is based, an explanation of additional material or
§ 54-14 GREENSBURG CODE § 54-14
50:130
§ 54-15. The pension fund.
information, if any necessary, to perfect such claim and a statement
of why such material or information is necessary, and an
explanation of the review procedure.
(3) Any notice of a claim questioning the amount of a benefit in pay
status shall be filed within 90 days following the date of the first
payment which would be adjusted if the claim is granted, unless the
Plan Administrator allows a later filing for good cause shown.
(4) A claimant who does not submit a notice of a claim or a notice
requesting a review of a denial of a claim within the time
limitations specified above shall be deemed to have waived such
claim or right to review.
(5) Nothing contained herein is intended to abridge any right of a
claimant to file and arbitrate a grievance under an applicable
collective bargaining agreement, if any.
A. Operation of the pension fund.
(1) The Council of the City of Greensburg is hereby authorized to hold
and supervise the investment of the assets of the pension fund,
subject to the provisions of the laws of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania and of this plan and any amendment thereto by

plan and, to the extent not paid directly by the employer, to pay the
expenses of administering the plan pursuant to authorization by the
employer.
(3) The employer intends the plan to be permanent and for the
exclusive benefit of its employees. It expects to make the
contributions to the pension fund required under the plan. The
employer shall not be liable in any manner for any insufficiency in
the pension fund; benefits are payable only from the pension fund,
and only to the extent that there are monies available therein.
(4) The pension fund will consist of all funds held by the employer
under the plan, including contributions made pursuant to the
provisions hereof and the investments, reinvestments and proceeds
thereof. The pension fund shall be held, managed, and

otherwise expressly provided in the plan, the employer has
exclusive authority and discretion to manage and control the
pension fund assets. The employer may, however, appoint a trustee,
custodian and/or investment manager, at its sole discretion.
B. Powers and duties of employer. With respect to the pension fund, the
employer shall have the following powers, rights and duties, in addition

property held in the fund.

commercial bank.
(8) In addition to the foregoing powers, the employer shall also have all
of the powers, rights, and privileges conferred upon trustees by the
Pennsylvania Fiduciaries Investment Act, or as the same may be
subsequently modified or amended, and the power to do all acts,
take all proceedings and execute all rights and privileges, although
not specifically mentioned herein, as the employer may deem
necessary to administer the pension fund.
(9) To maintain and invest the assets of this plan on a collective and
commingled basis with the assets of other pension plans

respective plan shall be accounted for and administered separately.
§ 54-15 GREENSBURG CODE § 54-15
50:132
(10) To invest the assets of the pension fund in any collective
commingled trust fund maintained by a bank or trust company,
including any bank or trust company which may act as a trustee
hereunder. In this connection, the commingling of the assets of this
plan with assets of other eligible, participating plans through such
a medium is hereby specifically authorized. Any assets of the plan
which may be so added to such collective trusts shall be subject to
all of the provisions of the applicable declaration of trust, as
amended from time to time, which declaration, if required by its
terms or by applicable law, is hereby adopted as part of the plan, to
the extent of the participation in such collective or commingled
trust fund by the plan.
(11) To make any payment or distribution required or advisable to carry
out the provisions of the plan, provided that, if a trustee is
appointed by the employer, such trustee shall make such
distribution only at the direction of the employer.
(12) To compromise, contest, arbitrate, enforce or abandon claims and
demands with respect to the plan.
(13) To retain any funds or property subject to any dispute without
liability for the payment of interest thereon, and to decline to make

court of competent jurisdiction.
(14) To pay, and to deduct from and charge against the pension fund,
any taxes which may be imposed thereon, whether with respect to

the interest of any person therein, which the fund is required to
pay; to contest, in its discretion, the validity or amount of any tax,
assessment, claim or demand which may be levied or made against
or in respect of the pension fund, the income, property or transfer
thereof, or in any matter or thing connected therewith.
(15) To appoint any persons or firms (including but not limited to
accountants, investment advisors, counsel, actuaries, physicians,
appraisers, consultants, professional plan administrators and other
specialists), or otherwise act to secure specialized advice or
assistance, as it deems necessary or desirable in connection with
the management of the fund; to the extent not prohibited by
applicable law, the employer shall be entitled to rely conclusively
upon and shall be fully protected in any action or omission taken by
it in good faith reliance upon the advice or opinion of such persons
or firms, provided such persons or firms were prudently chosen by
the employer taking into account the interests of the participants
and beneficiaries and with due regard to the ability of the persons
or firms to perform their assigned functions.
(16) To retain the services of one or more persons or firms for the
management of (including the power to acquire and dispose of) all
§ 54-15 (RESERVED) § 54-15
50:133
or any part of the fund assets, provided that each of such persons
or firms is registered as an investment advisor under the
Investment Advisors Act of 1940, is a bank (as defined in that
act), or is an insurance company qualified to manage, acquire or
dispose of pension trust assets under the laws of more than one
state; in such event, the employer shall follow the directions of such
investment manager or managers with respect to the acquisition
and disposition of fund assets, but shall not be liable for the acts
or omissions of such investment manager or managers, nor shall it
be under any obligation to review or otherwise manage any fund
assets which are subject to the management of such investment
manager or managers. If the employer appoints a trustee, the
trustee shall not be permitted to retain such an investment
manager except with the express written consent of the employer.
C. Common investments. The employer shall not be required to make
separate investments for individual participants or to maintain separate
investments for each participant's account but may invest contributions
and any profits or gains therefrom in common investments.
D. Compensation and expenses of appointed trustee. If a trustee is
appointed, the trustee shall be entitled to such reasonable
compensation as shall from time to time be agreed upon by the
employer and the trustee, unless such compensation is prohibited by
law. Such compensation, and all expenses reasonably incurred by the
trustee in carrying out his functions, shall constitute a charge upon the
employer or the pension fund, which may be executed at any time after
30 days' written notice to the employer. The employer shall be under no
obligation to pay such costs and expenses, and, in the event of its failure
to do so, the trustee shall be entitled to pay the same, or to reimburse
themselves for the payment thereof, from the pension fund.
E. Periodic accounting. If a trustee is appointed, the pension fund shall be
evaluated annually, or at more frequent intervals, by the trustee and a
written accounting rendered as of each fiscal year end of the fund, and
as of the effective date of any removal or resignation of the trustee, and
such additional dates as requested by the employer, showing the
condition of the fund and all receipts, disbursements and other
transactions effected by the trustee during the period covered by the
accounting, based on fair market values prevailing as of such date.
F. Value of the pension fund. All determinations as to the value of the
assets of the pension fund, and as to the amount of the liabilities
thereof, shall be made by the employer or its appointed trustee, whose
decisions shall be final and conclusive and binding on all parties hereto,
the participants and beneficiaries and their estates. In making any such
determination, the employer or trustee shall be entitled to seek and rely
upon the opinion of or any information furnished by brokers, appraisers
and other experts, and shall also be entitled to rely upon reports as to
sales and quotations, both on security exchanges and otherwise as
contained in newspapers and in financial publications.

or from time to time by an instrument in writing executed in the name
of the employer under its municipal seal by officers duly authorized to
execute such instrument and delivered to the Council; provided,
however;
(1) That no amendment shall deprive any participant or any
beneficiary of a deceased participant of any of the benefits to which
each is entitled under this plan with respect to contributions
previously made;
(2) That no amendment shall provide for the use of funds or assets held
under this plan other than for the benefit of employees and no
funds contributed to this plan or assets of this plan shall, except as
provided in § 54-16E, ever revert to or be used or enjoyed by the
employer; and
(3) That no amendment to the plan which provides for a benefit
modification shall be made unless the cost estimate described in
§ 54-17C has been prepared and presented to the Council in
accordance with the Act.
B. Termination of the plan. The employer shall have the power to
terminate this plan in its entirety at any time by an instrument in
writing executed in the name of the employer.
C. Automatic termination of contributions. Subject to the provisions of the
Act governing financially distressed municipalities, the liability of the
employer to make contributions to the pension fund shall automatically
terminate upon liquidation or dissolution of the employer, upon its
adjudication as a bankrupt or upon the making of a general assignment
for the benefit of its creditors.
D. Distribution upon termination.
(1) In the event of the termination of the plan, all amounts of vested
benefits accrued by the affected participants as of the date of such
termination, to the extent funded on such date, shall be
nonforfeitable hereunder. In the event of termination of the plan,
the employer shall direct either that the Plan Administrator
continue to hold the vested accrued benefits of participants in the
pension fund in accordance with the provisions of the plan (other
than those provisions related to forfeitures) without regard to such
termination until all funds have been distributed in accordance
with the provisions, or that the Plan Administrator immediately
distribute to each participant an amount equal to the vested
accrued benefit to the date.

50:135
§ 54-17. Provisions to comply with the Municipal Pension Plan
Funding Standard and Recovery Act of 1984.
(2) If there are insufficient assets in the pension fund to provide for all
vested accrued benefits as of the date of plan termination, priority
shall first be given to the distribution of any amounts attributable to
mandatory or voluntary employee contributions before assets are
applied to the distribution of any vested benefits attributable to
other sources hereunder.
(3) All other assets attributable to the terminated plan shall be
distributed and disposed of in accordance with the provisions of
applicable law and the terms of any instrument adopted by the
employer which effects such termination.
E. Residual assets. If all liabilities to vested participants and any others
entitled to receive a benefit under the terms of the plan have been
satisfied and there remain any residual assets in the pension fund, such
residual assets remaining shall be returned to the employer insofar as
such return does not contravene any provision of law, and any
remaining balance, in excess of employer contributions, shall be
returned to the commonwealth.
F. Exclusive benefit rule. In the event of the discontinuance and
termination of the plan as provided herein, the employer shall dispose
of the pension fund in accordance with the terms of the plan and
applicable law; at no time prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities under
the plan shall any part of the corpus or income of the pension fund,
after deducting any administrative or other expenses properly
chargeable to the pension fund, be used for or diverted to purposes
other than for the exclusive benefit of the participants in the plan, their
beneficiaries or their estates.
A. Actuarial valuations.

biennially unless the employer is applying or has applied for
supplemental state assistance pursuant to Section 603 of the Act,
whereupon actuarial valuation reports shall be made annually.
(2) Such biennial actuarial valuation report shall be made as of the
beginning of each plan year occurring in an odd-numbered
calendar year, beginning with the year 1985.
(3) Such actuarial valuation shall be prepared and certified by an
"approved actuary," as such term is defined in the Act.
(4) The expenses attributable to the preparation of any actuarial
valuation report or experience investigation required by the Act or
any other expense which is permissible under the terms of the Act,
and which are directly associated with administering the plan, shall
be an allowable administrative expense payable from the assets of

surrounding properties and vandalism and that such abuses of property
entitle this city to exercise its police powers to protect the health, safety,
comfort and welfare of the community, intends the following regulations
to provide for the orderly abatement and disposition of closed, vacant
and inoperative automobile service stations which are determined, in

Fire Insurance Claims
[Adopted 12-14-1992 as Ord. No. 1558]
§ 175-1. Administration. [Amended 12-21-1994 by Ord. No. 1646]
The City Treasurer or such official's designee is hereby appointed as the
designated officer who is authorized to carry out all responsibilities and
duties stated in 40 P.S. § 638.
§ 175-2. Municipal certificate for fire loss claims. [Amended
12-21-1994 by Ord. No. 1646; 12-21-1994 by Ord. No. 1649]
A. No insurance company, association or exchange doing business in the
commonwealth shall pay a claim of a named insured for fire damage to
a structure located within the City of Greensburg where the amount
recoverable for fire loss to the structure under all policies exceeds
seven thousand five hundred dollars ($7,500.) unless the insurance
company, association or exchange is furnished with a certificate
pursuant to Subsection B of this section and unless there is compliance
with the procedures set forth in Subsections C and D of this section.
B. Procedure.
(1) The City Treasurer shall, upon the written request of the named
insured specifying the tax description of the property, name and
address of the insurance company, association or exchange and the
date agreed upon by the insurance company, association or
exchange and the named insured as the date of the receipt of a loss
report of the claim, furnish the insurance company, association or
exchange either of the following, within fourteen (14) working days
of the request:
(a) A certificate to the effect that, as of the date specified in the
request, there are no delinquent taxes, assessments, penalties
or users charges against the property and that, as of the date
of the Treasurer's certificate, the city has certified any amount
as total costs incurred by the city for the removal, repair or
securing of a building or other structure on the property.
(b) A certificate and bill showing the amount of delinquent taxes,
assessments, penalties and user charges against the property
as of the date specified in the request that have not been paid
as of the date of the certificate and also showing, as of the date
of the Treasurer's certificate, the amount of the total costs, if
any, certified to the Treasurer that have been incurred by the
city for the removal, repair or securing of a building or other
structure on the property. For the purposes of this subsection,
the city shall certify to the Treasurer the total amount, if any, of
any costs. A tax, assessment, penalty or user charge becomes
delinquent at the time and on the date a lien could otherwise
§ 175-1 INSURANCE § 175-2
175:231
have been filed against the property by the city under
applicable law.
(2) Responsibility of insurance company.
(a) Upon the receipt of a certificate pursuant to Subsection B(1)(a)
of this section, the insurance company, association or exchange
shall pay the claim of the named insured in accordance with
the policy terms, unless the loss agreed to between the named
insured and the company, association or exchange equals or
exceeds sixty percentum (60%) of the aggregate limits of
liability on all fire policies covering the building or other
structure. In the case of such a loss, the insurance company,
association or exchange, the insured property owner and the
city shall follow the procedures set forth in Subsections C and
D of this section.
(b) Upon the receipt of a certificate and bill pursuant to
Subsection B(1)(b) of this section, the insurance company,
association or exchange shall return the bill to the Treasurer
and transfer to the Treasurer an amount from the insurance
proceeds necessary to pay the taxes, assessments, penalties
charges and costs as shown on the bill. The city shall receive
the amount and apply or credit it to payment of the items
shown in the bill.
C. When the loss agreed to between the named insured and the company,
association or exchange equals or exceeds sixty percentum (60%) of the
aggregate limits of liability on all fire policies covering the building or
other structure, the insurance company, association or exchange shall
transfer from the insurance proceeds to the designated officer of the
city in the aggregate two thousand dollars ($2,000.) for each fifteen
thousand dollars ($15,000.) and each fraction of that amount of a claim;
or if at the time of a loss report, the named insured has submitted a
contractor's signed estimate of the costs of removing, repairing or
securing the building or other structure in an amount less than the
amount calculated under the foregoing transfer formula, the insurance
company, association or exchange shall transfer from the insurance
proceeds the amount specified in the estimate. The transfer of proceeds
shall be on a pro rata basis by all companies, associations or exchanges
insuring the building or other structure. Policy proceeds remaining
after the transfer to the city shall be disbursed in accordance with the
policy terms. The named insured may submit a contractor's signed
estimate of the costs of removing, repairing or securing the building or
other structure after the transfer, and the designated officer shall
return the amount of the fund in excess of the estimate to the named
insured if the city has not commenced to remove, repair or secure the
building or other structure.
D. Upon receipt of proceeds by the city as authorized by this section, the
City Treasurer shall place the proceeds in a separate fund to be used
§ 175-2 GREENSBURG CODE § 175-2
175:232
§ 175-3. Additional regulations; fees.
The City of Greensburg may by resolution adopt procedures and regulations
to implement Act 98 of 199280 and this chapter and may by resolution fix
reasonable fees to be charged for municipal activities of certificates and
bills, performance of inspections and opening separate fund accounts.
solely as security against the total cost of removing, repairing or
securing incurred by the city. When transferring the funds as required
in Subsection C of this section, an insurance company, association or
exchange shall provide the city with the name and address of the named
insured, whereupon the city shall contact the named insured, certify
that the proceeds have been received by the city and notify the named
insured that the procedures under this subsection shall be followed.
The fund shall be returned to the named insured when repairs, removal
or securing of the building or other structure have been completed
and the required proof received by the designated officer if the city
has not incurred any costs for repairs, removal or securing. If the city
has incurred costs for repairs, removal or securing of the building or
other structure, the costs shall be paid from the fund, and, if excess
funds remain, the municipality shall transfer the remaining funds to
the named insured. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit
the ability of the city to recover any deficiency. Further, nothing in
this subsection shall be construed to prohibit the city and the named
insured from entering into an agreement that permits the transfer of
funds to the named insured if some other reasonable disposition of the
damaged property has been negotiated.
E. Proof of payment by the insurance company, association or exchange of
proceeds under a policy in accordance with Subsection C of this section
is conclusive evidence of the discharge of its obligation to the insured
under the policy to the extent of the payment and of compliance by the
company, association or exchange with Subsection C of this section.
F. Nothing in this section shall be construed to make an insurance
company, association or exchange liable for any amount in excess of
proceeds payable under its insurance policy or for any other act
performed pursuant to this section or to make a municipality or public
official an insured under a policy of insurance or to create an obligation
to pay delinquent property taxes or unpaid removal liens or expenses
other than as provided in this section.
G. An insurance company, association or exchange making payments of
policy proceeds under this section for delinquent taxes or structure
removal liens or removal expenses incurred by a municipality shall have
a full benefit of such payment, including all rights of subrogation and of
assignment.

ENFORCEMENT OFFICER  Any building official, zoning inspector, code
enforcement officer, health officer, police officer, fire inspector or building

that the property is vacant. Such conditions may include, but not be limited
to, overgrown or dead vegetation, accumulation of abandoned personal

filed, is in foreclosure, or where ownership has been transferred to
lender or mortgagee by any legal method.

welfare of the citizens of the City of Greensburg, the City Council
hereby establishes the rights and obligations of owners, mortgagees

action to secure the structure within 10 days of demand by the
enforcement officer or designee as outlined above, and the enforcement
officer determines that the unsecured structure presents a danger to
the public health, safety, and welfare of the community, the City may
secure the structure, and charge the owner and/or mortgagee for the
actual costs of securing the structure, including the cost of using a City
employee to secure the structure. If the condition of the real property
creates an immediate danger to the public health, safety, and welfare of

mortgagee for the actual costs of securing the structure, including the

City (with amendments thereto), then such structure may be
condemned under the provisions of the Property Maintenance Code. If
and when the City elects to condemn the property, all continuing and
future action by the City shall be governed by the requirements of the
Property Maintenance Code.

owner and/or mortgagee by way of regular first class mail and the notice

beginning of the service period and as is now in existence and as is set by
the Municipal Authority of Westmoreland County from time to time.
§ 219-22. Service charge billing; penalty added to delinquent bills.
Owners and users will be billed quarterly for the service charge. The billing
for the first two (2) months of each quarter may be an estimate based on the
water usage shown by the water company's meter reading for the previous
quarter. The last month's billing at each quarter will be computed on the
actual water usage for the quarter minus the previous two (2) months'
estimated billings. All bills for service charges shall be due when rendered
and shall be subjected to a penalty of five percent (5%) if not paid within
fifteen (15) days from the date of the bill.
§ 219-23. Billings involving multiple meters.
The measurement by two (2) or more meters of the quantity of water used
in or on one (1) property by one (1) owner or user may be combined and the
service charge billed to said owner or user as though the quantity of water
was measured by one (1) meter if the Authority so elects.
§ 219-24. Installation of meters to measure water obtained from
other sources.
In the event that the owner of or the user of water in or on any property
served by the public sanitary sewerage system obtains part or all of the
water used in or on such property from sources other than the water
company, such owner or user shall, upon demand of the city or the
Authority, at no expense to the city, the Authority or the water company,
install and maintain a water meter or meters satisfactory to the city or the
Authority and to the water company for measuring all water used, other
than that obtained from the water company, and the quantity of water used
to determine the service charge shall be the quantity of water measured
by all such meters, plus the quantity of water obtained from the water
company.
§ 219-25. Installation of meters to measure water excluded from
sewer system.
In the event that it is established to the satisfaction of the city or the
Authority that a portion of the water used in or on any property served by
the public sanitary sewerage system does not and cannot enter the system,
and in the event that the total water used in or on said property exceeds one
hundred thousand (100,000) gallons per quarter, the city or the Authority
may require or permit the installation of additional meters in such manner
as to determine either the quantity of water excluded from the public
sanitary sewerage system or the quantity of water, sewage or industrial
waste actually entering the public sanitary sewerage system, exclusive of
§ 219-21 RENTAL PROPERTY § 219-25
215:275
stormwater runoff. The service charge shall be based upon the quantity
of water estimated, measured or computed by the city or the Authority
to be actually entering the public sanitary sewerage system, exclusive of
stormwater runoff.
§ 219-26. Reduction of service charge due to water not entering
sewer system.
Any person requesting a reduction of the amount of the service charge
because of water purchased which does not enter the public sanitary
sewerage system shall make written application to the city and the
Authority, giving the name of such person, his address and setting forth
supporting data fully describing other sources of water, if any, as well as the
disposition of water alleged not to be entering the public sanitary sewerage
system. The application shall be accompanied by a title sketch eighteen by
twenty-four (18 x 24) inches in dimension, to approximate scale showing the
plan of the property, the water distribution system, sewer layout, existing
meters and proposed meters in the scheme to determine the quantity of flow
entering or not entering the public sanitary sewerage system. The cost of
furnishing, installing and maintaining any meters other than those utilized
to measure water purchased from the water company shall be borne by the
applicant. The type, size, location, arrangement and maintenance of such
meters shall be subject to the approval of the city and/or the Authority.
§ 219-27. Contracts with other municipalities for sewage treatment
pursuant to different fee schedule authorized.
Nothing contained in this article shall preclude any city or authority from
entering into contracts with neighboring municipalities for the treatment
of their sewage pursuant to a schedule of fees differing from the service
charges above set forth.
§ 219-28. Imposition of surcharge for certain industrial wastes.
Although the proposed sewage treatment works will be capable of treating
certain abnormal industrial wastes, the actual treatment of such wastes
will increase the cost of operating and maintaining the public sanitary
sewerage system. Therefore, there is hereby imposed upon each person
discharging such industrial waste into the public sanitary sewerage system
a surcharge or surcharges which are intended to cover such additional cost.
Such surcharges shall be in addition to the regular service charge set forth
in this article of this chapter and shall be payable as hereinafter provided in
the amount hereinafter provided.
§ 219-29. Determination of strength of industrial waste.
The strength of any industrial waste, the discharge of which is to be
subject to surcharge, shall be determined monthly or more frequently from
samples taken either at the manhole referred to in § 219-16 hereof or at
any other sampling point mutually agreed upon by the Authority and the
§ 219-25 GREENSBURG CODE § 219-29
215:276
producer of such waste. The frequency and duration of the sampling period
shall be such as, in the opinion of the Authority, will permit a reasonably
reliable determination of the average composition of such waste, exclusive
of stormwater runoff. Samples shall be collected by the Authority or its
authorized representative in proportion to the flow of waste, exclusive of
stormwater runoff, and composited for analysis in accordance with the
latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and
Sewage, as published by the American Public Health Association. Except as
hereinafter provided, the strength of the waste so found by analysis shall be
used for establishing the surcharge or surcharges. However, the Authority
may, if it so elects, accept the results of routine sampling and analyses
by the producer of such wastes in lieu of making its own sampling and
analyses.
§ 219-30. BOD surcharge rate.
In the event that any industrial waste is found by the Authority or its
authorized representative, to have a BOD in excess of two hundred fifty
(250) parts per million, the producer of said waste shall be surcharged an
amount equal to the product of the actual volume of wastes in thousand
gallons per billing period, exclusive of stormwater runoff, discharged to the
public sanitary sewerage system and the BOD surcharge rate. The BOD
surcharge rate shall be determined by the following formula:
Rc = 0.00834 p (C-250)
where Rc = The BOD surcharge rate in cents per one thousand (1,000)
gallons of waste discharged.
p = the average annual fixed, operating and maintenance cost of
secondary treatment processes per pound of BOD received
at the treatment works. Such secondary processes shall
include chlorination as well as the activated sludge
processes. [Prior to completion of the first year of operation,
the value of "p" shall be assumed to be four cents ($.04).]
C = The average BOD of the industrial waste expressed in parts
per million, as determined in accordance with § 219-29 of
this article.
NOTES:
The figure "250" appearing in the above formula corresponds to the
maximum BOD permissible without surcharge. The figure "0.00834" is the
factor to convert parts per million to pounds per one thousand (1,000)
gallons. No discount will be permitted for sewage or industrial wastes
having a BOD less than two
§ 219-31. Suspended solids surcharge rate.
In the event that any industrial waste is found by the Authority to have an
average suspended solid concentration in excess of two hundred seventyfive
(275) parts per million, the producer of such waste shall be surcharged
§ 219-29 RENTAL PROPERTY § 219-31
215:277
an amount equal to the product of the actual volume of wastes in thousand
gallons per billing period, exclusive of stormwater runoff, discharged to the
public sanitary sewerage system and the suspended solids surcharge rate.
The suspended solids surcharge rate shall be determined by the following
formula:
Rs = 0.00834 x B (S-275)
where Rs = The suspended solids surcharge rate in cents per one
thousand (1,000) gallons of waste discharged.
B = The average annual fixed, operating and maintenance cost
of the sludge digestion, sludge drying and sludge disposal
operations per pound of suspended solids received at the
treatment works. [Prior to completion of the first year of
operation, the value of "B" shall be assumed to be four cents
($.04).]
S = The average suspended solids concentration of the abnormal
industrial waste expressed in parts per million, as
determined in accordance with § 219-29 of this article.
NOTES:
The figure "275" appearing in the above formula corresponds to the
maximum suspended solids concentration permissible without surcharge.
The figure "0.00834" is the factor to convert parts per million to pounds
per one thousand (1,000) gallons. No discount will be permitted for sewage
or industrial wastes having a suspended solids concentration less than two
hundred seventy-five (275) parts per million.
§ 219-32. Billing for industrial waste surcharges.
The surcharges provided for in this section will be added to the service
charges set forth in this article. They will be billed quarterly and shall be
due at the same time and shall be subject to the same penalty as set forth
in § 219-36 of this article. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
article, no surcharge will begin to accrue until after the sewage treatment
works are put into operation.
§ 219-33. Quarterly billing; estimated billing for first two months of
quarter.
The service charges, additional charges and the surcharges, where
applicable, provided for in this article shall be payable in four (4) quarterly
payments each year. The billing for the first two (2) months of each quarter
may be an estimate equal to one-third ( 1/3) of the service charge computed
on the actual water usage for that quarter, minus the estimated billings for
the first two (2) months of that quarter.
§ 219-34. Authority to render and collect bills.
The Authority, as agent of the city, either directly or through any person
whom it may by resolution appoint or with whom it may contract, will
§ 219-31 GREENSBURG CODE § 219-34
215:278
render such bills for the service charges, additional charges and surcharges
imposed by this article and will make collections thereof in accordance with
this article and any agreement or agreements entered into between the
water company and the Authority relating to such billing and collection.
§ 219-35. Mailing or delivery of bills and notices; no responsibility
for delivery; changes of address.
Bills and notices relating to the service charges, additional charges and
surcharges will be mailed or delivered to the property owner's or user's
last address as shown on the books of the water company, and neither the
Authority nor the water company shall be otherwise responsible for delivery.
No change of address will be honored unless and until such change shall
have been furnished, in writing, to the Authority and the water company.
§ 219-36. Collection of delinquent charges, additional charges and
penalties; removal or closing of sewer connection.
Each service charge, additional charge, surcharge and penalty imposed
by this article shall be a debt due the city and shall be a lien on the
property served and, if not paid within thirty (30) days after the date of
the bill, shall be deemed delinquent. In such event, the city may proceed
to file the lien in the office of the Prothonotary of Westmoreland County,
Pennsylvania, and collect the same in the manner provided by law for the
filing and collection of municipal claims. In the event of failure to pay the
service charge, additional charge, surcharge or penalty after they become
delinquent as herein provided, the city or Authority shall be authorized to
remove or close the sewer connection and shall have the right to enter
upon the property served for such purpose and to take such steps as
may be necessary to accomplish such removal or closing. The expense
of such removal or closing, as well as the expense of restoring any such
service, shall likewise be a debt due the city and a lien on the property
served and may be filed and collected as hereinabove provided, or such
connection shall not again be turned on or the sewage service restored until
all service charges, additional charges, surcharges and penalties, including
the expense of removal, closing and restoration, shall have been paid.
§ 219-37. Notice of violation; removal or closing of connection if
violation not corrected.
Notice of the violation by any person of any provision of this article shall
be given personally or by means of the United States Mail. and if no action
to correct the violation is taken within thirty (30) days of the date of such
notice, the sewer connection may be removed or closed and reconnection
will not be made until after correction of the violation has been
accomplished. The expense of such removal or closing and the expense of
restoring the sewage service shall be a debt due the city and a lien upon
the property served and may be filed and collected as provided in § 219-36
hereof.

wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or
consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage wastestreams from
industrial wastestreams and such other conditions as may be necessary
to protect the POTW and determine the user's compliance with the
requirements of this article.
B. The Manager may require any person discharging into the POTW to
install and maintain, on their property and at their expense, a suitable
storage and flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow. A
wastewater discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization.
C. Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion
of the Manager, they are necessary for the proper handling of

discharged. In addition, grab samples may be required to show
compliance with instantaneous discharge limits.
B. Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfides
and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection
techniques.
A. Where a user has security measures in force which require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user
shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that,
upon presentation of suitable identification, the Manager will be
permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing specific
responsibilities.
§ 219-76 GREENSBURG CODE § 219-79
215:304
§ 219-80. Search warrants.
If the Manager has been refused access to a building, structure or property
or any part thereof and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe
that there may be a violation of this article or that there is a need to inspect
and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program of the
Greater Greensburg Sewage Authority designed to verify compliance with
this article or any permit or order issued hereunder or to protect the overall
public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the Manager may
seek issuance of a search warrant from the Justice of the Peace having
jurisdiction of the City of Greensburg or from the Court of Common Pleas of
Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania.
§ 219-81. Confidential information.
Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater
discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge permits and
monitoring programs and the Manager's inspection and sampling activities
shall be available to the public without restriction, unless the user
specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the
Manager that the release of such information would divulge information,
processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets
under applicable state law. Any such request must be asserted at the time of
submission of the information or data. When requested and demonstrated
by the user furnishing a report that such information should be held
confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or
secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public,
but shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental
agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment program
and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report.
Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other effluent data, as
B. The Manager shall have the right to set up on the user's property or
require installation of such devices as are necessary to conduct
sampling and/or metering of the user's operations.
C. The Manager may require the user to install monitoring equipment as
necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be
maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the
user at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow
and quality shall be calibrated at least every six (6) months to ensure
their accuracy.
D. Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the
facility to be inspected and/or samples shall be promptly removed by
the user at the written or verbal request of the Manager and shall not
be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be born by the user.
E. Unreasonable delays in allowing the Manager access to the user's
premises shall be a violation of this article.
§ 219-79 RENTAL PROPERTY § 219-81
215:305
defined by 40 CFR 2.302, will not be recognized as confidential information
and will be available to the public without restriction.
§ 219-82. Publication of users in significant noncompliance.
The Manager shall publish annually in the largest daily newspaper
published in the municipality where the POTW is located a list of the
users which, during the previous twelve (12) months, were in significant
noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.
The term "significant noncompliance" shall mean:
A. Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those
in which sixty-six percent (66%) or more of wastewater measurements
taken during a six-month period exceed the daily maximum limit or
average limit for the same pollutant parameter by any amount;
B. Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in
which thirty-three percent (33%) or more of wastewater measurements
taken for each pollutant parameter during a six-month period equals or
exceeds the product of the daily maximum limit or the average limit
multiplied by the applicable criteria [one and fourth-tenths (1.4) for
BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease and one and two-tenths (1.2) for all
other pollutants except pH];
C. Any other discharge violation that the Manager believes has caused,
along or in combination with other discharges, interference or passthrough,
including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the
general public;
D. Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment to
the public or to the environment or has resulted in the Manager's
exercise of his emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge;
E. Failure to meet, within ninety (90) days of the scheduled date, a
compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge
permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing
construction or attaining final compliance;
F. Failure to provide, within thirty (30) days after the due date, any
required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on
compliance with Categorical Pretreatment Standard deadlines, periodic
self-monitoring reports and reports on compliance with compliance
schedules;
G. Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or
H. Any other violation(s) which the Manager determines will adversely
affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment
program.
§ 219-81 GREENSBURG CODE § 219-83
215:306
§ 219-83. Notification of violation.
When the Manager finds that a user has violated or continues to violate
any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued
hereunder or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
Manager may service upon that user a written notice of violation. Within
three (3) days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation
and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include
specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the Manager.
Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any
violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation.
Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the Manager to take
any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action,
without first issuing a notice of violation.
§ 219-84. Consent orders.
The Manager may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary
compliance or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any
user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific
action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time
period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same
force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to §§ 219-86
and 219-87 of this article and shall be judicially enforceable.
§ 219-85. Show cause hearing.
The Manager may order a user which has violated or continues to violate
any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued
hereunder or any other pretreatment standard or requirement to appear
before the Manager and show cause why the proposed enforcement action
should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time
and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons
for such action and a request that the user show cause why the proposed
enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall
be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt
requested) at least five (5) days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be
served on any authorized representative of the user. A show cause hearing
shall not be a bar against or prerequisite for taking any other action against
the user.
§ 219-86. Compliance orders.
When the Manager finds that a user has violated or continues to violate
any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued
hereunder or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
Manager may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge
directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the
user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service
may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or other
§ 219-83 RENTAL PROPERTY § 219-86
215:307
related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance
orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance,
including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to
minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance
order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a
pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve
the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation.
Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against or a prerequisite
for taking any other action against the user.
§ 219-87. Cease and desist orders.
§ 219-88. Administrative fines.
A. When the Manager finds that a user has violated or continues to violate
any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order
issued hereunder or any other pretreatment standard or requirement
or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the Manager may
issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such
violations and directing the user to:
(1) Immediately comply with all requirements; and
(2) Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation,
including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.
B. Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against or a
prerequisite for taking any other action against the user.
A. When the Manager finds that a user has violated or continues to violate
any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order
issued hereunder or any other pretreatment standard or requirement,
the Manager may fine such user in an amount not to exceed twenty-five
thousand dollars ($25,000.). Such fines shall be assessed on a per
violation, per day basis. In the case of monthly or other long-term
average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the
period of violation.
B. Unpaid charges, fines and penalties shall, after thirty (30) calendar
days, be assessed an additional penalty of five percent (5%) of the
unpaid balance, and interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of one
percent (1%) per month. A lien against the user's property will be
sought for unpaid charges, fines and penalties.
C. Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for the
Manager to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine
amount within ten (10) days of being notified of the fine. Where a
request has merit, the Manager may convene a hearing on the matter.
In the event that the user's appeal is successful, the payment, together
with any interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user. The

215:308
§ 219-89. Emergency suspensions.
§ 219-90. Termination of discharge.
Manager may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement
actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine.
D. Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against or a
prerequisite for taking any other action against the user.
A. The Manager may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after
informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to
stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to
present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the
health or welfare of persons. The Manager may also immediately
suspend a user's health or welfare of persons. The Manager may also
immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to
respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW or
which presents or may present an endangerment to the environment.
(1) Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately
stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to
immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the
Manager may take such steps as deemed necessary, including
immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or
minimize damage to the POTW or its receiving stream or
endangerment to any individuals. The Manager may allow the user
to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to
the satisfaction of the Manager that the period of endangerment
has passed, unless the termination proceedings in § 219-90 of this
article are initiated against the user.
(2) A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written
statement describing the cause of the harmful contribution and the
measures taken to prevent any future occurrence to the Manager
prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under
§ 219-85 or 219-90 of this article.
B. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior
to any emergency suspension under this section.
A. In addition to the provisions in § 219-63 of this article, any user who
violates the following conditions is subject to discharge termination:
(1) Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions.
(2) Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge.
(3) Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater
volume, constituents and characteristics prior to discharge.
§ 219-88 RENTAL PROPERTY § 219-90
215:309
§ 219-91. Injunctive relief.
When the Manager finds that a user has violated or continues to violate
any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued
hereunder or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
Manager may petition the Court of Common Pleas of Westmoreland County,
Pennsylvania, through the Solicitor of the Greater Greensburg Sewage
Authority, for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as
appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the
wastewater discharge permit, order or other requirement imposed by this
article on activities of the user. The Manager may also seek such other
action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a
requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition
for injunction relief shall not be a bar against or a prerequisite for taking
any other action against a user.
§ 219-92. Civil penalties.
(4) Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose
of inspection, monitoring or sampling.
(5) Violation of the pretreatment standards in §§ 219-43 through
219-46 of this article.
B. Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge
and be offered an opportunity to show cause under § 219-85 of this
article why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this
option by the Manager shall not be a bar to or a prerequisite for taking
any other action against the user.
A. A user who has violated or continues to violate any provisions of this
article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder or
any other pretreatment standard or requirement may be liable to the
Greater Greensburg Sewage Authority for a maximum civil penalty of
twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.) for violation, per day. In the
case of a monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties
shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation.
B. The Manager may recover reasonable attorney's fees, court costs and
other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including
sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages
incurred by the Greater Greensburg Sewage Authority.
C. In determining the amount of civil liability, the Court shall take into
account all relevant circumstances, including but not limited to the
extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of
the violation, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation,
corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user and
any other factor as justice requires.

§ 219-93. Criminal prosecution.
§ 219-94. Remedies nonexclusive.
The remedies provided for in this article are not exclusive. The Manager
may take any, all or any combination of these actions against a
noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally
be in accordance with the Greater Greensburg Sewage Authority's
enforcement response plan. However, the Manager may take other action
against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the Manager
is empowered to take more than one (1) enforcement action against any
noncompliant user.
§ 219-95. Performance bonds.
The Manager may decline to issue or reissue a wastewater discharge permit
to any user who has failed to comply with any provision of this article, a
previous wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder or any
other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless such user first files a

prerequisite for taking any other action against a user.
A. A user who willfully or negligently violates any provision of this article,
a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement shall, upon conviction, be guilty
of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than twenty-five
thousand dollars ($25,000.) per violation, per day, or imprisonment for
not more than two (2) years, or both.
B. A user who willfully or negligently introduces any substance into the
POTW which causes personal injury or property damage shall, upon
conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor and be subject to a penalty of
not more than five thousand dollars ($5,000.) or be subject to
imprisonment for not more than one (1) year, or both. This penalty shall
be in addition to any other cause of action for personal injury or
property damage available under state law.
C. A user who knowingly makes any false statements, representations or
certifications in any application, record, report, plan or other
documentation filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this
article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder or
who falsifies, tampers with or knowingly renders inaccurate any
monitoring device or method required under this article shall, upon
conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than three hundred
dollars ($300.) per violation, per day.
D. In the event of a second conviction, a user shall be punished by a fine or
imprisonment up to the maximum allowable by the laws of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania based on the sentencing guidelines
adopted by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

satisfactory bond, payable to the Greater Greensburg Sewage Authority, in
a sum not to exceed a value determined by the Manager to be necessary to
achieve consistent compliance.
§ 219-96. Liability insurance.
The Manager may decline to issue or reissue a wastewater discharge permit
to any user who has failed to comply with any provision of this article, a
previous wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder or any
other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless the user first submits
proof that it has obtained financial assurances sufficient to restore or repair
damage to the POTW caused by its discharge.
§ 219-97. Water supply severance.
Whenever a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this
article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder or any
other pretreatment standard or requirement, water service to the user may
be severed. Service will only recommence, at the user's expense, after it has
satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to comply.
§ 219-98. Public nuisances.
A violation of any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or
order issued hereunder or any other pretreatment standard or requirement
is hereby declared a public nuisance and shall be corrected or abated as
directed by the Manager. Any person(s) creating a public nuisance shall be
subject to the provisions of the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
governing such nuisances.
§ 219-99. Affirmative defenses to discharge violations.
A. Upset.
(1) For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional
incident in which there is unintentional and temporary
noncompliance with Categorical Pretreatment Standards because
of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does
not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational
error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate
treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance or careless or
improper operation.
(2) An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action
brought for noncompliance with Categorical Pretreatment
Standards if the requirements of Subsection C(3), below are met.
(3) A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset
shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous
operating logs or other relevant evidence, that:
§ 219-95 GREENSBURG CODE § 219-99
215:312
(a) An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the
upset.
(b) The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable
operation and maintenance procedures.
(c) The user has submitted the following information to the
Manager within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of
the upset [if this information is provided orally, a written
submission must be provided within five (5) days]:
[1] A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance.
[2] The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and
times, or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the
noncompliance is expected to continue.
[3] Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
(4) In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of any upset shall have the burden of proof.
(5) Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any
claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for
noncompliance with Categorical Pretreatment Standards.
(6) Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with Categorical Pretreatment
Standards upon reduction, loss or failure of its treatment facility
until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is
provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among
other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility
is reduced, lost or fails.
B. Prohibited discharge standards. A user shall have an affirmative
defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance
with the general prohibitions in § 219-43A of this article or the specific
prohibitions in § 219-43B(3) through (16) of this article if it can prove
that it did not know or have reason to know that its discharge, alone or
in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause passthrough
or interference and that either:
(1) A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged, and the user was
in compliance with each limit directly prior to and during the passthrough
or interference; or
(2) No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially
in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the
Greater Greensburg Sewage Authority was regularly in compliance
§ 219-99 RENTAL PROPERTY § 219-99
215:313
with its NPDES permit and, in the case of interference, was in
compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.
C. Bypass.
(1) For the purposes of this subsection, the following terms shall have
the meanings indicated:
BYPASS  The intentional diversion of wastestreams from any
portion of a user's treatment facility.
SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE  Substantial physical damage to
property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to
become inoperable or substantial and permanent loss of natural
resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the
absence of a bypass. "Severe property damage" does not mean
economic loss caused by delays in production.
(2) A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause
pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if
it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation.
These bypasses are not subject to the provision of Subsections C(3)
and (4) of this section.
(3) Notice of bypasses.
(a) If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall
submit prior notice to the Manager, at least ten (10) days
before the date of the bypass, if possible.
(b) A user shall submit oral notice to the Manager of an
unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment
standards within twenty-four (24) hours from the time it
becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also
be provided within five (5) days of the time the user becomes
aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a
description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the
bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has
not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to
continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and
prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The Manager may waive
the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has
been received within twenty-four (24) hours.
(4) Bypass is prohibited, and the Manager may take an enforcement
action against a user for a bypass, unless bypass was unavoidable
to prevent loss of life, personal injury or severe property damage
and there were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes
or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime.
This condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should
have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering
judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal
§ 219-99 GREENSBURG CODE § 219-99
215:314
§ 219-100. Pretreatment charges and fees.
The Greater Greensburg Sewage Authority may adopt reasonable fees for
reimbursement of costs of setting up and operating the Greater Greensburg
Sewage Authority's pretreatment program, which may include:
periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance, and
the user submitted notices as required under Subsection C(3) of
this section. The Manager may approve an anticipated bypass, after
considering its adverse effects, if the Manager determines that it
will meet the three (3) conditions listed in the first sentence of this
subsection.
A. Fees for wastewater discharge permit applications, including the cost
of processing such applications.
B. Fees for monitoring, inspection and surveillance procedures, including
the cost of collection and analyzing a user's discharge and reviewing
monitoring reports submitted by users.
C. Fees for reviewing and responding to accidental discharge procedures
and construction.
D. Fees for filing appeals.
E. Other fees as the Greater Greensburg Sewage Authority may deem
necessary to carry out the requirements contained herein. These fees
are related solely to the matters covered by this article and are
separate from all other fees, fines and penalties chargeable by the
Greater Greensburg Sewage Authority.

§ 219-107. Stormwater management performance standards.
A. Stormwater management perforance districts.
(1) For purposes of stormwater management, the City of Greensburg is
divided into the following stormwater management districts:
(a) Northjmont Watershed.
(b) Shaller's Watershed.
(2) The location and boundaries of the watersheds and subareas are
shown on the Municipal Stormwater Management District Map
hereby adopted as part of this section.91
B. General standards. The following provisions shall be considered the
overriding performance standards against which all proposed
stormwater control measures shall be evaluated and shall apply
throughout the City of Greensburg:
(1) Any landowner and any persoin engaged in the alteration or
development of land which may affect stormwater runoff
characteristics shall implement such measures as are reasonably
necessary to prevent injury to health, safety or other property. Such
measures shall include such actions as are required:
(a) To assure that the maximum rate of stormwater runoff is no
greater after development than prior to development activities;
or
(b) To manage the quantity, velocity and direction of resulting
stormwater runoff in a manner which otherwise adequately
protects health and property from possible injury.

(2) Calculation methods.
(a) Development sites. For purpose of computing peak flow rates
and runoff hydrographs from development sites, calculations
shall be performed using one (1) of the following: SCS
publications, Technical Release (TR) 55 or 20, HEC I or Penn
State Runoff Model. For sites less than five (5) acres, the
Rational Method may be used as approved by the municipal/
consulting engineer. The intensity for the rational formula will
be the rainfall depths listed above.
(b) Stormwater collection/conveyance facilities. For the purposes
of designing storm sewers, open swales and other stormwater
runoff collection and conveyance facilities, any of the abovelisted
calculation methods or the Rational Method may be
used. Rainfall intensities for design should be obtained from
the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation rainfal charts.
(c) Predevelopment conditions. Predevelopment conditions shall
be assumed to be those which exist on any site. Hydrologic
conditions for all areas with pervious cover (i.e., field,s woods,
lawn areas, pastures, cropland, etc.) shall be assumed to be in

facilites for the purpose of designing those facilities shall be
accomplished using the Modified-Puls Method or recognized
reservoir routing method subject to the approval of the
municipality and county.
(3) Release rate percentage.
(a) Definition. The release rate percentage defines the percentage
of the predevelopment peak rate of runoff that can be
discharged from an outfall on teh site after development or
alterations within the subarea. A delineation of the release rate
percentages by subarea is shown on the Municipal Stormwater
Management District Map.92
§ 219-107 RENTAL PROPERTY § 219-107
215:325
§ 219-108. Design criteria for stormwater management control.
(b) Procedure for use.
[1] Identify the specific subarea in which the development site
is located and obtain the subarea release rate percentage
from the watershed map.
[2] Compute the pre- and post-development runoff
hydrographs for each stormwater outfall on the
development site using an acceptable calculation method
for the two- , ten- , twenty-five- and one-hundred-year
sotrms. Apply to on-site detention for stormwater
management but inclue any techniques to minimize
imperivous surfaces and/or increase the time of
concentration for stormwater flowing from the
development site. If the post-development peak runoff rate
and volume are less then or equal to the pre-development
peak runoff rate nd volume, then additional stormwater
control shall not be required at that outfall. If the postdevelopment
peak runoff rate and volume are greater than
the pre-development peak runoff rate and volume, then
stormwater detention will be required and the capacity of
the detention facility must be calculated in the manner
prescribed below.
[3] Multiply the subarea release rate percentage by the predevelopment
rate of runoff from the development site to
determine the maximum allowable release rate from any
detention facility for the four (4) prescribe storm events.
[4] Design the outlet control facility and size the volume of the
detention facility using the calculated post development
hydrograph and accepted hydrograph routing procedures
in consieration of the maximum allowable release rate.
A. General criteria.
(1) Applications may select runoff control techniques, or a combination
of techniques, which are most suitable to control stormwater runoff
from the development site. All controls must be subject to approval
of the Municipal/Consulting Engineer. The Municipal/Consulting
Engineer may request specific information on design and/or
operating features of the proposed stormwater controls in order to
determine their suitability and adequacy of the standards of this
article.
(2) The stormwater collection system must be designed to carry all
storm flows generated by storm events up to and including the ten-
92.Editor's Note: Said map is on file in the city offices.
§ 219-107 GREENSBURG CODE § 219-108
215:326
year storm event. For storm events greater than the ten-year storm,
the maximum capacity of the collection system must be analyzed.
All stormwater that cannot be carried by the collection system must
be analyzed as overland flow. The overland flows should, as much
as possible, be directed to the stormwater detention facilities. All
flows generated by storms greater than the ten-year flows must
be analyzed to ensure that proper detention is attained and that
minimal damage to persons or property is incurred by these flows.
(3) The applicant should consider the effects of the proposed
stormwater management techniques on any special soil conditions
or geological hazards which may exist on the development site. In
the event that such conditions are identified on the site, the
Municipal/Consulting Engineer may require in-depth studies by a
competent geotechnical engineer. Not all stormwater control
methods may be advisable or allowable at a particular development
site.
(4) The stormwater management practices to be used in developing a
stormwater management plan for a particular site shall be selected
according to the following order of preference:
(a) Infiltration of runoff on-site.
(b) Flow attenuation by use of open vegetated swales and natural
depressions.
(c) Stormwater detention/retention structures.
(5) Infiltration practices shall be used to the extent practicable to
reduce volume increases and promote groundwater recharge. A
combination of successive practices may be used to achieve the
applicable minimum control requirements.
B. Criteria for post-collection infiltration systems.
(1) Infiltration system shall be sized and designed based upon local soil
and groundwater conditions.
(2) Infiltration systems shall be greater than three (3) feet deep and
shall be located at least ten (10) feet from basement walls.
(3) Infiltration systems shall not be used to handle runoff from
commercial or industrial working or parking areas. This prohibition
does not extend to roof areas which are demonstrated to be
suitably protected from the effects of the commercial/industrial
activities.
(4) Infiltration systems shall not receive runoff until the entire
drainage area to the system has received final stabilization (i.e., no
erosion is occurring from the area).
§ 219-108 RENTAL PROPERTY § 219-108
215:327
(5) The stormwater infiltration facility design shall provide an overflow
system with measures to provide a non-erosive velocity of flow
along its entire length and at the outfall.
C. Criteria for stormwater detention facilities.
(1) If detention facilities are utilized for the development site, the
facility(ies) shall be designed such that post-development peak
runoff rates from the developed site are controlled to those rates
defined by the subarea release rate percentage for the two- , ten- ,
twenty-five and one-hundred-year storm frequencies.
(2) All detention facilities shall be equipped with outlet structures to
provide discharge control for the four (4) designated storm
frequencies. Provisions shall also be made to safely pass, at
minimum, the post-development one-hundred-year storm runoff
without breaching or otherwise damaging (i.e., impairing the
continued function of) the facilities.
(3) Shared-storage facilities which provide detention of runoff for more
than one (1) development site within a single subarea may be
considered and are encouraged. Such facilities shall meet the
criteria contained in this section. In addition, runoff from the
development sites involved shall be conveyed to the facility in a
manner that avoids adverse impacts (such as flooding or erosion) to
channels and properties located between the development site and
the shared-storage facilities.
(4) Where detention facilities will be utilized, multiple-use facilities,
such as wetlands, lakes, ballfields or similar recreation/open space
uses, are encouraged wherever feasible, subject to the approval of
the municipality and the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Resources' Chapter 105 regulations.
(5) Design criteria.
(a) Spillway design. The outlets for any detention facility must be
capable of passing the one-hundred-year storm flows. All
facilities must have an emergency spillway capable of handling
the one-hundred-year storm flows.
(b) Principal spillway. The principal spillway (main outlet
structure) must be constructed with reinforced concrete. All
principal spillway openings larger than three (3) square feet
must be covered with an open grating to prevent unauthorized
access.
(c) Principal spillway base. The base of the principal spillway must
be firmly anchored to prevent floating. If the riser of the
spillway is greater than ten (10) feet in height, computations
must be submitted to the Municipal/Consulting Engineer for
§ 219-108 GREENSBURG CODE § 219-108
215:328
approval. A factor of safety of one and five-tenths (1.5) will be
applied to these computations.
(d) Freeboard. The minimum allowable freeboard between the top
of the calculated high water mark in the emergency spillway
and top of the embankment shall be one (1) foot.
(e) Emergency spillway. The emergency spillway shall consist of
an open channel constructed adjacent to the embankment over
undisturbed material (not fill). The minimum emergency
spillway size shall be two (2) feet in width and one (1) foot in
height.
(f) Fences. All detention facilities will be fenced. All fences
associated with a detention facility will be a chain-link-type
fence with a minimum height of six (6) feet. All fence posts
must be firmly anchored with concrete. The bottom of the
fence must follow the ground contours.
(g) Access. All detention facilities must have an access road with a
minimum width of twelve (12) feet and a slope not to exceed
twenty percent (20%) to the bottom of the pond.
(h) Embankment. All embankment must be keyed into the original
ground. A minimum of twenty-five percent (25%) of the interior
slopes must not exceed a ratio of three to one (3:1) horizontal
to vertical dimensions. The remainder of the interior slopes
must not exceed a ratio of two to one (2:1) horizontal to
vertical dimensions. The following top widths shall be used for
all detention basin embankments:
Height of Embankment
(feet)
Top Width
(feet)
0 - 10 6
10 - 15 8
15 - 20 10
20+ 15
(6) Other considerations which should be incorporated into the design
of the detention facilities include:
(a) Inflow and outflow structures shall be designed and installed to
prevent erosion, and bottoms of impoundment-type structures
should be protected from soil erosion.
(b) Control and removal of debris, both in the storage structure
and in all inlet or outlet devices, shall be a design
consideration.
§ 219-108 RENTAL PROPERTY § 219-108
215:329
(c) Inflow and outflow structures, pumping stations, and other
structures shall be designed and protected to minimize safety
hazards.
(d) The developer shall be required to provide fencing around the
perimeter of the pond unless waived by the Council of
Greensburg.
(e) Landscaping shall be provided for the facility which
harmonizes with the surrounding area. The developer will be
responsible for planting trees and plants on the excavated
slopes and impoundment bottom. The type and species of
vegetation to be planted must be of a type that is compatible
with the soil and proposed environment. No planting of trees
will be permitted on the embankment slopes. The embankment
slopes will be planted with shrubs and ground cover.
(f) The facility shall be located to facilitate maintenance,
considering the frequency and type of equipment that will be
required.
D. Criteria for collection/conveyance facilities.
(1) All stormwater runoff collection or conveyance facilities, whether
storm sewers or other open or closed channels, shall be designed in
accordance with the following basic standards:
(a) All sites shall be graded to provide drainage away from and
around the structure in order to prevent any potential flooding
damage.
(b) When a house located on the high side of a street extends roof
and French drains to the street, these drains must be
connected to the nearest storm sewer system provided in the
street. Low side lots shall extend roof and French drains to a
stormwater collection conveyance/control system or natural
watercourse in accordance with this article.
(c) Collection/conveyance facilities should not be installed parallel
and close to the top or bottom of a major embankment to avoid
the possibility of failing or causing the embankment to fail.
(d) All collection/conveyance facilities shall be designed to convey
the ten-year storm peak flow rate from the contributing
drainage area and to carry it to the nearest suitable outlet,
such as a stormwater control facility, storm sewer or natural
watercourse.
(e) Where drainage swales or open channels are used, they shall
be suitably lined to prevent erosion and designed to avoid
excessive velocities.

of, part of, or during any stage of, a larger common plan of
development.
D. Evidence of any necessary permit(s) for regulated earth disturbance
activities from the appropriate DEP regional office or County
Conservation District must be provided to the City. The issuance of an
NPDES construction permit (or permit coverage under the statewide
general permit (PAG-2) satisfies the requirements Subsection A.
E. A copy of the erosion and sediment control plan and any required
permit, as required by DEP regulations, shall be available at the project
site at all times.
A. Maintenance responsibilities.

separately owned and in which streets, sewers and other
public improvements are to be dedicated to the municipality,
stormwater control facilities shall also be dedicated to and
maintained by the municipality. All stormwater control
facilities must be on a separate parcel(s) dedicated by deed to
the municipality. Dedication and acceptance therefor shall be
at the sole election of the municipality.
(b) If a development site is to be maintained in a single ownership
or if sewers and other public improvements are to be privately
owned and maintained, then the ownership and maintenance
of stormwater control facilities shall be the responsibility of the
owner or private management entity.
(3) The Council of the City of Greensburg, with recommendations from
the Municipal/Consulting Engineer, shall make the final
determination on the continuing maintenance responsibilities prior
to final approval of the stormwater management plan. The Council
reserves the right to accept the ownership and operating
responsibility for any or all of the stormwater management
controls.
B. Maintenance agreement for privately owned stormwater facilities.
(1) Prior to final approval of the site's stormwater management plan,
the property owner shall sign and record, in the Westmoreland
County Recorder of Deeds office, a maintenance agreement
covering all stormwater control facilities which are to be privately
owned. The agreement shall stipulate that:
(a) The owner shall operate and maintain all facilities in
accordance with the approved operation and maintenance

of Greensburg an on-call, door-to-door e-waste and household
hazardous waste ("HHW") collection, processing and disposal service
("HHW service") to include the collection of electronic waste during the

HHW service is to provide a safe, convenient, efficient and costeffective
method for residents to dispose of acceptable HHW (and
electronic) materials as defined under § 227-5 that are otherwise
difficult to dispose of and which are being stockpiled in residents'
homes. The contractor's HHW service shall include the following
mandatory components:
(1) The program must be offered to all residents on an on-call basis.
For residents to schedule a collection date, a toll-free hotline must
be provided with live operators between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and
5:00 p.m. EST, Monday through Friday (English- and Spanishspeaking
operators). An automated call system shall be available
for calls received after hours, on weekends and holidays. A webbased
platform also must be available 24 hours per day, seven days
per week, to permit residents to schedule collections. The call
center must be staffed with individuals who are tasked as their
exclusive job to work with residents and their household hazardous
and electronic materials. Residents may use the program as often
during the year as may be needed.
(2) The collector must provide each resident, via U.S. Mail, at least
seven days in advance of the scheduled collection date, a
containment device (box/bag) which is approved by City of
Greensburg and meets DEP requirements. Each containment
device should hold approximately 50 to 75 pounds of acceptable
materials.
(3) Residents may fill the bag and also can place outside the bag large
items such as straight fluorescent lamps, auto batteries and
electronics.
(4) An instruction sheet must accompany the containment device with
complete details about the program. Blank labels shall be included
with the containment device for residents to label and identify
unlabeled acceptable materials. In addition, a preprinted, postage
prepaid survey card must accompany the containment device,
soliciting customer feedback on the service. The return address on
§ 227-13 GREENSBURG CODE § 227-13
215:354
the survey cards will be to a representative to be designated by City
of Greensburg.
(5) Acceptable material must be collected from the resident's property
and not from public property, including the curb. Residents must be
advised, during the initial scheduling call, on how to place their
acceptable materials for collection. Technical assistance shall be
available for residents who request assistance.
(6) Scheduling and collection priority shall be given to residents with
disabilities or those who are moving in the immediate future.
(7) All acceptable materials must be properly separated preceding
transportation to avoid contact with incompatible substances, must
be packaged properly by the collector, and must be shipped to
permitted facilities for recycling, treatment or disposal (in that
preferred order).
(8) Materials collected must be recycled to the highest degree
possible. Recycle, incineration, treatment, landfill is the applicable
hierarchy.
(9) The approved collector is required by DEP to register as a
hazardous waste transporter, obtain an EPA ID number and submit
a program registration to DEP which must be approved prior to
work starting. Further, the disposition site must be permitted to
accept hazardous materials and be included in the documents
submitted to DEP.
(10) There can be no separate charge for electronic waste, and the
successful collector must comply with existing state regulations
regarding disposition of electronics. The current state/
manufacturer program does not apply to this bid.
(11) The collector must indemnify the City for any action that may occur
after the collector has taken possession of the materials. The
collector must accept generator status.
(12) In conjunction with Subsection X of § 227-26, the collector shall
develop a press release and/or advertising material to announce
the e-waste and HHW service, and shall plan and provide a public
education campaign introducing the household hazardous waste
collection and e-waste programs.
(13) The collector shall provide the City of Greensburg with quarterly
and annual reports detailing all materials collected, number of
homes collected from, pounds per home and other pertinent details
as may be required by the City of Greensburg.
(14) The collection of e-waste/HHW from businesses is excluded from
this program. Homes with commercial chemicals, containers of
more than five gallons and home businesses will not be served.

closed or restricted to traffic:
deemed conclusive evidence of defective backfilling by the permittee.
Nothing herein contained shall be construed to require the permittee
to maintain any repairs to pavement made by the city if such repairs
should prove defective. Any owner of real estate repairing or engaging
another to repair his own sidewalk shall not be required to give such
bond. Recovery on such bond for any injury or accident shall not

designated as detours without expense to the permittee, but in case
there are no existing highways, the permittee shall construct all detours
at its own expense and in conformity with the specifications of the

company or person owning the utility. If it becomes necessary to remove an
existing utility, this shall be done by its owner. No utility owned by the city

is borne by the permittee. The cost of moving privately owned utilities shall
be similarly borne by the permittee unless it makes other arrangements
with the person owning the utility. The permittee shall support and protect,
by timbers or otherwise, all pipes, conduits, poles, wires or other apparatus

protect from injury any adjoining property by providing proper foundations
and taking other measures suitable for the purpose. Where in the protection
of such property it is necessary to enter upon private property for the
purpose of taking appropriate protective measures, the permittee shall
obtain a license from the owner of such private property for such purpose,
and if he cannot obtain a license from such owner, the Municipal/Consulting

purpose of making the property safe. The permittee shall, at its own
expense, shore up and protect all buildings, walls, fences or other property
likely to be damaged during the progress of the excavation work and shall
be responsible for all damage to public or private property or highways
resulting from its failure to properly protect and carry out said work.
Whenever it may be necessary for the permittee to trench through any
lawn area, the sod shall be carefully cut and rolled and replaced after
ditches have been backfilled as required in this Article. All construction
and maintenance work shall be done in a manner calculated to leave the
lawn area clean of earth and debris and in a condition as nearly as possible

§ 232-38. Care of excavated material.
All material excavated from trenches and piled adjacent to the trench or in
any street shall be piled and maintained in such manner as not to endanger
those working in the trench, pedestrians or users of the streets and so
that as little inconvenience as possible is caused to those using streets and
adjoining property. Where the confines of the area being excavated are too
narrow to permit the piling of excavated material beside the trench, such
as might be the case in a narrow alley, the Director shall have the authority
to require that the permittee haul the excavated material to a storage site
and then rehaul it to the trench site at the time of backfilling. It shall be the

provide for the free passage of surface water. The permittee shall make
provision to take care of all surplus water, muck, silt, slickings or other
runoff pumped from excavations or resulting from sluicing or other
operations and shall be responsible for any damage resulting from its failure
to so provide.

Earned Income Tax
[Adopted 11-28-1961 by Ord. No. 648; amended in its entirety
4-14-2003 by Ord. No. 1865]
§ 240-1. Definitions.
The definitions contained in this section shall be exclusive for any tax
upon earned income and net profits levied and assessed by the City of
Greensburg pursuant to Act 511, the Local Tax Enabling Act, as set forth at
53 P.S. § 6913, as amended:
ASSESSMENT  The determination by a local taxing authority of the
amount of underpayment by a taxpayer.[Added 2-9-2004 by Ord. No.
1884]
ASSOCIATION  A partnership, limited partnership, or any other
unincorporated group of two or more persons.
BUSINESS  An enterprise, activity, profession or any other undertaking of
an unincorporated nature conducted for profit or ordinarily conducted for
profit whether by a person, partnership, association, or any other entity.
COMPENSATION  See "earned income."[Added 2-9-2004 by Ord. No.
1884]
CORPORATION  A corporation or joint-stock association organized under

other state, territory, foreign country or dependency.
COVENANT NOT TO COMPETE  An agreement whereby one party
promises to compensate another to refrain from working in a certain
profession or business, within a limited geographical region, for a certain
period of time. It is a positive absence of activity in the form of an
affirmative restraint and is therefore taxable. It is not comparable to income
from the sale of good will, nor can the compensation received be considered
investment income, for the payment is directly dependent upon the conduct
of the person receiving the compensation.[Added 2-9-2004 by Ord. No.
1884]
CURRENT YEAR  The calendar year for which the tax is levied.
DOMICILE  The place where one lives and has his/her permanent home
and to which he/she has the intention of returning whenever he/she is
absent. Actual residence is not necessarily domicile, for domicile is the fixed
place of abode which, in the intention of the taxpayer, is permanent rather
than transitory. Domicile is the voluntarily fixed place of habitation of a
person, not for a mere special or limited purpose, but with the present
intention of making a permanent home, until some event occurs to induce
him/her to adopt some other permanent home. In the case of businesses, or
associations, the domicile is that place considered as the center of business
affairs and the place where its functions are discharged.

more persons for a salary, wage, commission or other compensation.

and/or a private agency designated by City Council to collect and administer

its income or profits, as hereinafter defined.[Added 2-9-2004 by Ord. No.
1884]
NET PROFITS  The net income from the operation of a business,
profession, or other activity, except corporations, as determined under

exempt from payment of the tax:

B. Procedure to claim exemption.
§ 240-11 GREENSBURG CODE § 240-13
215:432
(1) A person seeking to claim an exemption from the local services tax
may annually file an exemption certificate with the political
subdivision and with the person's employer affirming that the
person reasonably expects to receive earned income and net profits
from all sources within the political subdivision of less than
$12,000 in the calendar year for which the exemption certificate is
filed. In the event the political subdivision utilizes a tax collection
officer, it shall provide a copy of the exemption certificate to that
officer. The exemption certificate shall have attached to it a copy of
all the employee's last pay stubs or W-2 forms from employment
within the political subdivision for the year prior to the fiscal year
for which the employee is requesting to be exempted from the tax.
Upon receipt of the exemption certificate and until otherwise
instructed by the political subdivision or except as required by
Subsection B(2), the employer shall not withhold the tax from the
person during the calendar year or the remainder of the calendar
year for which the exemption certificate applies. Employers shall
ensure that the exemption certificate forms are readily available to
employees at all times and shall furnish each new employee with a
form at the time of hiring. The exemption certificate form shall be
the uniform form provided by the political subdivision.
(2) With respect to a person who claimed an exemption for a given
calendar year from the tax, upon notification to an employer by the
person or by the political subdivision that the person has received
earned income and net profits from all sources within the political
subdivision equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that calendar year or
that the person is otherwise ineligible for the tax exemption for that
calendar year, or upon an employer's payment to the person of
earned income within the municipality in an amount equal to or in
excess of $12,000 in that calendar year, an employer shall withhold
the local services tax from the person under Subsection B(3).
(3) If a person who claimed an exemption for a given calendar year
from the tax becomes subject to the tax for the calendar year under
Subsection B(2), the employer shall withhold the tax for the
remainder of that calendar year. The employer shall withhold from
the person, for the first payroll period after receipt of the
notification under Subsection B(2), a lump sum equal to the amount
of tax that was not withheld from the person due to the exemption
claimed by the person under this subsection, plus the per-payroll
amount due for that first payroll period. The amount of tax withheld
per payroll period for the remaining payroll periods in that
calendar year shall be the same amount withheld for other
employees. In the event the employment of a person subject to
withholding of the tax under this clause is subsequently severed in
that calendar year, the person shall be liable for any outstanding
balance of tax due, and the political subdivision may pursue
collection under this article.

subsection that employers shall not be responsible for investigating
exemption certificates, monitoring tax exemption eligibility or
exempting any employee from the local services tax.
C. Refunds. The City of Greensburg, in consultation with the Collector and
DCED, shall establish procedures for the processing of refund claims
for any tax paid by any person who is eligible for exemption, which
procedures shall be in accord with provisions of the general municipal
law relating to refunds of overpayments and interest on overpayments.
Refunds made within 75 days of a refund request or 75 days after the
last day the employer is required to remit the tax for the last quarter of
the calendar year, whichever is later, shall not be subject to interest. No
refunds shall be made for amounts overpaid in a calendar year that do
not exceed $1. The City of Greensburg or the Collector shall determine
eligibility for exemption and provide refunds to exempt persons.
A. Each employer within the political subdivision, as well as those
employers situated outside the political subdivision but who engage in
business within the political subdivision, is hereby charged with the
duty of collecting the tax from each of his employees engaged by him or
performing for him within the political subdivision and making a return
and payment thereof to the Collector. Further, each employer is hereby
authorized to deduct this tax for each employee in his or her employ,
whether said employee is paid by salary, wage or commission and
whether or not all such services are performed within the political
subdivision.
B. A person subject to the tax shall be assessed by the employer a pro rata
share of the tax for each payroll period in which the person is engaging
in an occupation. The pro rata share of the tax assessed on the person
for a payroll period shall be determined by dividing the rate of the tax
levied for the calendar year by the number of payroll periods
established by the employer for the calendar year. For purposes of
determining the pro rata share, an employer shall round down the
amount of the tax collected each payroll period to the nearest 1/100 of a
dollar. Collection of the tax shall be made on a payroll-period basis for
each payroll period in which the person is engaging in an occupation,
except as provided in Subsection D of this section; for purposes of this
subsection, combined rate shall mean the aggregate annual rate of the
tax levied by the school district and the municipality.
C. No person shall be subject to the payment of the local services tax by
more than one political subdivision during each payroll period.

withholding the tax if the employee provides a recent pay statement
from a principal employer that includes the name of the employer, the
length of the payroll period and the amount of the tax withheld and a

215:434
§ 240-15. Returns.
Each employer shall prepare and file a return showing a computation of the
tax on forms to be supplied to the employer by the Collector. If an employer
fails to file the return and pay the tax, whether or not the employer makes
collection thereof from the salary, wages or commissions paid by him or her
to an employee, except as provided hereafter in this article, the employer
shall be responsible for the payment of the tax in full as though the tax had
been originally levied against the employer.
§ 240-16. Dates for determining tax liability and payment.
In each tax year, each employer shall use his or her employment records to
determine the number of employees from whom such tax shall be deducted
and paid over to the Collector on or before the 30th day following the end
of each calendar quarter of each such tax year.
§ 240-17. Self-employed individuals.
Each self-employed individual who performs services of any type or kind
or engages in any occupation or profession within a primary place of
employment within the political subdivision shall be required to comply with

employee's principal employer, and the employee will notify other
employers of a change in principal place of employment within two
weeks of its occurrence. The employee's statement shall be provided on
the form approved by DCED.
E. The tax shall be no more than $52 on each person for each calendar
year, irrespective of the number of political subdivisions within which a
person maybe employed. The political subdivision shall provide a
taxpayer a receipt of payment upon request by the taxpayer.
F. No employer shall be held liable for failure to withhold the tax or for the
payment of the withheld tax money to the political subdivision if the
failure to withhold taxes arises from incorrect information submitted by
the employee as to the employee's place or places of employment, the
employee's principal office or where the employee is principally
employed. Further, an employer shall not be liable for payment of the
local services tax in an amount exceeding the amount withheld by the
employer if the employer complies with the provisions of § 240-13B of
this article and this section and remits the amount so withheld in
accordance with this article.
G. Employers shall be required to remit the local services taxes 30 days
after the end of each quarter of a calendar year.

215:435
§ 240-18. Individuals engaged in more than one occupation or
employed in more than one political subdivision.
§ 240-19. Nonresidents subject to tax.
All employers and self-employed individuals residing or having their places
of business outside of the political subdivision but who perform services
of any type or kind or engage in any occupation or profession within the
political subdivision do, by virtue thereof, agree to be bound by and subject
themselves to the provisions, penalties and regulations promulgated under
this article with the same force and effect as though they were residents of
the political subdivision. Further, any individual engaged in an occupation
within the political subdivision and an employee of a nonresidential
employer may, for the purpose of this article, be considered a self-employed
person, and in the event his or her tax is not paid, the political subdivision
shall have the option of proceeding against either the employer or employee
for the collection of this tax as hereinafter provided.
§ 240-20. Administration of tax.
A. The situs of the tax shall be the place of employment on the first day the
person becomes subject to the tax during each payroll period. In the
event a person is engaged in more than one occupation, that is,
concurrent employment, or an occupation which requires the person
working in more than one political subdivision during a payroll period,
the priority of claim to collect the local services tax shall be in the
following order:
(1) First, the political subdivision in which a person maintains his or
her principal office or is principally employed;
(2) Second, the political subdivision in which the person resides and
works if the tax is levied by that political subdivision;
(3) Third, the political subdivision in which a person is employed and
which imposes the tax nearest in miles to the person's home.
B. In case of dispute, a tax receipt of the taxing authority for that calendar
year declaring that the taxpayer has made prior payment constitutes
prima facie certification of payment to all other political subdivisions.
A. The Collector shall be appointed by resolution of the political
subdivision. It shall be the duty of the Collector to accept and receive
payments of this tax and to keep a record thereof showing the amount
received by him from each employer or self-employed person, together
with the date the tax was received.
B. The Collector is hereby charged with the administration and
enforcement of this article and is hereby charged and empowered,
subject to municipal approval, to proscribe, adopt and promulgate rules
and regulations relating to any matter pertaining to the administration
and enforcement of this article, including provisions for the

refuses to file any return required by this article shall be guilty of a violation
and, upon conviction thereof, shall be sentenced to pay a fine of not more
than $600 and costs of prosecution, and, in default of payment of such
fine and costs, to imprisonment for not more than 30 days. The action to

consistent with the Local Taxpayers Bill of Rights under Act 50 of 1998
(municipalities may detail their appeal processes).
C. The Collector is hereby authorized to examine the books and payroll
records of any employer in order to verify the accuracy of any return
made by an employer or, if no return was made, to ascertain the tax
due. Each employer is hereby directed and required to give the
Collector the means, facilities and opportunity for such examination.
A. In the event that any tax under this article remains due or unpaid 30
days after the due dates above set forth, the Collector may sue for the
recovery of any such tax due or unpaid under this article, together with
interest and penalty.
B. If for any reason the tax is not paid when due, interest at the rate of 6%
on the amount of such tax shall be calculated beginning with the due
date of the tax and a penalty of 5% shall be added to the flat rate of such
tax for nonpayment thereof. Where suit is brought for the recovery of
this tax or other appropriate remedy undertaken, the individual liable
therefor shall, in addition, be responsible and liable for the costs of
collection.
A. Nothing contained in this article shall be construed to empower the
political subdivision to levy and collect the tax hereby imposed on any
occupation not within the taxing power of the political subdivision
under the Constitution of the United States and the laws of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

held by any court of competent jurisdiction to be in violation of the

agencies or political subdivisions shall be exempt from payment or the tax

recording any document or in whose behalf any document is made,
executed, delivered, accepted or presented for recording shall be

transfer, then the tax levied by the City of Greensburg under the
authority of that Act shall during the time such duplication of the tax
exists, except as hereinafter otherwise provided, be one-half (1/2) of the
rate, and such one-half rate shall become effective without any action
on the part of the City of Greensburg; provided, however, that the City
of Greensburg and any other political subdivision which impose such
tax on the same person or transfer may agree that, instead of limiting
their respective rates to one-half (1/2) of the rate herein provided, they
will impose respectively different rates, the total of which shall not
exceed the maximum rate permitted under the Local Tax Enabling Act.
D. If for any reason the tax is not paid when due, interest at the rate in
effect at the time the tax is due shall be added and collected.

confirms a transfer previously recorded, but which does not extend
or limit existing record legal title or interest.
(5) A transfer or division in kind for no or nominal actual consideration
of property passed by testate or intestate succession and held by
covenants; however, if any of the parties take shares greater in

previously husband and wife who have since been divorced,
provided that the property or interest therein subject to such

spouse of a brother or sister and brother or sister or the spouse of a

passing by testate or intestate succession from a personal

granted unless the Recorder of Deeds is presented with a copy of
the trust instrument that clearly identifies the grantor and all
possible beneficiaries.
(9) A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration from a trustee to a
beneficiary of an ordinary trust.

(11) A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration between principal
and agent or straw party, or from or to an agent or straw party

be imposed under this article. When the document by which title is
acquired by a grantee or statement of value fails to set forth that
the property was acquired by the grantee from or for the benefit of
his principal, there is a rebuttable presumption that the property is
the property of the grantee in his individual capacity if the grantee
claims an exemption from taxation under this subsection.
(12) A transfer made pursuant to the statutory merger or consolidation
of a corporation or statutory division of a nonprofit corporation,

grantee shall directly use such real estate for the primary purpose
of manufacturing, fabricating, compounding, processing,
publishing, research and development, transportation, energy
conversion, energy production, pollution control, warehousing or
agriculture and the agency or authority has the full ownership
interest in the real estate transferred.
(16) A transfer by a mortgagor to the holder of a bona fide mortgage in
default in lieu of a foreclosure or a transfer pursuant to a judicial
sale in which the successful bidder is the bona fide holder of a
mortgage, unless the holder assigns the bid to another person.

persons holding title for a religious organization if such real estate
is not being or has not been used by such transferor for commercial
purposes.

pursuant to Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of
1954, [68A Stat. 3, 26 U.S.C. § 501(c)(3)] and which has as its

gas or minerals, the statement of value may be limited to an explanation
of the reason such document is not subject to tax under this article.

ownership interest in the company, however effected, if the change
does not affect the continuity of the company; and of itself or together
with prior changes has the effect of transferring, directly or indirectly,
90% or more of the total ownership interest in the company within a
period of three years.
B. With respect to real estate acquired after February 16, 1986, a family
farm corporation is an acquired company when, because of voluntary or
involuntary dissolution, it ceases to be a family farm corporation or
when, because of issuance or transfer of stock or because of acquisition
or transfer of assets that are devoted to the business of agriculture, it
fails to meet the minimum requirements of a family farm corporation

§ 240-69. Authorized agent.
The City Administrator or the Planning Director is hereby designated as
authorized agent to sign all necessary forms, permits or other written
documents to implement any and all provisions of this article.
§ 240-70. Effective date.
The effective date of this article is August 10, 2015.
§ 240-71. Termination date.
The provisions hereof shall become effective on August 10, 2015, and its
terms shall continue in effect without annual reenactment for a period of 10
years from the effective date and shall apply to any building permitted for
construction or renovation at any time during that ten-year period.
§ 240-71.1. Legislative authority.
This article is enacted pursuant to the Local Economic Revitalization Tax
Assistance Act, 53 P.S. § 4722 et seq., as amended (the "LERTA").
§ 240-71.2. Purpose of article and intent.
assessment eligible for tax exemption in accordance with the limits
established by this article and shall further notify the taxpayer and
the local taxing authorities of the reassessment and amount of the
assessment eligible for exemption. Such notice shall occur within 90
days of completion of the project.
A. City Council has determined that a deteriorated area exists within the
City and pursuant to the LERTA Act is authorized to enact an ordinance
exempting from real property taxation the assessed valuation of
improvements to deteriorated properties and the assessed valuation of
new construction within the designated deteriorated areas.
B. City Council has determined that it is in the best interest of the citizens
of the City to promote economic development through the passage of a
LERTA program for the deteriorated area within the City as set forth
herein. The proposed LERTA program would exempt from City, School
District and County real property taxation on the assessed valuation of
improvements to deteriorated properties and the assessed valuation of
new construction within the designated deteriorated areas. City
Council expects the Greensburg Salem School District and the County
of Westmoreland to enact similar legislation to create the LERTA
program and to seek to cooperate with the City in creation of the
Greensburg Revitalization Fund that will provide funding for projects
within the deteriorated area through creation of the LERTA Program.
C. It is contemplated that property owners within the deteriorated area
who receive these exemptions will make payments into the Greensburg
§ 240-68 RENTAL PROPERTY § 240-71.2
215:465
Revitalization Fund in amounts related to the exempted taxes, and
the amounts deposited in the Greensburg Revitalization Fund will be
applied to pay for costs of priority projects within the deteriorated
area. The Greensburg Community Development Corporation (GCDC)
will partner with the taxing bodies to implement this program and
administration of the fund as follows:
(1) LERTA program participants will make annual payments equal to
an amount representing 65% of the difference between the tax
obligation that would be due to the City of Greensburg, County of
Westmoreland, and Greensburg Salem School District, based on
the increased value of the improvements and the tax obligation that
would be due to the City of Greensburg, County of Westmoreland,
and Greensburg Salem School District, based upon the pre-LERTA
tax obligation payable on the improvements. Property owners will
realize an effective partial exemption of approximately 25% of
taxes resulting from a project over the ten-year life of the program
as incentive to improve deteriorated properties. These payments
will capitalize the proposed Greensburg Revitalization Fund (GFund)
for use in funding priority community and economic
development projects within the City. The G-Fund will seek to
capture value and reinvest as a means to facilitate continued
revitalization. [Amended 11-13-2017 by Ord. No. 2078]
(2) It is Council's intent that G-Fund proceeds will be utilized to assist
revitalization efforts including, but not limited to, acquisition,
rehabilitation, new construction, public infrastructure and
programs related to implementation of the strategy. The G-Fund
will be available to provide financial assistance to eligible property
owners/developers, or for direct use by the GCDC to facilitate
private investment. The investment strategy will be governed by a
committee established by the GCDC in partnership with
representatives from the City, School District and County. Any
returns on investments will be returned directly to the G-Fund so
they can revolve into future projects. Additional private and public
funds will be sought to further capitalize the G-Fund and expand
available resources.
(3) Interested parties seeking financial assistance from the G-Fund will
be required to complete a formal application that provides project
plans, budgetary information (including demonstration of financial
necessity), anticipated benefits and other relevant economic
development impacts including, but not limited to, private
investment leverage, property values increases, tax generation, job
creation/retention, historic preservation, green building and
affordable housing. Projects must be consistent with local City's
Multi-Municipal Plan as amended.
(4) It is contemplated the GCDC will establish a G-Fund Committee in
partnership with the local taxing authorities made up of nine
members. This committee will consist of the City Planning Director,
§ 240-71.2 GREENSBURG CODE § 240-71.2

The provisions of this article are severable and if any of its sections, clauses
or sentences shall be held illegal, invalid or unconstitutional, such
provisions shall not effect or impair any of the remaining sections, clauses
or sentences. All ordinances or resolutions in part or in whole conflicting
with the provisions contained in this article are hereby repealed.
the School District Representative, the County Director of Planning
and Development, the GCDC Executive Director, the GCDC Board

§ 265-3. Community development objectives.
§ 265-4. Interpretation and intent.
A. This chapter is one of the available legal instruments to implement
community development objectives. The Master Plan is hereby
designated as the official statement of the city's intentions regarding
either the preservation or change of land use.
B. The intent of this chapter, as developed and applied at this time and as
may bear relationship to the Master Plan, is:
(1) Zoning districts are intended to give protection to the existing
development of the city until such time as it becomes necessary and
possible to change the form and matter of existing development
and achieve a new development that is attractive, stable and in
accord with sound economic planning principles.
(2) The zoning text contains standards and, as amended in the future,
should contain such additional or revised standards that may, when
appropriate, be applied to areas of prospective change that can
permit and guide that change into desirable and (in some cases)
new patterns of land use relationships.
(3) The Master Plan shall serve as a reference and a guide to the
Planning Commission in its recommendations and to the Council in
its legislative actions amending the Zoning Ordinance as to the
form and direction which these amendments should take to be
consistent with a predeveloped scheme of land use relationships
and to avoid changes that may be considered discriminatory,
arbitrary or capricious.

§ 265-5. Preambles and drawings not part of chapter.
The preambles preceding the initial sections of Articles IV to X, inclusive,
and any illustrative drawings are to be considered explanatory and directive
only, to be used in interpreting the intent of the aforesaid Articles and the
application of the provisions illustrated, but not a part of this chapter, in
establishing applicable regulations or provisions.160
A. In interpreting and applying the provisions of this chapter, they shall be
held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of the health,
safety, morals and general welfare of the City of Greensburg.
B. It is fundamental to the purpose of the chapter to recognize that many
existing lots throughout the city are less adequate than others because
of their location or size or odd shape or difficult topography, or any
combination of these limitations. A claim of hardship under this chapter,
therefore, shall not be allowed on behalf of any lot because the physical
characteristics of the lot prevent it from being built upon exactly as in
another lot abutting or close to it or in the same zoning district. The
regulations herein permit most such lots to be satisfactorily built upon.
There can be some alleviation for other lots through variances (minor
concessions) granted by the Zoning Hearing Board when special
physical conditions make literal enforcement of the regulations either
unsatisfactory in the interest of the people at large or actually
impossible. It is not the ordinance but the physical conditions that
prevent a lot from accommodating a type or area or bulk of structure
unsuited to it. For a typical example, it is not intended that each lot in a
General Residence District automatically become the prospective site
for a multiple-family dwelling and use. If a lot in such a district, after
provision of the yards and other open spaces prescribed for its own and
adjacent property protection, has a buildable area too small in extent or
dimensions for a multiple-family dwelling, then the lot may be used
under its district regulations for another type of dwelling or structure
permitted in that district.
160. Editor's Note: The preambles and drawings are on file and available for inspection in the
city offices.

submitted to it or may act on its own initiative in proposing and
approving a site plan.

endeavor to assure safety and convenience of traffic movement, both
within the site covered and in relation to access streets, and a

the Planning Commission shall review the permit application at its

place within 45 days of the date of the filing of the complete application.
The applicant for the permit shall be advised of the time and place of

therefor. Additional hearings, if necessary, shall be scheduled within 30

approval or denial of the certificate of appropriateness.
(1) In cases where the issuance of a certificate of appropriateness is

written report to the City Council stating the basis upon which such
a recommendation for approval was made. If the Planning
Commission shall fail to transmit such report within 45 days after
the occurrence of the final hearing concerning an application for a
permit, the application shall be forwarded to the Planning
Commission with no recommendation, except where mutual
agreement has been made for an extension of the time limit.
(2) In the case where relatively minor changes in the applicant's plans
and specifications will meet the Planning Commission's conditions
for recommendation for approval, the Planning Commission may
recommend conditional approval for the issuance of a certificate of
appropriateness. A written report to the Planning Commission
(copied to the applicant) shall clearly state these conditions. If the
applicant agrees to the recommended changes, the applicant shall
so notify the Planning Commission, in writing, prior to the next
regularly scheduled meeting of the Planning Commission.

before granting or denying approval, the Planning Commission may call
upon the City's consulting engineer, at the expense of the applicant, to
provide it with a report on the state of repair and stability of the
structure under consideration.

application for a permanent sign has been filed at least seven working
days prior to the regularly scheduled Planning Commission meeting,
the Planning Director shall forward one copy thereof to Planning
Commission. The Planning Commission shall review such permit
application at its next regularly scheduled public meeting or at a

presented to City Council concerning the issuing of a certificate of
appropriateness authorizing a permit for the erection, reconstruction,
alteration, restoration, rehabilitation, demolition or razing of all or a
part of any building within the Downtown District, the Planning
Commission shall consider the following relative to existing buildings:
(1) The significance of the building to the historic and architectural
integrity of the Downtown District.
(2) The development history of the building and its components and
the historic period most represented in its existing condition.
(3) The historic period or periods the applicant proposes to use as the
exterior appearance objective.
(4) The quality of the documentation used by the applicant to
substantiate the proposed exterior appearance objective.
C. The Board shall also consider the degree to which the proposed work
complies with the most-current version of the Standards for
Rehabilitation of the United States Department of the Interior in
making a decision relative to the appropriateness of the proposal
whenever rehabilitation work is proposed. The following standards
shall be used:
(1) Every reasonable effort shall be made to provide a compatible use
for a property which requires minimal alteration of the building,
structure or site and its environment. (The use regulations of the
principal zoning district shall apply.)
(2) The distinguishing original qualities or character of a building,
structure or site and its environment shall not be destroyed. The
removal or alteration of any historic material or distinctive
architectural features should be avoided when possible.
(3) All buildings, structures and sites shall be recognized as products
of their own time. Alterations that have no historical basis and
which seek to create an earlier appearance shall be discouraged.
(4) Changes which may have taken place in the course of time are
evidence of the history and development of a building, structure or
site and its environment. These changes may have acquired
significance in their own right, and this significance shall be
recognized and respected.
(5) Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship
which characterize a building, structure or site shall be treated
with sensitivity.
(6) Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired, rather than
replaced, wherever possible. In the event that replacement is
necessary, the new material should match the material being
§ 265-40.7 WARRANTLESS ARRESTS § 265-40.7
260:623
replaced in composition, design, color, texture and other visual
qualities. Repair or replacement of missing architectural features
should be based on accurate duplications of features, substantiated
by historic, physical or pictorial evidence, rather than on
conjectural designs or the availability of different architectural
elements from other buildings or structures.
(7) The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with the
gentlest means possible. Sandblasting and other cleaning methods
that will damage the historic building materials shall not be
undertaken.
(8) Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing
properties shall not be discouraged when such alterations and
additions do not destroy significant historical, architectural or
cultural material and such design is compatible with the size, scale,
color, material and character of the property, neighborhood or
environment.
(9) Wherever possible, new additions or alterations to structures shall
be done in such a manner that, if such additions or alterations were
to be removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the
structure would be unimpaired.
D. The Planning Commission shall also consider the most current version
of the Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings of the United
States Department of the Interior in making its decision relative to the
appropriateness of the proposal.
E. The design guidelines for construction in the Downtown District which
are published by the Planning Commission to further the description of
exterior architectural design criteria shall be approved by resolution of
City Council.
F. In addition to those criteria above for existing buildings which are
considered applicable by the Planning Commission, the following shall
be evaluated for new construction:
(1) The extent to which the proposed construction conforms to existing
building setbacks and yard widths predominant within the block
where the proposed construction is proposed.
(2) The relationship to buildings in the immediate area with respect to
height, width and materials.
(3) The degree to which the proposed construction respects the
established street/sidewalk level character of the Downtown
District and the immediate area.
(4) The degree to which the proposed building's various floors are
defined with window openings rather than an unbroken opaque
facade.

[Amended 9-14-2009 by Ord. No. 1985; 7-8-2019 by Ord. No. 2094]
G. Relative to demolition, the Planning Commission shall evaluate:
(1) The extent to which the building constitutes an immediate threat to
the public health, safety and welfare.
(2) The significance of the building to the historic and architectural
integrity and the economic vitality of the Downtown District.
(3) The extent to which the applicant demonstrates that the building
has no economic use.
(4) The extent to which the building's deterioration and loss of
economic use has been the result of the applicant's actions.
(5) The efforts made by the applicant to successfully market the
building.
(6) The proposed construction after demolition and its impact on the
integrity of the Downtown District.
A. The Planning Commission, according to the provisions of § 265-40.5,
shall submit to City Council, within 45 days of the final hearing or
before its next regularly scheduled meeting, a report containing its
recommendations regarding the issuance of a certificate of
appropriateness of the proposed construction, alteration or demolition
within the Downtown District.
B. The report shall describe the following and reference any relevant
application materials submitted in accordance with § 265-40.6:
(1) The exact location of the property in question.
(2) A list of adjacent/surrounding structures, stating their general
exterior architectural characteristics.
(3) Proposed landscape work, such as tree removal, additional
plantings, grading and access roads.
(4) Proposed construction, reconstruction, restoration, rehabilitation,
alteration, razing or demolition work.
(5) The finished height and width of any proposed construction or
alterations.
(6) The extent to which the proposed work meets the various
evaluation criteria contained in § 265-40.7.
(7) The opinion of the Planning Commission, including any dissent, as
to the appropriateness of the proposed work and the
recommendation regarding the issuance of a certificate of
appropriateness.

ARTICLE XB
Gateway Overlay District
[Added 1-8-2007 by Ord. No. 1937]
§ 265-40.12. Overview.
Greensburg has been a city of opportunity for over 200 years, providing a
home and a livelihood for generations of residents and entrepreneurs. In
the next century, our prosperity will depend on a sustained commitment
to investments in people and places that create new opportunities for
generations to come. Showcasing Greensburg's unique cultural, artistic
and historic assets within the Greensburg Gateway District can serve as a
source of civic pride and a foundation for citywide economic development.
The first step in changing the image and perception of Greensburg is to
reach out to others in our own community. We must share our dreams
and work together to build a better future. Everyone has a role to play
in improving the public environment, including neighborhood residents,
businesses, civic organizations, and the City. It is especially important to
reach out to young people and engage them in environmental change.
Only by working collaboratively to create a shared sense of pride and
ownership can we truly change the landscape of the City. Greensburg
has an outstanding legacy of historic architecture, engineering and urban
design. Our efforts to improve the public environment should highlight
and celebrate this legacy, restoring Greensburg as one of America's most
beautiful cities.
§ 265-40.13. Purpose. [Amended 9-14-2009 by Ord. No. 1985]
The Gateway Overlay District is hereby established in accordance with
the provisions of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code (MPC),
Act of 1968, P.L. 805, No. 247, as reenacted and amended, to preserve
and/or protect natural and historic resources; to mean to conserve and
safeguard these resources from wasteful or destructive use, but shall not
be interpreted to authorize the unreasonable restriction of forestry, mining
or other lawful uses of natural resources. The Gateway District shall be
considered as an overlay to various districts as shown on the Zoning Map
and will be preserved and protected by the terms of the Municipal Planning
Code (MPC). The Greensburg Gateway Overlay District is designed to
permit economically sustainable development, unlock the potential of
historic land use patterns and buildings, and provide the foundation for
long-term private reinvestment in the Greensburg Gateway District. In
order to market and promote the City of Greensburg and the Greensburg
Gateway District, a two-fold approach is required: first, to increase
awareness of the positive assets we already have; and second, to change
the conditions that have contributed to our negative image. The strength of
the regional economy combined with Greensburg's geographic location and
access to roads, rail, and air travel can be tapped to spark new development
and growth in the City. In addition, our regional proximity to amenities,
such as mountains, parks, historic sites and cultural assets, can make
§ 265-40.12 WARRANTLESS ARRESTS § 265-40.13
260:629
Greensburg a highly attractive location for current and future residents and
businesses.
§ 265-40.14. Composition and public infrastructure.
Improvements to the public environment in the Greensburg Gateway
District include parks and recreational facilities, streets, sidewalks,
lighting, street furnishings, signage, public transportation, and parking.
Investments in the public environment should include streets, sidewalks,
street furniture, lighting, alleys, parks, playgrounds, trails, and public
parking facilities. These elements should be treated as interconnected
elements of a unified system. Improvements to the public environment
should be designed to increase pedestrian and cycle access throughout the
City for all people, including those with disabilities. Public spaces should
be designed to maximize the use and accessibility of public transportation,
with safe, attractive and well-lit waiting areas. Shared parking and
multilevel garages should be encouraged to increase efficiency and
maximize the land area available for other uses. Investments in public
infrastructure should complement and support investments in brick-andmortar
projects. Targeted infrastructure improvements, from street repairs
to better transit service, can play a critical role in protecting and enhancing
the value of private development projects. Within the Greensburg Gateway
District, consistent, high-quality design standards should be used for
streets, sidewalks, parks and public spaces to reinforce the unity and
continuity of the area.
§ 265-40.15. Boundaries.
The boundaries of the Greensburg Gateway Overlay District are the
following streets:
§ 265-40.16. Existing zoning.

shall be required to provide one off-street parking space; rehabilitation
or adaptive reuse projects with three bedrooms shall be required to
provide two off-street parking spaces; and rehabilitation or adaptive
reuse projects with four or more bedrooms shall be required to provide

Greensburg Gateway Overlay District development may be met by the
presentation of a long-term lease of at least 10 years, with the ability to
renew, with a private or public parking facility within 1,000 feet of the
property line of the proposed Greensburg Gateway Overlay District use;
§ 265-40.19 GREENSBURG CODE § 265-40.20
260:634
§ 265-40.21. Site plan review.
All new development occurring as a result of the Greensburg Gateway
Overlay District shall be subject to site plan review under the provisions of
this chapter as applicable.
§ 265-40.22. Design considerations; size, shape and scale.
or by certification from the City of Greensburg Planning and
Development that a public parking facility within 1,000 feet has the
capacity to accommodate the proposed use. For Greensburg Gateway
Overlay District residential uses intending to use public parking supply,
the availability of capacity shall be measured between the weekday
hours of 5:30 p.m. to 7:30 a.m. (the "off" leasing hours). On-street
parking may also be counted, if available, depending on street location
and the neighborhood related to permit parking requirements.
[Amended 9-14-2015 by Ord. No. 2057]
F. Off-street parking shall be primarily located in the rear and side areas
of any new development using Greensburg Gateway Overlay District
regulations.
A. Site Plan: The primary facade of the newly constructed building should
front at least one principal street whenever possible. Additionally, a
drive-through shall not be permitted on main streets, but rather some
place less obtrusive.
B. Lot size: The predominant lot size of surrounding buildings shall be
respected; building anything significantly larger is inappropriate.
C. Setback: The setback of a new building should be consistent with
adjacent buildings. Commercial buildings are traditionally built to the
sidewalk.
D. Height: Height should be similar to that of adjacent buildings. New
construction should respect the floor-to-floor heights of surrounding
buildings as well as the height-to-width ratio seen on the back, thereby
creating a uniform streetscape without gaps or the "lost tooth"
phenomenon.
E. Materials: Materials should be compatible in color and texture to those
used in surrounding area. It is best to use the same materials used on
adjacent buildings whenever possible. Avoid using materials that were
unavailable when surrounding buildings were originally constructed.
§ 265-40.20 WARRANTLESS ARRESTS § 265-40.22
260:635
For example, it is inappropriate to use synthetic stucco when all
surrounding buildings are composed of brick and/or wood.
F. Windows and Doors: New construction on any street in the Gateway
Overlay District should have storefront windows. (Oftentimes major
companies are resistant to windows because they utilize prime display
areas.) At the very least, shadow-box windows should be considered
when a corporate design does not call for actual windows. Windows and
doors should be similar in height, size and orientation to those in
adjacent buildings. Any pattern created by windows and door
placement should be likewise respected.
G. Parking: Locating a sizable parking lot in front of a building is
inappropriate as stated earlier. On-street parking is encouraged when
feasible. Parking lots should be located to the rear or side in a location
that is unobtrusive to the main streetscape.
H. Landscaping: Landscaping can be used to create a buffer between the
parking lot and the new building. Landscaping may also be used to
soften the design of a new building by including benches and fences
built of materials compatible to the building and vegetation.
I. Vehicular curb cuts: limiting the amount of curb cuts and encouraging
the use of shared curb cuts
J. Sidewalks: All sidewalks must be maintained and new developments
must provide sidewalks along any property that fronts a public street.
Sidewalks should also be considered to connect various properties to
each other to create further pedestrian traffic patterns.
K. Streetscape lighting and furniture: the use of pedestrian-scaled lighting
and other streetscape features to visually link these districts to the
downtown and create a more attractive and accessible pedestrian
environment. See Exhibits D-1 (planter), D-2 (bench), D-3 (bulb) and
D-4 (lighting); D-5 (bike rack) attached hereto and made part of this
article.179
L. Signage: Signage should complement the scale, design and materials of
the new building. The City proposes that the sign guidelines be used to
determine the signage for new construction and adaptive reuses of
buildings.
M. Design agreement: It may be necessary for the City to enter into a
design agreement with new construction projects to ensure proper
design principles as presented in the City's Design Guidelines.

It is not the intention of the Gateway Overlay District to override the
proposed Downtown District but to, in fact, complement it. Therefore, if a
property is in the Gateway District, the proposed design and sign guidelines
for the Downtown District will also pertain to the Gateway District. Said
guidelines are to be, as stated, a guide to assist the development of the City.
Furthermore, if a property is in the Downtown District, those regulations
would supersede the Gateway District regulations.

Historic District
[Added 9-14-2009 by Ord. No. 1985]
§ 265-40.26. Composition, purpose and intent.
A. The City of Greensburg's Historic District is created for the following
purposes:
(1) To protect those portions of the City of Greensburg which reflect
the cultural, economic, social, political and architectural history of
the City, state and nation.
(2) To awaken and reinforce an interest in the historic past.
(3) To promote the use and reuse of the Historic District for the
culture, education, pleasure and welfare of the general public.
(4) To advocate an interest in civic beauty through the encouragement
of appropriate settings and continued construction of buildings in
general harmony with respect to style, form, color, proportion,
texture and material between buildings of historic design and those
of more modern design.
(5) To strengthen the economy of the City by stabilizing and improving
property values within the Historic District.
B. The City of Greensburg Historic District, as registered by the National
Park Service in1995 is shown on the City of Greensburg Historic
District Map (Attachment 4:1 of this chapter). The provisions of this
article shall be applied to all land, buildings and structures which are
viewed or may be viewed from a public way within the boundaries of the
City of Greensburg Historic District.
C. The Historic District shall be considered as an overlay to various
districts as shown on the Zoning Map and will be preserved and
protected by the terms of the Municipalities Planning Code (MPC).
D. Interpretation of boundaries.
(1) Boundaries indicated as approximately following the center lines of
streets or alleys shall be construed to follow such center lines.
(2) Boundaries indicated as approximately following lot lines shall be
construed as following such lines.
(3) Boundaries indicated as parallel to or extensions of features
indicated above shall be so construed. Distances not specifically
indicated on the map shall be determined by the scale of the map.
(4) Where topographical or man-made features existing on the ground
are at variance with those shown on the map or in other
§ 265-40.26 WARRANTLESS ARRESTS § 265-40.26
260:639
§ 265-40.27. Applicability.
It is the intent of this article that the requirements contained herein shall
only pertain to construction, reconstruction, restoration, rehabilitation,
alteration, razing or demolition on sites located within the Historic District.
This includes but is not limited to cleaning methods, such as sandblasting
or solvent wash down; the application of nonstructural surface textures or
veneers, such as stucco or siding; replacement of similar types of windows,
doors and other minor building elements; the alteration of decorative
elements, such as cornices or trim; and other work affecting the visual
appearance of a building within the district which can be seen from a public
street or way.
§ 265-40.28. Application; review, approval and compliance
requirements; issuance of permits and/or certificates. [Amended
7-8-2019 by Ord. No. 2094]
circumstances not covered by the above, the City of Greensburg
Zoning Hearing Board shall interpret the boundaries of the district.
A. Projects that the Secretary of the Interior, as administered by the
National Park Service, has approved as certified rehabilitation are
deemed approved and need not be reviewed according to the provisions
of this article, provided that copies (one each) of the Part 1, Evaluation
of Significance, and Part 2, Description of Rehabilitation Work,
applications, along with evidence of their approval from the National
Park Service, are submitted to the Planning Director; and the project is
proposed to be completed as stated in the Part 2 application.
B. No permanent sign or other structure within the Historic District may
be constructed, altered or otherwise changed, in whole or part, nor may
the exterior architectural character of any structure be altered until
after an application for a Uniform Construction Code (UCC) building,
compliance and/or sign permit has been fully reviewed by the Planning
Commission, recommended for a certificate of appropriateness by the
Planning Commission and approved by the Planning Director. In the
case of the Historic District, the City Council will issue the certificate of
appropriateness upon a recommendation of the Planning Commission.
C. If any proposal for construction, alteration or other change in the
Historic District involves subdivision or land development, approval by
the City Council is necessary, all approvals therefore shall be obtained
prior to application for permits and Planning Commission review.
D. No structure within the Historic District may be demolished or
removed, in whole or in part, until after the application for a UCC
building, compliance and/or demolition permit has been reviewed by
the Planning Commission and the Planning Director, unless such
building is deemed blighted as per the City's Redevelopment Plan. For
properties in the Historic District, City Council approval is necessary.
§ 265-40.26 GREENSBURG CODE § 265-40.28
260:640
§ 265-40.29. Preapplication review procedure. [Amended 7-8-2019
by Ord. No. 2094]
E. Uses of properties within the Historic District shall be in accordance
with the zoning district in which the land and/or buildings are situated.
F. Evidence of the required approvals shall be a certificate of
appropriateness issued by the City Council. The certificate shall be a
statement that the application for the proposed work is approved.
G. Any person requesting a permit under this article shall be entitled to a
hearing on such request before the Planning Commission according to
the provisions of § 265-40.5.
H. Nothing in this article shall be construed to prevent the routine
maintenance or repair of any exterior elements of any building or
structure, nor shall anything in this article be construed to prevent the
construction, reconstruction, alteration or demolition of any such
elements which the City Council shall certify as required for public
safety.
I. The Planning Commission may determine that minor changes to
buildings need not undergo the same level of scrutiny as major changes
to buildings. Examples of minor changes might include such items as
repainting, re-pointing of stone and reconstruction of steps or a roof.
A. Prior to the preparation of working drawings and specifications or
calling for proposals or bids from contractors and/or developers,
owners or agents may prepare preliminary scale drawings and outline
specifications, including color samples for outside work, for review and
informal discussion with the Planning Commission. The purpose of this
review shall be to acquaint the developer, owner or agent with
standards of appropriateness of design that are required of their
proposed development.
B. The preapplication review shall not require formal application but does
require notice to be given to the Planning Director and subsequent
notification to the Chairman of the Planning Commission at least seven
working days before the date of the meeting at which the preliminary
drawings are to be discussed. Ten copies of all documents shall be
submitted to the Planning Director, who shall forward one copy each to
the Planning Commission members.
C. In the case of very minor projects involving repairs or alterations to
existing buildings, the Planning Commission, if preliminary drawings
and other data are sufficiently clear and explicit, may recommend to the
Planning Director that a UCC building and/or compliance permit be
issued after approval by a majority of members attending the review
session at which the proposal is presented.

§ 265-40.30. Review by the Planning Commission. [Amended
7-8-2019 by Ord. No. 2094]
A. Upon determination by the Planning Director and the Planning
Commission that a complete application for a UCC building and/or
compliance permit for the erection, reconstruction, alteration,
restoration, rehabilitation, demolition or razing of a building or
buildings or other structures in the Historic District has been filed, the
Planning Commission shall review the permit application at its
regularly scheduled public meeting; or at a special hearing, to take
place within 45 days of the date of the filing of the complete application.
The applicant for the permit shall be advised of the time and place of
said hearing and shall be invited to appear to explain his/her reasons
therefor. Additional hearings, if necessary, shall be scheduled within 30
days of each other, unless mutually agreed to otherwise by the Planning
Commission and the applicant.
B. Within 45 days of the occurrence of the final hearing upon an
application for a permit for the erection, reconstruction, alteration,
restoration, rehabilitation, demolition or razing of a building or
buildings or other structures in the Historic District, the Planning
Commission shall make recommendation to City Council regarding the
approval or denial of the certificate of appropriateness.
(1) In cases where the issuance of a certificate of appropriateness is
recommended in the Historic District with a land development
activity those recommendations will be passed along to the City
Council. The Planning Commission shall forthwith transmit a
written report to the Planning Director stating the basis upon
which such a recommendation for approval was made. If the
Planning Commission shall fail to transmit such report within 45
days after the occurrence of the final hearing concerning an
application for a permit, the application shall be forwarded to the
City Council with no recommendation, except where mutual
agreement has been made for an extension of the time limit.
(2) In the case where relatively minor changes in the applicant's plans
and specifications will meet the Planning Commission's conditions
for recommendation for approval, the Planning Commission may
recommend conditional approval for the issuance of a certificate of
appropriateness. A written report to the City Council (copied to the
applicant) shall clearly state these conditions. If the applicant
agrees to the recommended changes, the applicant shall so notify
the Planning Commission, in writing, prior to the next regularly
scheduled meeting of the Planning Commission.
(3) In the case when the Planning Commission makes a
recommendation to deny the issuance of a certificate of
appropriateness, the Planning Commission shall transmit a written
report to City Council within 45 days after the occurrence of the
final hearing, stating its reasons. The report shall state the reasons
§ 265-40.30 GREENSBURG CODE § 265-40.30
260:642
§ 265-40.31. Application for permits.
for a recommendation for disapproval and the changes necessary
for the applicant to obtain approval. The applicant shall be
informed, in writing by the Planning Commission, of the decision
and the reasons for the recommendation for disapproval.
C. In any case involving the demolition or partial demolition of a structure,
before granting or denying approval, the Planning Commission may call
upon the City's Consulting Engineer, at the expense of the applicant, to
provide it with a report on the state of repair and stability of the
structure under consideration.
D. If the applicant intends to refile revised plans to remedy the defects
which led to the recommendation for disapproval, the same review
period and procedure set forth above shall apply.
E. Upon determination by the Planning Director that a complete
application for a permanent sign has been filed at least seven working
days prior to the regularly scheduled Planning Commission meeting,
the Planning Director shall forward one copy thereof to the Planning
Commission. The Planning Commission shall review such permit
application at its next regularly scheduled public meeting or at a
hearing specially convened, which meeting or hearing, in any event,
shall occur within 40 days of the date of the filing of the complete
application. The applicant for the permit shall be advised of the time
and place of the meeting or hearing and shall be invited to explain the
reasons for the application. The Planning Commission shall, as soon as
reasonably practicable following the conclusion of the meeting or
hearing, issue a written recommendation, which shall state, at a
minimum, "recommended for the issuance of a certificate of
appropriateness", "not recommended for the issuance of a certificate of
appropriateness" or "recommended for a certificate of appropriateness
with modifications as set forth". The written report shall be forwarded
to the applicant and the Planning Director. In the event that the
Planning Commission fails to meet to consider the application within 40
days of the completed application, or following the conclusion of a
timely scheduled meeting or hearing, the Planning Commission fails to
forward its written report to the Planning Director, the application shall
be deemed approved and a permit shall be issued to the applicant.
A. Ten copies of all drawings and plans for the proposed major alterations,
additions or changes and for new construction of buildings or property
use shall be submitted. The drawings and plans shall be prepared by a
registered architect or engineer and shall include, but are not limited,
to the following:
(1) Plans and exterior elevations, drawn to scale, with sufficient detail
to show, as it relates to exterior appearances, the architectural
design of the buildings, including proposed materials, textures and
colors and dimensions.
§ 265-40.30 WARRANTLESS ARRESTS § 265-40.31
260:643
§ 265-40.32. Evaluation criteria. [Amended 7-8-2019 by Ord. No.
2094]
(2) Plot or site plans, drawn to scale not smaller than one inch equals
50 feet, showing adjoining property lines and adjacent streets from
which the proposed activity may be viewed and all improvements
affecting appearances, such as walls, walks, terraces, landscaping,
accessory buildings, parking, signs, lights and other elements.
(3) A location map, drawn at a scale not smaller than one inch equals
20 feet, indicating the general location of the site in relation to
nearby roads and properties.
B. Photographs are required with an application for the demolition of an
existing structure. Every application for a permit to demolish an
existing structure shall be accompanied by Baseline Documentation
(see policy requirements) and a set of legible black-and-white or color
photographs showing all sides of the building under consideration and
any interiors which relate its state of disrepair or substantiate the need
for demolition and photographs showing the contiguous properties and
the relationship of the building to them.
C. Photographs required with an application for repair, alterations, and/or
additions to existing structures. Every application for repair, alterations
and/or additions to existing structures shall be accompanied by a set of
legible black-and-white or color photographs showing all sides of the
structure and photographs showing the adjacent properties and the
relationship of the building to them.
D. Photographs are required with an application for new construction.
Every application for new construction shall be accompanied by a set of
legible black-and-white or color photographs showing the construction
site and its relationship to the properties contiguous to it. The direction
of the photograph shall be noted for each view and shall be keyed into
the plot plan or site plan.
E. All of the materials included in this section shall be filed at least 10
working days prior to the regularly scheduled Planning Commission
meeting with the Planning Director, who shall forward them to the
Chairman of the Planning Commission. The Chairman of the Planning
Commission shall determine if the application is complete and shall
notify the applicant of the date of the Planning Commission review
meeting or hearing. [Amended 7-8-2019 by Ord. No. 2094]
A. The Planning Commission may recommend against the issuance of a
certificate of appropriateness for the erection, reconstruction,
alteration, rehabilitation, demolition, partial demolition or removal of
any structure within the Historic District which, in the Planning
Commission's opinion, would be detrimental to the district and against
the public interests of the City.
§ 265-40.31 GREENSBURG CODE § 265-40.32
260:644
B. In determining the recommendation by the Planning Commission to be
presented to the City Council concerning the issuing of a certificate of
appropriateness authorizing a permit for the erection, reconstruction,
alteration, restoration, rehabilitation, demolition or razing of all or a
part of any building within the Historic District, the Planning
Commission shall consider the following relative to existing buildings:
(1) The significance of the building to the historic and architectural
integrity of the Historic District.
(2) The development history of the building and its components and
the historic period most represented in its existing condition.
(3) The historic period or periods the applicant proposes to use as the
exterior appearance objective.
(4) The quality of the documentation used by the applicant to
substantiate the proposed exterior appearance objective.
C. The Board shall also consider the degree to which the proposed work
complies with the most-current version of the Standards for
Rehabilitation of the United States Department of the Interior in
making a decision relative to the appropriateness of the proposal
whenever rehabilitation work is proposed. The following standards
shall be used:
(1) Every reasonable effort shall be made to provide a compatible use
for a property which requires minimal alteration of the building,
structure or site and its environment. (The use regulations of the
principal zoning district shall apply.)
(2) The distinguishing original qualities or character of a building,
structure or site and its environment shall not be destroyed. The
removal or alteration of any historic material or distinctive
architectural features should be avoided when possible.
(3) All buildings, structures and sites shall be recognized as products
of their own time. Alterations that have no historical basis and
which seek to create an earlier appearance shall be discouraged.
(4) Changes which may have taken place in the course of time are
evidence of the history and development of a building, structure or
site and its environment. These changes may have acquired
significance in their own right, and this significance shall be
recognized and respected.
(5) Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship
which characterize a building, structure or site shall be treated
with sensitivity.
(6) Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired, rather than
replaced, wherever possible. In the event that replacement is
necessary, the new material should match the material being
§ 265-40.32 WARRANTLESS ARRESTS § 265-40.32
260:645
replaced in composition, design, color, texture and other visual
qualities. Repair or replacement of missing architectural features
should be based on accurate duplications of features, substantiated
by historic, physical or pictorial evidence, rather than on
conjectural designs or the availability of different architectural
elements from other buildings or structures.
(7) The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with the
gentlest means possible. Sandblasting and other cleaning methods
that will damage the historic building materials shall not be
undertaken.
(8) Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing
properties shall not be discouraged when such alterations and
additions do not destroy significant historical, architectural or
cultural material and such design is compatible with the size, scale,
color, material and character of the property, neighborhood or
environment.
(9) Wherever possible, new additions or alterations to structures shall
be done in such a manner that, if such additions or alterations were
to be removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the
structure would be unimpaired.
D. The Planning Commission shall also consider the most current version
of the Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings of the United
States Department of the Interior in making its decision relative to the
appropriateness of the proposal.
E. The design guidelines for construction in the Historic District which are
published by the Planning Commission to further the description of
exterior architectural design criteria shall be approved by resolution of
City Council.
F. In addition to those criteria above for existing buildings which are
considered applicable by the Planning Commission, the following shall
be evaluated for new construction:
(1) The extent to which the proposed construction conforms to existing
building setbacks and yard widths predominant within the block
where the proposed construction is proposed.
(2) The relationship to buildings in the immediate area with respect to
height, width and materials.
(3) The degree to which the proposed construction respects the
established street/sidewalk level character of the Historic District
and the immediate area.
(4) The degree to which the proposed building's various floors are
defined with window openings rather than an unbroken opaque
facade.

[Amended 7-8-2019 by Ord. No. 2094]
G. Relative to demolition, the Planning Commission shall evaluate:
(1) The extent to which the building constitutes an immediate threat to
the public health, safety and welfare.
(2) The significance of the building to the historic and architectural
integrity and the economic vitality of the Historic District.
(3) The extent to which the applicant demonstrates that the building
has no economic use.
(4) The extent to which the building's deterioration and loss of
economic use has been the result of the applicant's actions.
(5) The efforts made by the applicant to successfully market the
building.
(6) The proposed construction after demolition and its impact on the
integrity of the Historic District.
A. The Planning Commission, according to the provisions of § 265-40.5,
shall submit to the Planning Director within 45 days of the final hearing
or before its next regularly scheduled meeting, a report containing its
recommendations regarding the issuance of a certificate of
appropriateness of the proposed construction, alteration or demolition
within the Historic District.
B. The report shall describe the following and reference any relevant
application materials submitted in accordance with § 265-40.6:
(1) The exact location of the property in question.
(2) A list of adjacent/surrounding structures, stating their general
exterior architectural characteristics.
(3) Proposed landscape work, such as tree removal, additional
plantings, grading and access roads.
(4) Proposed construction, reconstruction, restoration, rehabilitation,
alteration, razing or demolition work.
(5) The finished height and width of any proposed construction or
alterations.
(6) The extent to which the proposed work meets the various
evaluation criteria contained in § 265-40.7.
(7) The opinion of the Planning Commission, including any dissent, as
to the appropriateness of the proposed work and the
recommendation regarding the issuance of a certificate of
appropriateness.

necessary to meet the Planning Commission approval.
E. In either case, City Council shall notify the applicant within 10 days of
its meeting at which the application was considered, unless mutually
agreed otherwise.
F. When a certificate of appropriateness has been issued, the Planning
Director shall, from time to time, inspect the work approved by such
certificate. All work not in accordance with such certificate shall
constitute a basis for the issuance of a cease-and-desist order.
Applicants issued a certificate of appropriateness may immediately
apply for a UCC building and/or compliance permit.
G. Violators of this portion of the City Code shall be subject to civil
judgments as prescribed in §§ 265-150 and 265-151 of this chapter.

Health Care District
[Added 4-13-2015 by Ord. No. 2048]
§ 265-40.37. Composition, purpose and intent.
The City of Greensburg Health Care District includes the area that includes
three arterial streets that take traffic from the Route 30 beltway into
the downtown. An x-ray in time would reveal that the east/west arterials,
principally Pittsburgh and Otterman Streets, were designed to carry Route
30 through-traffic before the beltway was constructed. These major streets
are connected by a series of north/south local streets. Although the building
patterns show a highly developed area, large gaps in building fabric are
evident in the center of the area indicating an area of opportunity. The
area is largely devoid of internal open spaces. It is, however, adjacent
to two major open spaces: Seton Hill University (SHU) and Mount Odin
Park Municipal Golf Course. These are largely inaccessible from the district
because of intervening barriers. Topographic maps indicate a district
dominated by dramatic elevation changes. The center of the district is a
hilltop and the location of Excela Westmoreland Hospital, a facility highly
visible from many locations around the City. The topography creates
accessibility challenges. This district is being put forth to secure some
public goals for future development:
A. Provide optimal vehicular access to medical, retail and office uses.
B. Provide visitor-friendly access to the hospital and other use.
C. Control congestion.
D. Control illegal turning movements.
E. Reduce pedestrian and vehicular conflicts.
F. Improve pedestrian crossing safety.
G. Minimize truck traffic in residential neighborhoods.
H. Provide dedicated bicycle routes.
I. Provide options for separating hospital traffic from downtown traffic.
J. Optimize parking access points to function well.
K. Provide complete streets where possible (bikes, pedestrians, vehicles,

§ 265-40.38. Overview.
The City of Greensburg designated portions of the 5th and 6th Wards
situated west of the downtown for more detailed planning to guide future
public and private investment. This area of the city, designated the Health
Care District because of its location around Excela Westmoreland Hospital,
is situated at the western gateway to the downtown and includes several
residential neighborhoods. Much of the district is highly visible to those
approaching the downtown on Pittsburgh Street from Route 30. First
impressions of Greensburg are of a city that has suffered disinvestment with
vacant buildings, parking lots, and rundown properties. At the same time,
with the revitalization of the downtown, the strength of the hospital, SHU
and the historic residential areas, this area is receiving increasing interest
from investors and private developers.
§ 265-40.39. Purpose.
The Health Care District is designed to permit economically sustainable
development in the area, unlock the potential of historic land use patterns
and buildings, and provide the foundation for long-term private
reinvestment in the District. In order to market and promote the City of
Greensburg and the Health Care District, a two-fold approach is required:
first, to increase awareness of the positive assets we already have; and
second, to change the conditions that have contributed to its negative
image. The strength of the regional economy combined with Greensburg's
geographic location and access to roads, rail, and air travel can be tapped
to spark new development and growth in the City. In addition, our regional
proximity to amenities such as, mountains, parks, higher education
facilities, the hospital, historic sites and cultural assets; can make
Greensburg a highly attractive location for current and future residents and
businesses.
§ 265-40.40. Composition and public infrastructure.
Improvements to the public environment in the Health Care District include
parks and recreational facilities, pedestrian and bike safe passage, streets,
sidewalks, lighting, street furnishings, signage, public transportation, and
parking. Investments in the public environment should include streets,
sidewalks, street furniture, lighting, alleys, parks, playgrounds, trails, and
public parking facilities. These elements should be treated as
interconnected elements of a unified system. Improvements to the public
environment should be designed to increase pedestrian and cycle access
throughout the City for all people, including those with disabilities. Public
spaces should be designed to maximize the use and accessibility of public
transportation, with safe, attractive and well-lit waiting areas. Shared
parking and multi-level garages should be encouraged to increase efficiency
and maximize the land area available for other uses. Investments in public
infrastructure should complement and support investments in bricks and
mortar projects. Targeted infrastructure improvements, from street repairs
to better transit service, can play a critical role in protecting and enhancing
§ 265-40.38 GREENSBURG CODE § 265-40.40
260:652
the value of private development projects. Within the Health Care District,
consistent, high-quality design standards should be used for streets,
sidewalks, parks and public spaces to reinforce the unity and continuity of
the area.
§ 265-40.41. Boundaries.
The boundaries of the Health Care District are as depicted on the attached
map.181 Exhibit E.
§ 265-40.42. Existing zoning.
The Health Care District shall be overlaid over the R-1 Single-Family
Residence, R-2 General Residence, C-1 Neighborhood Shopping, C-2
Business, S Special Institutional and M Industrial Districts; within the
boundaries shown on the Greensburg Zoning Map. The owners of property
shall maintain all zoning rights consistent with said districts. However, if an
owner elects to develop consistent with the Health Care District, the rules
and regulations of the Health Care District shall apply. Where the Health
Care District provisions are silent on a zoning regulation the requirements
of the C-2 Business District shall apply. Please note that all three of the
neighborhood areas, Greenview, Ludwick and 5th Ward, shall be preserved
as residential neighborhoods; therefore, the review of these particular areas
as depicted on the map shall be viewed from a residential perspective in
order to keep the urban landscape of the neighborhoods.
§ 265-40.43. Permitted uses: links to individual underlying zoning
districts.
A. In the R-1 Single-Family and R-2 General Residence Zoning Districts
the uses listed in §§ 265-12, 265-15, 265-17 shall apply as indicated
except that the following uses shall be permitted as of right:
(1) Rehabilitation of existing multifamily structures, with an increased
view of parking issues as they relate to the neighborhood.
(2) New development of multifamily residential, with the required offstreet
parking.
(3) New mixed-use development, including residential townhouses.
(4) Commercial development (special consideration must be in place
for the preservation areas because the goal is to preserve the
neighborhood), such as professional medical offices, law offices,
and the like, retail operations, personal services such as beauty
shops, small inns, or bed-and-breakfast facilities, eating and
drinking establishments, and other uses related to the area.
(5) Live/work units: this type of use may be considered for the
preservation neighborhoods but only with careful consideration to

the existing parking situation and the existing dynamics of the
street. It will never be the intent to create a commercial area in the
heart of these neighborhoods. The Depot District, Arts District, the
Point District and the Health Care District as shown on the map are
the defined areas for mixed use and commercial areas, but a live/
work unit could be considered for a permitted home occupation.
B. In the C-1 Neighborhood Shopping and C-2 Business Districts the uses
listed in §§ 265-21 and 265-25 shall apply as indicated except that the
following uses shall be permitted as of right:
(1) Rehabilitation of multifamily structures.
(2) Rehabilitation of commercial uses and mixed use development.
(3) Mixed-use development including residential uses.
(4) Commercial development.
(5) Restaurants.
(6) Bar and cafe.
(7) Rehabilitation of commercial uses and mixed use development.
(8) Live/work units.
A. For the R-1 and R-2 Zoning Districts, the dimensional regulations listed
in § 265-47, Schedule of area requirements, shall not apply; rather, the
following shall apply:
(1) Minimum lot area; 5,000 square feet for single-family, less for
townhomes.
(2) Minimum lot frontage; 50 feet for single-family, less for townhomes.
(3) Minimum lot area per dwelling unit: 2,500 square feet.
(4) Yards, minimum in feet:
(a) Front: at the property line, or in alignment with existing
property buildings, to be determined by the Planning
Commission. [Amended 7-8-2019 by Ord. No. 2094]
(b) Side: five feet or less depending on existing conditions and
depending on type of development; e.g., townhomes and patio
homes could have a zero lot line and a five-foot lot line for
exterior property lines.
(c) Rear: 15 feet or more, depending on parking development.
§ 265-40.43 GREENSBURG CODE § 265-40.44
260:654
(d) Lot coverage (maximum in percent): dwelling 40%; accessory
structures 10%; maximum impervious surface 75%.
(e) Height of structures (maximum in feet): must be compatible
with existing structures in the area.
B. For the C-1, C-2, M and S Zoning Districts, the dimensional regulations
listed in § 265-47, Schedule of area requirements, for C-2 shall apply to
all Health Care District related development where the underlying
Zoning District is C-1, C-2, M and S.
C. Townhouses as permitted in the Health Care District.
(1) Townhouses that abut more than one public right-of-way shall be
set back 12 feet from each public right-of-way.
(2) All facades of a townhouse that abut a public right-of-way shall be
designed with windows and other architectural openings.
D. Mixed-use development in the Health Care District.
(1) Mixed-use development shall be residential use with retail, offices,
and similar uses.
(2) Mixed-use development in the Health Care District shall require
residential uses to occur on floors above the ground floor, except
for live/work units which shall be permitted on any floor. All
development, except for live/work units, shall provide for a distinct
and separate entrance on the ground floor to the upper floors.
Further, except for live/work units, commercial use of the ground
floor shall not exceed 90% of the floor area of the ground floor.
(3) There shall be no required minimum or maximum percentage of
residential or retail, offices, and similar uses in any type of mixeduse
development.
E. Restaurants and outdoor cafes in the Health Care District where the
underlying Zoning District is C-1, C-2, S or M District:
(1) Restaurants shall be allowed by right if they are located in whole or
in part in an existing building and seat at least 50 persons. In the
instance where a restaurant includes a bar or a lounge said facility
shall also be permitted as of right if it is designed to seat at least 20
people in addition to the minimum 50 restaurant seats.
(2) Drive-through food service facilities, and stand-alone fast food
restaurants of any kind shall not be permitted as of right.
(3) Outdoor cafes shall also be permitted as of right if they are a
subsidiary portion of a restaurant, or as a separate operation if they
seat at least 15 people.
F. Live/work units in the Health Care District. The configuration of live/
work units can be as separate living and workspace in the same

§ 265-40.45. Baseline documentation policy.
building but on separate floors; or a building where each individual
living space can be used for the creation of art or arts and craft
products. In either configuration, showrooms and other areas for public
display and sale shall also be permitted.
G. Issues to consider regarding new development:
(1) New developments and additions to existing buildings must be
compatible with the architectural style that is characteristic of the
neighborhood;
(2) Proposed development will strengthen the identity of the areas and
provide needed auxiliary retail uses. In the Neighborhood
Preservation areas, the development must adhere to the existing
urban style;
(3) New development will create new opportunities for public open
spaces and gathering spaces in the Health Care District;
(4) New developments within the Health Care District must be
pedestrian and bike-friendly and provide places for civic activities;
and
(5) New developments will improve the visual appearance, increase
property values, and reduce vacancy rates within the City of
Greensburg.
A. The establishment of baseline documentation of the physical conditions
and historic character on all properties being considered for a reuse
(razing and new construction) in the Health Care District is required as
per the baseline documentation policy administered by the Planning
Department. Baseline documentation may include but is not limited to
the following:
(1) Location, address and boundaries of the property (legal
description).
(2) Brief statement of significance of the property.
(3) Description of physical evolution of property, noting major
additions, alterations.
(4) Assessment of condition of property from a visual inspection.
(5) Site plan or survey.
(6) Sketch of floor plans.
(7) Photographic record.
B. Any costs associated in the creation of the baseline documentation will
be the responsibility of the property owner/developer.

260:656
§ 265-40.46. Parking regulations.
Parking regulations in the Health Care District for all underlying districts
shall be consistent with the City of Greensburg Zoning Ordinance as
indicated in § 265-65, Number of off-street parking spaces required, and the
other applicable subsections except for the following:
§ 265-40.47. Site plan review.
All new development occurring as a result of the Health Care District
shall be subject to site plan review under the provisions of this chapter as
applicable.
A. Townhouses with two or fewer bedrooms shall be required to provide
one off-street parking space; townhouses with three bedrooms shall be
required to provide two off-street parking spaces; and townhouses with
four or more bedrooms shall be required to provide one parking space
per bedroom.
B. Rehabilitation or adaptive reuse projects with two or fewer bedrooms
shall be required to provide one off-street parking space; rehabilitation
or adaptive reuse projects with three bedrooms shall be required to
provide two off-street parking spaces; and rehabilitation or adaptive
reuse projects with four or more bedrooms shall be required to provide
one parking space per bedroom.
C. New residential development with two or fewer bedrooms shall be
required to provide one off-street parking space; new residential
development with three bedrooms shall be required to provide two offstreet
parking spaces; and new residential development with four or
more bedrooms shall be required to provide one parking space per
bedroom.
D. Live/work units shall require one space per live/work unit and no
parking requirement for any common gallery or showroom space.
E. All or a portion of the off-street parking requirement for any type of
Health Care District development may be met by the presentation of a
long-term lease of at least 10 years with the ability to renew, with a
private or public parking facility within 1,000 feet of the property line of
the proposed Health Care District use; or by certification from the City
of Greensburg Planning Department that a public parking facility
within 1,000 feet has the capacity to accommodate the proposed use.
For Health Care District residential uses intending to use public
parking supply, the availability of capacity shall be measured between
the weekday hours of 5:30 p.m. to 7:30 a.m. (the "off" leasing hours).
On-street parking may also be counted, if available, depending on street
location and the neighborhood related to permit parking requirements.
F. Off-street parking shall be primarily located in the rear and side areas
of any new development using Health Care District regulations.
§ 265-40.46 WARRANTLESS ARRESTS § 265-40.48
260:657
§ 265-40.48. Design considerations; size, shape and scale.
A. Site plan: The primary facade of the newly constructed building should
front at least one principal street whenever possible. Additionally, a
drive-thru shall not be permitted on main streets, but rather someplace
less obtrusive.
B. Lot size: The predominant lot size of surrounding buildings shall be
respected; building anything significantly larger is inappropriate.
C. Setback: The setback of a new building should be consistent with
adjacent buildings. Commercial buildings are traditionally built to the
sidewalk with some green area in the frontage.
D. Height: Height should be similar to that of adjacent buildings. New
construction should respect the floor-to-floor heights of surrounding
buildings as well as the height-to-width ration seen on the back; thereby
creating a uniform streetscape without gaps or the "lost tooth"
phenomenon.
E. Materials: Materials should be compatible in color and texture to those
used in surrounding area. It is best to use the same materials used on
adjacent buildings whenever possible. Avoid using materials that were
unavailable when surrounding buildings were originally constructed.
For example, it is inappropriate to use synthetic stucco when all
surrounding buildings are composed of brick and/or wood.
F. Windows and doors: New construction on any street in the Health Care
District should have storefront windows. (Often times major companies
are resistant to windows because they utilize prime display areas.) At
the very least, shadow-box windows should be considered when a
corporate design does not call for actual windows. Windows and doors
should be similar in height, size and orientation to those in adjacent
buildings. Any pattern created by windows and door placement should
be likewise respected.
G. Parking: Locating a sizable parking lot in front of a building is
inappropriate as stated earlier. On-street parking is encouraged when
feasible. Parking lots should be located to the rear or side in a location
that is unobtrusive to the main streetscape.
H. Landscaping: Landscaping can be used to create a buffer between the
parking lot and the new building. Landscaping may also be used to
soften the design of a new building by including benches, and fences,
built of materials compatible to the building and vegetation.

260:658
§ 265-40.49. Zoning Map amendment.
The creation of this Health Care District hereby amends the City's Zoning
Map in order to delineate the boundary of the Health Care District.
§ 265-40.50. Health Care District vs. Gateway Overlay District.
It is not the intention of the Health Care District to override the Gateway
Overlay but, in fact, to compliment it. Properties in both districts will adhere
to the design and sign guidelines. Said guidelines are to be as stated, a
guide to assist the development of the City.
§ 265-40.51. Procedures for Health Care District review. [Amended
7-8-2019 by Ord. No. 2094]
I. Vehicular curb cuts: limiting the amount of curb cuts and encouraging
the use of shared curb cuts.
J. Sidewalks: all sidewalks must be maintained and new developments
must provide sidewalks along any property that fronts a public street.
Sidewalks should also be considered to connect various properties to
each other to create further pedestrian and bike traffic patterns and
connectivity to the Five Star Trail when possible.
K. Streetscape lighting and furniture: the use of pedestrian-scaled lighting
and other streetscape features to visually link this district to the
downtown and create a more attractive and accessible pedestrian and
bike environment. See Exhibits F-1 (planter), D-2 (bench), D-3 (bulb)
and D-4 (lighting); D-5 (bike rack) attached hereto and made part of this
article.182
L. Signage: Signage should compliment the scale, design and materials of
the new building. The City proposes that the sign guidelines be used to
determine the signage for new construction and adaptive reuses of
buildings.
M. Design agreement: It may be necessary for the City to enter into a
design agreement with new construction projects to ensure proper
design principles as presented the City's Design Guidelines.
A. New development: Planning Director review, Planning Commission
review, and City Council for final approval.
B. Existing building/adaptive reuse: UCC building and/or compliance
permit application process, Planning Commission review and
recommendations to the Planning Director and City Council.
C. It is not the intent of this article to require the owner-occupied
residential properties adhere to the design guidelines, but it is indeed
welcomed. In fact, owner-occupied property owners should feel very

welcome to attend Planning Commission meetings for any of their home
projects, but they are not required to do so.
D. Appeals from any Planning Commission review would go to the City
Council.

established by the following schedule. Heights for R3 Districts shall be as
prescribed in Article XXIII, pertaining to planned residential development.
§ 265-42. General height restrictions.
For purposes of height measurement, on through lots, where a structure
extends beyond 1/2 of the depth of the lot, such lot shall be considered as if
it were two separate lots divided by a line equidistant from each street, and
the basic grades shall be established accordingly.

clearly evident that the original construction plans anticipated such
additional height.
C. In the C2 District, the height of a main building may be increased four
feet for each one foot that the building or increased height portion
thereof is set back from the permitted building lines; however, the
cubical contents of such building shall not exceed the cubical contents
of a prism having a base equal to the buildable area of the lot and a

Area Requirements and Exceptions
§ 265-45. Compliance required.
Except as hereinafter provided in § 265-48, Area exceptions, and Article
XVI, Nonconformance and Noncompliance, after the effective date of this
chapter, no structure shall be erected, reconstructed, enlarged, used or
moved to another location, unless such structure or enlarged portion
conforms to the area regulations established by the following schedule.
Area conformance for R3 Districts shall be as prescribed in the ordinance
pertaining to planned residential development.
§ 265-46. General area requirements.
A. Any portion of a lot once used as a yard or as lot area in compliance with
the area requirements of the district regulations of this chapter shall
not be counted again as required yard or lot area for another structure.
B. No yards or other open spaces shall be diminished below what is
prescribed by this chapter.
C. For yards abutting streets, the required side yard width and rear yard
depth shall be the same as the required front yard depth.
D. Public service lines for the transportation and distribution and control
of water, electricity, gas, oil, steam, telegraph and telephone
communications or railroad trackage and supporting members other

zoning lot nor be held to reduce the required yard dimensions for other
structures on a zoning lot.
E. In a C or M District, when a side or rear yard abuts property in an R
District:
(1) It shall be screened from such R District by a masonry wall or solid
fence six and one-half (6 1/2) feet high, extending along the
property line adjoining the abutting R District, but not closer to a
street than the buildable area of the lot; or
(2) Said abutting side or rear yard shall be planted and maintained
with shrubbery so as to provide a visual screen approximately six
and one-half (6 1/2) feet high between the concerned C or M
District and the abutting property.
F. Vision clearance on a corner lot. On a corner lot, no fence, building
wall, shrubbery or other vision obstruction (including automobile
parking) shall be placed or maintained, and no structure other than a
necessary retaining wall shall be constructed after the effective date of

ARTICLE XIV
Automotive Regulations; Parking and Loading
[Amended 10-14-1991 by Ord. No. 1495]
§ 265-56. Purpose and intent.
The purpose of these regulations is to ensure the appropriate provision
of off-street parking and loading areas. It is further the intent of these
regulations to avoid undue congestion on public streets, to protect the level
of service and capacity of existing streets, to avoid unnecessary conflicts
between pedestrians and vehicles and to provide the general health, safety
and public welfare.
§ 265-57. Applicability.
These off-street parking and loading regulations shall apply to all parking
and loading areas, including driveways for single-family and two-family
dwellings, established within the City of Greensburg following the effective
date of this chapter.
§ 265-58. Procedures; development plan or subdivision
requirement. [Amended 9-14-2015 by Ord. No. 2057]
An application for development plan or subdivision plot approval, as
appropriate, shall be required prior to the construction of any new or
expanded off-street parking and loading facilities for all uses other than
single-family detached and two-family dwellings, pursuant to site plan
review by the City Planning Commission. Any plans for restriping or
modifying the number of parking or loading spaces shall be approved by the
Planning Director or their designee upon the submission of a parking lot
plan which complies with all applicable ordinance requirements.
§ 265-59. Permanence of requirements.
No owner or operator of any structure or use shall discontinue, dispense
with or cause a reduction in the number of required off-street parking
or load spaces without establishing alternative vehicular parking and/or
loading facilities which meet the requirements of this article. Any structure
or use which is altered or expanded in a manner which would warrant the
provision of additional off-street parking or loading facilities shall provide
such facilities in compliance with this article prior to occupancy of the
altered or expanded portion of the use. If, as a result of amendments to this
chapter regarding the number and/or lot size of parking or loading spaces,
an existing use is determined to have an excess number of spaces, such
space may be removed upon approval of a revised development plan.

[Added 5-9-1977 by Ord. No. 1025]
In all zoning areas, the automobile parking space requirements for
structures designed for and maintained as housing for the elderly persons
shall be reduced to 30% of the requirement which would otherwise be in

§ 265-61. All forms of on-street automotive repairs prohibited.
[Added 5-12-1986 by Ord. No. 1288]
§ 265-62. General parking and loading review standards. [Amended
10-14-1991 by Ord. No. 1495]
All proposed off-street parking and loading facilities shall comply with the
following requirements:
A. Outdoor parking or storage of automotive vehicles of any kind or type
without current license plates and valid state inspection stickers on any
residentially zoned property is specifically prohibited.
B. All forms of vehicle repairs within public rights-of-way in all districts is
specifically prohibited.
A. Overall internal circulation pattern. All off-street parking and loading
facilities shall be designed and constructed in a manner so as to provide
for adequate circulation within the site and safe and convenient access
onto adjoining streets. Among factors to be considered during the
review of parking and loading areas shall be the following: number and
location of entrances and travel aisles; need for acceleration,
deceleration and turning lanes and other traffic control improvements;
the general arrangement and delineation of parking and loading areas;
the quality and quantity of landscaping provided; the means of access
to buildings for fire-fighting equipment and emergency vehicles; and
the needs of the handicapped.
B. Use and parking and loading areas on same parcel; exceptions. Offstreet
parking and loading spaces shall be provided on the same lot or
within the same development as the use to which said use is
appurtenant, except as provided below.
(1) Off-site parking. The Planning Commission may authorize the
utilization of off-site parking areas for uses within nonresidential
zoning districts and anywhere within the C2 Business District if the
Commission determines that there are practical difficulties in
satisfying the parking requirements on-site and/or that the public
safety or convenience would be better served by an off-site
location. If the Planning Commission authorizes the use of off-site
parking, the following conditions shall apply.
(a) The off-site parking area shall be in the same possession as the
principal use, either by deed, by easement or by long-term
§ 265-60 GREENSBURG CODE § 265-62
260:672
lease which has a term equal to or exceeding the projected
life of the facility to which the parking is appurtenant; and
further provided that the owner shall be bound by recorded
covenants requiring the owner and all subsequent owners,
heirs or assigns to maintain the required number of off-street
parking spaces during the existence of the use to which the
parking is appurtenant.
(b) Pedestrian access shall be available within a walking distance
of 500 feet for nonresidential uses and 300 feet for residential
uses, measured from the nearest entrance to the building to
the nearest point of the parking area.
(c) Such separated parking areas shall be usable without causing
unreasonable traffic congestion, detriment to any residential
neighborhood or hazard to pedestrians.
(2) Payment of fund in lieu of providing parking in C2 District. Rather
than providing the required off-street parking on-site due to a
change of use, expansion of an existing use or new construction,
developers of land within the C2 - Business District may provide a
portion of all of such parking by means of a payment to the city's
parking fund. Such payment shall be based on a one-time fee per
parking space, as established from time to time by ordinance of the
City Council. Any off-street parking satisfied in this matter shall run
with the land, and any subsequent change in use that requires
more off-street parking shall require subsequent action to satisfy
additional parking requirements. No refund of such payment shall
be made when there is a change of use to require less parking.
Such payment shall be made to the city in one lump sum prior to
the issuance of a building permit; however, this payment shall not
guarantee the availability of parking for such development. Funds
derived from such payment shall be deposited by the city in a
special parking fund and shall be used for acquiring and developing
off-street parking facilities within the C2 - Business District.
C. Entrances and exits. Driveway entrances shall be designed to
accommodate all vehicle types having occasion to enter the site,
including delivery vehicles. There should be not more than one
entrance and exit or one combined entrance and exit along any street
frontage unless deemed necessary by the Planning Director or their
designee in order to alleviate traffic congestion and interference along
such street. The width of all entrances and exits to off-street parking
and loading areas shall comply with the requirements of this chapter,
except that the Planning Director or their designee may authorize a
narrower driveway width for parking and loading areas within the C2 -
Business District when: [Amended 9-14-2015 by Ord. No. 2057]
(1) The driveway leading to the off-street parking or loading area is not
longer than 50 feet in length.
§ 265-62 WARRANTLESS ARRESTS § 265-62
260:673
(2) The driveway provides access to not more than 10 parking spaces.
(3) Sufficient turning space is provided so that vehicles need not back
into a public street.
D. Relationship of off-street parking and loading areas to public rights-ofway.
In no event shall parking or loading areas be provided in a manner
requiring the backing out of vehicles into the public rights-of-way or the
movement of vehicles entering or exiting the site in a manner which
would require them to make an unlawful maneuver within the public
right-of-way. This requirement does not apply to areas consisting of
driveways serving single-family detached or two-family dwellings,
although direct access onto arterial roadways is discouraged.
E. Pavement requirements. All off-street parking and loading areas,
including aisles and entrances, shall be paved with durable and dustfree
hard surface, except as may be specifically authorized within the
limits of the one-hundred-year floodplain. Individual parking spaces
shall be paved; provided, however, that a two-foot section of the parking
space may be unpaved if the area is landscaped and a raised curb stop
is installed.
F. Curbs and gutters. Curbs and gutters shall be installed where deemed
necessary by the Planning Director or their designee within off-street
parking and loading areas in order to manage storm drainage,
channelize traffic, protect buildings and landscaping areas and
separate pedestrian and vehicular circulation areas. [Amended
9-14-2015 by Ord. No. 2057]
G. Sidewalks and pedestrian facilities. Sidewalks shall be provided on-site,
as necessary, to protect pedestrians and promote the safe and efficient
movement of pedestrian and vehicular movement. Sidewalks shall have
a minimum, unobstructed width of four feet. Specifications may be
found in Planning and Development. [Amended 9-14-2015 by Ord.
No. 2057]
H. Delineation of parking and loading spaces; traffic control signs. All
parking and loading spaces shall be marked by durable painted lines or
curbs extending the length of the space. Signs or pavement marking
shall be utilized, as necessary, to ensure safe traffic operation and to
identify designated compact and handicapped parking spaces and offstreet
loading spaces.
I. Lighting. Any lighting used to illuminate off-street parking and loading
areas shall be arranged, installed and maintained in order to deflect,
shade and focus lights away from adjacent public or private properties.
Modifications to installed lighting may be required by the Planning
Director or their designee upon determination that the lighting
constitutes a hazard or nuisance. [Amended 9-14-2015 by Ord. No.

dust-free hard surface condition at the expense of the owner or lessee.
Parking and loading areas shall be resealed or repaved and pavement
markings periodically repainted and on-site traffic control signs replaced,
as necessary, to maintain a clear identification of individual parking and
loading spaces and to facilitate the safe movement of pedestrian and
vehicular traffic.
§ 265-65. Number of off-street parking spaces required.
All uses shall be subject to the minimum off-street parking requirements
established in this section unless modified parking standards are included
as a proffer or as a condition of the approval of a special exception or
conditionally permitted use or otherwise modified by provisions of this
chapter.
J. Setbacks, screening and landscaping. All parking and loading areas
shall comply with the setback, screening and landscaping requirements
of Article XV of this chapter.
K. Emergency and public vehicle access. Parking and loading areas shall
be designed so that emergency, public service and refuse collection
vehicles can serve the development without the necessity of taking
unreasonable distances or making other dangerous or hazardous
turning movements.
A. Use of parking and loading facilities, generally. Off-street parking and
loading facilities shall be used solely for the parking of vehicles in
operating condition by the patrons, occupants or employees of the use
to which such facilities are accessory. No motor vehicle repair work
except emergency service shall be permitted in association with offstreet
parking and loading facilities. The storage of merchandise or the
sale of vehicles is prohibited in a required off-street parking or loading
area, except as specifically authorized in this Zoning Ordinance.
B. Trucks parked in residential areas. Parking facilities accessory to
residential uses shall be used solely for parking of passenger vehicles or
trucks having a gross weight of 5,000 pounds or less, which are owned
by the occupants of the dwelling or their guests.
C. Vehicle sales and display areas. All areas used for the display of vehicles
for the purposes of sale or rental shall comply with the provisions of this

(5) Species. At least three-fourths ( 3/4) of the trees planted to meet
the requirements of this section must be canopy shade trees as
identified in § 265-95, Plant list.
A. Landscape area adjacent to a public street. The Planning Director or
their designee may waive or reduce the requirement for a landscape
area as described in § 265-83C(1). This requirement may be waived or
reduced when the Planning Director or their designee and the Shade
Tree Commission find that the required ten-foot area would serve no
useful purpose, would result in a hardship to the property owner and
that a suitable screening alternative has been provided where
necessary. Alternative screening such as architectural walls may be
permitted when approved by the Planning Commission.
B. Perimeter parking lot landscaping. The Planning Director or their
designee may waive or reduce the requirement for perimeter parking
lot landscaping as described in § 265-83. This requirement may be
waived or reduced when a suitable screening alternative has been
provided that is acceptable to the Planning Director or their designee
and the Planning Commission.
C. Relation of perimeter and interior parking lot landscaping. The
Planning Director or their designee may modify the numerical
requirements for the amount of landscape space and the amount of
plant materials as required in §§ 265-83 and 265-84. If additional
landscape area or plant material is provided that exceeds the
requirements of the interior or perimeter parking lot landscaping, the
Planning Director or their designee may apply this to the alternative
perimeter or interior landscaping requirements.

§ 265-87. Land use categories. [[Amended 12-21-1994 by Ord. No.
1646; 9-14-2015 by Ord. No. 2057]
For the purpose of this article, existing and proposed land uses are divided
into the four major land uses categories: residential, institutional,
commercial and industrial. Each category is subdivided to reflect the
intensity of the proposed use. For instance, the residential category is
divided into single-family detached, single-family attached and multifamily
residential. In those instances where a proposed or existing use is not listed
below, the Planning Director or their designee shall decide which land use
category is applicable. If the adjacent property is vacant, the property shall
be assumed to be the land use set forth on the Zoning Map.184
§ 265-88. Buffer yards.
A. Residential.
(1) RA - Single-family detached and duplexes.
(2) RB - Single-family attached (townhouses).
(3) RC - Multifamily residential.
B. Institutional.
(1) IA - Low-intensity (daytime only) uses, including libraries, post
offices and churches.
(2) IB - Schools.
(3) IC - Emergency services, including hospitals and fire and rescue
stations.
C. Commercial.
(1) CA - Offices and general retail uses under 10,000 square feet of
gross leasable area.
(2) CB - Offices and general retail uses over 10,000 square feet of
gross leasable area.
(3) CC - Hotels and motels, fast-food restaurants, convenience grocery
stores or vehicle sales and service.
D. Industrial.
(1) INA - Industrial uses without outdoor storage.
(2) INB - Industrial uses with outdoor storage.
A. Relation to setbacks. Buffer yards may be provided in the area required
for setbacks by the zoning district regulations, except in residential
zoning districts. Buffer yards in residential zoning districts may be

§ 265-89. Screening.
provided in any of the following ways: in common open space, in
common use easements located outside of the required lot area or by
providing additional yard space in addition to the required minimum
yard requirements listed in the residential zoning district regulations.
B. Buffer yards exceeding setbacks. In any instance when the buffer yard
required by this article exceeds the setback required by the zoning
district regulations, the buffer yard required by this article must be
provided.
C. Credit for existing buffer. Any existing buffer yard proposed to be saved
by a subdivision or development plan application, which complies with
the intention of this article, shall be deemed to meet these buffer yard
requirements.
D. Buffer yards adjacent to a vacant parcel. Development plan and
subdivision applications proposed adjacent to vacant parcels of
property shall only be required to provide one-half ( 1/2) of the required
buffer yard set forth in § 265-84 of this article.
E. Buffer yards adjacent to a developed site.
(1) Existing development complying with buffer requirement.
Whenever a development or subdivision is proposed adjacent to a
developed property that has provided 100% of the required buffer
yard, the adjacent proposed development or subdivision must
provide at least one-half ( 1/2) of the width of the buffer yard
required by § 265-90 of this article. This provision shall apply
unless modified by § 265-88.
(2) Existing development not complying with buffer requirement.
Whenever a development plan or subdivision application is
proposed adjacent to a developed property that has not provided
any or all of the required buffer, the adjacent proposed
development shall provide the balance of the buffer yard required
by § 265-90. This provision shall apply unless modified by § 265-88.
Residentially zoned or used properties developed prior to the
adoption of this article shall not be determined to have provided a
buffer yard, as defined in Article II.
A. This Article establishes three different screens as identified in the
matrix in § 265-90. Four separate types of plants are required: large- or
medium-scale canopy shade trees, evergreen trees, ornamental trees
and evergreen shrubs.
B. Plant varieties. Plantings must be identified as suitable screening plants
in Subsection D below. Alternative varieties may be approved by the
Planning Director or their designee and the Shade Tree Commission.

§ 265-88 WARRANTLESS ARRESTS § 265-89
260:695
C. Number of plants. Plant materials are required per square foot of buffer
area. For example, if the matrix requires a twenty-five-foot buffer along
a one-hundred-foot property boundary, a resulting 2,500 square feet of
buffer space is required. Screen 1, Alternative A, requires a minimum of
six medium- or large-scale canopy trees and three ornamental trees.
D. Alternative screens and modifications. Alternative planting programs
achieving the objectives of the required screens are permitted to allow
flexibility in landscape design. The Planning Director or their designee
may approve any of the alternative screens provided below or a
combination of the alternatives if the applicant can demonstrate that
the objective of the screen has been met. The Planning Director or their
designee may reduce or eliminate the requirements for evergreen trees
or shrubs if a landscape plan proposes the use of hedges, shrubs, walls
or berms that achieve the objective of the required screen. [Amended
9-14-2015 by Ord. No. 2057]
(1) Screen 1: an open screen between relatively similar land uses.
Open screening shall provide an attractive separation between the
land uses. Screen 1 shall consist of one of the three alternative
planting programs described below or as otherwise approved as
described in Subsection D above:

Shrubs 1/100 1/100 1/200
NOTE:
All figures are per square foot of required buffer yard.
(2) Screen 2: a semiopaque screen between land uses which are
dissimilar in character. Semiopaque screening should partially
block views from the adjoining land uses and create a separation
between the adjoining land uses.

buffer yard.
A. Properties in the C2 District. Buffer yards may be reduced or eliminated
at the discretion of the Planning Director or their designee for the
development or subdivision of property in the C2 District. An opaque
screen accomplished through the construction of architectural
features, walls or the planting of vegetative materials may be required
as a substitute for all or a portion of the required buffer yard. The
Planning Commission must approve these screens. [Amended
9-14-2015 by Ord. No. 2057]
B. Buffer yard exceeding 15% of area. No buffer yard shall be required
which comprises more than 15% of the subject property. In any case

professional planting procedures. At a minimum, all trees planted shall
have rootballs adequate to enclose the entire root system, all trees shall be
mulched and staked and all plants shall be watered at time of installation.
which the required buffer yard would exceed 15% of the buffer yard,
such yards shall be reduced to 15% of the gross area of the site.
C. Construction of walls. Screening and buffer yard requirements shall be
reduced by one-third ( 1/3) where the developer constructs a six-foot
high brick or architectural block wall.
D. Temporary uses. Screening and buffer yard requirements may be
reduced or eliminated by the Zoning Hearing Board.
E. Combined development plan. The Planning Director or their designee
may modify or reduce the requirements for screening and buffer yards
when the adjoining land uses are developed under a combined
development plan. [Amended 9-14-2015 by Ord. No. 2057]
A. Condition. All plants required by this article shall be well-branched and
well-formed, sound, vigorous, healthy and free from disease, sunscald,

ARTICLE XVI
Nonconformance and Noncompliance
[Added 10-14-1991 by Ord. No. 1495]
§ 265-106. Legislative findings.
It is hereby determined and declared (as a matter of legislative findings)
that:
§ 265-107. Purpose.
A. Nonconforming uses and nonconforming structures present a serious
obstacle to the accomplishment of the purposes and intent of this
chapter and the Master Plan upon which it is based.
B. Nonconforming uses and nonconforming structures impede the
development of healthful, safe and economically sound neighborhoods
and districts, disrupt harmonious interrelationships between otherwise
permitted uses and depreciate the usefulness and convenience of the
surrounding land uses and structures.
C. Continuation of nonconforming uses, nonconforming structures and
noncomplying signs in many instances results in an unfortunate and
undesired preferred status in that adherence of adjoining properties to
the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance operates to place such
nonconforming uses, nonconforming structures and noncomplying
signs, especially commercial ones, in a monopolistic position within the
district, secured by the provisions and requirements of the Zoning
Ordinance itself.
D. Nonconforming and noncomplying signs should be classified and
regulated apart from other structures and uses because they are uses in
the field of vision relative to highways and other public and open places,
rather than uses related directly to the land upon which they are
located.
E. Experience has shown that generally, nonconforming uses and
nonconforming structures do not tend to disappear or to be converted
into conforming uses and structures by the mere passage of time.
A. This chapter establishes separate districts, each of which is an
appropriate area for the location of the uses and structures which are
permitted in that district when meeting the established standards of the
district with respect to height, density, open space and other
requirements. It is necessary and consistent with the establishment of
these districts that nonconforming uses, nonconforming structures and
noncomplying signs which substantially and adversely affect the
orderly development and taxable value of other property in the district
not be permitted to continue without restriction.
§ 265-106 WARRANTLESS ARRESTS § 265-107
260:707
§ 265-108. Nonconforming uses, structures and signs.
B. It is the declared purpose of the land use plan upon which this chapter
is based that all such nonconforming uses, nonconforming structures
and noncomplying signs be eventually discontinued and the use of the
premises conform to the regulations prescribed herein.
C. It is the purpose of this chapter (notwithstanding certain present
regulations contained herein, designed with reasonable consideration
of the property rights and investments involved in nonconforming uses,
nonconforming structures and noncomplying signs) to provide for the
regulation of such uses and structures and to specify those
circumstances and conditions under which nonconforming uses,
nonconforming structures and noncomplying signs shall be permitted
to continue and to encourage the ultimate termination of such uses and
structures.
A. The nonconforming use of land (where such use is the principal use of
the property and no main structure is involved) may be continued for a
period of not more than three years from the date the use became or
becomes nonconforming, provided that there shall be no expansion or
extension of such use; and if any such use is discontinued, the future
use of said land shall be in conformity with the provisions of this
chapter. A nonconforming use shall be considered to be abandoned and
discontinued if such use ceases for a period of three years.
B. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a nonconforming use of a
structure may be continued, but shall not thereafter be changed, except
as may be authorized as a special exception by the Board (see
§ 265-129). A nonconforming use of a structure may be extended
throughout those existing parts of the structure which were arranged
or designed for such use.
C. A nonconforming structure (other than a sign) may be moved, extended,
enlarged or structurally altered if the natural expansion and growth of
the operations conducted therein require such moving, extension,
enlargement or structural alteration; provided, however, that any
extended or enlarged portion of the structure shall not further
encroach, extend into or infringe upon the height and area provisions

shall be within the confines of the lot as it existed on the zoning origin
date. [Amended 8-12-2019 by Ord. No. 2095]
D. A noncomplying sign may be continued, but not enlarged, moved or
replaced, until removed or made to conform, which shall occur within
five years of the effective date of this chapter if such sign is initially
noncomplying or within such time from the date any such sign later
becomes noncomplying.
E. Subject to the other provisions of this section, a nonconforming

destroyed by fire or other casualty or act of God to the extent that
the cost of restoration to the condition in which it was before the
occurrence shall exceed 50% of the cost of restoration of the entire
structure or sign new, shall not be restored. In the event that such
damage or destruction is 50% or less than the cost of restoration
of the entire structure or sign new, such structure or sign may be
restored (but not enlarged or extended onto any land not previously
occupied) and its previous occupancy or use resumed, provided that
such restoration is started within one year of the occurrence of the

the district of its location under certain qualifying conditions contained
in the use regulations of such district, such as a conditional use
permitted by the Council, a special exception permitted by the Board,
etc., and which exists without compliance with these conditions or a use
which does not comply only because of failure to provide required
automobile parking space and loading space shall have the same rights
and privileges of continuance and maintenance as if it were in
compliance with these conditions and requirements. This provision,
however, shall not be deemed to remove the obligation to provide

obligation to comply with all applicable regulations of this chapter for
any enlarged, changed or restored portion of the use or structure at the
time of such enlargement, change or restoration.
B. A use of land lawfully existing on the effective date of this chapter or
subsequent applicable amendment thereto conforming as to use, but
not complying with the area regulations of the district in which it is
located, shall have the same rights and privileges of continuance,
maintenance, enlargement and expansion as are permitted for a use
complying with such area regulations.
C. A structure lawfully existing on the effective date of this chapter or
subsequent applicable amendment thereto designed to comply with the
use regulations of the district in which it is located, but not complying
with height or area regulations of such district:
(1) Shall have the same rights and privileges of continuance,
maintenance, enlargement and expansion as are permitted for such
a structure when complying with such height and area regulations.
(2) May be restored if damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty
or act of God to the extent of less than 50% of the cost of
restoration of the entire structure new, provided that such
restoration is started within one year of the occurrence and
diligently prosecuted to completion. If, however, such damage
amounts to 50% or more of the cost of restoration of the entire
structure new, no restoration shall be made unless every portion of
§ 265-108 WARRANTLESS ARRESTS § 265-109

the structure is made to conform to all regulations of the district in
which it is located. (See § 265-129.)

ARTICLE XVII
Signs
[Amended 7-11-1988 by Ord. No. 1373]
§ 265-110. Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to regulate display of the various classes of
signs as follows:
A. Display of signs.
(1) Any sign placed on land or on a building for the purpose of
identification or protection of the same or for advertising a use
conducted thereon or therein shall be deemed to be accessory and
incidental to such land, building or use. It is the purpose to place
such limitations on the display of all such signs as will assure that
they will:
(a) Be appropriate to the land, building or use to which they are
appurtenant; and
(b) Be adequate but not excessive for the intended purpose of
identification, protection or advertisement. With respect to
signs advertising business uses, such regulations have been
devised after considering, among other matters, shopping
habits, extent of trade area and means of access to such uses
and are specifically intended, among other things, to avoid
excessive competition among sign displays in their demand for
public attention.
(2) A further purpose of this article is to permit such signs that will not,
by their reason, size, location, construction or manner of display,
endanger the public safety of individuals; confuse, mislead or
obstruct the vision necessary for traffic safety; or otherwise
endanger public health, safety and morals; and to permit and
regulate signs in such a way as to support and complement land
use objectives set forth in the Comprehensive Plan and this Zoning
Ordinance. Considerable attention has been placed on the physical
and economic revitalization of the central business district by city
government and the business community. Extensive planning
efforts within the downtown area have resulted in a comprehensive
program to upgrade the aesthetic environment, which in turn is
expected to stimulate economic growth within the community. As
signs are a prominent element of the downtown's visual
environment, it has become important to control their appearance,
number and location. The regulation of signs is intended to be
consistent with objectives set forth in the Comprehensive Plan.
B. It is intended that signs erected for directional purposes, for public
information or to call attention to special events shall be confined to
§ 265-110 WARRANTLESS ARRESTS § 265-110
260:711
§ 265-111. Exempt signs.
The provisions of this article relating to signs shall apply in all zoning
districts. However, the following types of signs shall be exempted from all
requirements of this chapter, except those specifically provided for herein:
those that are of general public interest, and that such signs shall be
limited to the giving of such information.
C. All other signs commonly referred to as "outdoor advertising signs" are
deemed by this chapter to constitute a separate use, unique among all
uses in the city, in that it is essentially a use of the streets and highways
in the city.
D. Any widespread display of outdoor advertising is deemed to be
inappropriate to the character and sound development of the city, and it
is intended by this chapter that the streets and highways in the city
shall not be made available for such display, but that outdoor
advertising shall be confined to locations in industrial districts in which
it is deemed not to be incongruous with other uses permitted therein.
A. Temporary signs.
(1) Announcing signs. One sign per street frontage of a building which
is under construction or structural alteration of repair announcing
the character of the building enterprise or the purpose for which
the building is intended, including names of architects, engineers,

area of such sign shall not exceed 16 square feet in residential
districts or 32 square feet in other districts.
(2) Real estate signs. One sign per street frontage, not exceeding four
square feet in residential districts, advertising the sale, rental or
lease of the premises on which displayed.
(3) Subdivision signs. One sign per street entrance to the subdivision
and located on the property to be subdivided, provided that such
sign shall not exceed 32 square feet in area. Such sign may not be
erected until the subdivision has been approved by the appropriate
city officials and may be displayed for a period of one year from the
date of erection, which must be filed with the Planning Director or
their designee within 30 days after erection. Erection date will be
determined to be the same as the subdivision approval date if not
filed within the thirty-day period. The display period may be
extended by written approval of the Planning Director or their
designee for a reasonable period of time, not to exceed one year at
any one time. [Amended 9-14-2015 by Ord. No. 2057]
(4) Special event displays. Portable signs and window signs may be
erected on the premises of an establishment having a grand
opening or special event, provided that such signs shall be
displayed for a period not to exceed seven calendar days within any

determines that such work is in accordance with the requirements
contained in this article and that such work will not violate the building
or electrical codes of the City of Greensburg. When a sign permit has
been issued by the Department, it shall be unlawful to change, modify,

without prior approval of the Department of Planning and Development.

2094]
(1) Temporary sandwich board signs may only be located in front of
commercial properties within the Downtown and Historic Districts
where sidewalks are a minimum of eight feet wide. These
temporary signs shall be located on the sidewalk only during
business hours.
(2) The total size of the sign is not to exceed 42 inches by 24 inches
(height by width). The signs must be internally weighted to
withstand strong winds. The temporary sandwich board signs shall
be placed on the sidewalk next to the curb edge of the sidewalk in
such a manner so as not to interfere with pedestrian traffic or
handicapped accessibility along with the opening of car doors,
paying parking meter fees, and loading/unloading zones. Portable
signs shall be placed an appropriate distance from pedestrian
gathering points such as crosswalks and bus stops.
(3) Only one sandwich board sign shall be permitted per business, and
the sign shall be located in front of that specific business, not at
another location. If the business is a corner property, the sign may
only be placed in one location. The Planning Commission design
approval is required prior to a permit being issued by the City of
Greensburg.
(4) Sandwich board signs shall not be located so as to cause a traffic
hazard by becoming an obstruction to the vision of a vehicular
driver.
(5) Sandwich board signs placed on private property or a public rightof-
way without prior written approval of the Planning Commission
and City Council will be immediately removed by the City.
(6) Sandwich board signs that cause any kind of traffic or pedestrian
hazard will be removed immediately by the City of Greensburg.
(7) Any sandwich board sign in place prior to the adoption of this
ordinance185 are considered in violation of the City Code because
§ 265-115 WARRANTLESS ARRESTS § 265-115
260:719
sandwich board signs were prohibited prior to the date of this
amendment.
(8) Sandwich board signs will only be considered as an accessory sign.
Sandwich board signs will only be considered by Planning
Commission when a business has already been approved for a
permanent sign as per the design guidelines.

zoned C-1 Neighborhood Shopping District in the City's Gateway
District, C-2 Business District (with the exception of the Historic
District) and in the M Industrial District operating a commercial
enterprise. All EMC proposals shall be submitted to the Planning
and Development Department and shall be reviewed by the City's
Planning Commission and approved by City Council. [Amended
7-8-2019 by Ord. No. 2094]
(2) All EMCs that are currently erected in the City of Greensburg that
do not fit the criteria below are now considered nonconforming
signs.
(3) EMCs will follow this criteria: 10 mm pitch resolution or greater
depending on the square footage of the sign. EMC signs are never
to scroll, flash, oscillate or move in any way, and the message must
remain static. EMCs are part of but not the main message of any
sign. The sign presented must have the business name identified in
a non-EMC format. The night-distance time illumination of an EMC
shall conform to the criteria set forth in this section:
(a) EMC illumination measurement criteria. The illuminance of an
EMC shall be measured with an illuminance meter set to
measure footcandles accurate to at least two decimals.
Illuminance shall be measured with the EMC off, and again
with the EMC displaying a white image for a full color-capable
EMC, or a solid message for a single-color EMC. All
measurements shall be taken perpendicular to the face of the
EMC at the distance determined by the total square footage of
the EMC.

describe the sign and specify the violation involved and which shall
state that, if the sign is not removed or the violation is not
corrected within 10 days, the sign shall be removed in accordance
with the provisions of this section.
(2) All notices of removal mailed by the Planning Director or their
designee shall be sent by certified mail. Any time periods provided

property on which the sign is located as shown on the last
equalized assessment roll. If known or with reasonable care should
be known, the notice shall be mailed to or delivered to the owner of
the sign and the occupant of the property.
(4) Any person having an interest in the sign or the property may
appeal the determination of the Planning Director or their designee

per the same permitting process herein defined. [Amended
9-14-2015 by Ord. No. 2057]
(8) Availability of signage space. All messaging is subject to availability
of space for signage along a given block. No more than two
installations with no more than two signs each are permitted on
one side of the street before a given intersection. A single sign may
have up to three messages, and the desired maximum messages at
an installation are four messages, through rare exceptions may be
made for five messages. (Six messages at an installation may occur
only in very exceptional circumstances.) Note that traffic
conditions and other physical circumstances may prevent the
maximum amount of messaging being erected on a given block.
(9) Additional messaging locations. These may be allowed on an
exceptional basis where the setting of an intersection could cause
confusion as to which way is which to reach a destination.

(14) Erection and traffic engineering. Directional signs shall be safely
and securely attached to poles or channels. In no case shall any
signs be secured with wire, strips of wood or nails. Such signs may
rest in or be bolted to strong, heavy metal brackets or saddles. The
applicant is responsible for providing a sealed approval certified by
a Commonwealth of Pennsylvania traffic engineer for each sign
location. In addition, on any State of Pennsylvania right-of-way,
PennDOT (Pennsylvania Department of Transportation) approval is
required as part of the city application for a directional sign.
M. Enforcement; nonconforming signs. Any directional sign in existence on
the date of promulgation of these regulations which violated or does not
conform to its provisions shall be removed, altered or replaced so as to
conform with the provisions hereof. [Amended 4-12-1999 by Ord.
No. 1771]

so as to comply with the standards hereof within 30 days after such
notice, Planning and Development may undertake such removal or
alteration as is necessary to bring the structure into compliance and
assess the costs to the permittee or owner. Planning and Development
may cause any directional sign that presents an immediate peril to
person or property to be removed or altered immediately and without
notice. If said directional sign is removed for the above reasons, it shall
become the property of the City of Greensburg. [Added 4-12-1999 by

ARTICLE XVIII
Conditional Uses
§ 265-118. Intent; findings.
The development and execution of this chapter is based upon the division
of the city into districts, within which districts the regulations of this
chapter apply uniformly to a great majority of the permitted uses. It is
recognized, however, that there are certain uses which, because of their
special characteristics, justify different and more flexible considerations in
adjusting them to their environment with a maximum of mutual protection
than the more or less rigid considerations that are reflected in the uniform
district regulations. These uses, herein designated as "conditional uses,"
and individually identified in § 265-122, may be grouped in the following
three categories, each of which qualifies for the special considerations,
including exercise of planning judgment on location and site plan:
§ 265-119. General requirements and conditions.
Conditional uses, as named in § 265-122, may be authorized in the districts
therein designated, by the Council, after public hearing and report by the
Commission subject to:
§ 265-120. General standards.
The following findings shall be used as guidelines by the Commission and
the Council in acting upon conditional use applications:
A. Uses publicly operated or traditionally affected with a public interest.
B. Uses entirely private in character, but of such an unusual nature that
their operation may give rise to unique problems with respect to their
impact upon neighboring property or public facilities.
C. Developments, either public or private, consisting of a multiplicity of
units or uses, controlled and planned as a single entity.
A. Approval of site plan and location.
B. The conditions herein prescribed, without variance.
C. All other applicable provisions of this chapter unless otherwise
prescribed or excepted.
D. Such minor departures from the literal application of the regulations
and standards as will, in special situations, not be contrary to the
general intent and objectives of such regulations and standards, but
will, in fact, further such intent and objectives by providing some
measure of flexibility for adaptation to a particular site.
A. That the establishment, maintenance or operation of the conditional
use will not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety,
morals, comfort or general welfare.
§ 265-118 WARRANTLESS ARRESTS § 265-120
260:731
§ 265-121. Conditions and guaranties.
§ 265-122. Uses, locations and specific conditions. [Amended
3-14-1994 by Ord. No. 1616]
The following-named conditional uses and unit group buildings thereof
may be authorized in the districts indicated in accord with the general
requirements, conditions and standards of §§ 265-119 and 265-120 above
and the specific conditions listed for each use. The definitions of these uses
shall be determined by the Council and may be applied on a case-by-case
basis as necessary, depending on neighborhood considerations, current and
relevant meanings of terms, etc. In addition, expansion of a previously
conditional use or a change in the original conditional use must have the
approval of the Council.
B. That the conditional use will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment
of other properties in the immediate vicinity for the purposes already
permitted, nor substantially diminish and impair property values within
the neighborhood.
C. That the establishment of the conditional use will not impede the
normal and orderly development and improvement of the surrounding
property for uses permitted in the district.
D. That adequate utilities, access roads, drainage and/or necessary
facilities have been or are being provided.
E. That adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide ingress
and egress so designed as to minimize traffic congestion in the public
streets.
A. Prior to the authorization of any conditional use, the Commission may
recommend, and the Council shall stipulate, such conditions and
restrictions upon the establishment, location, construction,
maintenance, management and operation of the conditional use as are
deemed necessary for the protection of the public interest and to secure
compliance with the requirements and standards of §§ 265-119 and
265-120 above and the specific conditions herein prescribed for each
use.
B. Adequate legal provisions shall be made for the assurance of continual
maintenance and management of privately owned improvements,
utilities and facilities serving the conditional use. Such assurance may
be in the form of protective or restrictive covenants, corporate
membership agreements, cooperative membership agreements or such
other form as may be deemed adequate.
C. In all cases in which conditional uses are authorized, the Council shall
require such evidence and guaranties as it may deem necessary as
proof that the conditions stipulated in connection therewith are being
and will be complied with.

line which borders the development, if suitably screened
from the street.
(2) Density, land coverage and floor area ratio. The total permitted
dwelling unit density, maximum land coverage and floor area ratio
shall be the same as otherwise permitted in the particular district,
computed on the basis of net site area, except:
(a) In R Districts, the required lot area per dwelling unit may be
reduced by not more than 5% if it is found that, throughout the
development, the site plan provides a better arrangement of
buildings in relation to one another and to their sites, from the
standpoint of privacy, light access, organization of private open
space and preservation of important natural features, than
would be possible or practical for a development comprised of
similar types of dwellings otherwise built in strict compliance
with the applicable district regulations.
(b) In R2 Districts, in a development qualifying for lot area per
dwelling unit reduction under Subsection F(2)(a) above, the
required lot area per dwelling may be reduced by not more
than 10%, provided that at least one acre or 50% of the total
open space, whichever is greater, is provided in common open

G. Nursing homes and halfway houses. [Added 5-12-1986 by Ord. No.
1290]
(1) Findings. The concept of nursing homes and halfway houses bear
many similarities to personal care boarding homes. The recent
trend in corrections and health care is towards
deinstitutionalization, i.e., the provision of shelter and treatment in
the residential community. Hospital stays have become generally
shorter in duration and many forms of treatment which were once
available only at a hospital are now being performed in smaller,
private facilities.
(2) Regulations of group care facilities. Group care facilities are to be
treated as a conditional use with the following specific
requirements:
(a) Group care facilities may be established in R2, C1, C2 and
some S Zoning Districts. Group care facilities may also be
established in R3 Districts so as not to impact or adversely
affect the existing neighborhood/area, such impact to be
determined by the Planning Commission and the City Council.
[Amended 5-9-1988 by Ord. No. 1365]
(b) Group care facilities shall not be located within 4,000 feet of
any existing group care facility unless it is determined by the
Planning Commission and the City Council that there is a
natural buffer, such as a highway, mountainside, etc., that
hinders any impact or negative effect on any particular
neighborhood. [Amended 5-9-1988 by Ord. No. 1365]
(c) Group care facilities shall have a minimum lot size of 10,000
square feet.
(d) A buffer area shall be provided along all adjacent property
lines.
(e) Parking shall be required as follows: one off-street space for
every two employees, plus one space for every three residents.
(f) Conversion of existing structures must meet the development
standards required for new construction.
(g) Group care facilities must supply to the city and keep current
the names of a manager and/or other such person responsible
for responding to an inquiry of the city.

treated as a conditional use with the following specific
requirements:

(b) Halfway houses shall not be located within 10,000 feet of any
existing halfway house.
(c) Halfway houses shall have a minimum lot size of 30,000 square
feet and a minimum lot area of 1,500 square feet per resident.
(d) Halfway houses must supply to the city and keep current the
name of a manager and/or other such person responsible for
responding to an inquiry of the city.

federal and county agencies when required, but in all cases
supervised on a twenty-four-hour basis.

(2) The maximum length of stay for any guest shall be 14 days per
calendar year.
(3) No cooking facilities shall be permitted in any of the rented rooms.
(4) Breakfast shall be served to overnight guests only from the
residential kitchen. No kitchen remodeling for commercial
restaurant operation or restaurant operation shall be permitted.
(5) Two parking spaces, plus one additional space for each room must
be provided. Tandem parking is permitted with the limit of two
vehicles per tandem space, subject to the following:
(a) All parking spaces shall be paved, subject to city approval and
to city standards, with materials to maintain the historical
nature of the neighborhood.
(b) No removal of adjacent residential facilities shall be permitted
to provide for parking requirements of this section unless the
applicant obtains special approval of the Planning Commission
based upon submission of a parking analysis of available and

facility. The Commission, upon review of such study, may
decrease the required number of spaces if it finds sufficient

hotels and motels.
(13) Facilities shall be prohibited on lots or parcels within developments
constructed under the provisions of a PUD or PRD or containing
less than the minimum lot area of 7,200 square feet.
A. Application; form and content. Written application for the approval of a
conditional use shall be filed in the public office of the Commission upon

known name and address of such owners as shown upon records of
the existing tax assessing authority. Where all property within the
three-hundred-foot radius is under the same ownership as the site
under consideration, the owners of all property adjoining that
owned by the applicant shall be notified in the same manner as
herein provided.
(3) By mailing a notice thereof to every association of residents or
owners who shall have registered an association address for this
purpose with the Commission.

exceptional and undue hardship upon the owner of such
property, the Board shall have the power to authorize, upon
appeal, a variance from such strict application, so as to relieve
such difficulties or hardships, provided that such relief may be
granted without substantial detriment to the public good and

(b) Ordinance amendment not appropriate. No variance shall be
authorized unless the Board specifically finds that the

E. In C-1, C-2, M, R-T and S Districts, a communications tower may be
permitted via a special exception by the City of Greensburg's Zoning
Hearing Board with the requirements listed below: [Added 7-19-2004
by Ord. No. 1895]
(1) The communications company is required to demonstrate, using
technological evidence, that the antenna must be located in the
area it has proposed in the order to satisfy its function in the
company's grid system.
(2) If the communications company proposes to build a tower (as
opposed to mounting the antenna on an existing structure), it is
required to demonstrate that it contacted the owners of tall
structures within a one-fourth-mile radius of the site proposed,
asked for permission to install the antenna on those structures and
was denied for reasons other than economic ones. This would
include smokestacks, water towers, tall buildings, flagpoles, towers
and antenna support structures of other communications
companies, and other communications towers (fire, police, etc.).
(3) The applicant shall demonstrate that the antenna is the minimum
height required to function satisfactorily. No antenna that is taller
than this minimum height shall be approved. In addition, no
antenna shall exceed 200 feet in height.
(4) All communications towers must be stealth towers. A "stealth
tower" is a communications tower which is not recognizable as a
conventional communications tower (e.g., a metal lattice
structure), but instead is disguised or concealed in such a fashion
as to conform to its surroundings. Examples of such cell stealth
towers include a tower which looks like a tree or one that is
concealed in a church steeple, or a monopole.
§ 265-129 GREENSBURG CODE § 265-129
260:750
(5) Setbacks from base of antenna support structure. If a new antenna
support structure is constructed (as opposed to mounting the
antenna on an existing structure), the minimum distance between
the base of the support structure or any guy wire anchors and any
property line shall be the largest as following:
(a) One hundred percent of antenna height.
(b) The minimum setback in the underlying zoning district.
(6) Landscaping. The following landscaping shall be required to screen
as much of the support structure as possible, the fence surrounding
the support structure and any other ground-level features (such as
the building) and, in general, efforts should be made to soften the
appearance of the communications site. If the antenna is mounted
on an existing structure, landscaping shall not be required. An
evergreen screen shall be required to surround the site. The screen
can be either a hedge (planted three feet on center maximum) or a
row of evergreen trees (planted 10 feet on a center maximum). The
evergreen screen shall be a minimum height of six feet at planting
and shall grow to a minimum of 15 feet at maturity.
(7) In order to reduce the number of antenna support structures
needed in the community in the future, the proposed support
structure shall he required to accommodate other users, including
other communications companies, local police, fire, ambulance
services and municipal authority and road departments. In
addition, a linear two-mile separation shall be maintained between
communications towers, measured from the base of the support
structure.
(8) The communications company must demonstrate that the Federal
Communications Commission licenses it.
(9) Antenna support structures under 200 feet in height shall either be
painted silver or have a galvanized finish retained or be either
stainless steel or aluminum in order to reduce the visual impact.
Support structures near airports shall meet all Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) regulations. No antenna support structure
may be artificially lighted except for that required by the FAA.
(10) A land development plan shall be required for all cell sites, showing
the antenna, antenna support structure building, buffering, access
to the public right-of-way and all other items that may be required
by Planning and Development. [Amended 9-14-2015 by Ord. No.
2057]
(11) In granting the use, the City of Greensburg Zoning Hearing Board
may attach reasonable conditions warranted to protect the public
health, safety and welfare, including but not limited to location,
fencing, screening, increased setbacks and the right to use said
facilities for public purposes.
§ 265-129 WARRANTLESS ARRESTS § 265-129
260:751
(12) All approvals will be only for specific facilities set forth in the
application. No additions or alterations thereto will be permitted
without a new application.
(13) The applications shall demonstrate that the proposed
communications tower and communications antenna proposed to
be mounted thereon comply with all applicable standards
established by the Federal Communications Commission governing
human exposure to electromagnetic radiation.
(14) Communications towers shall comply with all applicable Federal
Aviation Administration and Commonwealth Bureau of Aviation
standards and regulation.
(15) The applicant shall demonstrate that the proposed height of the
communications tower is the minimum height necessary to perform
its function.
(16) The applicant shall submit certification from a Pennsylvaniaregistered
professional engineer that the proposed
communications tower will be designed and constructed in
accordance with the current Structure Standards for Steel
Antennas Towers and Antenna Supporting Structures, published by
the Electrical Industry Association/Telecommunications Industry
Association.
(17) The applicant shall submit a copy of its current Federal
Communication Commission license; the name, address and
emergency telephone number for the operator of the
communications tower; and a certificate of insurance evidencing
general liability coverage in the minimum amount of $1,000,000
per occurrence and property damage coverage in the minimum
amount of $1,000,000 per occurrence covering the
communications tower and the communications antennas.
(18) All guy wires associated with the guyed communications towers
shall be clearly marked so as to be visible at all times.
(19)No signs, lights, sirens or horns shall be mounted on a
communications tower, except as may be required by the Federal
Communications Commission, Federal Aviation Administration or
other governmental agency that has jurisdiction.
(20) Communications towers shall be protected and maintained in
accordance with the requirements of the City of Greensburg.
(21) If a communications tower remains unused for a period of 12
consecutive months, the owner or operator thereof shall dismantle
and remove the communications tower within six months of the
expiration of such twelve-month period.

ARTICLE XXII
Floodplain Provisions
[Added 9-11-1978 by Ord. No. 1059; amended 7-28-1997 by Ord. No.
1728; 2-14-2011 by Ord. No. 2004]
§ 265-154. Statutory authorization.
The Legislature of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has, by the passage
of the Pennsylvania Flood Plain Management Act of 1978, delegated the
responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management
regulations to promote public health, safety, and the general welfare of its
citizenry. Therefore, the Mayor and Council of the City of Greensburg, does
hereby order as follows.
§ 265-155. General provisions.
A. Purpose and intent. The intent of this article is to:
(1) Promote the general health, welfare, and safety of the community.
(2) Encourage the utilization of appropriate construction practices in
order to prevent or minimize flood damage in the future.
(3) Minimize danger to public health by protecting water supply and
natural drainage.
(4) Reduce financial burdens imposed on the community, its
governmental units, and its residents, by preventing excessive
development in areas subject to flooding.
(5) Comply with federal and state floodplain management
requirements.
B. Applicability.
(1) It shall be unlawful for any person, partnership, business or
corporation to undertake, or cause to be undertaken, any
construction or development anywhere within the City of
Greensburg unless a permit has been obtained from the Floodplain
Administrator.
(2) A permit shall not be required for minor repairs to existing
buildings or structures.
C. Abrogation and greater restrictions. This article supersedes any other
conflicting provisions that may be in effect in identified floodplain
areas. However, any other ordinance provisions shall remain in full
force and effect to the extent that those provisions are more restrictive.
If there is any conflict between any of the provisions of this article, the
more restrictive shall apply.
D. Severability. If any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause, or
phrase of this article shall be declared invalid for any reason

of the Chapter, which shall remain in full force and effect, and for
this purpose the provisions of this article are hereby declared to be
severable.
E. Warning and disclaimer of liability.
(1) The degree of flood protection sought by the provisions of this
article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is
based on accepted engineering methods of study. Larger floods
may occur or flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by
debris. This article does not imply that areas outside any identified
floodplain areas, or that land uses permitted within such areas will
be free from flooding or flood damages.
(2) This article shall not create liability on the part of the City of
Greensburg or any officer or employee thereof for any flood
damages that result from reliance on this article or any
administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
A. Designation of the Floodplain Administrator. The Planning Director
within Planning and Development is hereby appointed to administer
and enforce this article and is referred to herein as the Floodplain

B. Description and special requirements of identified floodplain areas. The
identified floodplain area may consist of the following specific areas:
(1) Floodway Area.
204. Editor's Note: See 32 P.S. § 679.101 et seq.
§ 265-156 GREENSBURG CODE § 265-157
260:776
(a) Description.
[1] The area identified as "floodway" in the FIS that
represents the channel of a watercourse and the adjacent
land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the
base flood without cumulatively increasing the water
surface elevation by more than one foot at any point.
[2] This term shall also include floodway areas that have been
identified in other available studies or sources of
information for those special floodplain areas where no
floodway has been identified in the FIS.
(b) Special requirements.
[1] Any encroachment that would cause any increase in flood
heights shall be prohibited.
[2] No new construction or development shall be allowed,
unless a permit is obtained from the Department of
Environmental Protection Regional Office.
(2) Special Floodplain Area.
(a) Description. The areas identified as Zones AE and A1-30 in the
FIS which are subject to inundation by the one-percent-annualchance
flood event determined by detailed methods and have
base flood elevations (BFEs) shown.
(b) Special requirements.
[1] No new construction or development shall be located
within the area measured 50 feet landward from the topof-
bank of any watercourse.
[2] In special floodplain areas without a designated floodway,
no new development shall be permitted unless it can be
demonstrated that the cumulative effect of all past and
projected development will not increase the BFE by more
than one foot.
(3) Approximate floodplain area.
(a) Description. The areas identified as Zone A in the FIS that are
subject to inundation by the one-percent-annual-chance flood
event determined using approximate methodologies. Because
detailed hydraulic analyses have not been performed, no BFEs
or flood depths are shown.
(b) Special requirements.
[1] No new construction or development shall be located
within the area measured 50 feet landward from the topof-
bank of any watercourse.
§ 265-157 WARRANTLESS ARRESTS § 265-157

[2] When available, information from other federal, state, and
other acceptable sources shall be used to determine the
BFE, as well as a floodway area, if possible. When no other
information is available, the BFE shall be determined by
using a point on the boundary of the identified floodplain
area that is nearest the construction site in question.
[3] In lieu of the above, the municipality may require the
applicant to determine the elevation with hydrologic and
hydraulic engineering techniques. Hydrologic and
hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by
professional engineers or others of demonstrated
qualifications, who shall certify that the technical methods
used correctly reflect currently accepted technical
concepts. Studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be
submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical
review by the City of Greensburg.

natural topography and prevents soil erosion.
(6) To provide an environment of stable character in harmony with
surrounding development.
B. This Article is designed to provide for small- and large-scale
development incorporating a single type or a variety of residential and
related uses which are planned and developed as a unit. Such
development may consist of individual lots or it may have common
building sites. Common space for recreational purpose shall be an
essential and major element of the plan which is related to and affects
the long-term value of the homes and other development.
C. The planned residential development may also provide public facilities
and commercial or industrial uses; parks, playgrounds, recreational
areas or reservation of area and reservation for educational and
governmental facilities wherever those are deemed necessary by the
City Council.
A. The following residential uses may be permitted in a planned
residential development: single-family dwellings, semidetached and
duplex dwellings, townhouses, apartments, student homes (see
§§ 265-12A, 265-17A), nursing homes and retirement homes.
[Amended 11-14-2005 by Ord. No. 1913]

public schools, golf courses and community clubs, provided that
they are designed to serve primarily the residents of the planned
residential development and are compatibly and harmoniously
incorporated into the unitary design of the planned residential
development. Such additional uses shall not, by reason of their
location, construction, manner or timing of operation, signs
lighting, parking arrangements or other characteristics, have
adverse effects on residential uses within or adjoining the district
or create traffic congestion or hazards to vehicular or pedestrian
traffic.
A. The distance between buildings in a planned residential development
shall not be less than that required for an R1 District; however, the
Council may permit reductions in these requirements if it finds that,
through the use of topography, siting on the lot or through design, such
building or buildings do not impinge upon the privacy of adjacent
existing or potential structures.
B. The proposed location and arrangement of structures shall not be
detrimental to existing or prospective adjacent dwellings or to the
existing or prospective development of the neighborhood. High-rise
buildings shall be located within a planned residential development in
such a manner so as not to create any adverse impact on adjoining lowrise
buildings, such as obstructing the view, excluding natural light, or
invading the privacy of occupants of such low-rise buildings.
A. In this article, where the words "former R1 District" or words of like
import are used, the meaning shall refer to the zoning classification of a
parcel of land prior to its having been rezoned PRD (planned residential
districts) under the provision of this chapter.
B. In order to encourage landowners to take advantage of the PRD
concept and to fulfill the intent of this chapter, the Council may permit
densities not exceeding those as follow within former districts, provided

C. The Council may decline or refuse to allow the maximum density
permitted within each zoning district if the development:
(1) Creates inconvenient or unsafe access to the planned development.
(2) Creates traffic congestion in the streets which adjoin the planned
development.
(3) Places an excessive burden on parks, recreational areas, schools
and other public facilities which serve or are proposed to serve the
planned residential development.
D. The minimum recreational space and outdoor living space shall be
provided in accordance with Graph No. 1.209
E. The computation of overall density of a planned residential
development shall not include the area of lands intended for
commercial or industrial purpose or other public or nonresidential uses
within the planned residential district.
F. The distribution of dwellings or other land uses shall not be affected by
former zoning district boundaries.
A. PRD. Structures located within 200 feet of the perimeter of a planned
residential development must be set back by a distance sufficient to
protect the privacy and density of adjacent existing uses.
B. Such PRD structures located on the perimeter of the planned
residential development must be permanently screened if required by
the Council.

condition of allowing further work to be done, reasonable safety
precautions be taken as the consulting engineer considers advisable to
reduce such likelihood of danger. Such safety precautions may include
§ 265-193 GREENSBURG CODE § 265-193
260:824
§ 265-194. Certificate of completion. [Amended 9-14-2015 by Ord.
No. 2057]
but shall not be limited to specifying a flatter exposed slope or
construction of additional drainage facilities, berms, terraces,
compaction or cribbing. Implementation of these measures shall in no
way relieve the permit holder of liability resulting from the operation.
F. Council actions. A permit shall not be issued for any land operation
involved in any conditional use or activity controlled by the Zoning or
Subdivision/Land Development Ordinance, as may be in force at the
time, until such time as said conditional use or activity has received the
requisite. Council then reserves the right to amend, modify or add to or
delete the conditions or standards to be imposed at the time of approval
pertinent to the zoning or subdivision/land development approval, and
these conditions or standards shall become part of the conditions of the
permit issued under this chapter.
A. Certification. Upon completion of the operation for which a permit has
been obtained, the owner shall certify, in writing, to Planning and
Development that the operation has been completed in compliance with
the provisions of this chapter and the land operations permit issued
pursuant thereto.

Planning and Development and/or consulting engineer shall forward
within 10 days a request for comment and final review of the permit and
work performed thereunder to the appropriate agencies, including but
not limited to the Director of Finance, consulting engineer, Director of
Public Works, the Soil Conservation District, any utility or authority
affected by the operation and any party who has gone on record as an
interested party affected by the operation. Said agencies/parties shall
review and reply, in writing, to Planning and Development within 20
days after notice on whether or not the provisions of the permit have
been complied with as it affects their jurisdiction.
C. Issuance. If the city, after the above review, is satisfied that the work
authorized by the permit has been satisfactorily completed in
accordance with the requirements of this article and the permit issued
hereunder, Planning and Development shall issue a completion
certificate covering such work to the applicant. A separate certificate
shall be issued for each permit.
D. Nonissuance. If the review in Subsection B yields information that the
work has not been completed in compliance with the provisions of this
chapter, the applicant will be denied the certificate of completion and
ordered to abate the violation by Planning and Development in
accordance with the enforcement provisions of this article.
§ 265-193 WARRANTLESS ARRESTS § 265-195
260:825
§ 265-195. Special measures; compliance. [Amended 9-14-2015 by
Ord. No. 2057]
Whenever the city determines that any land operations existing on the
effective date of this chapter or subsequent thereto (either in process or
completed, and whether or not a permit is required under this article) has,
from any cause, become a hazard to life or property or affects the safety,
use or stability of a public street or way or otherwise constitutes a public
nuisance, the owner of the property upon which such operation is located,
or other person or agent in control of said property, upon receipt of notice,
in writing, from the City Clerk shall, within 30 days of the date of the notice
or as directed in emergency situations, comply with such requirements of
this chapter as the city may direct or take such other action ordered by the
city to eliminate the hazard or nuisance or other danger to the public street
or way. Where compliance with the order of the city may not be possible
within such period and where public safety will be adversely affected, the
City Clerk may authorize Planning and Development to grant an extension
of time for a specified period for compliance.
§ 265-196. Fees.
A. Permit. In addition to any fees payable under any ordinance a permit
fee shall be paid pursuant to this chapter based upon quantity of
material handled or land area involved for each job site, even though
the same material may be handled in more than one type of operation.
The amount of fee shall be in accordance with the following table:
(1) Land reclamation project: $500 per year or fraction thereof.
(2) Transportation of material over city streets when not involving a
site: $100 per truck per year or fraction thereof.
(3) Other than included in Subsection A or A(2) above:
(a) Minimum filing fee: $50.
(b) Additional, based on quantity of material, totaled through each
range up to that applicable:
[1] Five hundred one to 1,000 cubic yards: $0.10 per yard.
[2] One thousand one to 2,500 cubic yards: $0.05 per yard.
[3] Two thousand five hundred one to 5,000 cubic yards: $0.03
per yard.
[4] Five thousand one to 7,500 cubic yards: $0.02 per yard.
[5] Over 7,501 cubic yards: $0.01 per yard.
(4) Permit modified: zero dollars.
B. Extraordinary costs. When, in the course of enforcing or complying with
the provisions of this chapter, any costs are incurred by the city for
§ 265-195 GREENSBURG CODE § 265-196
260:826
§ 265-197. Bonds and insurance.
inspection or testing beyond that normally anticipated and reasonable
as indicated in § 265-190C, the applicant shall be invoiced for the same
and shall render said amount within 30 days.
A. Performance bond. This bond is intended to ensure that the applicant
carries out and finishes the indicated and approved work. Failure to
finish, landscape or restore the land shall be prevented by use of this
bond by the city to mitigate any hazard to the public's interest and
safety left by the applicant. Hazards to be mitigated shall include but
not to be limited to avoidance of erosion; unnatural contours, such as
spoil piles, unstable cuts or embankments; and insufficient drainage
measures. This bond also may be known as a "restoration bond." Except
where clearly demonstrated by the applicant to the satisfaction of the
City Clerk that the operation if left incomplete will not create a hazard
to human life or endanger adjoining property or property at a higher or
lower level or any street improvement or any other public property, the
applicant shall file with the city prior to the issuance of the land
operations permit a performance bond for the benefit of the city, as in
the application for a land reclamation project. The City Clerk may
recognize that the special nature and extent of such operation, the selfimposed
protective methods and devices and the provisions of other
applicable regulatory laws may warrant different consideration and
may take this into account when reviewing the performance bond needs
for a land reclamation project. State or federal agencies shall be
exempted from the requirement of filing a bond unless the city finds
that a bond is required for adequate protection of the public.
[Amended 9-14-2015 by Ord. No. 2057]
(1) Execution. All bonds shall be executed by the owner of the property
where the work is to be undertaken and by a corporate surety
insurer authorized to do business in this commonwealth as surety,
or, in lieu thereof, the bond shall be in writing, accompanied by a
deposit in the amount of the bond or other surety, approved and
acceptable to the Director of Finance and the City Solicitor.
(2) Conditions. Every bond shall be conditioned upon compliance with
all the provisions of this chapter and all other applicable laws and
ordinances, compliance with the terms and conditions of the permit
and completion of all work contemplated under the permit within
the time limit specified in the permit. Planning and Development
may, for sufficient cause, extend the time limit specified in the
permit, but no such extension shall release the surety upon the
bond.
(3) Term. The term of each bond shall begin upon the date of filing and
shall remain in effect until the date of the issuance of the
completion certificate by the inspector. At said time for release of
bond and at issuance of the completion certificate, the permit
holder and/or owner shall provide a notorized statement and/or
§ 265-196 WARRANTLESS ARRESTS § 265-197
260:827
guarantee that all vegetation, as shown on the approved plans and
placed, shall be immediately replaced for a period of one year
growing season, including one winter.
(4) Coverage for completion of work and compliance with permit. In
the event of failure to complete the work or comply with all the
terms and conditions of the permit, the city may order the work or
part thereof to be completed as required by the permit. The surety
executing such bond or the person giving such deposit shall
continue to be firmly bound under a continuing obligation for the
payment of all necessary costs and expenses that may be incurred
or expended by the city in causing any and all such required work
to be done, and the surety or the depositor shall be considered to
assent to any lawful extensions of time within which to construct
and complete the work.
(5) Amount. The amount of bond shall be based in part upon the cost of
handling the quantity of material and in part upon the additional
amount equal to the cost of all construction work, drainage (both
surface and subsurface) or other protective devices, removal or
replacement of trees or other natural ground cover which may be
required. The amount of the bond shall equal 50% of the sum of the
two parts, as established by the applicant via presentation of valid
contracts or agreements or as established by the consulting
engineer utilizing the most current standard construction cost
indexes.
(6) Proportionate reduction as work is completed. When a substantial
portion of the required work has been completed to the satisfaction
of Planning and Development and/or consulting engineer and if the
completion of the remaining work is delayed due to conditions
beyond the control of the owner or the contractor, and no adverse
effects to the public's interest or safety are shown, Planning and
Development and/or consulting engineer may, at his discretion,
accept the completed portion of the work and consent to an
appropriate reduction of the bond to an amount estimated to be
adequate by the consulting engineer and Director of Finance to
ensure completion of the work remaining to be performed. In no
case shall the reduction be greater than an amount equal to 50% of
the original bond. Said bond reductions will only occur on
affirmative approval of the Council. [Amended 9-14-2015 by
Ord. No. 2057]
(7) Insurance. The applicant shall furnish to the city, together with the
application for a permit, a certificate showing standard form public
liability insurance against claims for damages for personal injury,
as well as claims for property damage, including damage to the city
streets or other public improvements, by blowing, drifting,
washing, sliding, flowing subsurface water or otherwise depositing
of matter which may arise from or out of performance of the work,
whether such performance is by himself, his contractor or
§ 265-197 GREENSBURG CODE § 265-197
260:828
§ 265-198. Enforcement; violations and penalties.
subcontractor or any person directly or indirectly employed by
him. Said insurance shall include protection against liability arising
from completed operations. Said insurance shall be written by
a legally chartered company and approved by the city and shall
insure the city, its officers, agents and employees against any loss
or liability which may arise during the performance of or which
may result from any work herein required to be performed. The
amounts of such insurance shall be as follows:
(a) Public liability insurance in an amount not less than
$1,000,000 for injuries, including wrongful death to any one
person, and subject to the same limit for each person, in an
amount not less than $2,000,000, on account of one accident.
(b) Property damage insurance in an amount not less than
$1,000,000 for damages on account of any one accident and in
an amount not less than $2,000,000 for damage on account of
all accidents.
(c) Excess insurance coverage on the above shall be required for
all operations in excess of 2,500 cubic yards or more than 1.5
acre involvement in an amount not less than $1,000,000.
A. Notice of violation. The consulting engineer and/or Planning and
Development shall serve a notice of violation order, by hand delivery or
certified mail, on the person responsible for any land operation in
violation of the provisions of this article or in violation of a permit or
certificate issued under the provisions of this article, and such order
shall direct the discontinuance of the illegal action or condition and the
abatement of the violation. [Amended 9-14-2015 by Ord. No. 2057]
B. Prosecution of the violation. If the notice of violation is not complied
with promptly, Planning and Development and/or consulting engineer
shall notify the Mayor, who shall request the legal counsel of the city to
institute the appropriate proceeding at law or in equity to restrain,
correct or abate such violation or to require the removal or termination
of the unlawful action in violation of the provisions of this article or of
the order or direction made pursuant hereto. [Amended 9-14-2015 by
Ord. No. 2057]
C. Penalty. Any person, firm or corporation violating any of the provisions
of this article shall, upon conviction in a summary proceeding thereof
before any District Justice of the city, be subject to a fine of not less than
$100 and not exceeding $500 and costs for any one offense, and, in
default of payment of said fine and costs, shall be subject to
imprisonment in the county jail or workhouse for a period not exceeding
90 days, or both. Each day's violation shall constitute a separate
offense. In the case of firms or associations, the penalty may be imposed
§ 265-197 WARRANTLESS ARRESTS § 265-198
260:829
§ 265-199. Appeals.
on the partners or members thereof and, in the case of a corporation,
upon the officers thereof.
D. Abatement of the violation. The imposition of penalties herein
prescribed shall not preclude the Mayor from instituting appropriate
action to prevent unlawful land operations or to restrain, correct or
abate a violation or to stop an illegal act or conduct of business or use in
or about any premises.
E. Stop-work order.
(1) Notice. Upon notice from Planning and Development and/or
consulting engineer that work on any land operations permit is
being prosecuted contrary to the provisions of this chapter, or in an
unsafe and dangerous manner, such work shall be immediately
stopped. The stop-work order shall be in writing and shall be given
to the owner, the permit holder, the owner's agent or the person
doing the work and shall state the conditions under which work
may be resumed. The site or premises shall also be posted with a
stop-work order. [Amended 9-14-2015 by Ord. No. 2057]
(2) Unlawful continuance. Any person who shall remove the posted
stop-work order or who shall continue any work on or about the site
or premises after having been served with a stop-work order,
except such work as he is directed to perform to remove a violation
or unsafe condition, shall be considered in violation of the
provisions of this chapter and proceeded against accordingly.
A. Application for appeal. The owner of any premises, the applicant or any
permit holder may appeal a decision of the Planning Director or their
designee in suspending or revoking a permit on the basis of the
following: [Amended 9-14-2015 by Ord. No. 2057]
(1) Alleged incorrect interpretation of the provisions of this chapter.
(2) The provisions of this chapter do not fully apply.
(3) That an equal or better form of construction can be used.
B. Review. Council shall undertake a review of the appeal within 30 days
after receipt of notice of appeal. Council may request information from
the appropriate agencies, applicant and the public if it so deems it
necessary.
C. Hearing and decision. After affording the applicant or his
representative the opportunity to present any or all material relating to
the work, Council shall, at its next regularly scheduled meeting or at a
duly advertised special meeting within 15 days after the thirty-day

260:830
§ 265-200. Specific standards; transportation of materials; land
reclamation.
stipulate the reasons and any conditions it deems necessary and be
mailed to the applicant within 10 days after the date of the decision.
[Amended 9-14-2015 by Ord. No. 2057]
D. Court review. An applicant or permit holder shall have the right to
appeal to any court of competent jurisdiction from any decision of
Council.
A. Scope. The following standards shall apply for land operations and
activities as set forth in this article, whether a permit is required or not
required. Additionally, those standards or requirements established in
the Zoning, Subdivision/Land Development and Construction Standards
Ordinances, as may be in effect at the time, shall apply to any work
performed pursuant to a permit as required herein.
B. Grading standards.
(1) Clearing and grubbing.
(a) Description. This work shall consist of the removal of all
objectionable material, rubbish, junk, trees, stumps, brush,
major root systems, downed timber, rotten wood and any
vegetation within the grading limits. The work shall also
include the disposal of the spoils in a satisfactory manner.
(b) Construction requirements. Grading operations shall not be
started in any area until the clearing and grubbing operations
have been completed, except that stumps may be removed in
excavation areas during the grading operations.
[1] Within areas where excavation is to be made, the area
shall be cleared and grubbed. All stumps and major root
mats shall be removed to a depth of not less than two feet
below the finished grade or the subgrade of any area to be
paved.
[2] Within areas where an embankment five feet or more in
depth is to be made, the area shall be cleared and grubbed
and stumps cut off as close to the ground as is practical but
not to exceed six inches above the ground surface. Stumps
shall not extend above the ground surface near the toe of
the embankment.
[3] Where the embankment is less than five feet in depth, the
area shall be cleared and grubbed to a depth of eight
inches below the existing ground surface for all areas
beneath the embankment or any stumps within 20 feet of
the edge of any proposed pavements. Beyond 20 feet, no
stumps shall extend above the existing ground surface.
§ 265-199 WARRANTLESS ARRESTS § 265-200
260:831
(2) Excavation requirements.
(a) Finished slope. The finished slope, or cut face, shall be rounded
at the top and shall not be steeper than two horizontal to one
vertical in soil and 1 1/2 to one in shale or rock, except under
one or more of the following conditions:
[1] The excavation is located so that a line having a slope of
two horizontal to one vertical and passing through any
portion of the cut face will be entirely inside the property
lines of the property on which the excavation is made.
[2] A written statement is provided bearing the signature and
seal of a registered professional engineer experienced in
soils engineering, certifying that he has inspected the site
and that the material in which the excavation is made is
sufficiently stable to sustain a slope steeper than the
requirements above. The statement must further certify
that said steeper slope will not endanger any property or
result in property damage. The statement must be
submitted with the application.
[3] A retaining wall or other approved support designed by a
registered professional engineer is provided to support the
face of the excavation. Planning and Development may,
upon recommendation of the consulting engineer, require
an excavation to be made with a cut face flatter in slope
than two horizontal to one vertical if the soil analysis has
indicated unstable soils or if field conditions indicate the
material in which the excavation is to be made is unusually
subject to erosion or if other conditions exist, under
applicable engineering practice, to make such flatter cut
slope necessary for stability and safety. Additionally, in
residential areas, it is to be encouraged that flatter slopes
than provided herein be constructed. [Amended
9-14-2015 by Ord. No. 2057]
(b) Trench excavation. Where trench excavation is required for the
installation of underground facilities, the steepness of the cut
face excavation shall conform with good engineering practice.
The work shall include such trench bracing, sheathing or
shoring necessary to perform and protect the excavation as
required for safety and conformance to governing laws.
(c) Excavation adjacent to footings, foundations or structures.
Excavations adjacent to any footing, foundation or structure
shall not extend below the angle of repose or natural slope of
the soil under the nearest point of the same unless such
footing, foundation or structure is first properly underpinned
or protected against settlement.
§ 265-200 GREENSBURG CODE § 265-200
260:832
(3) Embankment requirements.
(a) Materials. Materials for embankment construction may consist
of soil, granular material, shale, rock or random material, such
as old concrete and brick. Soil and granular materials shall be
readily placed and compacted in loose, eight-inch layers; other
permitted materials shall be readily placed and compacted in
lifts or material size not exceeding 24 inches. The material
shall be reasonably free of organic material, topsoil, coal or
coal blossom and any other material considered unsuitable by
the consulting engineer. The material shall not be placed when
frozen and shall have a moisture content which shall ensure
satisfactory compaction.
(b) Preparation of foundation area.
[1] The embankment foundation area shall be cleared and
grubbed in accordance with Subsection B(1) of this
section. The topsoil shall be removed and disposed of or
stockpiled for later use. Areas containing material that is
excessively wet or compressible shall be undercut.
[2] Foundation areas that have an existing ground slope
steeper than five horizontal to one vertical shall be
benched and, if necessary, subsurface drainage provided
in a manner designed by a registered professional
engineer and approved by the consulting engineer.
(c) Placement and compaction. The embankment shall be
constructed in a manner that complies with the requirements
of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Department of
Transportation as described in Publication No. 408, or as
approved by the consulting engineer.
(4) Drainage.
(a) Accommodation of surface and subsurface water. Sufficient
drainage shall be provided to accommodation surface and
subsurface water during any grading operation and after its
completion in order to prevent additional water from flowing
onto adjacent property or from unduly increasing the load on
sewage or drainage facilities. Facilities in the form pipe,
pervious granular layers, buried granular trenches, etc., shall

of any excavation or the sloping face of any fill. When
necessary for protection of critical areas during construction,
diversion ditches or terraces shall be provided,
(d) Design of drainage facilities. Drainage facilities shall be of
such design as to carry storm and surface waters to the nearest
street storm drain or natural watercourse approved by the
inspector as a safe place to deposit and receive such waters.

provided in connection with any fill to avoid the development of
hydrostatic pressures.
(5) Protection of adjacent property and utilities.

easement line. The horizontal distance from either the toe or
top of the excavation or fill slope line shall be five feet or 1/2 of
the vertical height of the fill or excavation from any adjoining
property or easement line, whichever is greater, but such
distance need not exceed 10 feet. The consulting engineer
shall advise Planning and Development, who shall have the
authority to modify this requirement in instances where it is
demonstrated that such modification is needed to secure
desirable interrelationships between properties and will not
result in a condition detrimental to the adjacent property.
[Amended 9-14-2015 by Ord. No. 2057]
(c) Support and protection of public utilities and public streets.
Adequate methods shall be employed to provide proper
protection from damage resulting from the operation for all
public and private utilities, whether on the surface, beneath
the ground surface or overhead, and, when necessary, for the
repair, replacement or relocation of such utilities. The surface
and other facilities of public streets shall be fully restored by
the holder of the permit in the event of such damage. The

260:834
owner shall correct any damage to the utility before the city
issues the completion certificate.

the inspector, create a hazard to persons or property unless
adequately fenced, the owner shall construct such fences or
guardrails as safeguards to persons using adjoining property
(public or private).
(6) Erosion and sediment control. The requirements and guidelines of
the Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook of Westmoreland

operational schedules, which schedules delineating those
areas shall be submitted with the application.
(b) Interim protective vegetation. Protective vegetation and/or
mulching or artificial cover shall be established on all areas
where soil is to be exposed for more than 20 days, including
topsoil stockpiles and borrow pits, excluding rights-of-way for
cartway or utility line development or the vehicle paths for
ingress, egress and regress on the site.
(c) Preservation of natural features. In order to prevent the
denuding of the landscape, wherever practical, large trees and
other natural features which constitute physical, aesthetic and
economic assets to the community shall be preserved and shall
be protected during groundmoving operations, except where
they would intrude into or beneath pavement, shoulders or
swales or where sight distance requirements dictate.
(d) Final ground cover. Permanent final vegetation or other ground
cover shall be installed as soon as practical in the
development. Upon completion of the operation, the entire site
shall be ground covered and provided with drainage facilities
so as to avoid excessive erosion, sedimentation and storm
runoff. The city may require this work to be done in accord with
specifications of a registered landscape architect, an
experienced nurseryman or other person qualified in this field.
(7) Retaining walls.
(a) If a retaining wall is constructed to satisfy a requirement of
this article, a building permit as provided for by other city
regulations shall not be required. The grading permit will
apply to the retaining wall, and the requirements for
inspection, etc., as stated herein, will govern. Other
§ 265-200 WARRANTLESS ARRESTS § 265-200
260:835
construction within the site beyond the scope of this article
involving the construction of a retaining wall must comply with
the requirements of Chapter 114, Building Construction, or
other ordinances that may be in effect at that time.

vertical face of the wall shall be three feet zero inches back
from the adjoining property, except as follows:
[1] A special exception to this requirement may be applied for
and granted by the city if it can be satisfactorily
demonstrated that such a variance is necessary to ensure
normal use of the property, i.e., for a sideline driveway.
[2] The requirement of this subsection may also be waived
when the proposed retaining wall is a joint venture
between adjacent property owners and appropriate
documents so stating are filed with the application for a
permit.
C. Transportation of materials.
(1) Approval of City of Greensburg. The proposed use of streets or
thoroughfares for the transportation of material in excess of the
provisions of § 265-191 for disposal or fill purposes shall have the
approval of the city. The bonding and insurance requirements in
§ 265-197 of this article shall apply.
(2) Size and type of vehicles and hours of operation. The size and type
of vehicles and the hours of operation shall be as approved by

required as necessary on site at any transport origin and
destination point within the city. All vehicles shall be scraped and
cleaned before leaving the site.

down or other treatment before leaving the site, to ensure that
§ 265-200 GREENSBURG CODE § 265-200
260:836
during transit no material being transported shall blow or spill over
the public or private property.
(5) Street cleaning. In the event that earth, dust, powder, mud, sludge
or any other debris from the operation involved in the permit
accumulates in or on any street, catch basin or sewer line, the
transporter shall remove the same immediately upon notification
by the city.
D. Land reclamation project.
(1) Application.
(a) An owner or lessee holding a lease, the unexpired term of
which is more than five years from the date of filing of the
application, may, in filing for a required land operations permit,
choose to undertake or conduct a land reclamation project, as
defined by this chapter. In such instance, the application shall
contain such additional information as may be deemed
necessary by the city to describe properly the nature and
extent of the operation and the program.
(b) Other requirements of this article shall apply, but the city
recognizes that the special nature and scope of the operation,
any self-imposed protective methods and devices and the
provisions of other applicable regulatory laws may warrant
different considerations and shall take this into account when
applying the standards and when waiving submission of data
under § 265-191.
(2) Operational requirements.
(a) In addition to complying with other applicable requirements of
this chapter or any other ordinance, the operation shall be
conducted in such a manner as to provide reasonable
protection to surrounding properties and uses against
detriment from emission odor, dust, smoke, noise, gas fumes,
cinders, vibration, refuse matter, water-carried waste and the
like.
(b) In connection with the proposed operations, the city may
require the installation, operation and maintenance of such
methods and devices as may, in its opinion, be reasonably
required to prevent or reduce such emission and may impose
such conditions regarding the extent of open space between
any portions of the proposed operation involving such
emissions as will tend to prevent or reduce injury to
surrounding property and neighborhood which might result
from the proposed operation.
(c) The City of Greensburg may also limit the extent and hours of
any operation, depending upon the specific site of such
§ 265-200 WARRANTLESS ARRESTS § 265-200
260:837
operation and its relation to surrounding properties and
structures. This limit shall be imposed so as to provide a
reasonable degree of protection. The city may prohibit such
operation at a particular location if, on review and
recommendation of the consulting engineer, it would be unsafe
or dangerous to surrounding properties.

sprayed in accordance with specifications of local public health
authorities to eliminate breeding places for mosquitoes and
other insects.

gradient is greater than 10% and two feet in areas where
the gradient is 10% or less.
[2] The program for the exploitation phase shall demonstrate
the feasibility of the operation without creating a hazard or
causing damage to other properties. This program shall
also indicate the different stages of exploitation, where
and how traffic on and from the development will be
handled, where equipment will be operating, the location
and dimensions of structures and the manner in which
safeguards will be provided, including those for
preventing access by children and other unauthorized
persons to dangerous areas. The final stage of the program
shall indicate how the project is to be finished in accord
with the plan for reuse.
(b) Reuse phase. The program for the reuse phase shall indicate
how the property is to be left in a form suitable for reuse for
purposes permissible in the zoning district in which it is
located so as to relate such reuses to uses existing, proposed or
intended for surrounding properties. Among items to be
§ 265-200 GREENSBURG CODE § 265-200
260:838
§ 265-201. Conflict with other provisions.
This chapter shall be construed as being in addition to the provisions of any
other regulatory ordinance. If any regulations herein are in conflict with any
other regulatory ordinance, the provisions establishing the more restrictive
requirements shall apply.

An environmental impact statement is required before beginning any
applicable work under the provisions of this article.
included in such program are proposed circulation patterns in
and around the site, the treatment of exposed soil or subsoil,
including measures to be taken to replace topsoil or establish
vegetation in worked-over areas in order to make the property
suitable for reuse and treatment of slopes to prevent erosion.
(c) Annual stage development schedule. The applicant shall
submit an initial schedule delineating the scope and extent of
the operation, the estimated time for completion and the
portion to be accomplished during the first year of the
program, and, annually thereafter, the applicant shall submit
such a schedule projecting the intended accomplishment for at
least one year ahead. Any change in schedule for foreseeable
or anticipated delays shall be reported promptly to the
inspector, with reasons therefor, and a proper adjustment in
plans shall be made. Unforeseeable delays or departures from
the schedule shall be justified to the satisfaction of the city.
Major departures from the schedule shall be considered as
changes in plans and shall render the entire application
subject to review and approval by the Council.
(4) Referral to Planning Commission. The program and illustrative
plans for development of the site shall be referred to the Planning
Commission for report and recommendation as to relationship of
the development to zoning and other planning aspects.
(5) Permits and certificates of completion. Permits and certificates of
completion shall be issued in accord with the provisions of
§§ 265-191 through 265-194, except that an annual permit fee shall

intensive or obnoxious activities. This regulation aims to preserve
neighborhood integrity while fostering a positive and wholesome image
for visitors from out of the area.
