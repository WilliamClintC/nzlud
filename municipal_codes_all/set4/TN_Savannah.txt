PREFACE
The Savannah Municipal Code contains the codification and revision of the
ordinances of the City of Savannah, Tennessee. By referring to the historical
citation appearing at the end of each section, the user can determine the origin of
each particular section. The absence of a historical citation means that the section
was added by the codifier. The word “modified” in the historical citation indicates
significant modification of the original ordinance.
The code is arranged into titles, chapters, and sections. Related matter is kept
together, so far as possible within the same title. Each section number is complete
within itself, containing the title number, the chapter number, and the section of
the chapter of which it is a part. Specifically, the first digit, followed by a hyphen,
identifies the title number. The second digit identifies the chapter number, and the
last two digits identify the section number. For example, title 2, chapter 1, section
6, is designated as section 2-106.
By utilizing, the table of contents and the analysis preceding each title and chapter
of the code, together with the cross references and explanations included as
footnotes, the user should locate all the provisions in the code relating to any
question that might arise. However, the user should note that most of the
administrative ordinances (e.g. Annual Budget, Zoning Map Amendments, Tax
Assessments, etc.) do not appear in the code. Likewise, ordinances that have been
passed since the last update of the code do not appear here. Therefore, the user
should refer to the city’s ordinances.
Following this preface is an outline of the ordinance adoption procedures, if any,
prescribed by the city’s charter.

location and will otherwise comply with zoning laws. (1988 Code, § 2-206)
8-15
8-207. Sale and storage of beer.
(1) When sale or storage of beer as defined herein is used in this chapter,
the same will apply to sale for the purpose of “off-premises” consumption only and

may be either sold hot or cold. All beer sold shall be placed in bags before taken
from the premises. Beer shall not be kept outside the building for sale.

sales. The secretary of the beer board, or whomsoever he may designate, may
make periodic audits at any beer establishment to determine compliance under this
section.
(6) It is the intent of this chapter that no business establishment will be
allowed to sell beer under the guise of placing a few food items in the establishment
to qualify as a grocery store or convenience food store, in that it is against the intent
of this chapter to allow an establishment to be a mere beer outlet.
To insure that the intent and purpose of § 8-207(5) and (6) are more
thoroughly regulated to reflect the intent and purpose of the permit and that this
amendment will not only make it clear to the intent of § 8-206 (5) and (6). That

applicant will file for a beer permit within forty-five (45) days prior to making
application for a beer permit and shall notify the board by written certified mail
that said applicant will file for a beer permit within forty- five (45) days of the date
of the letter. Application may be made prior to conclusion of the forty-five (45) days
8-16
to allow normal processing of information during the stated forty-five (45) days. One
the permit is issued under this procedure, said permit holder will still be subject to
periodic audits to determine compliance with § 8-207(5). Any grocery/beer
establishment whether new or old in existence violated the seventy-five percent
(75%) grocery requirements will be subject to suspension as fixed by the beer board

revoked unless extreme circumstances show a reason that the permit should not be
revoked. (1988 Code, § 2-207, as amended by Ord. #666-7-2004, Sept.

the enforcement of this chapter, including this section. Violators shall be
prosecuted in the city court and if licensed, complaints may be filed against them

8-209. Conditions precedent to the issuance of permits. It shall be
unlawful for any person, corporation, etc., to sell, store for sale, distribute for sale,

8-20

penalty not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) for any other
offense.

penalty not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) for each offense

suspension, the holder shall have seven (7) days within which to pay
the civil penalty before the revocation or suspension shall be
imposed. If the civil penalty is paid within that time, the revocation or
suspension shall be deemed withdrawn.

includes knowledge which a parent or legal guardian should reasonably be expected
to have concerning the whereabouts of a minor in that parent's legal custody. The

directly between the minor's home and place of employment. This
exception shall also apply if the minor is in a public place during
the curfew hours in the course of the minor's employment. To come
within this exception, the minor must be carrying written evidence
of employment which is issued by the employer.
(d) When returning home by a direct route from (and within thirty (30)
minutes of the termination of) a school activity or an activity of a
religious or other voluntary association, or a place of public
entertainment, such as a movie, play or sporting event. This exception
does not apply beyond 1:00 A.M.;

designated time for a described purpose including place or origin and
destination. A copy of such communication, or the record thereof,
an appropriate notation of the time it was received and of the names
and addresses of such parent or legal, guardian and minor constitute
evidence of qualification under this exception; if errands are necessary
during curfew, the parents or legal guardians will comply with this
paragraph for such activity.

States Constitution, such as the free exercise of religion, freedom of

in good faith interstate travel.

automobile accident, or any situation requiring immediate action to
prevent serious bodily injury, loss of life or property.

residence.
(i) When a minor is married or has his disability of minority removed
by a proper court order. Each of the foregoing exceptions, and the
limitations are severable.

shall act in one (1) of the following ways:
(a) Take the child to the child’s home and warn and counsel the
parents or legal guardians;
(b) Issue a summons to the child and parent or legal guardians to
appear at the county juvenile court.

disposition.
(d) A minor violating the provisions of this section shall commit an
unruly act, disposition of which shall be governed pursuant to
Tennessee Code Annotated, title 37.

business establishment who knowingly allows a minor to violate the
provisions of this chapter, commits a Class C misdemeanor and shall
be fined no more than fifty dollars ($50.00) for each offense; each
violation of the provisions of this chapter shall constitute a
separate offense, said latter offenses of such persons shall be
before the county juvenile court, which court shall receive all
fines and costs under this chapter. It is a defense to prosecution under
this section that the owner, operator or employee of an
establishment promptly notify the police department that a
minor is present on the premises of the establishment during curfew
hours and refuses to leave.
(6) Before taking any enforcement action under this chapter a police
officer shall ask the offender's age and reason for being in a public place during
curfew. The officer shall not take any action under this section unless the officer
reasonably believes that a violation of this curfew is occurring and that, based on
any responses and other circumstances, no defenses as provided by subsection (4)
herein apply.
(7) (a) If any provision hereof is determined to be invalid under any
law, then such shall not render the entire chapter null and void.
(b) Any person granted custody of a minor or minors by court order
shall be deemed a custodial parent or legal guardian within the
meaning or purposes of this chapter. "Parent" means a person who is a
natural parent adopted parent or stepparent.

regulations of the department of public utilities and the board of commissioner
governing the instillation, servicing, and repairing of gas systems, gas burning
facilities, and equipment, or such permit may be revoked for allowing or permitting
said work to be carried on in an unworkmanlike manner by those employed by or

work by said installing agency. (1988 Code, § 4-506)

valid permit issued by the utility director as herein above provided. The
department of public utilities, the superintendent thereof, nor any employee of said
department, shall not connect the gas piping or system in such building to the gas
system unless the same has been installed by qualified installing agency as
provided for in this chapter.

the gas system of the City of Savannah, unless such person, firm, or corporation is a
duly qualified gas installing agency, as herein provided, and the fact that such work
has been done by other than an installing agency, qualified as herein provided, shall
be sufficient to hold and render said property owner responsible for the violation of
this chapter. (1988 Code, § 4-510)

implementing it, and shall endeavor with their advice to work out programs of
voluntary compliance and of enforcement. (1988 Code, § 4-709)
12-710. Enforcement.
(1) Any person who claims to have been injured by a discriminatory
housing practice or who believes that he will be irrevocably injured by a
discriminatory housing practice that is about to occur (hereafter "person aggrieved")
may file a complaint with the Mayor of Savannah. Complaints shall be in writing
and shall contain such information and be in such form as the mayor requires. Upon
receipt of such a complaint, the mayor shall furnish a copy of the same to the person
or persons who allegedly committed or about to commit the alleged discriminatory
housing practice. Within thirty days after receiving a complaint, or within thirty
days after the expiration of any period of reference under subsection (3), the mayor
shall investigate the complaint and give notice in writing to the person aggrieved
whether he intends to resolve it. If the mayor decides to resolve the complaint, he
shall proceed to try to eliminate or correct the alleged discriminatory housing
12-21
practice by informal methods of conference, conciliation, and persuasion. Nothing
said or done in the course of such informal endeavors may be made public or used as
evidence in a subsequent proceeding under this chapter without the written consent
of the persons concerned. Any employee of the mayor who shall make public any
information in violation of this provision shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor
and upon conviction thereof shall be fined not more than one thousand dollars
($1,000.00) or imprisoned not more than one (1) year.
(2) A complaint under subsection (1) shall be filed within one hundred
eighty (180) days after the alleged discriminatory housing practice occurred.
Complaints shall be in writing and shall state the facts upon which the allegations
of a discriminatory housing practice are based. Complaints may be reasonably and
fairly amended at any time. A respondent may file an answer to the complaint
against him and with the leave of the mayor, which shall be granted whenever it
would be reasonable and fair to do so, may amend his answer at any time. Both
complaints and answers shall be verified.
(3) If the mayor has been unable to obtain voluntary compliance within
thirty (30) days of the complaint, the person aggrieved may, within thirty (30) days
hereafter commence a civil action in any appropriate court, against the respondent
named in the complaint, to enforce the rights granted or protected by this chapter,
insofar as such rights relate to the subject of the complaint. If the court finds that a
discriminatory housing practice has occurred or is about to occur, the court may
enjoin the respondent from engaging in such practice or order such affirmative
action as may be appropriate.
(4) In any proceeding brought pursuant to this section, the burden of proof
shall be on the complainant.
(5) Whenever an action filed by an individual shall come to trial, the
mayor shall immediately terminate all efforts to obtain voluntary compliance.
(1988 Code, § 12-710)
12-711. Investigations; subpoenas; giving of evidence.
(1) In conducting an investigation the mayor shall have access at all
reasonable times to premises, records, documents, individuals, and other evidence
or possible sources of evidence and may examine, record, and copy such materials
and take and record the testimony or statements of such persons as are reasonable
necessary for the furtherance of the investigation: Provided, however, that the
mayor first complies with the provisions of the Fourth Amendment relating to
unreasonable searches and seizures. The mayor may issue subpoenas to compel his
access to or the production of such materials, or the appearance of such persons,
and may issue interrogatories to a respondent, to the same extent and subject to the
same limitations as would apply if the subpoenas or interrogatories were issued or
served in aid of a civil action in the United States district court for the district in
which the investigation is taking place. The mayor may administer oaths.
(2) Upon written application to the mayor, a respondent shall be entitled
to the issuance of a reasonable number of subpoenas by and in the name of the
mayor to the same extent and subject to the same limitations as subpoenas issued
by the mayor himself. Subpoenas issued at the request of a respondent shall show
12-22
on their face the name and address of such respondent and shall state that they
were issued at his request.
(3) Witness summoned by a subpoena of the mayor shall be entitled to the
same witness and mileage fees as are witnesses in proceedings in the United States
district courts. Fees payable to a witness summoned by a subpoena issued at the
request of a respondent shall be paid by him.
(4) Within five (5) days after service of a subpoena upon any person, such
person may petition the mayor to revoke or modify the subpoena. The mayor shall
grant the petition if he finds that the subpoena requires appearance or attendance
at an unreasonable time or place, that it requires production of evidence which does
not relate to any matter under investigation, that it does not describe with
sufficient particularity the evidence to be produced, that compliance would be
unduly onerous, or for other good reason.
(5) In case of contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena, the mayor or other
person at whose request it was issued may petition for its enforcement in the
municipal or state court for the district in which the person to whom the subpoena
was addressed resides, was served, or transacts business.
(6) Any person who willfully fails or neglects to attend and testify or to
answer any lawful inquiry or to produce records, documents or other evidence, if in
his power to do so, in obedience to the subpoena or lawful order of the mayor shall
be fined not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or imprisoned not more
than one (1) year, or both. Any person who, with intent thereby to mislead the
mayor, shall make or cause to be made any false entry or statement or fact in any
report, account, record, or other document submitted to the mayor pursuant to his
subpoena or other order, or shall willfully neglect or fail to make or cause to be
made full, true, and correct entries in such reports, accounts, records, or other
documents, or shall willfully mutilate, alter, or by any other means falsify any
documentary evidence, shall be fined not more than one thousand dollars
($1,000.00) or imprisoned not more than one (1) year, or both.
(7) The city attorney shall conduct all litigation in which the mayor
participates as a party or as amicus pursuant to this chapter. (1988 Code,§ 4-711)
12-712. Enforcement by private persons.
(1) The rights granted by §§ 12-703, 12-704, 12-705, and 12-706 may be
enforced by civil action in state or local courts of general jurisdiction. A civil action
shall be commenced within one hundred and eighty (180) days after the alleged
discriminatory housing practice occurred: Provided, however, that the court shall
continue such civil case brought pursuant to this section or § 12-710(4) from time to
time before bringing it to trial or renting dwellings; or
(2) Any person because he is or has been, or in order to intimidate such
person or any other person or any other person or any class of persons from:
(a) Participating, without discrimination on account of race, color,
religion, sex, or national origin, in any of the activities, services,
organizations or facilities described in subsection (15)(a); or
12-23
(b) Affording another person or class of persons opportunity or
protection so to participate; or
(3) Any citizen because he is or has been, or in order to discourage such
citizen or any other citizen from lawfully aiding or encouraging other persons to
participate, without discrimination on account of race, color, religion, sex, or
national origin, in any of the activities, services, organizations or facilities described
in subsection (15)(a), or participating lawfully in speech or peaceful assembly
opposing any denial of the opportunity to so participate shall be fined not more than
one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or imprisoned not more than one (1) year, or both;
and if bodily injury results shall be fined not more than ten thousand dollars
($10,000.00), or imprisoned not more than ten (10) years, or both; and if death
results shall be subject to imprisonment for any term of years or for life. (1988 Code,

a conspicuous place on premises affected by the complaint or order. A copy of such
complaint or order shall also be filed for record in the Register's Office of Hardin

13-311. Enjoining enforcement of orders. Any person affected by an
order issued by the public officer served pursuant to this chapter may file a bill in
chancery court for an injunction restraining the public officer from carrying out the
provisions of the order, and the court may, upon the filing of such suit, issue a
temporary injunction restraining the public officer pending the final disposition of
the cause; provided, however, that within sixty (60) days after the posting and
service of the order of the public officer, such person shall file such bill in the court.
The remedy provided herein shall be the exclusive remedy and no person affected by

regulation requirements, including but not limited to setbacks and frontage on a
public street. This section shall not apply to multi-family developments having
separate clusters of housing units, nor shall this section apply to shopping centers
developed as an integrated whole. (1988 Code, § 11-303)

designed for additional users. All proposals for a new telecommunications tower
shall demonstrate, through documentation, that no existing towers within a one
mile radius of the proposed tower will accommodate a new antenna array for one or
more of the following reasons:
(a) The planned antenna array equipment would exceed the structural
capacity of all existing or approved towers and existing utility
structures and said owners and structures cannot be upgraded at a
reasonable cost.

14-12
a 4 foot wide landscaping strip around the perimeter of the security fence. The
landscaping strip shall be installed for the permanent year round protection of
adjacent property owners by visually shielding the contents at the base of the tower
from adjoining property owners. The landscaping strip shall consist of a
combination of trees, shrubs, vines and other ground covers that are expected to
grow to a height of 8 feet. The landscaping provisions of this section may be varied
or reduced if the proposed plan provides for unique and innovative landscaping
treatment or there are existing physical features that meet the intent and purpose
of this section. (Ord #810-4-2015, May 2015)

not have workers that remain at the site on a full or part-time
basis. (Ord #810-4-2015, May 2015)
(15) Lighting
(a) Towers - All towers shall be lighted when required by the
FAA (Federal Aviation Administration).
(b) Structures - Outside lighting of structures, if required for safety
and security purposes, shall be of a sensory fashion in which
illumination offers only when the site is approached. The lighting
shall be arranged to minimize glare and reflection on adjacent
properties and public streets. (Ord #810-4-2015, May 2015)
(16) Removal of Obsolete Towers - Any telecommunications
tower that is no longer in use for its original purpose shall be removed at the
owner’s expense. The owner shall provide the Town with a copy of the notice of
intent to cease operations that must be submitted to the FCC and shall be given
ninety (90) days from the date of ceasing operations to remove the obsolete tower
and any accessory structure(s). In the case of multiple operators sharing a single
tower, this provision shall not become effective until all users cease operations. (Ord
#810-4-2015, May 2015)
14-315. Standards for Automobile repair, services, and garages,
appliance stores, building materials and furniture establishments. Storage
for vehicular craft awaiting repair or vehicular craft parts, appliances such as
refrigerators and stoves, used furniture, building materials, etc. shall be stored
indoors or in a storage area fully screened from any public or private street and
from all adjoining property by an opaque fence approved by city staff and on the
same lot as the established principal use. Vehicles storage for less than 10 days

14-506. Planned Development Districts.
(1) Administration. Any request pertaining to the establishment of a
PUD zoning district or changes to an existing PUD ordinance shall be considered an
amendment to the zoning chapter, and shall be administered and processed in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
(2) Purpose. The purpose of this section is to encourage the development
of various type planned developments under a single master plan, where the
traditional density, bulk, spacing and use regulations of all other zoning
designations, which may be useful in protecting the character of substantially
developed areas, may impose inappropriate and unduly rigid restrictions upon the
development of parcels or areas which lend themselves to a unified, planned
approach. These districts are intended to promote flexibility in site planning and
structure location, to facilitate the provision of utilities and circulation systems, as
well as to preserve the natural and scenic features of the parcel. All planned
developments should be designed to ensure that the following general goals are
achieved:
(a) The proposed development shall be of such design that will
efficiently use available land and will protect and preserve, to the
greatest extent possible, natural features of the land such as trees,
streams, and topographic features.
14-28
(b) The development will be located in an area where transportation,
police and fire protection, schools and other community facilities and
public utilities, including public water and sewer service, are or will be
available and adequate for the uses and densities proposed. The
applicant may, where appropriate, make provisions for such facilities
or utilities, which are not presently available.
(3) Statement of intent.
(a) To encourage the development of residential and/or nonresidential
communities which provide a full range of harmonious land
uses, including multiple residential types, along with supporting
recreational, religious, and educational facilities to serve
residents of the district at various densities.
(b) To promote flexibility in site planning and structure location that
facilitates the provision and use of efficient circulation and utility
systems, and preservation of natural and scenic features, resulting in
diversity of scale, style and details that foster a strong sense of
community.
(c) To permit the development of such communities where there is a
demand for housing, as well as supporting businesses and other
services, and adequate where community facilities and infrastructure
are existing or are planned in the city.
(d) To provide a mechanism for evaluating alternative zoning
regulations proposed with each application on its own merit,
emphasizing that these provisions are not to be used to circumvent the
intent or use of conventional zoning classifications set forth in this
article, but to permit innovative and creative design of communities in
the City of Savannah.
(4) Regulatory effects.
(a) Consideration of a request for approval of a Planned Unit
Development (PUD) is based upon submission of a concept
development plan. The concept development plan consists of
both visual and written representations of the proposed layout and/or
design of the planned development, including alternative zoning
regulations.
(b) Approval of a request to rezone a specific parcel or tract of land to
Planned Unit Development (PUD) constitutes a change in the city's
zoning map and zoning requirements applicable to those parcels
included in the rezoning request.
(c) No action of the board of zoning appeals shall be required in the
approval of a PUD or PURD.
(d) Wherever the approved concept development plan and
accompanying documents conflict with provisions in the city's zoning
ordinance and land development regulations, provisions of the concept
development plan as approved by the city commission shall supersede.
All land development requirements of the City of Savannah not
specifically addressed by the concept development plan apply.
14-29
(e) Transfer of ownership of a parcel or tract of land zoned planned
unit development does not invalidate the regulatory effect of the
approved rezoning, including the concept development plan.
(f) No tract of land may be considered for or approved as a planned
development unless such tract is under the single ownership of a
landowner. For the purpose of this subchapter, a landowner may be a
person, partnership, corporation, association or any other legal entity
entitled to own property. The holder of a written option to
purchase, a party purchaser to a contract for the sale of real
property contingent upon the success of a PUD application for the
property or any governmental agency shall be considered landowners
for the purpose of this section. Unless otherwise provided as a
condition of approval of the PUD, the landowner of an adopted PUD
may divide and transfer parts of such development. The transferee
shall complete each section and use and maintain it in strict
conformance with the final site plan or subdivision plat.
(5) Development and staging. The expeditious construction of any
planned development authorized under these provisions shall be undertaken to
assist in the assurance of the full completion of the development in accordance with
the approved preliminary site plan and subsequent approved final site plan.
(a) Start of development.
(i) In the absence of an approved phasing plan, an application
for approval of a final site plan(s) for the entire planned
development shall be submitted for review by the planning
commission within two (2) years from and after the date of the
action approving a preliminary site plan. Failure to comply with
this provision may result in the expiration of the previously
approved preliminary site plan.
(ii) Within one (1) year from and after the date of the action
approving the final site plan(s), actual construction shall have
commenced in such development on the property that is the
subject of an approved final site plan(s). Actual construction is
defined to include the placing of construction materials in a
permanent position and fastened permanently or extensive
grading, including demolition or removal of existing structures
necessary for the development. If actual construction is not
commenced within this one (1) year period, the final site
plan(s), in concurrence with the preliminary site plan, may be
terminated as provided herein.
(b) Completion period. The Savannah Planning Commission may
recommend and the city commission may establish a reasonable period
of time, which may include a phasing plan, for the completion of the
planned development at the time the preliminary site plan is approved.
It is contemplated that several final site plans for different portions of
the property encompassed in the preliminary site plan will be
submitted for approval from time to time.
14-30
(i) If the development staff determines that no actual
construction has begun in the planned development within the
time period specified herein, the city commission may in its
discretion terminate the final site plan, along with the
preliminary site plan, by giving written notice to the applicant,
and the final site plan, along with the preliminary site plan,
shall be of no further effect.
(ii) Upon the request of the applicant and review of the
recommendation of the planning commission, the city
commission may extend for a reasonable time, not to exceed
one (1) year, the period for the commencement of actual
construction of the planned development or of the
improvements contemplated by the subject final site plan.
The planning commission and city commission may consider
such request before or after the expiration of the time periods
set forth herein. If a final site plan, along with the
preliminary site plan, is terminated under the provisions of this
section, the development director shall remove the planned
development designation from the official zoning map as to the
appropriate property and shall file a notice of revocation with
the recorded preliminary site plan and final site plan. The
zoning regulations applicable before the development was
approved shall then be in effect as to the balance of the
property encompassed within the preliminary site plan and
for which no construction has commenced within the time
periods provided herein.
(c) Staging of development. The city commission may elect to permit
the staging of development, in which case, the following provisions
shall be compiled with:
(i) Each stage shall be so planned and so related to existing
surrounding and available facilities and services that failure to
proceed to the subsequent stages will not have an adverse
impact on the development or its surroundings at any stage of
the development. The development staff shall review any
proposed phasing plan and recommend to the planning
commission a plan for the phasing and recommended
construction of improvements, including site improvements,
streets, surface and subsurface drainage, water lines, sewer
lines, parking areas, landscaping, plantings and screening.
(ii) The commencement of actual construction of any stage of
the planned development shall be governed by the provisions of
subsection (5) (a).
(iii) After commencement of actual construction, the
development director shall review all applications for building
permits. Only such building permits that are in compliance with
the overall development phasing program shall be issued. The
14-31
development director shall review, from time to time, the
progress of all construction and compare it to the overall
development phasing program. If the development director
determines that the rate of construction of residential units or
non-residential structures substantially differs from the
phasing program, the development director may issue such
orders to the developer as are deemed necessary and upon
continued violation of this subsection may suspend the
developer from further construction until compliance is
confirmed.
(6) Modifications. All requirements included in this article may be
modified by the city commission as part of approval of a planned unit development
if it is found that actions, designs or solutions proposed by the applicant, although
not literally in accord with applicable regulations, will satisfy public purposes to at
least a comparable degree.
(7) District size and location. When mapped, a PUD district shall be
located:
(a) With limited direct access to primary transportation routes
within the city;
(b) In areas served by public water and sewer facilities; and
(c) In areas where supporting business and other services are
existing
or planned (if not to be included within the proposed planned
development).
(8) Community types/land use mix. The character of a planned
community is to be defined by the proportional mix of land uses depicted on the
approved concept development plan. The land use mix of each type of planned
community should generally contain a mix comparable to the following:

partitions shall comply with the provisions of Article V,
Section B.
4. Standards for Manufactured Homes and Recreational
Vehicles
(a) All manufactured homes placed, or substantially
improved, on:
(1) individual lots or parcels,
(2) in expansions to existing manufactured home
parks or subdivisions, or
(3) in new or substantially improved manufactured
home parks or subdivisions, must meet all the
requirements of new construction.
(b) All manufactured homes placed or substantially

(d) In all approximate A Zones require that all new
subdivision proposals and other proposed developments
(including proposals for manufactured home parks and
subdivisions) greater than 50 lots or 5 acres, whichever is
the lesser, include within such proposals Base Flood
Elevation data (See Article V, Section E).
(e) Standards for Special Flood Hazard Areas with
Established Base Flood Elevations and With Floodways
Designated. Located within the Special Flood Hazard
Areas established in Article III, Section B, are areas
designated as floodways. A floodway may be an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters,
debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must
remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the
discharge of the base flood without increased flood
heights and velocities. Therefore, the following
provisions shall apply:
14-69
1. Encroachments are prohibited, including
earthen fill material, new construction, substantial
improvements or other development within the
regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted
however, provided it is demonstrated through
hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in
accordance with standard engineering practices that
the cumulative effect of the proposed encroachments
or new development shall not result in any increase
in the water surface elevation of the Base Flood
Elevation, velocities, or floodway widths during the
occurrence of a base flood discharge at any point
within the community. A Tennessee registered
professional engineer must provide supporting
technical data, using the same methodologies as in
the effective Flood Insurance Study for the City of
Savannah, Tennessee and certification, thereof.
2. New construction and substantial
improvements of buildings, where permitted, shall
comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction
provisions of Article V, Sections A and B.
(f) Standards for areas of special flood hazard zones AE
with established base flood elevation but without floodways
designated. Located within the Special Flood Hazard Areas
established in Article III, Section B, where streams exist
with base flood data provided but where no floodways have
been designated (Zones AE), the following provisions apply:
1. No encroachments, including fill material, new
construction And substantial improvements shall be
located within areas of special flood hazard, unless
certification by a Tennessee registered professional
engineer is provided demonstrating that the
cumulative effect of the proposed development, when
combined with all other existing and anticipated
development, will not increase the water surface
elevation of the base flood more than one (1) foot at
any point within the community. The engineering
certification should be supported by technical data
that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering
principles.
2. New construction and substantial
improvements of buildings, where permitted, shall
comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction
provisions of Article V, Sections A and B.
(e) Standards for streams without established base flood
elevations and floodways (A Zones). Located within the
14-70
Special Flood Hazard Areas established in Article III,
Section B, where streams exist, but no base flood data has
been provided and where a Floodway has not been
delineated, the following provisions shall apply:
1. The Administrator shall obtain, review, and
reasonably utilize any Base Flood Elevation and
floodway data available from any Federal, State, or
other sources, including data developed as a result of
these regulations (see 2 below), as criteria for
requiring that new construction, substantial
improvements, or other development in approximate
A Zones meet the requirements of Article V,
Sections A and B.
2. Require that all new subdivision proposals and
other proposed developments (including proposals for
manufactured home parks and subdivisions) greater
than 50 lots or 5 acres, whichever is the lesser,
include within such proposals Base Flood Elevation
data.
3. Within approximate A Zones, where Base Flood
Elevations have not been established and where such
data is not available from other sources, require the
lowest floor of a building to be elevated or
floodproofed to a level of at least three (3) feet above
the highest adjacent grade (as defined in Article II).
All applicable data including elevations or
floodproofing certifications shall be recorded as set
forth in Article IV, Section B. Openings sufficient to
facilitate automatic equalization of hydrostatic flood
forces on exterior walls shall be provided in
accordance with the standards of Article V, Section
B.
4. Within approximate A Zones, where Base Flood
Elevations have not been established and where such
data is not available from other sources, no
encroachments, including structures or fill material,
shall be located within an area equal to the width of
the stream or twenty feet (20), whichever is greater,
measured from the top of the stream bank, unless
certification by a Tennessee registered professional
engineer is provided demonstrating that the
cumulative effect of the proposed development, when
combined with all other existing and anticipated
development, will not increase the water surface
elevation of the base flood more than one (1) foot at
any point within the City of Savannah, Tennessee.
14-71
The engineering certification should be supported by
technical data that conforms to standard hydraulic
engineering principles.
5. New construction and substantial
improvements of buildings, where permitted, shall
comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction
provisions of Article V, Sections A and B. Within
approximate A Zones, require that those subsections
of Article V Section B dealing with the alteration or
relocation of a watercourse, assuring watercourse
carrying capacities are maintained and
manufactured homes provisions are complied with as
required.
(f) Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO and AH
Zones). Located within the Special Flood Hazard Areas
established in Article III, Section B, are areas designated
as shallow flooding areas. These areas have special flood
hazards associated with base flood depths of one (1) to
three (3) feet where a clearly defined channel does not
exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and
indeterminate; therefore, the following provisions, in
addition to those set forth in Article V, Sections A and B,
apply:
1. All new construction and substantial
improvements of residential and non-residential
buildings shall have the lowest floor, including
basement, elevated to at least one (1) foot above as
many feet as the depth number specified on the
FIRM’s, in feet, above the highest adjacent grade. If
no flood depth number is specified on the FIRM, the
lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated to
at least three (3) feet above the highest adjacent
grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate automatic
equalization of hydrostatic flood forces on exterior
walls shall be provided in accordance with standards
of Article V, Section B.
2. All new construction and substantial
improvements of non-residential buildings may be
floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure
together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities
must be floodproofed and designed watertight to be
completely floodproofed to at least one (1) foot above
the flood depth number specified on the FIRM, with
walls substantially impermeable to the passage of
water and with structural components having the
capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
14-72
loads and the effects of buoyancy. If no depth number
is specified on the FIRM, the structure shall be
floodproofed to at least three (3) feet above the
highest adjacent grade. A Tennessee registered
professional engineer or architect shall certify that
the design and methods of construction are in
accordance with accepted standards of practice for
meeting the provisions of this Ordinance and shall
provide such certification to the Administrator as set
forth above and as required in accordance with
Article IV, Section B.
3. Adequate drainage paths shall be provided
around slopes to guide floodwaters around and away
from proposed structures.
(g) Standards for areas protected by flood protection
system (A-99 Zones). Located within the Areas of Special
Flood Hazard established in Article III, Section B, are areas
of the 100-year floodplain protected by a flood protection
system but where Base Flood Elevations have not been
determined. Within these areas (A-99 Zones) all provisions
of Article IV and Article V shall apply.
(h) Standards for unmapped streams. Located within the
City of Savannah, Tennessee, are unmapped streams
where areas of special flood hazard are neither indicated
nor identified. Adjacent to such streams, the following
provisions shall apply:
1. No encroachments including fill material or
other development including structures shall be
located within an area of at least equal to twice the
width of the stream, measured from the top of each
stream bank, unless certification by a Tennessee
registered professional engineer is provided
demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the
proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, will not
increase the water surface elevation of the base flood
more than one (1) foot at any point within the
locality.
2. When a new flood hazard risk zone, and Base
Flood Elevation and floodway data is available, new
construction and substantial improvements shall
meet the standards established in accordance with
articles IV and V.
(5) Variance procedures.
(a) Board of zoning appeals.

Board of Zoning Appeals all papers constituting the record upon
which the appeal action was taken. The Municipal Board of
Zoning Appeals shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the
appeal, give public notice thereof, as well as due notice to
parties in interest and decide the same within a reasonable time
which shall not be more than fifteen (15) days from the date of
the hearing. At the hearing, any person or party may appear
and be heard in person or by agent or by attorney.
4. Powers. The Municipal Board of Zoning Appeals shall
have the following powers:
(a) Administrative Review. To hear and decide appeals
where it is alleged by the applicant that there is error in
any order, requirement, permit, decision, determination,
or refusal made by the Administrator or other
administrative official in carrying out or enforcement of
any provisions of this Ordinance.
(b) Variance Procedures. In the case of a request for a
variance the following shall apply:

Board of Zoning Appeals shall hear and decide
appealsand requests for variances from the
requirements of this Ordinance.
2. Variances may be issued for the repair or
rehabilitation of historic structures as defined,
14-74
herein, upon a determination that the proposed
repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the
structure’s continued designation as a historic
structure and the variance is the minimum
necessary deviation from the requirements of this
Ordinance to preserve the historic character and
design of the structure.
3. In passing upon such applications, the
Municipal Board of Zoning Appeals shall consider all
technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all
standards specified in other sections of this
Ordinance, and:
(a) The danger that materials may be swept
onto other property to the injury of others;
(b) The danger to life and property due to
flooding or erosion;
(c) The susceptibility of the proposed facility
and its contents to flood damage;
(d) The importance of the services provided
by the proposed facility to the community;
(e) The necessity of the facility to a
waterfront location, in the case of a
functionally dependent use;
(f) The availability of alternative locations,
not subject to flooding or erosion damage, for
the proposed use;
(g) The relationship of the proposed use to
the comprehensive plan and floodplain
management program for that area;
(h) The safety of access to the property in
times of flood for ordinary and emergency
vehicles;
(i) The expected heights, velocity, duration,
rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood
waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site;
(j) The costs of providing governmental
services during and after flood conditions
including maintenance and repair of public
utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas,
electrical, water systems, and streets and
bridges.
4. Upon consideration of the factors listed above,
and the purposes of this Ordinance, the Municipal
Board of Zoning Appeals may attach such conditions
14-75
to the granting of variances, as it deems necessary to
effectuate the purposes of this Ordinance.
5. Variances shall not be issued within any
designated floodway if any increase in flood levels
during the base flood discharge would result.
(b) Conditions for variances.
1. Variances shall be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum relief necessary, considering the flood
hazard and the factors listed in Article VI, Section A.
2. Variances shall only be issued upon: a showing of good and
sufficient cause, a determination that failure to grant the
variance would result in exceptional hardship; or a
determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or
victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or
Ordinances.
3. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the issuance of a variance to construct a
structure below the Base Flood Elevation will result in increased
premium rates for flood insurance (as high as $25 for $100)
coverage, and that such construction below the Base Flood
Elevation increases risks to life and property.
4. The Administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal
actions and report any variances to FEMA upon request. (Ord.

manager and all employees handling or receiving funds of the natural gas
distribution, waterworks distribution and sewerage collection systems, to execute a
fidelity bond, for the accounting of all funds or monies of the department of public
utilities handled by the city manager or employees. The bond shall be in such
amount as the board of commissioners may determine, provided that the penalty of
the same shall not be less than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00). The bond shall
be executed by some surety or guaranty company, authorized to do business in the
State of Tennessee, and the premium for the bonds shall be paid by the waterworks,
sewerage and natural gas systems, the same to be prorated between the three (3)
18-6
systems as equitably as the cost may be divided. The bonds may be a blanket bond
covering all employees of the department of public utilities. (1988 Code, § 13-107)

18-202. Obtaining service. Prospective customers are reminded that a
formal application for either original or additional service must be made with a duly
appointed employee of the department and be duly approved before connection or
meter installation orders will be issued and work performed. (1988 Code, § 13-202)
18-203. Application and contract for service. Each prospective
customer desiring service will be required to sign the department's standard form of
application. The use of service by a customer shall impliedly bind the customer by
the terms of the applicable standard application form, even though not actually
signed. Said application shall constitute a contract binding the prospective
customer to applicable rules and regulations of the department.
Within the corporate limits of the City of Savannah should the premises to be
served be new construction, the applicant shall show that an approved building
permit from the City of Savannah has been issued for such construction.
Before a service connection will be made, it will be necessary for the customer
to obtain a house number or box number for the structure to be served and place
this number where it will be readily visible from the street, alley, road or easement.
If, for any reason, a prospective customer, after requesting service does not
take the service by reason of not occupying premises or otherwise, he shall
reimburse the department for the expense incurred by reason of its endeavor to
furnish said service.
The receipt by the department of a prospective customer's application for
service, regardless of whether or not accompanied by a deposit, shall not obligate
the department to render the service applied for. The department may require
additional information and/or statements as needed in support of a customer's
application for services.
If the service applied for cannot be supplied in accordance with the
department's rules, regulations, and general practice, the liability of the
department to the applicant for such service shall be limited to the return of any
refundable deposit made with the department by such applicant.
18-9
Whenever an application is made for service to premises concerning which
the department knows there is a dispute as to the ownership or the right of
occupancy, and one (1) or more of the claimant’s attempts to prevent such service
being furnished, the department reserves the right to adopt either one (1) of the
following two (2) alternative courses:
(1) To treat the applicant in actual possession of the premises to be
served, as being entitled to such service, irrespective of the rights or claims of other
persons.
(2) To withhold service, pending a judicial or other settlement of the rights
of the various claimants. (1988 Code, § 13-203)
18-204. Deposits.
(1) The customer shall deposit such sums of money as may be required by
the department as continuing security for the performance of the obligations
contracted for by the customer, and failure to make such deposit upon demand of
the department will give the department the right to declare the contract forfeited
and to refuse or to discontinue service. (See schedule of rates and charges.)
(2) The cash deposit shall be retained by the department as security for
the payment of the bills and charges for services rendered by the department to the
customer. Upon discontinuance of service to any customer, the deposit shall be
refunded to the customer, provided that all charges for services rendered by the
department are paid, and the customer is not indebted to the department. If the
customer is indebted to the department at the time any service is discontinued, then
the department shall apply the cash deposit to the amount due the department for
services rendered. If a balance remains after so applying such cash deposit, the
same will be paid to the customer. If the amount due by the customer is greater
than the cash deposit, then the customer shall pay the same. No deposit shall be
transferable or assignable by customer.
(3) The amount of a commercial or industrial deposit is determined by
using January, February, July and August billing for the previous customer at the
address for which the applicant is applying for service. The department multiplies
the second highest monthly billing by one and one-half (1 1/2) to obtain the most
realistic dollar amount in securing payments on final bills. On newly constructed
buildings which have never been occupied, the department considers the size of the
building, type of operation and load requirements. A minimum deposit shall be
established as per the schedule of rates and charges for use in regards to the above
calculations.
In lieu of a cash deposit, commercial and industrial customers may, at the
customer’s expense, furnish to the department, and maintain in full force and effect
until service to such customer is terminated:
(a) Indemnity bond. A bond in the amount of the deposit requested
will be accepted and shall be signed by the customer as principal
and by a responsible corporate surety company authorized to do
and doing a general surety business in Tennessee. The selection
of the surety company shall be the responsibility of the
customer.
18-10
(b) Certificate of deposit. The department will accept this type
instrument purchased through a bank at a standard interest rate.
The certificate of deposit is held in safekeeping by the division in
lieu of a cash deposit. Certificate must be made jointly to
customer and Savannah Utility Department.
(c) Bank letter of credit. This type instrument must be furnished to
the department by any FDIC approved bank, which guarantees
full payment of deposit if utility bill is delinquent.
No surety on a bond, issuer of a letter of credit or issuer of a
certificate of deposit shall have the right to terminate its liability
thereunder without giving the department at least thirty (30)
days prior written notice of its election so to do, and such
termination shall not limit or otherwise affect the liability of any
such surety or issuer to the department for utility services
furnished the customer prior to the effective date of such
termination.
(4) If a commercial or industrial customer with a good paying record for
one (1) year opens a second business, a second deposit may not be required.
(5) No deposit will be required for city, county, state, or federal
institutions.
(6) No interest shall be paid on deposits.
(7) If an existing customer that has less than the presently required
deposits has service disconnected for nonpayment, the customer will be billed the
balance required to increase the deposit to present rates in equal installments on
the next two (2) bills.
(8) Customers that discontinue service and at a later time reapply for
service, shall be required to pay any difference in their deposits if they are lower
than the present rates no matter if the deposit has been retained by the department
during the period of non-service. (1988 Code, § 13-204)
18-205. Billing. Bills for residential service will be rendered monthly. Bills
to commercial and industrial customers may be rendered at other intervals at the
option of the department. Bill shall be due and payable upon receipt. Failure to
receive bills will not release customer from payment obligation nor extend the net or
due date. Bills paid on or before the “net date” shown on the bill shall be payable
at the net rates, but thereafter the gross rates shall apply, the gross rates being the
net amount plus a ten percent (10%) late payment charge. The late payment charge
shall be applied to any portion of the bill paid after the net payment period. The net
period shall be at least ten (10) days beginning with the date the bill is mailed.
If the department elects to read meters less frequently than each month in
order to reduce meter reading expense for other reasons, the department reserves
the right to render an estimated bill to a customer for any billing period for which
such customer’s meter is not read. If a subsequent meter reading shows that the
estimated bill was based on an erroneous mistake of consumption, the department
18-11
at its option will either adjust the estimated bill to correct the error or make a
compensated adjustment in a later bill.
If a meter fails to register properly, or if a meter is removed to be tested or
repaired, or if service is received other than through a meter, or if agents of the
department are unable to obtain access during regular working hours to read
meters, or if any other reason correctly registered consumption cannot be
determined, the department reserves the right to render an estimated bill based on
the best information available.
Any unpaid bill of the customer accrued at any address may be added to any
unpaid bill accrued by the same customer at any other address.
For the convenience of our customers, a bill depository has been provided on
the west side of the city hall utility department office into which payments for bills
may be placed when the office is closed and any payment made therein will be
accepted for the customer’s account. Any customer using the depository does so at
his own risk and must accept the department’s accounting for the amount received
by the department.
The department shall not be obligated to make adjustment of any bills unless
within thirty (30) days after the questioned bill is paid, the customer files with the
department a written objection to said bill specifying the basis for the desired
adjustment.
The department shall be under no obligation to extend the due date or the
time for paying any bills to the department because the customer disputes the
amount of the bill or liability for the bill. The customer shall have the right to pay
any disputed bill under protest provided the customer at the time of payment gives
the department written notice that the payment is being made under protest
together with a written statement of the ground or grounds upon which the
customer questions the correctness of the bill; and any such payment thus made
under protest shall not be considered a voluntary payment provided the customer
files suit to recover the questioned payment within thirty (30) days after such
payment is made.
In the event bills are not paid on or before the due date, service may be
discounted without notice to customer and not again resumed until all bills are
paid, and the department nor the City of Savannah shall not be liable for damages
on account of discounting service at any time after the due date, even though
payment of such bills be made on the same day either before or after service is
actually discontinued.
Should the net of due date of payment for bills fall on a weekend or holiday,
the next following business day will be considered as the net or due date
accordingly. Net remittances received by mail after the time limit for payment of
said net rates will be accepted by the department if the incoming envelope bears
United States post office date stamp of the final date for payment of the net
amount, or any date prior thereto.
The discontinuance of service by the department for any cause does not
release the customer from his obligation to the department for the payment of bills.
18-12
The seasonal or other temporary discontinuance of service at the customer’s
request will not relieve the customer from payment of minimum monthly bills
according to the applicable rate schedule.
To the extent that any sales or other tax is payable by a customer on any
service provided by the department and the department is obligated to collect such
tax from the customer, the customer’s failure to pay any such tax shall have the
same effect as such customer’s failure to pay all or any part of the charge for the
service to which such tax is attributable. Failure of the department to bill the
customer for all or any part of any such tax to the department at any later time. No
more than three (3) returned checks per customer will be acceptable in a twelve (12)
month period. For a period of (12) months from the date of the third returned
check, payment of bills to the department by said customer must be paid by cash or
money order. (1988 Code, § 13-205)
18-206. Termination/refusal of service. The department shall have the
right to discontinue service or to refuse to connect service for a violation of, or a
failure to comply with any provision of the following:
(1) These rules and regulations, including the schedule of rates and
charges;
(2) The customer’s application/contract for service;
(3) The payment of any obligation due the department, including any
required deposit.
Such right to discontinue service shall apply to all service received through a
single tap or service line, even though more than one (1) customer or tenant is
furnished service therefrom; and even though the delinquency or violation is limited
to only one (1) such customer or tenant.
Discontinuance of service by the department for any causes stated in these
rules and regulations shall not release the customer from liability for service
already received or from liability for payments that thereafter become due under
the minimum bill provisions or other provisions of the customer’s contract.
The department shall have the right to refuse to render service to any
applicant whenever the applicant or any member of the household, company or firm
to which service is to be furnished is in default in the payment of any obligation to
the department or has theretofore had his service disconnected because of a
violation of the rules and regulations of the department.
If the department should for any reason begin to render service to an
applicant to whom the department has a good and valid reason for refusing to
render such service, the department shall have the right to discontinue such service
at any time within one (1) year after such service is begun, even though such
customer does nothing to justify the discontinuance of service during the time such
service is being rendered.
In accordance and upon request of the customer prior to cut-off date, the
department shall afford the customer an opportunity for a hearing for resolution of
any dispute or the existence of the liability. The hearing shall be conducted by the
department office manager. At the time of the hearing or earlier, the department
shall permit the customer to inspect relevant records regarding his or her account.
18-13
The office manager will render a decision and shall immediately notify the
customer. If the customer is not satisfied with the decision of the office manager, or
if in unusual circumstances the manager desires to refer the matter to the utility
director, a hearing will be conducted by the utility director who shall hear the
evidence and render a final decision to the customer. The customer must request
the hearing before the utility director immediately after a decision and before a cutoff.
The customer's utility services shall not be terminated until a final decision is
reached and the customer is notified of that decision. (Ord. #779-7-2012, July 2012)
The department has the following types of plans that may be used in the
payment of bills:
(a) EXTENSIONS ON ONE (1) MONTH'S BILLS. Where financial,
health, unemployment or any other hardship conditions are
known, a good customer may be granted additional time to pay the
bill. In some cases the balance may be brought forward on the
following month's bill. Collection charges may be applicable. This
plan is primarily for a temporary hardship condition.
(b) EXTENDED PAYMENT PLAN. The extended payment plan may
be used to allow a good customer with an accumulated large
balance to be spread out over a number of months, but in no case
longer than a six (6) month period. Each month the customer
must pay their current bill and the agreed monthly portion of the
extended balance. Each month the agreed amount is billed until
the balance is paid or if terminated, the entire balance will be
payable on the final bill.
(c) LEVEL BILLING PROGRAM. Senior citizens (age sixty-two (62)
and older) or disabled persons will be allowed to participate in the
level billing program. Participants must be a good customer on
fixed income with at least one (1) year of utility service with the
department.
This program allows the customer to receive their bill in equal amounts
each month. The amount billed is based on previous service used in the past year.
It allows the customer to budget themselves and not have to worry about unusually
high bills. A review of their billing will be made in January and July of each year
and changes in the monthly amount are made if warranted. (1988 Code, § 13-206)
18-207. Service charge. A nonrefundable service charge as per the
schedule of rates and charges shall be applied for:
(1) Service to a new customer;
(2) Transfer of services;
(3) Returned checks;
(4) After hours service calls. (1988 Code, § 13-207)
18-208. Collection charge. There shall be a nonrefundable collection
charge as per the schedule of rates and charges applied for collection of services
rendered involved with nonpayment of bills as follows:
18-14
(1) Applied as delinquent charge on outstanding bills immediately
following due date; and
(2) Applied as additional cost to customer involved with initial tampering
of meter.
Collection charge shall apply per occurrence and not be cumulative in
delinquent charges for nonpayment. (1988 Code, § 13-208)
18-209. Reconnection charge. There shall be a nonrefundable
reconnection charge as per the schedule of rates and charges for reconnection of
services discontinued for reason of nonpayment or for any other reason by fault of
the customer. Collection of this charge shall be made before service is restored.
There shall be no charge in the event of connections in relation to emergency
disconnections and connections during normal working hours. (1988 Code, § 13-209)
18-210. Temporary service charges. Customers requiring temporary
service will be required to pay all costs as determined by the department for
connection and disconnection incidental to the supplying and removing of service in
addition to the regular charge for services used. This rule applies to circuses,
carnivals, fairs, temporary construction and other temporary requirements. (1988
Code, § 13-210)
18-211. Adjustment of water billing. Customers will be notified by
phone or email that a potential service leak exists. (Ord. #779-7-2012, July 2012)
To qualify for a water/or sewer billing adjustment, the customer must repair
the leak and provide the department with a copy of plumbing repair bills and/or
receipts for repair parts at the time bills are to be paid. Adjustments at a later date
will not be considered.
Adjustments will be completed for a one (1) billing period only, unless it is
determined that leakage occurred over two (2) consecutive billing periods. No more
than one (1) adjustment per customer over a twelve (12) month period will be
allowed.
Leakage adjustments for known water loss shall be based on the
corresponding billing period of the previous year charged at the current water rate
plus fifty percent (50%) of the excess consumption.
A customer's water billing must be at least five dollars ($5.00) over the
charge for the same period of the previous year to qualify for an adjustment.
For customers on the department sewer system an adjustment will be made
as follows:
(1) Water leakage that returns to the sewer system (i.e., toilet, sink, etc.)
shall be adjusted based on the corresponding billing period of the previous year
charged at the correct sewer rate plus fifty percent (50%) of the excess consumption
in addition to the above water adjustment; or
(2) Water leakage that does not return to the sewer system will be
adjusted based on the corresponding billing period of the previous year and charged
at the current sewer rate in addition to the above water adjustment.
18-15
When a customer files a complaint that the water bill of any period has
been excessive, the department shall reread the meter to verify accuracy of the
initial reading. If readings are in line, the customer may request a meter test for
accuracy (see § 18-311 meter test), otherwise consumption has been verified. (1988
Code, § 13-211)
18-212. Customer's responsibility for violations of rules and
regulations. Where the department furnishes service to a customer, such
customer shall be responsible to the department for all violations of the rules,
regulations, and rate schedules of the department, which violations occur on the
premises served or in connection with such service. Personal participation by the
customer in any such violations shall not be necessary to impose such personal
responsibility on the customer. (1988 Code, § 13-212)
18-213. Scope. These rules and regulations and applicable rate schedules
are a part of all contracts for receiving service from the department and apply to all
service received from the department whether the service is based upon contract,
agreement, signed application, or otherwise. (1988 Code, § 13-213)
18-214. Conflict. In case of conflict between any provision of any rate
schedule and the rules and regulations, the rate schedule shall apply. (1988 Code, §
13-214)
18-215. Revisions. These rules and regulations and applicable rate
schedules may be revised, amended, supplemented, or otherwise changed from time
to time. Such changes, when effective, shall have the same force as the present
rules, regulations and rate schedules. (1988 Code, § 13-215)
18-216. Separability section. If any clause, sentence, paragraph,
section or part of these rules and regulations shall be declared invalid or
unconstitutional, it shall not affect the validity of the remaining parts of these rules
and regulations. (1988 Code, § 13-216)
18-217. Filing and posting. A copy of these rules and regulations,
together with a copy of the department's schedules of rates and charges, shall be
kept open to inspection at the offices of the department. (1988 Code, § 13-217)
18-218. Standard forms.

fires, storms, floods, washouts, droughts, arrests and restraint of rulers and peoples,
civil disturbances, explosions, breakage or accidents to the water system, the
necessity for making repairs on alterations in the water system or any other cause,
whether of the kind herein enumerated or not, not within the control of the
department and which, by the exercise of reasonable care, the department is unable
to prevent or overcome.
(5) When the department deems it necessary for the protection of the
supply of water or for the protection of the department's system, the supply of water
may be immediately discontinued or restricted in whole or in part. All water sold to
customers is subject to interruption, discontinuance or curtailment by the
department, regardless of priority observance, when an emergency exists or is
imminent, justifying such interruption, discontinuance or curtailment. (1988 Code, §
13-302)
18-303. Customer’s responsibilities to department.
(1) No customer will, in the distribution or use of water furnished by the
department distribute or supply any water through any pipes or hoses installed
across or along property owned by any other party or parties or installed across or
along any public right-of-way unless the requirements of this paragraph are waived
by a resolution duly adopted by the Savannah City Commission.
Said resolution shall state any requirements necessary as outlined by the
commission in waiving of the above paragraph.
(2) Customers are liable for the cost of repairing meters or meter boxes set
to serve their premises, provided repairs are necessitated by a change in grade of
the lot or carelessness or lack of proper equipment on the part of the customer, his
agent, employee or any member of his family. Since these boxes are either on or
close to public rights-of-way, the removal of covers by an unauthorized person is
prohibited in the interest of public safety.
(3) The customer must agree to allow right of access to the department's
agents on the customer's premises at all reasonable times and for all necessary
purposes.
18-19
(4) Only employees of the department will be permitted to turn water on
or off at the curb cock, except as follows:
(a) Cut-off made by plumber to make repairs on customer's water
service;
(b) Cut-off made by customer in time of emergency while department
office is closed.
In either case, customer is liable for any damage to department equipment.
(5) The customer must contract and agree to pay for water service at the
established rate in accordance with the operating procedures of the department.
(6) The customer is required to install a cut-off valve on their service line
for purposes of cutting off water in case of a leak. (1988 Code, § 13-303)
18-304. Eligible customers for water service. Water service shall be run
only to those applicants whose premises are abutting a dedicated street, alley, road
or an easement where a department water main is present. If a water main is in
close proximity to the premises requesting service, said main may be extended
according to the main extension section.
Easements obtained across adjacent properties for purposes of meeting the
above requirements will not be accepted so long as the property in question abuts a
public right-of-way where a water main may be extended to provide service. (1988
Code, § 13-304)
18-305. Application for water service. In addition to application
procedures as outlined in chapter two of the department's rules and regulations,
new construction to be served by sanitary disposal other than the Savannah Sewer
System shall first have sanitary disposal approved by the local state health
department before water services can be provided. (1988 Code, § 13-305)
18-306. Installation of meter connections. Water service mains will be
installed by the department from the water distribution main to the customer's
point of delivery. The location of such water mains will be determined by the
department.
Before a new or larger water service main will be installed by the
department, the applicant shall pay the necessary cost for construction whenever
required under these rules and regulations.
The department shall be responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of
water mains to the point of delivery. In addition, the department shall be
responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of meters, meter boxes, cut-off valves
and meter connections with access thereto being required as previously provided.
The service line and all other facilities (except meter, meter wells, meter boxes, cutoff
valves and meter connections) beyond the point of delivery (even though such
remaining portion is not located within the customer's property line) shall be the
responsibility of the customer. Notwithstanding anything elsewhere herein
provided, the department shall not be responsible for the maintenance and upkeep
of any part of a service line.
18-20
Water service shall not be furnished to more than one (1) customer through a
single service line unless it is clearly in the best interest of the department to
provide such service. In the event that a present service line provides service to
more than one (1) customer, the department may require that each customer served
by such service line acknowledge, in a manner satisfactory to the department:
(1) That the department is not responsible for the maintenance of such
service line; and
(2) That such customer is responsible for providing and maintaining such
service line as previously provided.
The omission of the department to obtain any such acknowledgment shall
neither add to the department’s responsibility nor reduce the customer's
responsibility for the maintenance of such service line.
Where a water line is adjacent to industrial property, the city will pay for
labor to provide water lines to the property line of industrial customers and the
industrial customers will pay for all materials. Under special circumstances, and
upon consideration from the board of utilities, the city commission may consider a
modification of this policy. (1988 Code, § 13-306, as amended by Ord. #562-4-98,
June 1998)
18-307. Street excavation and restoration. In the event the department
shall remove any pavement and dig a trench in making the connection from the
water main to the property line, and shall damage the surface of any street,
sidewalk, curb, or gutter, then the department shall refill any ditch so dug and
repair any damage to any curb, gutter, or sidewalk. In refilling the ditch in said
street, the department shall tamp the same and compact the dirt as near as possible
to the condition it was before the opening of such ditch, and shall place on top of the
same gravel or crushed stone for the purpose of the paved surface or pavement on
the street being replaced. The replacing of the surface or pavement on the street
shall be done by the street department of the City of Savannah within the corporate
limits. County and state roads shall be the responsibility of the departments as
negotiated with the individual government entity. (1988 Code, § 13-307)
18-308. Main extensions.
(1) Short main extensions to developed areas. The provisions of this
section shall apply only to water distribution main extensions of five hundred feet
(500') or less to areas where there is a demand for water service by the occupants of
existing houses. This section shall in no event be applicable to land development
projects and subdivision promotions, even though accompanied by the erection of
occasional houses within such areas and requiring water distribution main
extensions of five hundred feet (500') or less.
Owners of property to be served by a proposed water distribution main
extension of the character to which this section applies shall pay to the department
before the work is begun the regular tap fees for each connection desired
immediately. The water distribution main shall be extended fifty feet (50') for each
such connection at no cost to the owners. If additional main is required, the
applicant for the extension shall pay in advance of construction the cost as
18-21
reasonably estimated by the department; and the department shall be under no
obligation to make any refund of such payments or any part thereof. Extensions in
this section will be extended to the structure to be served, if any, but in no case can
the extension terminate short of mid-point of the property parcel.
Beginning with the completion of the water distribution main extension and
installation of water connections, each customer shall pay to the department water
bills at least equal to the minimum monthly charges prescribed by the applicable
rules, regulations, and rate schedules of the department for each such connection
regardless of the use made thereof.
An extension of a larger water distribution main to premises already served
by a smaller water distribution main, when made at the request of a customer or
customers and not by the department as an improvement to the department's water
distribution system, shall be treated the same as an original water distribution
main extension for the purposes of this section.
(2) Main extensions to areas to which subsection (1) is not applicable. The
provisions of this subsection shall apply to all areas to which subsection (1) is not
applicable and applies to all land development projects and subdivision promotions.
The person desiring water distribution main extensions or connections
pursuant to this subsection must pay all the costs of making such extensions or
connections including connecting mains to the department's existing water system
located outside the area being developed or promoted. The applicant shall pay in
advance of construction the estimated cost for work to be performed by the
department.
Upon completion of such extensions and connections and their approval by
the department, such water distribution mains and connections shall become the
property of the department, and the persons paying the cost of constructing such
mains and connections shall execute any written instrument requested by the
department to provide evidence of the department's title to such mains and
connections. In consideration of such mains and connections being transferred to
the department, the department shall incorporate said mains and connections as an
integral part of the department's water system and shall furnish water therefrom
for the reasonable life of said mains and connections, in accordance with the
department's rules and regulations and rate schedules, subject always to such
limitations as may exist because of the size and elevation of said mains.
No refunds shall be made by the department for service connections
attached to the mains installed pursuant to this section.
An extension of larger water distribution mains to premises already served
by a smaller water distribution main, when made at the request of a customer or
customers and not by the department as an improvement to the department's water
distribution system, shall be treated the same as an original water main extension
for the purposes of this section.
(3) The size, type and installation of water distribution mains to be
extended must be approved by the department. Minimum standards are:
(a) Six inch (6") minimum nominal diameter main within the City of
Savannah Planning Region;
18-22
(b) Four inch (4") minimum nominal diameter main maybe used
outside the planning region only for short cul-de-sacs and
permanent dead-ends where future growth is not feasible. The
length of four inch (4") mains shall be restricted to three thousand
feet (3,000') in any one (1) direction.
(c) Six inch (6") minimum nominal diameter main for all other
extensions outside the planning region not applicable in
subsection (b) above.
(4) Should the department be unable to install a main extension, the
customer or developer has the option to install a main extension, the customer or
developer has the option to install the mains by a private contractor. If this option is
selected, the customer or developer must install the mains in accordance with the
department rules and regulations, specifications, policies and ordinances. All
connections to existing department mains will be made by the department or its
authorized agents at the expense of the customer or developer.
(5) The authority to make water main extensions pursuant to subsections
(1) and (2) is permissive only; and nothing contained herein shall be construed as
requiring the department to make water main extensions to furnish service to any
person or persons, even though such prospective customers meet all of the
requirements contained in subsections (1) and (2) so as to permit the department to
make a main extension pursuant to said provisions.
(6) The department may extend water mains as it deems necessary in
regards to water system improvements and expansions. (1988 Code, § 13-308)
18-309. Easement rights and relocation of department's facilities. In
cases where the needs of one (1) or more customers are such as to make desirable
the location of the department's water mains, and appurtenant facilities on the
customer's property or other private property in order to provide service to such
customer(s). The customer(s) shall provide adequate easement rights as required by
the department for the department's facilities. The department shall not install
such water mains and facilities and no applicant for service shall be entitled to such
service until the department has been furnished, at no cost to the department, such
indefeasible easement rights for such water mains and facilities at a location
acceptable to the department. All persons having any interest in the property where
such water mains and facilities of the department are located, shall be conclusively
presumed to have agreed to the construction and continued maintenance of such
water mains and facilities if at any time after the use thereof begins, a continuous
period of six (6) months elapses during which no effort is made by the customer or
by any person having an interest in such property, to have such water mains and
facilities removed or relocated.
Any person wishing to have the department's water mains or facilities
relocated for his convenience shall be entitled to have such water mains or facilities
relocated only if:
(1) An easement for a suitable substitute location acceptable to the
department is provided at no cost to the department; and
18-23
(2) Satisfactory arrangements are made with the department for all
expenses for any relocation work to be paid at no cost to the department.
Until arrangements acceptable to the department are made for providing
water service to the premises served by such water mains or facilities, no person
shall have the right to require the department to remove any such water mains or
facilities even though the facilities are not in active use at the time. Neither the
customer nor any other person shall do anything on the property where such water
main and facilities are located, or allow any use thereof, which will endanger said
water main and facilities or which will create a hazard by reason of the location or
use of such water mains and facilities, or which will materially interfere with access
thereto for the repair, maintenance and use thereof.
Any customer whose premises do not extend to a public street right-of- way
or other public right-of-way from which water service can be safely and
economically provided, shall be responsible for providing and maintaining without
cost to the department an easement for the department's water facilities between
the customer's premises and the public right-of-way from which such water service
is to be or is being provided. Such customer shall also be responsible for providing
and maintaining, including approved easements, all water facilities beyond such
customer's point of delivery, which facilities are not owned by the department.
This rule applies to all customers, present and future, including without limitation,
those occupying apartments, office buildings, condominiums, shopping centers,
parks, projects, developments, subdivisions, and other similar land uses. (1988
Code, § 13-309)
18-310. Meter. All meters shall be furnished, installed, owned, tested,
repaired and removed by the department.
Department approval of meter locations shall be obtained prior to the
installation of any service lines. The customer shall cause to be provided a suitable
location, satisfactory to the department, for all metering equipment. The
department shall have ready access at all times to such meter locations, whether
inside or outside of buildings, for reading, inspection, repair, replacement and
removal. The department reserves the right to move a meter at its own expense to a
location which it deems to be more accessible or desirable. If meter is moved by the
department, the customer will be required to move their service line to the new
meter location at no cost to the department.
No one shall do anything which will in any way interfere with or prevent the
proper registration of a meter. No one shall tamper with or work on a water meter
without the written permission of the department. No one shall install any pipe or
other device which will cause water to pass through or around a meter without the
passage of such water being registered fully by the meter.
The department reserves the right to properly size the meter for usage by a
customer. Second water meters may be obtained as per the schedule of rates and
charges for purposes of watering that will not be sewered (swimming pools, yards,
gardens, etc.). These meters will be subject to a charge for water use only.
The following restrictions will apply in connection with second water meters:
18-24
(1) All cost involved in complying with cross connection regulations will be
at the customer's expense;
(2) Customer must install an outside faucet for use in regulating their
water flow; and
(3) Piping from a second water meter will not be connected in any way to
piping from a meter that is being charged for water and sewer.
If determined by the department that customer is in violation of restriction
(3) above, sewer charges for the past twelve (12) months will be billed and due in
full by the customer on their next regular billing. Continued violations in this
manner will result in permanent disconnection of a customer's second water meter
with no refund of any monies to said customer. (1988 Code, § 13-3110)
18-311. Meter tests. The department will, at its own expense, make routine
tests of meters when the department considers such tests desirable.
In testing meters, the water passing through a meter will be weighed or
measured at various rates of discharge and under varying pressures. To be
considered accurate, the meter registration shall check with the weighed or
measured amounts of water within the percentage shown in the following table:
Meter Size Percentage
5/8", 3/4", 1", 1 1/2" 3%
2" and over 5%
The department will make additional tests or inspections of its meters at the
request of the customer. If a test requested by a customer shows a meter to be
accurate within the limits stated above, the customer shall pay a meter testing
charge in the amount stated in the schedule of rates and charges. In case the test
shows a meter to be in excess of the above percentage, fast or slow, the meter will be
replaced. An adjustment will be made in the customer's bill over a reasonable
period as determined by the department. The cost of making the test for inaccurate
meter will be borne by the department. (1988 Code, § 13-311)
18-312. Single point delivery. The rates fixed in the schedule of rates and
charges for each class of service are based upon supply of service to the entire
premises through a single point of delivery and meter location. Separate supply for
the same customer at each additional point of delivery and meter location. Separate
supply for the same customer at each additional point of delivery shall be separately
metered and billed. (1988 Code, § 13-312)
18-313. Multiple services through a single meter. No customer shall
supply water service to more than one (1) dwelling or premises from a single service
line and meter with the following exceptions:
(1) Building under one ownership that has a number of apartments offices
or stores under one (1) roof.
(2) Mobile home or trailer park (such park is defined as having three (3) or
more units).
18-25
Contract for services of the above exceptions shall be with the owner. (1988
Code, § 13-313)
18-314. Inspections. The department shall have the right, but not be
obligated, to inspect in any manner any service line, installation or plumbing
system before water service is furnished or at any later time. The department
reserves the right to refuse or discontinue service to any service line, plumbing
system or other installation not in accordance with the standards fixed by the City
of Savannah ordinances regulating plumbing or not in accordance with any special
contract, these rules and regulations, or other requirements of the department.
Any failure to inspect or reject a customer's service line, installation or
plumbing system shall not render the department liable or responsible for any loss
or damage which might have been avoided, had such inspection or rejection been
made. (1988 Code, § 13-314)
18-315. Standby and resale service. All purchased water (other than
emergency or standby service) used on the premises of customer shall be supplied
exclusively by the department and the customer shall not, directly or indirectly,
sell, sublet, assign, or otherwise dispose of the water or any part thereof, except
with written permission from the department. (1988 Code, § 13-315)
18-316. Cross connections. No cross connection of any kind shall be
permitted between the water supply from the department's mains and the water
supply from any other source.
A cross connection is defined as any physical connection whereby the
department's water supply is connected with any other water supply system,
whether public or private, either inside or outside of any building or buildings, in
such manner that a flow of water into the department's water supply is possible
either through the manipulation of valves or because of ineffective check or back
pressure valves, or because of any other arrangement. Cross connection control
shall be maintained as established by the department in conjunction with this
chapter and Tennessee Code Annotated. (1988 Code, § 13-316)
18-317. Unauthorized use or interference with water supply. No
person shall turn on or turn off any of the department's stop cocks, valves, spigots or
fire hydrants, without permission or authority from the department. (1988 Code, §
13-317)
18-318. Fire hydrants. Fire hydrants shall be installed in the city on new
mains as determined by the department. This also applies for areas in the county
for locations where water mains have been designed for fire protection service and
currently meet the state requirements for appropriate pressure and flows. These
and existing fire hydrants shall be so indicated by a red colored body and bonnet.
18-26
Fire hydrants installed in the county at locations below minimum fire
protection service will:
(1) Be installed at locations determined by the department and the
county fire department for the restricted purpose of filing fire department
equipment only;
(2) Be installed on no less than a six inch (6”) main;
(3) Be indicated by a blue colored body and red bonnet.
Fire hydrants and blow-offs installed in the county not included in above
sections are to be used only for flushing purposes by the department. These
hydrants shall be so indicated by a blue colored body and bonnet.
Subject to approval of the department, water may be furnished to a
customer through a public or unmetered private fire hydrant by obtaining a
temporary hydrant permit. The use of water from a fire hydrant is not to be used as
an alternate domestic supply or standby for a private water supply system and
must be metered. (1988 Code, § 13-318)
18-319. Limited use of unmetered private fire line. Where a private fire
line is not metered, no water shall be used from such line or from any fire hydrant
thereon, except to fight fire or except when being inspected in the presence of an
authorized agent of the department.
All private fire hydrants shall be sealed by the department, and shall be
inspected at regular intervals to see that they are in proper condition and that no
water is being used therefrom in violation of the department's rules and
regulations. When the seal is broken on account of fire, or for any other reason, the
customer taking such service shall give the department written notice of such
occurrence as soon as possible. (1988 Code, § 13-319)
18-320. Swimming pools. Swimming pools may be filled initially each year
at one of the following options:
(1) Pools may be filled by the customer's residential service. If said
customer has sewer service with the department, an adjustment will be made as per
the water leak adjustment section, except the customer will be required to pay for
all excessive water consumption instead of fifty percent (50%). This adjustment will
count as the one adjustment allowed per twelve (12) months per customer as stated
under the section "adjustment of water billing."
(2) Customer may fill pool from department fire hydrant if readily
available to pool site. Temporary hydrant permit is required.
(3) Second water meter may be obtained. See "meter" section and
schedule of rates and charges. (1988 Code, § 13-320)
18-321. Continuous flow on unmetered service. No customer taking
water through an unmetered service shall use any device requiring or allowing a
continuous flow of water unless such use has been approved in writing by the
department. (1988 Code, § 13-321)
18-27
18-322. Damages to property due to water pressure. The department
shall not be liable for any damages to a customer's plumbing or property, which
damages may be caused by high pressure, by low pressure, or by fluctuation in
pressure, in the department's water mains. (1988 Code, § 13-322)
18-323. Customer's responsibility for violations of rules and
regulations. Where the department furnishes service to a customer, such
customer shall be responsible to the department for all violations of the rules,
regulations, and rate schedules of the department, when violations occur on the
premises served or in connection with such service. Personal participation by the
customer in any such violations shall not be necessary to impose such personal
responsibility on the customer. (1988 Code, § 13-323)
18-324. Scope. These rules and regulations and applicable rate schedules
are a part of all contracts for receiving service from the department and apply to all
service received from the department whether the service is based upon contract,
agreement, signed application, or otherwise. (1988 Code, § 13-324)
18-325. Conflict. In case of conflict between any provision of any rate
schedule and the rules and regulations, the rate schedule shall apply. (1988 Code, §
13-325)
18-326. Revisions. These rules and regulations and applicable rate
schedules may be revised, amended, supplemented, or otherwise changed from time
to time. Such changes, when effective, shall have the same force as the present
rules, regulations and rate schedules. (1988 Code, § 13-326)
18-327. Separability section. If any clause, sentence, paragraph, section
or part of these rules and regulations shall be declared invalid or unconstitutional,
it shall not affect the validity of the remaining parts of these rules and regulations.
(1988 Code, § 13-327)
18-328. Filing and posting. A copy of these rules and regulations,
together with a copy of the department's schedule of rates and charges, shall be
kept open to inspection at the offices of the department. (1988 Code, § 13-328)

(vii) No Person shall make connection of roof downspouts,
exterior foundation drains, area drains, basement drains, or
other sources of surface runoff or groundwater to a Building
Sewer or building drain which, in turn, is connected directly
or indirectly to a public sanitary sewer.
(c) Inspection of Connections
(i) The connection of the Building Sewer to the public sewer and all
Building Sewers from the building to the public sewer main line
shall be inspected by the Control Authority or his Duly
Authorized Representative before the underground portion is
covered.
(ii) The applicant for discharge shall notify the Control Authority
when the Building Sewer is ready for inspection and connection
to the public sewer. The connection shall be made under the
supervision of the Control Authority or his Duly Authorized
Representative.
(d) Maintenance of Building Sewers
Each individual User of the POTW shall be entirely responsible
for the maintenance of the Building Sewer located on private property
to insure that the Building Sewer is watertight. This maintenance will
include repair or replacement of the Building Sewer as deemed
necessary by the Control Authority to meet the requirements of this
18-43
Ordinance. If, upon smoke testing or visual inspection by the Control
Authority, roof downspout connections, exterior foundation drains,
area drains, basement drains, Building Sewer leaks, or other sources of
rainwater, surface runoff, or groundwater entry into the POTW are
identified on Building Sewers on private property, the Control
Authority may take any of the following actions:
(i) Notify the User in writing of the nature of the problem(s)
identified on the User’s Building Sewer and the specific steps
required to bring the Building Sewer within the requirements of
this Ordinance. All steps necessary to comply with this
Ordinance must be completed within sixty (60) days from the
date of the written notice and entirely at the expense of the
User.
(ii) Notify the User in writing of the nature of the problem(s)
identified on the User’s Building Sewer and inform the User
that the City will provide all labor, equipment, and materials
necessary to make the repairs required to bring the Building
Sewer within the requirements of this Ordinance. The work on
private property will be performed at the City’s convenience and
the cost of all materials used will be charged to the User. The
City will be responsible for bringing any excavations back to
original grade, replacing topsoil and hand raking all disturbed
areas; however, the property owner shall be responsible for final
landscaping, including but not limited to seeding, fertilizing,
watering, mulching, sodding, and replacing any shrubbery or
trees displaced or damaged by the City during the execution of
the work.
(2) Prohibitions on Storm Drainage and Groundwater. Storm water,
groundwater rain water, street drainage, roof top drainage, basement
drainage, subsurface drainage, or yard drainage, if unpolluted, shall not
be discharged to the POTW.
(3) Unpolluted Water. Unpolluted water, including, but not limited to
cooling water or process water, shall not be discharged to the POTW
unless such discharge is permitted by the User’s wastewater discharge
permit.
(4) Limitations of the Use of Garbage Grinders. Waste from
garbage grinders shall not be discharged into the POTW except where
generated in preparation of food consumed on the premises. Such
grinders must shred the waste to a degree that all particles will be
carried freely under normal flow conditions prevailing in the POTW
sewer. Garbage grinders shall not be used for the grinding of plastic,
paper products, inert materials, or garden refuse. This provision shall
not apply to domestic residences.
(5) Limitation on Point of Discharge. No Person shall discharge any
substance directly into a manhole or other opening in a POTW sewer
18-44
other than through an approved Building Sewer unless a temporary
permit by the Control Authority has been issued. The Control Authority
shall incorporate in such temporary permit such conditions as the City
deems reasonably necessary to insure compliance with the provisions of
this article and the User shall be required to pay applicable charges and
fees thereof.
(6) Septic Tank Pumping, Hauling, and Discharge. No Person owning
vacuum or “cesspool” pump truck or other liquid waste transport truck
shall discharge such sewage into the POTW, unless waste transport
trucks have applied for and received a Truck Discharge Operation Permit
from the Control Authority. All applicants for a Truck Discharge
Operation Permit shall complete such forms as required by the Control
Authority, pay appropriate fees, and agree in writing to abide by the
provisions of this article and any special conditions or regulations
established by the Control Authority. The owners of such vehicles shall
affix and display the permit number on the side of each vehicle used for
such purposes. Such permits shall be valid for a period of one (1) year
from date of issuance provided such permit shall be subject to revocation
by the Control Authority for violation of any provision of this article or
reasonable regulation established by the Control Authority. Such permits
shall be limited to the discharge of domestic sewage waste containing no
industrial waste. The Control Authority shall designate the locations and
times where such trucks may be discharged, and may refuse to accept
any truckload of waste where it appears that the waste could interfere
with the effective operation of the POTW treatment works or any sewer
line or appurtenance thereto. The Control Authority shall incorporate in
such Truck Discharge Operation Permit such conditions necessary to
insure compliance with the provisions of this article and the charge (on a
volume basis) for disposal of wastewater or sludge removed from septic
tanks into the POTW.
(7) Other Holding Tank Waste. No Person shall discharge any other
holding tank waste into the POTW unless he has been issued a permit by
the Control Authority. Unless otherwise allowed under the terms and
conditions of the permit, a separate permit must be secured for each
separate discharge. The permit shall state the specific location of
discharge, the time of day the discharge is to occur, the volume of the
discharge, and shall limit the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of the discharge. Such User shall pay any applicable
charges or fees, and shall comply with the conditions of the permit issued
by the Control Authority. Provided, however, no permit will be required
to discharge domestic waste from a recreational vehicle holding tank
provided such discharge is made into an approved facility designed to
receive such waste.
18-45
(8) On-Site Wastewater Disposal Facilities. No Person shall discharge
untreated wastewater from on-site private sewage disposal facilities
including, but not limited to sanitary pit privies, septic tanks, and
cesspools to drainage ditches or the surface of the ground. All on-site
private wastewater disposal facilities shall be properly operated and
maintained by the owner of the property on which the facilities are
located. Any new construction of on-site private wastewater disposal
facilities shall be in accordance with State requirements.
(9) Prohibited Discharge Standards.
(a) General Prohibitions. No User shall introduce or cause to be
introduced into the POTW any pollutant or wastewater which
causes Pass Through or Interference. These general prohibitions
apply to all Users of the POTW whether or not they are subject to
Categorical Pretreatment Standards or any other Federal, State, or
local Pretreatment Standards or Requirements.
(b) Specific Prohibitions. No User shall introduce or cause to be
introduced into the POTW the following pollutants, substances, or
wastewater:
(i) Any liquids, solids, or gases which, by reason of their nature or
quantity are, or may be, sufficient either alone or by interaction
with other substances to cause fire or explosion or be injurious
in any other way to the POTW or to the operation of the POTW.
At no time shall two successive readings on an explosion hazard
meter at the point of discharge into the POTW system (or at any
point in the POTW) be more than five percent (5%) nor any
single reading over ten percent (10%) of the Lower Explosive
Limit (LEL) of the meter or have a closed-cup flashpoint of less
than 140 degrees Fahrenheit (60 degrees Celsius) using the test
methods specified in 40 CFR 261.21;
(ii) Wastewater having a pH less than 5.0, or wastewater having
any other corrosive property capable of causing damage or
hazard to structures, equipment, and/or personnel of the POTW;
(iii) Solid or viscous substances which may cause obstruction to the
flow in a sewer or other interferences with the operation of the
wastewater treatment facilities such as, but not limited to:
grease garbage with particles greater than one-half inch (1/2”) or
one and 27 hundredths (1.27) centimeters in any dimension;
animal guts or tissues, paunch manure, bones, hair, hides or
fleshings, entrails, whole blood, and feathers from slaughter
houses; ashes or cinders from sawmills; sand, spent lime, stone
or marble dust from stone work facilities; metal, glass, straw,
shavings, grass clippings, rags, spent grains, spent hops, waste
paper, wood, plastics, gas, tar, asphalt residues, residues from
refining or processing of fuel or lubricating oil, mud, or glass

grinding or polishing waxes; towels, rags, or sanitary wipes from
health care facilities;
(iv) Pollutants, including oxygen-demanding pollutants (BOD, etc.),
released in a discharge at a flow rate and/or pollutant
concentration which, either singly or by interaction with other
pollutants, will cause Interference with the POTW;
(v) Wastewater having a temperature which will inhibit biological
activity in the POTW treatment plant resulting in Interference,
but in no case wastewater which causes the temperature at the
introduction into the treatment plant to exceed 104 degrees
Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celsius);
(vi) Petroleum oil, nonbiodegradable cutting oil, or products of
mineral oil origin, in amounts that will cause Interference with
the POTW or Pass Through;
(vii) Pollutants which result in the presence of toxic gases, vapors, or
fumes within the POTW in a quantity that may cause acute
worker health and safety problems;
(viii) Trucked or hauled pollutants, except at discharge points
designated by the Control Authority in accordance with Section
18-402.6 of this Ordinance;
(ix) Noxious or malodorous liquids, gases, or solids, or other nondomestic
wastewater which, either singly or by interaction with
other wastes, are sufficient to create a public nuisance or a
hazard to life, or to prevent entry into the sewers for
maintenance or repair;
(x) Wastewater which imparts color which cannot be removed by
the treatment process, such as, but not limited to, dye wastes
and vegetable tanning solutions, which consequently imparts
color to the treatment plant’s effluent, thereby violating the
City’s NPDES permit;
(xi) Wastewater containing any radioactive wastes or isotopes of
such half-life or concentration as may exceed limits established
by the Control Authority in compliance with applicable State or
Federal regulations;
(xii) Storm Water, surface water, ground water, artesian well water,
roof runoff, subsurface drainage, swimming pool drainage,
condensate, deionized water, Noncontact Cooling Water, and
unpolluted wastewater, unless specifically authorized by the
Control Authority;
(xiii) Sludges, screenings, or other residues from the pretreatment of
industrial wastes;
(xiv) Wastewater causing, alone or in conjunction with other sources,
the treatment plant’s effluent to fail toxicity test;
(xv) Detergents, surface-active agents, or other substances that
might cause excessive foaming in the POTW;
18-47
(xvi) Any wastewater which causes a hazard to human life or creates
a public nuisance;
(xvii) Any Fats, Oils, or Grease of animal or vegetable origin and
Waste Food and Sand that cause an upset, interference, or the
POTW to violate its NPDES permit in concentrations greater
than specified at Table 1: Industrial Wastewater Specific
Pollutant Limitations and the table insert Threshold
Limitations on Wastewater Strength Exceedances that may be
subject to surcharge Refer to the specific guidelines for control at
Section 18-402.10.
When the Control Authority determines that a User is
contributing to the POTW any of the above enumerated substances in
such amounts as to interfere with the operation of the POTW, the
Control Authority shall: 1) advise the User(s) of the impact of the
contribution on the POTW and 2) develop effluent limitations for such
User(s) to correct the Interference with the POTW.
Pollutants, substances, or wastewater prohibited by this Section
shall not be processed or stored in such a manner that they could be
discharged to the POTW.
(10) Fats, Oils and Grease, Waste Food, and Sand Guidelines. Fats, oil,
grease, waste food, and sand in the POTW can interfere with the
collection system and wastewater treatment facility by causing blockages
and plugging of pipelines, problems with normal operation of pumps and
their controls, and contribute waste of a strength or form that is beyond
the treatment capability of the treatment plant.
(a) Interceptors. Fats, Oil, and Grease (FOG), waste food, and sand
interceptors shall be installed when, in the opinion of the Control
Authority, they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes
containing fats, oils, and grease, ground food waste, sand, soil, and
solids, or other harmful ingredients in excessive amounts which
impact the POTW. Such interceptors shall not be required of singlefamily
residences, but may be required for multiple family residences.
All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by the
Control Authority, and shall be located as to be readily and easily
accessible for cleaning and inspection.
(i) Fats, Oil, Grease, and Food Waste
(A) New Food Service Facility. On or after the effective
date of this Ordinance, food service facilities which are
newly proposed or constructed, shall be required to
install, operate and maintain a grease interceptor with a
minimum capacity of 750 gallons located on the exterior of
the building. Approval of the installation of a grease trap
instead of a grease interceptor at a new food service
facility can be obtained for those facilities where
inadequate space is available for the installation of a
18-48
grease interceptor. Design criteria shall conform to the
standard in accordance with any provisions of the
plumbing Code as adopted by the City of Savannah and
Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation
engineering standards or applicable local guidelines.
(B) Existing Food Service Facilities. On or after the
effective date of this Ordinance, existing food service
facilities or food service facilities which will be expanded
or renovated shall install a grease trap or grease
interceptor when, in the opinion of the Control Authority,
necessary for the control of FOG and food waste. Upon
notification, the facility must be in compliance within 90
days (unless due case of hardship may be proven). The
facility must service and maintain the equipment in order
to prevent adverse impact upon the POTW. If in the
opinion of the Control Authority the user continues to
impact the POTW, additional pretreatment measures
may be required.
(ii) Sand, Soil, and Oil. All car washes, truck washes, garages,
service stations, and other sources of sand, soil, and oil shall
install effective sand, soil, and oil interceptors when directed by
the Control Authority. These interceptors shall be sized to
effectively remove sand, soil, and oil at the proper flow rates.
These interceptors shall be cleaned on a regular basis to prevent
impact upon the POTW. Owners whose interceptors are deemed
to be ineffective by the Control Authority may be asked to
change the cleaning frequency or to increase the size of the
interceptors. Owners or operators of washing facilities shall
prevent the inflow of rainwater into the sanitary sewer.
(iii) Laundries. Where directed by the Control Authority
commercial laundries shall be equipped with an interceptor with
a wire basket or similar device, removable for cleaning, that
prevents passage into the POTW of solids ½-inch or larger in
size such as strings, rags, buttons, or other solids detrimental to
the POTW.
The equipment or facilities installed to control FOG, food
waste, sand, and soil shall be designed in accordance with
Southern Plumbing Code and Tennessee Department of
Environment and Conservation engineering standards or
applicable local guidelines. Underground equipment shall be
tightly sealed to prevent inflow of rainwater and easily
accessible to allow regular maintenance and inspection. Control
equipment shall be maintained by the owner or operator of the
facility to prevent a stoppage of the public sewer, and the
accumulation of FOG in the POTW. If the Control Authority is
required to clean out the public sewer lines as a result of a
18-49
stoppage resulting from poorly maintained control equipment, or
lack thereof, the owner or operator shall be required to refund
the labor, equipment, materials and overhead costs to the
Control Authority. Nothing in this section shall be construed to
prohibit or restrict any other remedy the Control Authority has
under this ordinance, or state or federal law.
The Control Authority retains the right to inspect and
approve installation of the control equipment.
There shall be no charge for random inspections
conducted by the Control Authority personnel on traps or
interceptors. If a trap or interceptor has to be re-inspected
because of deficiencies found during the previous inspection by
the Control Authority personnel, and all of the deficiencies have
been corrected, there shall be no charge for the re-inspection. If
all of the deficiencies have not been corrected, a first reinspection
fee of $50 shall be charged to the facility. If a second
re-inspection is required, a second re-inspection fee of $150 shall
be charged to the facility if all of the deficiencies have still not
been corrected. If three or more re-inspections are required, a reinspection
fee of $300 for each successive re-inspection shall be
charged to the facility in addition to other enforcement actions if
all of the deficiencies have not been corrected.
(b) Solvents. The use of degreasing or line cleaning products containing
petroleum-based solvents is prohibited.
(11) National Categorical Pretreatment Standards. Users must comply
with the
categorical Pretreatment Standards found at 40 CFR Chapter I,
Subchapter N, Parts 405-471 and shall serve as the minimum
requirements.
(a) Where a categorical Pretreatment Standard is expressed in terms of
either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the
Control Authority may impose equivalent concentration or mass
limits in accordance with Section 18-402.11e. and 18-402.11f. as
allowed at 40 CFR 403.6(c).
(b) When the limits in a categorical Pretreatment Standard are
expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production,
the Control Authority may convert the limits to equivalent limitations
expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent
concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations
applicable to individual Industrial Users as allowed at 40
CFR403.6(c)(2).
(c) When wastewater subject to a categorical Pretreatment Standard is
mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same Standard, the
Control Authority shall impose an alternate limit in accordance with
Tennessee Rule 0400-40-14-.06(5).
18-50
(d) A CIU may obtain a net/gross adjustment to a categorical
Pretreatment Standard in accordance with the following paragraphs
of this Section as allowed at 40 CFR 403.15.
(i) Categorical Pretreatment Standards may be adjusted to reflect
the presence of pollutants in the Industrial User’s intake water
in accordance with this Section. Any Industrial User wishing to
obtain credit for intake pollutants must make application to the
City. Upon request of the Industrial User, the applicable
Standard will be calculated on a “net” basis (i.e., adjusted to
reflect credit for pollutants in the intake water) if the
requirements of paragraph (ii) of this Section are met.
(ii) Criteria:
(A) Either 1) The applicable categorical Pretreatment
Standards contained in 40 CFR Chapter I, subchapter N
specifically provide that they shall be applied on a net
basis; or 2) The Industrial User demonstrates that the
control system it proposes or uses to meet applicable
categorical Pretreatment Standards would, if properly
installed and operated, meet the Standards in the absence
of pollutants in the intake waters.
(B) Credit for generic pollutants such as biochemical oxygen
demand (BOD), total suspended solids (TSS), and oil and
grease, etc. shall not be granted unless the Industrial
User demonstrates that the constituents of the generic
measure in the User’s effluent are substantially similar to
the constituents of the generic measure in the intake
water or unless appropriate additional limits are placed
on process water pollutants either at the outfall or
elsewhere.
(C) Credit shall be granted only to the extent necessary to
meet the applicable categorical Pretreatment Standard(s),
up to a maximum value equal to the influent value.
Additional monitoring may be necessary to determine
eligibility for credits and compliance with Standard(s)
adjusted under this Section.
(D) Credit shall be granted only if the User demonstrates that
the intake water is drawn from the same body of water as
that into which the POTW discharges. The City may
waive this requirement if it finds that no environmental
degradation will result.
(e) When a categorical Pretreatment Standard is expressed only in terms
of pollutant concentrations, an Industrial User may request that the
City convert the limits to equivalent mass limits. The determination
to convert concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion
of the Control Authority. The City may establish equivalent mass
18-51
limits only if the Industrial User meets all the conditions set forth in
Sections 18-402.11e.(i)A. through 18-402.11e.(i)E. below.
(i) To be eligible for equivalent mass limits, the Industrial User
must:
(A) Employ, or demonstrate that it will employ, water
conservation methods and technologies that substantially
reduce water use during the term of its individual
wastewater discharge permit;
(B) Currently use control and treatment technologies
adequate to achieve compliance with the applicable
categorical Pretreatment Standard, and not have used
dilution as a substitute for treatment;
(C) Provide sufficient information to establish the facility’s
actual average daily flow rate for all wastestreams, based
on data from a continuous effluent flow monitoring device,
as well as the facility’s long-term average production rate
must be representative of current operating conditions;
(D) Not have daily flow rates, production levels or pollutant
levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass
limits are not appropriate to control the Discharge; and
(E) Have consistently complied with all applicable categorical
Pretreatment Standards during the period prior to the
Industrial User’s request for equivalent mass limits.
(ii) An Industrial User subject to equivalent mass limits must:
(A) Maintain and effectively operate control and treatment
technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the
equivalent mass limits;
(B) Continue to record the facility’s flow rates through the use
of a continuous effluent flow monitoring device;
(C) Continue to record the facility’s production rates and
notify the Control Authority whenever production rates
are expected to vary by more than 20 percent (20%) from
its baseline production rates determined in paragraph 18-
402.11e.(i)C. of this Section. Upon notification of a revised
production rate, the Control Authority will reassess the
equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as necessary to
reflect changed conditions at the facility; and
(D) Continue to employ the same or comparable water
conservation methods and technologies as those
implemented pursuant to paragraphs 18-402.11e.(i)A. of
this Section so long as it discharges under an equivalent
mass limit.
(iii) When developing equivalent mass limits, the Control Authority:
(A) Will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying
the actual average daily flow rate of the regulated
process(es) of the Industrial User by the concentration18-
52
based Daily Maximum and Monthly Average Standard for
the applicable categorical Pretreatment Standard and the
appropriate unit conversion factor;
(B) Upon notification of a revised production rate, will
reassess the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the
limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the
facility; and
(C) May retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent
individual wastewater discharge permit terms if the
Industrial User’s actual average daily flow rate was
reduced solely as a result of the implementation of water
conservation methods and technologies, and the actual
average daily flow rates used in the original calculation of
the equivalent mass limit were not based on the use of
dilution as a substitute for treatment pursuant to Section
18-402.16. The Industrial User must also be in
compliance with Section 18-412.3 regarding the
prohibition of bypass.
(f) The Control Authority may convert the mass limits of the categorical
Pretreatment Standards of 40 CFR Parts 414, 419, and 455 to
concentration limits for purposes of calculating limitations applicable
to individual Industrial Users. The conversion is at the discretion of
the Control Authority. When converting such limits, the Control
Authority will use the concentrations listed in the applicable subparts
of 40 CFR Parts 414, 419, and 455 and document that dilution is not
being substituted for treatment as prohibited by Section 18-402.16 of
this Ordinance (see 40 CFR 403.6(d)). In addition, the Control
Authority will document how the equivalent limits were derived for
any changes from concentration to mass limits, or vice versa, and
make this information publicly available (see 40 CFR 403.6(c)(7)).
(g) Once included in its permit, the Industrial User must comply with the
equivalent limitations developed in this Section (18-402.11) in lieu of
the promulgated categorical Standards from which the equivalent
limitations were derived.
(h) Many categorical Pretreatment Standards specify one limit for
calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit
for calculating maximum Monthly Average, or 4-day average,
limitations. Where such Standards are being applied, the same
production or flow figure shall be used in calculating both the average
and the maximum equivalent limitation.
(i) Any Industrial User operating under a permit incorporating
equivalent mass or concentration limits calculated from a productionbased
Standard shall notify the Control Authority within two (2)
business days after the User has a reasonable basis to know that the
production level will significantly change within the next calendar
month. Any User not notifying the Control Authority of such
18-53
anticipated change will be required to meet the mass or concentration
limits in its permit that were based on the original estimate of the
long term average production rate.
(12) Modification of National Pretreatment Standards. If the POTW
achieves consistent removal of pollutants limited by the National
Pretreatment Standards, the City may apply to the Approval Authority for
modifications of specific limits in the National Pretreatment Standards.
“Consistent Removal” shall mean reduction in the amount of a pollutant or
alteration of the nature of the pollutant by the POTW to a less toxic or
harmless state in the effluent which is achieved by the system in ninety-five
(95) percent of the samples taken when measured according to the procedures
set forth in 40 CFR 403.7(a)(3)(ii) – General Pretreatment Regulations for
Existing and New Sources of Pollution, promulgated pursuant to the Act. The
City may then modify pollutant discharge limits in the National
Pretreatment Standards, if the requirements continued in 40 CFR 403.7 are
fulfilled and approval is obtained from the Approval Authority.
(13) State Pretreatment Standards. Users must comply with
Tennessee Pretreatment Standards codified at T.C.A. §§ 69-3-101 et seq.
and 4-5-201 et seq.
(14) Local Limits.
(a) The Control Authority is authorized to establish Local Limits
pursuant to Tennessee Rule 0400-40-14-.05(3).
(b) Specific Pollutant Limitations. Pollutant limits are established
to protect against Pass Through and Interference. For a list of the
specific pollutants and respective concentrations refer to Appendix
(latest revision), Table 1: Industrial Wastewater Specific Pollutant
Limitations. No Person shall discharge wastewater containing in
excess of the limits for each pollutant unless:
(i) An exception has been granted by the Control Authority to
the User; or
(ii) The wastewater discharge permit of the User provides as a
special permit condition a higher interim concentration level
in conjunction with a requirement that the User construct a
pretreatment facility or institute changes in operation and
maintenance procedures to reduce the concentration of
pollutants to levels not exceeding the standards set forth in
Table 1: Industrial Wastewater Specific Pollutant Limits
(refer to Appendix A) within a fixed period of time.
Analyses for all pollutants listed at Table 1: Industrial
Wastewater Specific Pollutant Limitations (refer to Appendix)
shall be conducted in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR
Part 136 or equivalent methods approved by the United States
Environmental Protection Agency.
(c) Criteria to Protect the POTW Treatment Plant Influent. The
City shall monitor the treatment works influent for each
18-54
parameter listed in Appendix (latest revision), Table 2: Criteria to
Protect the Treatment Plant Influent. Analyses for all pollutants
listed at Table 2: Criteria to Protect the Treatment Plant Influent
(refer to Appendix) shall be conducted in accordance with the
requirements of 40 CFR Part 136 or equivalent methods approved
by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Industrial
Users shall be subject to the reporting and monitoring
requirements set forth in Section 18-406 and 18-407 of this
Ordinance as to these parameters. In the event that the influent at
the treatment works reaches or exceeds the levels established by
Table 2: Criteria to Protect the Treatment Plant Influent (refer to
Appendix), the Control Authority shall initiate technical studies to
determine the cause of the influent violation and shall recommend
to the City such remedial measures as are necessary, including,
but not limited to recommending the establishment of new or
revised pretreatment levels for these pollutants. The Control
Authority shall also recommend changes to any of these criteria in
the event the POTW effluent standards are modified or in the
event that there are changes in any applicable law or regulation
affecting same or in the event changes are needed to more
effectively operate the POTW.
(d) Conventional Pollutants
(i) BOD5, TSS, and NH3-N. The POTW treatment plant was
designed to accommodate specific waste load concentrations
and mass amounts of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5),
total suspended solids (TSS) and ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N).
If an Industrial User discharges concentrations of these
pollutants in excess of the Threshold Limitations on
Wastewater Strength at Table 1: Industrial Wastewater
Specific Pollutant Limitations, added operation and
maintenance costs will be incurred by the POTW. Therefore,
any Industrial User who discharges concentrations in excess
of the Threshold Limitations on Wastewater Strength at
Table 1: Industrial Wastewater Specific Pollutant
Limitations listed at Appendix A of this Ordinance for any
conventional pollutants such as BOD5, TSS and/or NH3-N
will be subject to a surcharge. The formula for this surcharge
is listed in Section 18-413.4 of this Ordinance. The City also
reserves the right to, at any time, place specific mass or
concentration limits for BOD5, TSS, and/or NH3-N on the
Industrial User if the Industrial User’s discharge of the
excessive strength wastewater causes the POTW treatment
plant to violate its NPDES permit.
(ii) Oil and Grease. Oil and grease loadings were not
taken into account in the design of the POTW treatment
18-55
plant; however, oil and grease are regulated under this
ordinance as conventional pollutants.
“Free” and “Emulsified” oil and grease shall be
differentiated based on the following procedure. One aliquot
of sample shall be extracted with hexane using EPA Method
1664, with the exception that the sample shall not be
acidified prior to the extraction. The result of this analysis
will be considered “Free” oil and grease. A second aliquot of
sample shall be prepared by adding sulfuric acid and heating
until emulsion breaks. The sample shall then be extracted
with hexane using EPA Method 1664. The result of the
analysis will be considered the arithmetic difference between
“Total” and “Free” oil and grease.
If a User discharges concentrations of “Free” Oil and
Grease in excess of the Threshold Limitations on Wastewater
Strength listed at Table 1: Industrial Wastewater Specific
Pollutant Limitations at Appendix A of this Ordinance for
“Free” Oil and Grease, added operation and maintenance
costs will be incurred by the POTW. Therefore, any User who
discharges concentrations in excess of the Threshold
Limitations on Wastewater Strength listed at Table 1:
Industrial Wastewater Specific Pollutant Limitations at
Appendix for “Free” Oil and Grease will be subject to a
surcharge. The formula for this surcharge is listed at Section
18-413.4 of this Ordinance. The City also reserves the right
to, at any time, place specific mass or concentration limits for
“Free” Oil and Grease on the User if the User’s discharge of
the excessive strength wastewater causes the POTW
treatment plant to violate its NPDES permit.
(15) City’s Right of Revision. The City reserves the right to establish, by
ordinance or in individual wastewater discharge permits, more stringent
Standards or Requirements on discharges to the POTW system if deemed
necessary consistent with the purpose of this Ordinance.
(16) Dilution. No User shall ever increase the use of process water, or in
any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute
for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation
unless expressly authorized by an applicable Pretreatment Standard or
Requirement. The Control Authority and/or his designated
representative may impose mass limitations on Users who are using
dilution to meet applicable Pretreatment Standards or Requirements or
in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.
(17) Accidental Discharges.
(a) Protection from Accidental Discharge. Each Industrial User
shall provide protection from accidental discharge of prohibited
materials or other substances regulated by this Ordinance.
Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials
18-56
shall be provided and maintained at the Industrial User’s own cost
and expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating
procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the
Control Authority for review, and shall be approved by the Control
Authority before construction of the facility. No Industrial User who
commences contribution to the POTW after the effective date of this
Ordinance shall be permitted to introduce pollutants into the
system until accidental discharge procedures have been approved
by the Control Authority. Review and approval of such plans and
operating procedures shall not relieve the Industrial User from the
responsibility to modify the Industrial User’s facility as necessary
to meet the requirements of this Ordinance.
(b) Notification of Accidental Discharge. In the case of an
accidental discharge, it is the responsibility of the Industrial User
to immediately telephone and notify the POTW of the incident. The
notification shall be within 24 hours of becoming aware of the
violation and shall include the location of the discharge, type of
waste, volume, and corrective actions.
(i) Written Notice. Within five (5) days following an accidental
discharge, the Industrial User shall submit to the Control
Authority a detailed written report describing the cause of
the discharge and the measures to be taken by the Industrial
User to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification
shall not relieve the Industrial User of any expense, loss,
damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result
of damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any other damage to
person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the
Industrial User of any civil penalties, administrative
penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this
Ordinance or other applicable law.
(ii) Notice to Employees. A notice shall be permanently
posted on the Industrial User’s bulletin board or other
prominent place advising employees whom to call in the
event of a dangerous accidental discharge. Industrial Users
shall insure that all employees who may cause such a
dangerous discharge to occur or may suffer such are advised
of the emergency notification procedure. (Ord. # 801-11-2014,
December 2014)
18-403. Pretreatment of wastewater.
(1) Pretreatment facilities. Users shall provide wastewater treatment as
necessary to comply with this Ordinance and shall achieve compliance with all
categorical Pretreatment Standards, Local Limits, and the prohibitions set out in
Section 18-402 of this Ordinance within the time limitations specified by EPA, the
State, or Control Authority, whichever is more stringent. Any facilities necessary
for compliance shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the User’s expense.
18-57
Detailed plans describing such facilities and operating procedures shall be
submitted to the Control Authority for review, and shall be acceptable to the
Control Authority before such facilities are constructed. The review of such plans
and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the User for the responsibility of
modifying such facilities as necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to the City
under the provisions of this Ordinance.
(2) Additional Pretreatment Measures
(a) Whenever deemed necessary, the Control Authority may require Users
to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that
certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate
and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage waste streams
from industrial waste streams, and such other conditions as may be
necessary to protect the POTW and determine the User’s compliance
with the requirements of this Ordinance.
(b) The Control Authority may require any person discharging into the
POTW to install and maintain, on their property and at their expense,
a suitable storage, and flow-control facility to ensure equalization of
flow. An individual wastewater discharge permit may be issued solely
for flow equalization.
(c) Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the
opinion of the Control Authority, they are necessary for the proper
handling of wastewater containing excessive amounts of grease, oil,
and/or sand; except that such interceptors shall not be required for
residential users. All interception units shall be a type and capacity
approved by the Control Authority, shall comply with Section 18-
402.10 of this Ordinance, and shall be so located to be easily accessible
for cleaning and inspection. Such interceptors shall be inspected,
cleaned, and repaired in accordance with Section 18-402.10 by the
User at their expense.
(d) Users with potential to discharge flammable substances may be
required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas
detection meter.
(3) Accidental Discharge/Slug Discharge Control Plans. The Control
Authority shall evaluate whether each SIU needs an accidental
discharge/slug discharge control plan or other action to control Slug
Discharges. The Control Authority may require any User to develop,
submit for approval, and implement such a plan or take such other action
that may be necessary to control Slug Discharges. Alternatively, the
Control Authority may develop such a plan for any User at the User’s
expense. An accidental discharge/slug discharge control plan shall
address, at a minimum, the following:
(a) Description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch
discharges;
(b) Description of stored chemicals (which shall include cleaning supplies);
18-58
(c) Procedures for immediately notifying the Control Authority of any
accidental or Slug Discharge, as required by Section 18-406.6 of this
Ordinance; and
(d) Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or Slug
Discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to inspection
and maintenance of storage areas, handling, and transfer of materials,
loading and unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker
training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures
for containing toxic pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures
and equipment for emergency response. (Ord. #801-11-2014, December
2014)
18-404. Individual wastewater discharge permits.
(1) Wastewater analysis. When requested by the Control Authority, a User
may submit information on the nature and characteristics of its
wastewater within fifteen (15) days of the request. The Control Authority
is authorized to prepare a form for this purpose and may periodically
require Users to update this information.
There shall be two (2) classes of Building Sewer permits: (a) for
connection of residential, commercial, and institutional users to the
POTW, and (b) for connection of Industrial Users to the POTW. In either
case, the owner of the facility or residence wishing to connect a Building
Sewer to the POTW or his agent shall make application on a special form
furnished by the City. The permit application shall be supplemented by
any plans, specifications, or other information considered pertinent in the
judgment of the Control Authority. A permit and inspection fee shall be
paid to the City at the time the application is filed as set out in the City’s
schedule of charges and fees.
(2) Individual Wastewater Discharge Permit Requirement
(a) No Significant Industrial User shall discharge wastewater into the
POTW without first obtaining an individual wastewater discharge
permit from the Control Authority, except that a Significant
Industrial User that has filed a timely application pursuant to Section
18-404.3 of this Ordinance may continue to discharge for the time
period specified therein.
(b) The Control Authority may require other Users to obtain individual
wastewater discharge permits as necessary to carry out the purposes
of this Ordinance.
(c) Any violation of the terms and conditions of an individual wastewater
discharge permit shall be deemed a violation of this Ordinance and
subjects the wastewater discharge permittee to the sanctions set out
in Section 18-409 through 18-412 of this Ordinance. Obtaining an
individual wastewater discharge permit does not relieve a permittee
of its obligation to comply with all Federal and State Pretreatment
Standards or Requirements or with any other requirements of
Federal, State, and local law.
18-59
(3) Individual Wastewater Discharge Permitting: Existing Connections. Any
non-permitted User required to obtain an individual wastewater
discharge permit who was discharging wastewater into the POTW prior

18-406. Baseline Monitoring Requirements.
(a) Within either one hundred eighty (180) days after the effective date of
a categorical Pretreatment Standard, or the final administrative
decision on a category determination under Tennessee Rule 0400-40-
14-.06(1)(d), whichever is later, existing Categorical Industrial Users
currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge to the POTW shall
submit to the Control Authority a report which contains the
information listed in paragraph (b), below. At least ninety (90) days
prior to commencement of their discharge, New Sources, and sources
that become Categorical Industrial users subsequent to the
promulgation of an applicable categorical Standard, shall submit to the
Control Authority a report which contains the information listed in
paragraph (b), below. A New Source shall report the method of
pretreatment it intends to use to meet applicable categorical
Standards. A New Source also shall give estimates of its anticipated
flow and quantity of pollutants to be discharged.
(b) Users described in paragraph (a), above, shall submit the information
set forth below:

(C) Samples should be taken immediately downstream
from pretreatment facilities if such exist or immediately
downstream from the regulated process if no
pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed with
the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment the User
should measure the flows and concentrations necessary to
allow use of the combined wastestream formula in
Tennessee Rule 0400-40-14-.06(5) to evaluate compliance
with the Pretreatment Standards. Where an alternate
concentration or mass limit has been calculated in
accordance with Tennessee Rule 0400-40-14-.06(5) this
adjusted limit along with supporting data shall be
submitted to the Control Authority;
(D) Sampling and analysis shall be performed in
accordance with Section 18-406.10;
(E) The Control Authority may allow the submission of
a baseline report which utilizes only historical data so
long as the data provides information sufficient to
determine the need for industrial pretreatment measures;
(F) The baseline report shall indicate the time, date

M) and/or additional pretreatment is required to meet the
Pretreatment Standards and Requirements.
(d) Compliance Schedule – If additional pretreatment and/or O & M
will be required to meet the Pretreatment Standards, the
shortest schedule by which the User will provide such additional
pretreatment and/or O & M must be provided. The completion
date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date
established for the applicable Pretreatment Standard. A
compliance schedule pursuant to this Section must meet the
requirements set out in Section 18-406.2 of this Ordinance.
18-68
(e) Signature and Report Certification – All baseline monitoring
reports must be certified in accordance with Section 18-406.14a.
of this Ordinance and signed by an Authorized Representative
as defined in Section 18-401.4c. of this Ordinance.
(1) Compliance Schedule Progress Reports. The following conditions shall
apply to the compliance schedule required by this Ordinance:
(a) The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates for
the commencement and completion of major events leading to the
construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the
User to meet the applicable Pretreatment Standards (such events
include, but are not limited to, hiring an engineer, completing
preliminary and final plans, executing contracts for major components,
commencing and completing construction, and beginning and conducting
routine operation);
(b) No increment referred to above shall exceed nine (9) months;
(c) The User shall submit a progress report to the Control Authority no
later than fourteen (14) days following each date in the schedule and the
final date of compliance including, as a minimum, whether or not it
complied with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and,
if appropriate, the steps being taken by the User to return to the
established schedule; and
(d) In no event shall more than nine (9) months elapse between such
progress reports to the Control Authority.
(2) Reports on Compliance with Categorical Pretreatment Standards Deadline.
Within ninety (90) days following the date for final compliance with
applicable categorical Pretreatment Standards, or in the case of a New
Source following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the
POTW, any User subject to such Pretreatment Standards and Requirements
shall submit to Control Authority a report containing the information
described in Section 18-404.5f., 18-404.5g., and 18-406.1b.(ii) of this
Ordinance. For Users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits
established in accordance with the procedures in Section 18-402.11, this
report shall contain a reasonable measure of the User’s long-term production
rate. For all other Users subject to categorical Pretreatment Standards
expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or
other measure of operation), this report shall include the User’s actual
production during the appropriate sampling period. All compliance reports
must be signed and certified in accordance with Section 18-406.14a. of this
Ordinance. All sampling will be done in conformance with Section 18-406.11.
(a) Periodic Compliance Reports. All SIUs and Non-Significant
Categorical Industrial Users are required to submit periodic
compliance reports.
(i) All permitted Users must, at a frequency determined by the
Control Authority, submit no less than twice per year (on dates
specified) reports indicating the nature, concentration of
pollutants in the discharge which are limited by Pretreatment
18-69
Standards and the measured or estimated average and
maximum daily flows for the reporting period. In cases where
the Pretreatment Standard requires compliance with a Best
Management Practice (BMP) or pollution prevention alternative,
the User must submit documentation required by the Control
Authority or the Pretreatment Standard necessary to determine
the compliance status of the User.
(ii) The City may authorize a User subject to a categorical
Pretreatment Standard (upon the Approval Authority’s
approval) to forego sampling of a pollutant regulated by a
categorical Pretreatment Standard if the SIU or NSCIU has
demonstrated through sampling and other technical factors that
the pollutant is neither present nor expected to be present in the
Discharge, or is present only at background levels from intake
water and without any increase in the pollutant due to activities
of the Industrial User. [Tennessee Rule 0400-40-14-.12(5)(b)]
This authorization is subject to the following conditions:
(A) The waiver may be authorized where a pollutant is
determined to be present solely due to sanitary
wastewater discharged from the facility provided the
sanitary wastewater is not regulated by an applicable
categorical Standard and otherwise includes no
process wastewater.
(B) The monitoring waiver is valid only for the duration of
the effective period of the industrial wastewater
discharge permit, but in no case longer than five (5)
years. The User must submit a new request for the
waiver before the waiver can be granted for each
subsequent individual wastewater discharge permit.
See Section 18-404.5h. of this Ordinance.
(C) In making a demonstration that a pollutant is not
present, the Industrial User must provide sufficient
data of the facility’s process wastewater prior to any
treatment present at the facility that is representative
of all wastewater from all processes.
(D) The request for a monitoring waiver must be signed in
accordance with Section 18-401.4c. of this Ordinance,
and include the certification statement in Section 18-
406.14a. of this Ordinance (Tennessee Rule 0400-40-
14-.06(1)(b)(2)).
(E) Non-detectable sample results may be used only as a
demonstration that a pollutant is not present if the
EPA approved method from 40 CFR Part 136 with the
lowest minimum detection level for that pollutant was
used in the analysis.
18-70
(F) Any grant of the monitoring waiver by the Control
Authority must be included as a condition in the
User’s permit. The reasons supporting the waiver and
any information submitted by the User in its request
for the waiver shall be maintained by the Control
Authority for three (3) years after expiration of the
waiver.
(G) Upon approval of the monitoring waiver and revision
of the User’s permit by the Control Authority, the
Industrial User must certify on each report with the
statement in Section 18-406.14b. of this Ordinance,
that there has been no increase in the pollutant in its
wastestream due to activities of the Industrial User.
(H)In the event that a waived pollutant is found to be
present or is expected to be present because of changes
that occur in the User’s operations, the User must
immediately: Comply with the monitoring
requirements of Section 18-406.4a., or other more
frequent monitoring requirements imposed by the
Control Authority, and notify the Control Authority.
(I) This provision does not supersede certification
processes and requirements established in categorical
Pretreatment Standards, except as otherwise specified
in the categorical Pretreatment Standards.
(iii) All periodic compliance reports must be signed and
certified in accordance with Section 18-406.14a. of this
Ordinance and a Chain of Custody form must be submitted with
all reports.
(iv) All wastewater samples must be representative of the
User’s discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement
facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained
in good working order at all times. The failure of a User to keep
its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be
grounds for the User to claim that sample results are
unrepresentative of its discharge.
(v) If a User subject to the reporting requirement in this Section
monitors any regulated pollutant at the appropriate sampling
location more frequently than required by the Control Authority,
using the procedures prescribed in Section 18-406.11 of this
Ordinance, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the
report for the corresponding reporting period.
(b) Reports of Changed Conditions. Each User must notify the Control
Authority of any significant changes to the User’s operations or system
which might alter the nature, quality, or volume of its wastewater at
least one hundred eighty (180) days before the change.
18-71
(i) The Control Authority may require the User to submit such
information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the
changed condition, including the submission of a wastewater
discharge permit application under Section 18-404.5 of this
Ordinance.
(ii) The Control Authority may issue an individual wastewater
discharge permit under Section 18-405.6 of this Ordinance or
modify an existing wastewater discharge permit under Section
18-405.3 of this Ordinance in response to changed conditions or
anticipated changed conditions.
(c) Reports of Potential Problems.
(i) In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to
accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic
nature, a non-customary batch discharge, a Slug Discharge or
Slug Load, that might cause potential problems for the POTW,
the User shall immediately telephone and notify the Control
Authority of the incident. This notification shall include the
location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and
volume, and corrective actions taken by the User. The Control
Authority may request a sample be collected for analysis at the
time of accidental discharge.
(ii) Within five (5) days following such discharge, the User shall,
unless waived by the Control Authority, submit a detailed
written report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the
measures to be taken by the User to prevent similar future
occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the User of any
expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may incur as a
result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other
damage to personal property; nor shall such notification relieve
the User of any penalties or other liability which may be
imposed pursuant to this Ordinance.
(iii) A notice shall be permanently posted on the User’s
bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees who
to call in the event of a discharge described in paragraph A.
above. Employers shall ensure that all employees are advised of
the emergency notification procedure.
(iv) Significant Industrial Users are required to notify the
Control Authority immediately of any changes at its facility
affecting the potential for a Slug Discharge.
(d) Reports from Non-permitted Users. All Users not required to obtain
an individual wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate
reports to the Control Authority as the Control Authority may require.
(e) Notice of Violation/Repeat Sampling and Reporting. If sampling
performed by a User indicates a violation, the User must notify the
Control Authority within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of
the violation. The User shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and
18-72
submit the results of the repeat analysis to the Control Authority
within thirty (30) days after becoming aware of the violation.
Resampling by the Industrial User is not required if the City performs
sampling at the User’s facility at least once a month, or if the City
performs sampling at the User’s facility between the time when the
initial sampling was conducted and the time when the User or the City
receives the results of this sampling, or if the City has performed the
sampling and analysis in lieu of the Industrial User. If sampling
performed by the City indicates a violation, the City may opt to notify
the User of the violation and require the User to perform the repeat
sampling and analysis [40 CFR 403.12(g)(2)].
(f) Notification of the Discharge of Hazardous Waste
(i) Any User who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall
notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Water Management Division
Director, and State hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any
discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise
disposed of, would be hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261.
Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as
set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number,
and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the User
discharges more than one hundred (100) kilograms of such waste
per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain
the following information to the extent such information is known
and readily available to the User: an identification of the hazardous
constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and
concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged
during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of
constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during
the following twelve (12) months. All notifications must take place
no later than one hundred and eighty (180) days after the discharge
commences. Any notification under this paragraph needs to be
submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However,
notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under
Section 18-406.5 of this Ordinance. The notification requirement in
this Section does not apply to pollutants already reported by Users
subject to categorical Pretreatment Standards under the selfmonitoring
requirements of Section 18-406.1, 18-406.3, and 18-
406.4 of this Ordinance.
(ii) Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of paragraph A.
above during a calendar month in which they discharge no more
than fifteen (15) kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes
are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and
261.33(e). Discharge of more than fifteen (15) kilograms of nonacute
hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of
acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and
261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months
18-73
during which the User discharges more than such quantities of any
hazardous waste do not require additional notification.
(iii) In the case of any new regulations under section 3001 of RCRA
identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing
any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the User must
notify the Control Authority, the EPA Regional Waste Management
Waste Division Director, and State hazardous waste authorities of
the discharge of such substance within ninety (90) days of the
effective date of such regulations.
(iv) In the case of any notification made under this Section, the User
shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and
toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has
determined to be economically practical.
(v) This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance
not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this Ordinance, an
issued industrial wastewater discharge permit, or any applicable
Federal or State law.
(g) Analytical Requirements. All pollutant analyses, including
sample techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge
permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the
techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto,
unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical Pretreatment
Standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical
techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the EPA determines
that the Part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are
inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses
shall be performed by using validated analytical methods or any other
applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures
suggested by the Control Authority or other parties approved by EPA.
(h) Sample Collection. Samples collected to satisfy reporting
requirements must be based on data obtained through appropriate
sampling and analysis performed during the period covered by the
report, based on data that is representative of conditions occurring
during the reporting period.
(i) Except as indicated in Section (ii) and (iii) below, the User must
collect wastewater samples using 24-hour flow-proportional
composite sampling techniques, unless time-proportional
composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the
Control Authority. Where time-proportional composite sampling
or grab sampling is authorized by the City, the samples must be
representative of the discharge. Using protocols (including
appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and
appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected
during a 24-hour period may be composited prior to analysis as
follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may
be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile
18-74
organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in
the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters
unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in
approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the City, as
appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to show
compliance with Instantaneous Limits (40 CFR 403.12(g)(3)).
(ii) Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total
phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be
obtained using grab collection techniques.
(iii) For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring
and 90-day compliance reports required in Section 6.1 and 6.3
[Tennessee Rule 0400-40-14-.12(2) and (4)], a minimum of four
(4) grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil
and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities
for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for
which historical sampling data are available, the Control
Authority may authorize a lower minimum. For reports required
by Section 18-406.4 paragraphs (Tennessee Rule 0400-40-14-
.12(5) and (8)), the Industrial User is required to collect the
number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure
compliance with applicable Pretreatment Standards and
Requirements.
(i) Date of Receipt Reports. Written reports will be deemed to have been
submitted on the date postmarked. For reports, which are not mailed
using the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report
shall govern.
(j) Retention of Records. Users subject to the reporting requirements
of this Ordinance shall retain, and make available for inspection and
copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any
monitoring activities required by the Ordinance, any additional records
of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken
by the User independent of such requirements, and documentation
associated with Best Management Practices, as set out in individual
wastewater discharge permits. Records shall include the date, exact
place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the person(s)
taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed
the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the
results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a
period of at least three (3) years after the expiration date of the User’s
permit. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of
any litigation concerning the User or the Control Authority, or where
the User has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by
the Control Authority, Approval Authority, or EPA.
(k) Certification Statements.
(i) Certification of Permit Applications, User Reports, and Initial
Monitoring Waiver – The following certification statement is
18-75
required to be signed and submitted by Users submitting permit
applications in accordance with Section 4; Users submitting

(l) Certification of Pollutants Not Present – Users that have an approved
monitoring waiver based on Section 18-406.4b. of this Ordinance must
certify on each report with the following statement that there has been
no increase in the pollutant in its wastestream due to activities of the
User.
“Based on my inquiry of the person(s) directly responsible for
managing compliance with the Pretreatment Standard for 40
CFR Part (s) ______ [specify applicable National Pretreatment
Standard part(s)], I certify that, to the best of my knowledge and
belief, there has been no increase in the level of ____________ [list
pollutant(s)] in the wastewaters due to the activities at the
facility since filing of the last periodic report under Section 18-
406.4a.” (Ord. # 801-11-2014, December 2014)
18-407. Right of Entry: Inspection and Testing. The Control
Authority shall have the right to enter the premises of any User to determine
whether the User is complying with all requirements of this Ordinance and any
individual wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder. Users shall
allow the Control Authority ready access at all reasonable times to all parts of the
premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination, and
copying, and the performance of any additional duties.
(1) Where a User has security measures in force which require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the User
shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that,
upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the
Control Authority, Approval Authority, and/or EPA shall be permitted
to enter for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities (40 CFR
403.12).
(2) The Control Authority, Approval Authority, and/or EPA shall have the
right to set up on the User’s property, or require installation of, such
devices as are necessary to conduct compliance monitoring/sampling
and/or metering of the User’s operations.
18-77
(3) The Control Authority may require the User to install monitoring
equipment as necessary. The facility’s sampling and monitoring
equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper
operating condition by the User at his own expense. All devices used to
measure wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated annually
(unless otherwise specified) to ensure their desired accuracy. The
location of the monitoring facility shall provide ample room in or near
the monitoring facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of
samples and on-site analysis (where necessary), whether constructed
on public or private property. The monitoring facilities should be
provided in accordance with the Control Authority’s requirements and
all applicable local construction standards and specifications, and such
facilities shall be constructed and maintained in such a manner to
enable the Control Authority to perform independent monitoring
activities.
(4) Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the
facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by
the User at the written or verbal request of the Control Authority and
shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne
by the User.
(5) Unreasonable delays in allowing the Control Authority access to the
User’s premises shall be a violation of this Ordinance. (Ord. # 801-11-
2014, December 2014)
18-408. Confidential Information. Information and data on a User
obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater discharge permit applications,
individual wastewater discharge permits and monitoring programs, and from the
Control Authority’s inspection and sampling activities, shall be available to the
public without restriction, unless the User specifically requests, and is able to
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Control Authority, that the release of such
information would divulge information, processes, or methods of production entitled
to protection as trade secrets under applicable State law. Any such request must be
asserted at the time of submission of the information or data. When requested and
demonstrated by the User furnishing a report that such information should be held
confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret
processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made
available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to the
NPDES program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings
involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and
characteristics and other effluent data, as defined at 40 CFR 2.302 shall not be
recognized as confidential information and shall be available to the public without
restriction. (Ord. # 801-11-2014, December 2014)
18-409. Publication of users in significant noncompliance. The
Control Authority shall publish annually, in a newspaper of general circulation that
provides meaningful public notice within the jurisdiction(s) served by the POTW, a
18-78
list of the Users which, at any time during the previous twelve (12) months, were in
Significant Noncompliance with applicable Pretreatment Standards and
Requirements. The term Significant Noncompliance shall be applicable to all
Significant Industrial Users (or any other Industrial user that violates paragraphs
(3), (4), or (8) of this Section) is in significant noncompliance if its violation meets
one or more of the following criteria:
(1) Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those in
which sixty-six percent (66%) or more of all the measurements taken for
the same pollutant parameter taken during a six (6) month period on a
rolling quarterly basis exceed (by any magnitude) a numeric Pretreatment
Standard or Requirement, including Instantaneous Limits as defined in
Section 18-401.4;
(2) Technical Review Criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in which
thirty three percent (33%) or more of wastewater measurements taken for
each pollutant parameter during a six (6) month period equals or exceeds
the product of the numeric Pretreatment Standard or Requirement
including Instantaneous Limits, as defined by Section 18-401.4 multiplied
by the applicable criteria (TRC=1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease,
NH3-N and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH);
(3) Any other violation of a Pretreatment Standard or Requirement as
defined by Section 18-401.4 (Daily Maximum, long-term average,
Instantaneous Limit, or narrative standard) that Control Authority
determines has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges,
Interference or Pass Through, including endangering the health of POTW
personnel or the general public;
(4) Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment to
human health, welfare, or to the environment, or has resulted in the
Control Authority’s exercise of its emergency authority under 40 CFR
403.8(f)(1)(vi)(B) to halt or prevent such a discharge;
(5) Failure to meet, within ninety (90) days of the scheduled date, a
compliance schedule milestone contained in an individual wastewater
discharge permit or enforcement order for starting construction,
completing construction, or attaining final compliance;
(6) Failure to provide within forty-five (45) days after the due date, any
required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on
compliance with categorical Pretreatment Standard deadlines, periodic
self monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance
schedules;
(7) Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or
(8) Any other violation(s), which may include a violation of Best Management
Practices, which the Control Authority determines will adversely affect
the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program. (Ord.
# 801-11-2014, December 2014)
18-79
18-410. Administrative enforcement remedies. All administrative
enforcement actions taken against a Significant Industrial User, including
procedures, order, and complaints, shall be in accordance with the Tennessee Water
Quality Control Act of 1977 and its amendments, specifically TCA 69-3-123, and
enforcement per the Enforcement Response Plan (ERP).
(1) Notification of Violation. When the Control Authority finds that a
User has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this
ordinance, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued
hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, the
Control Authority may serve upon that User a written Notice of
Violation. Within ten (10) days of the receipt of such notice, an
explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction
and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be
submitted by the User to the Control Authority. Submission of such a
plan in no way relieves the User of liability for any violations occurring
before or after receipt of the Notice of Violation. Nothing in this Section
shall limit the authority of the Control Authority to take any action,
including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without
first issuing a Notice of Violation.
(2) Consent Orders. The Control Authority may enter into Consent
Orders, assurances of compliance, or other similar documents
establishing an agreement with any User responsible for
noncompliance. Such documents shall include specific action to be
taken by the User to correct the noncompliance within a time period
specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force
and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to Sections 18-
410.4 and 18-410.5 of this ordinance and shall be judicially
enforceable.
(3) Show Cause Hearing. The Control Authority may order a User
which has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this
ordinance, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued
hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, to
appear before the Control Authority and show cause why the proposed
enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the
User specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed
enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the
User show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be
taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by
registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten (10)
days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any
Authorized Representative of the User as defined in Section 18-401.4
and required by Section 18-404.6. A show cause hearing shall not be a
bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the
User. Whether or not a duly notified User appears as noticed,
18-80
immediate enforcement action may be pursued. Hearings shall be
conducted in accordance with the provisions of TCA 69-3-124.
(4) Compliance Order. When the Control Authority finds that a User has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this ordinance, an
individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or
any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, the Control
Authority may issue an order to the User responsible for the discharge
directing that the User come into compliance within a specified time
period. If the User does not show compliance within the specified time,
sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment
facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and
properly operated to allow compliance with this ordinance. Compliance
orders may also contain other requirements to address the
noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring, the installation of
pretreatment system(s), and management practices designed to
minimize the amount of pollutant(s) discharged to the sewer. A
compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance
established for a Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, nor does a
compliance order relieve the User of liability for any violation,
including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order
shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action
against the User.
(5) Cease and Desist Orders. When the Control Authority finds that a
User has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this
Ordinance, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued
hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, or
that the User’s past violations are likely to recur, the Control
Authority may issue an order to the User directing it to cease and
desist all such violations and directing the User to:
(a) Immediately comply with all requirements; and/or
(b) Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation,
including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.
Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against,
or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the User.
(6) Administrative Penalties
(a) Notwithstanding any other section of this Ordinance, when the
Control Authority finds that a User has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this Ordinance, individual wastewater
discharge permit, and/or orders issued hereunder, and other
Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, or that the User’s past
violations are likely to recur, the Control Authority may be
penalize such a User in an amount not to exceed Ten Thousand
Dollars ($10,000.00). Such penalties shall be assessed on a per
violation, per day basis in accordance with the provisions of TCA
69-3-125, 126, 128 and 129 and 40 CFR 403.8 (f)(1)(vi)(A). In the
18-81
case of monthly or other long-term average discharge limits,
penalties shall be assessed for each day during the period of
violation. Each day on which noncompliance shall occur or
continue shall be deemed a separate and distinct violation. Such
assessments may be added to the User’s next scheduled sewer
service charge and the City shall have such other collection
remedies as available to collect other service charges.
(b) Unpaid charges and penalties shall constitute a lien against the
individual User’s property.
(c) Users desiring to dispute the assessment of such penalties must
file a written request for the City to reconsider the penalty
within ten (10) days of being notified of the penalty. Where the
City believes a request has merit, the Control Authority shall
convene a hearing on the matter within fifteen (15) days of
receiving the request from the User.
(d) Issuance of an administrative penalty shall not be a bar against,
or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the User.
(7) Emergency Suspensions
(a) The City may suspend the wastewater treatment service and/or
individual wastewater discharge permit of a User whenever
such suspension is necessary in order to stop an actual or
threatened discharge presenting or causing an imminent or
substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons,
the POTW, or the environment.
(b) Any User notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment
service and/or the individual wastewater discharge permit shall
immediately stop or eliminate its contribution of process
wastewater to the POTW. In the event of a User’s failure to
immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the
City shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including
immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or
minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or
endangerment to any individuals. The City may allow the User
to recommence its discharge when the User has demonstrated to
the satisfaction of the City that the period of endangerment has
passed, unless the termination proceedings set forth in Section
10.8 of this ordinance are initiated against the User.
(c) A User which is responsible, in whole or in part, for any
discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit to
the City a detailed written statement describing the causes of
the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any
future occurrence within five (5) days after notification of
suspension of service or prior to the date of the hearing
described in Section 18-410.3.
Nothing in this Section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing
prior to Emergency Suspension under this Section.
18-82
(8) Termination of Discharge. In addition to the provisions in Section
18-405.5 of this Ordinance, any User who violates the following
conditions is subject to discharge termination:
(a) Violation(s) of individual wastewater discharge permit
conditions;
(b) Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
(c) Failure to report significant changes in operations or
wastewater volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to
discharge;
(d) Refusal of reasonable access to the User’s premises for the
purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling;
(e) Violation of Pretreatment Standards in Section 18-402 of this
Ordinance.
Such User(s) will be notified of the proposed termination of its
discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under Section 18-410.3
of this Ordinance why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of
this option by the Control Authority shall not be bar to, or a prerequisite for,
taking any other action against the User. (Ord. # 801-11-2014, December
2014)
18-411. Judicial enforcement remedies. If any User discharges sewage,
industrial wastes, or other wastes into the POTW contrary to the provisions of this
Ordinance or any order or individual wastewater discharge permit issued
hereunder, the City through the City Attorney, may commence an action for
appropriate legal and/or equitable relief in the Chancery Court for Hardin County.
Any judicial proceedings and relief shall be in accordance with the provisions of
TCA 69-3-127.
(1) Injunctive Relief. Whenever a User has violated or continues to
violate the provisions of this Ordinance or individual wastewater
discharge permit, order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment
Standard or Requirement ,the City, through the City Attorney, may
petition the Court for the issuance of a preliminary or permanent
injunction or both (as may be appropriate) which restrains or compels
the specific performance of the individual wastewater discharge permit
or other requirement imposed by this ordinance on activities of the
User. The City may also seek such other action as is appropriate for
legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the User to
conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief
shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action
against a User.
(2) Civil Penalties.
(a) A User who has violated or continues to violate any provision of
this Ordinance, an individual wastewater discharge permit, an
order issued hereunder, or any Pretreatment Standard or
Requirement shall be liable to the City for a maximum civil
18-83
penalty of ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00), per violation, per
day. In the case of a monthly or other long-term average
discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the
period of the violation.
(b) The City may recover reasonable attorneys’ fees, court costs,
engineering fees, and other expenses associated with
enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring
expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the
City.
(c) In determining amount of liability, the Court shall take into
account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to
the extent of the harm caused by the violation, the magnitude
and duration, any economic benefit gained through the User’s
violation, corrective actions by the User, the compliance history
of the User, and any other factor as justice requires.
(d) Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against a User.
(3) Criminal Prosecution. Pursuant to Section 69-3-115(4)(c) of the
Tennessee Code Annotated, violators will be prosecuted for a Class E
Felony and punished by a fine of not more than twenty five thousand
dollars ($25,000.00) or incarceration, or both.
(4) Remedies Nonexclusive. The remedies provided for in this ordinance
are not exclusive. The Control Authority may take any, all, or any
combination of these actions against a noncompliant User.
Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance
with the City’s Enforcement Response Plan. However, the City may
take other action against any User when the circumstances are
warranted. Further, the City is empowered to take more than one
enforcement action against any noncompliant User. (Ord. # 801-11-
2014, December 2014)
18-412. (1) Treatment Upset
(a) Any User which experiences an upset in operations that places it
in a temporary state of noncompliance, which is not the result of
operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities,
inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventative
maintenance, or careless or improper operation, shall inform the
Control Authority thereof immediately upon becoming aware of
the upset.
(b) A User who wishes to establish affirmative defense of a
treatment upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed,
contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that:
(i) An upset occurred and the User can identify the cause(s)
of the upset;
18-84
(ii) The facility was, at the time, being operated in a prudent
and workman-like manner and in compliance with
applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and
(iii) The User has submitted the following information to the
Control Authority within twenty-four (24) hours of
becoming aware of the upset (where such information is
provided orally, a written report thereof shall be filed by
the User within five (5) days): The report shall contain:
(A) A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
(B) The duration of noncompliance, including exact
dates and times of noncompliance, and, if the
noncompliance is continuing, the time by which
compliance is reasonably expected to be restored;
(C) All steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and
prevent reoccurrence of such an upset.
(c) An Industrial User which complies with the notification
provisions of this Section in a timely manner shall have
affirmative defense to any enforcement action brought by the
City for any noncompliance with this Ordinance, or an order or
individual wastewater discharge permit issued hereunder to the
Industrial User, which arises out of violations attributable and
alleged to have occurred during the period of the documented
and verified upset.
(d) In any enforcement proceeding, the Industrial User seeking to
establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of
proof.
(e) Industrial Users shall have the opportunity for a judicial
determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement
action brought for noncompliance with categorical Pretreatment
Standards.
(f) The Industrial User shall control production of all discharges to
the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical
Pretreatment Standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its
treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative
method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in
the situation where, among other things, the primary source of
power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.
(2) Prohibited Discharge Standards. A User shall have affirmative defense
to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the
general prohibitions in Section 18-402.9a. of this Ordinance or the specific
prohibitions in Section 18-402.9b.(i) through 18-402.9b.(xvi) of this
Ordinance if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know,
that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other
sources, would cause Pass Through or Interference and that either:
18-85
(a) A Local Limit exists for each pollutant discharge and the User was
in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the Pass
Through or Interference; or
(b) No Local Limit exists, but the discharge did not change
substantially in nature or constituents from the User’s prior
discharge when the Control Authority was regularly in compliance
with its NPDES permit, and in the case of Interference, was in
compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.
The affirmative defense outlined in this Section does not apply
to the specific prohibitions in Section 18-402.9b.(i), (iii), and (xiv) of
this Ordinance.
(3) Bypass
(a) For the purposes of this Section:
(i) Bypass means the intentional diversion of waste streams
from any portion of a User’s treatment facility.
(ii) Severe property damage means substantial physical
damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which
causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and
permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be
expected to occur in the absence of bypass. Sever property
damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in
production.
(b) Bypass not violating applicable Pretreatment Standards or
Requirements – A User may allow any bypass to occur which does
not cause Pretreatment Standards or Requirements to be violated,
but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient
operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of
paragraphs (c) and (d) of this Section.
(c) Bypass Notification
(i) If a User knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it
shall submit prior notice to the Control Authority, if possible,
at least ten (10) days before the date of the bypass.
(ii) A User shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated
bypass that exceeds applicable Pretreatment Standards to
the Control Authority within twenty four (24) hours from the
time the User becomes aware of the bypass. A written
submission shall also be provided within five (5) days of the
time the User becomes aware of the bypass. The written
submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its
cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and
times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the
anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or
planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the
bypass. The Control Authority may waive the written report
on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received
within twenty four (24) hours.
18-86
(d) Prohibition of Bypass
(i) Bypass is prohibited, and the Control Authority may take
enforcement action against the User for a bypass, unless:
(A) The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life,
personal injury, or sever property damage;
(B) There was no feasible alternative to the bypass,
including the use of auxiliary treatment facilities,
retention of untreated wastes, or maintenances during
normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition
is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should
have been installed in the exercise of reasonable
engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which
occurred during normal periods of equipment
downtime or preventative maintenance; and
(C) The User properly notified the Control Authority as
required by paragraph (c) above.
(ii) The Control Authority may approve an anticipated
bypass, after considering its effects, if the Control Authority
determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in
paragraph (d)(i) of this Section. (Ord. # 801-11-2014,
December 2014)
18-413. Fees.
(1) Purpose. It is the purpose of this Section to provide for the recovery
of costs from Users of the City’s POTW system for the implementation
of the program established herein. The applicable charges or fees shall
be set forth in the City’s Schedule of Charges and Fees.
(2) Pretreatment Charges and Fees. The City may adopt reasonable
fees for reimbursement of costs of setting up and operating the City’s
Pretreatment Program, which may include:
(a) Fees for wastewater discharge permit applications including the
cost of processing such applications;
(b) Fees for monitoring, inspection, and surveillance procedures
including the cost of collection and analyzing a User’s discharge,
and reviewing monitoring reports and certification statements
by Users;
(c) Fees for reviewing and responding to accidental discharge
procedures and construction;
(d) Fees for filing appeals;
(e) Fees to recover administrative and legal costs (not included in
Section 18-413.2b.) associated with the enforcement activity
taken by the Control Authority to address Industrial User
noncompliance;
(f) Fees for inspection of Building Sewer connections;
18-87
(g) Charges to Users for recovery of costs associated with normal
operation, maintenance, administration, amortization of debt
and depreciation of the POTW; and
(h) Other fees as the City may deem necessary to carry out the
requirements contained herein. These fees relate solely to the
matters covered by this Ordinance and are separate from all
other fees, fines, and penalties chargeable by the City.
(3) Distribution of Costs
(a) Distribution of the costs associated with the POTW shall be
proportional to the actual cost associated with the User’s waste.
Users are divided into three categories; residential, commercial,
and industrial. Cost per thousand gallons of waste flow is equal
for each category until such time as when a major industrial
contributor is connected to the POTW. (See Schedule of Rates
and Charges)
(b) The User Charge for normal domestic wastewater shall be based
on the water usage as measured by the public water supply
meter(s) and/or by any supplementary meter(s) necessary to
estimate the amount of wastewater discharged to the POTW.
The basic User Charge shall be determined upon the metered
flow and at rates as provided in the Schedule of Rates and
Charges. A cap or maximum Wastewater Charge during four (4)
summer billing periods shall be established for Users occupying
single family residential dwellings only. This maximum charge
shall be defined as:
(i) A consumption cap shall be established from the
previous eight (8) billing periods for each single family
residential User. If said User was not present at the
service location for any or all of the eight (8) billing
periods, the Department shall determine the consumption
cap from the best information available. If the User
received a leak adjustment during this time, said period
covered by the leak adjustment shall be deleted from
consideration for the consumption cap.
(ii) Each single family residential User shall be
charged at the actual rates for amounts of consumption
below and/or up to the established consumption cap.
Should the User exceed the consumption cap during the
four (4) summer billing periods, no charge will be made
for amounts in excess of the consumption cap.
(iii) The consumption cap shall not apply for the
remaining eight (8) billing periods and actual
consumption will be charged at the actual User Charge
Rate.
(4) Surcharge Fee. If a Significant Industrial User discharges in excess
of the Criteria to Protect the POTW Treatment Plant Influent set for
18-88
the pollutants BOD5, TSS, NH3-N, and/or free oil and grease at
Appendix, additional operation and maintenance costs will be incurred
by the City. Therefore, any Significant Industrial User who discharges
in excess of the limits for any of these pollutants will be subject to a
surcharge. The formula for this surcharge is listed below. Surcharges
shall be in addition to normal user fees.
Base Sewer Actual Monthly Average of Base Sewer
Bill for x Parameter Concentration (mg/l) - Bill for
Monthly Usage Threshold Limitation on Monthly Usage
Wastewater Strength Monthly
Average Concentration (mg/l)
The City also reserves the right to, at any time, place limits
which may not be exceeded on the Significant Industrial User’s
discharge if the Significant Industrial User’s discharge of the excessive
strength wastewater causes the POTW Treatment Plant to violate its
NPDES permit.
The City may calculate surcharge fees based on actual costs
caused by the discharge of excessive strength conventional pollutants.
(Ord. # 801-11-2014, December 2014)
18-414. Severability. If any provision, paragraph, word, section, or
chapter of this Ordinance is invalidated by any court of competent jurisdiction, the
remaining provisions, paragraphs, words, sections, and chapters shall not be
affected and shall continue in full force and effect. (Ord. # 801-11-2014, December
2014)
18-415. Appendix – Pollutant parameters. (Subject to Change by
Addenda applicable to new or revised “Pass Through Limitations” issued to the City
by the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation, Division of Water
Resources. The revision date will be noted in the revised Appendix.)

18-701. Mayor authorized to execute contract. The Mayor of the City of
Savannah is hereby authorized to enter into and execute a contract for the sale of
water to the Aqua Utility Company and/or its successors which shall include the
following terms and conditions. (1988 Code, § 13-801)
18-702. Terms.
(1) The seller agrees:
(a) Quality and quantity. To furnish the purchaser, at the point of
delivery hereinafter specified, during the term of this contract or
any renewal or extension thereof, potable treated water meeting
applicable purity standards of the Tennessee Department of
Public Health, in such quantity as may be required by the
purchaser, not to exceed eight million (8,000,000) gallons per
month.
(b) Point of delivery and pressure. That water will be furnished at a
reasonably constant pressure calculated at sixty to eighty (60 –
80) lbs. from an existing ten inch (10") main supply at a point
located at Point Grande Drive and Pyburn Road. If a greater
pressure than that normally available at the point of delivery is
required by the purchaser, the cost of providing such greater
pressure shall be borne by the purchaser. Emergency failures of
pressure or supply due to main supply line breaks, power failures,
floods, fires and use of water to fight fires, earthquakes or other
catastrophes shall excuse the seller from this provision for such
reasonable period of time as may be necessary to restore service.
(c) Metering equipment. To furnish, install, operate, and maintain
at its own expense at the point of delivery, the necessary metering
equipment, including a meter house or pit, and required devices of
standard type for properly measuring the quantity of water
delivered to the purchaser and to calibrate such metering
equipment whenever requested by the purchaser. A meter
registering not more than two percent (2%) above or below the
test result shall be deemed to be accurate. The previous reading
of any meter disclosed by test to be inaccurate shall be corrected
for the two (2) months previous to such test in accordance with
the percentage of inaccuracy found by such tests. If any meter
fails to register for any period, the amount of water delivered in
the corresponding period immediately prior to the failure, unless
18-99
seller and purchaser shall agree upon a different amount. The
metering equipment shall be read on a monthly basis. An
appropriate official of the purchaser, at all reasonable times,
shall have access to the meter for the purpose of verifying its
readings.
(d) Billing procedure. To furnish the purchaser, not later than the
15th day of each month, with an itemized statement of the
amount of water furnished the purchaser during the preceding
month.
(2) The purchaser agrees:
(a) Rates and payment date. To pay the seller, not later than the last
day of each month, for water delivered in accordance with the
following schedule of rates:
(i.) One dollar and sixty-five cents ($1.65) per one thousand
(1,000) gallons.
(b) Connection fee. To pay as an agreed cost, a connection fee to
connect the seller's system to the system of the purchaser, the
sum of twenty thousand dollars ($20,000.00) which shall cover
any and all costs of the seller for initial installation of the
metering equipment. In addition thereto, purchaser shall be
required to place on deposit with the City of Savannah the sum
of five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) which shall be deemed by the
parties as a refundable service deposit. Said deposit shall be in
the name of the seller. The purchaser shall receive the interest
therefrom provided it pays its bills as required by this
agreement. Any additional meters required shall be subject to
additional connection fees.
(c) Deed of water line. The purchaser agrees, to convey the necessary
water line easement, which shall be at least twenty feet (20'), and
the ten inch (10") water line itself, consisting of some seven
thousand two hundred feet (7,200') to the seller upon execution of
this contract, for no consideration. Said line is located on south
right-of-way of Pyburn Road. Purchaser agrees that said right-ofway
is not encumbered in any way by it and that county has
authorized the placing of said line on its right-of-way.
(3) It is further mutually agreed between the seller and the purchaser as
follows:
(a) Term of contract. That this contract shall extend for a term of
twenty (20) years from the date of the initial delivery of any water
as shown by the first bill submitted by the seller to the purchaser
and, thereafter may be renewed or extended for such term, or
terms, as may be agreed upon by the seller and the purchaser.
(b) Delivery of water. That thirty (30) days prior to the estimated
date of first demand for water delivery to the purchaser's water
supply distribution system, the purchaser will notify the seller in
18-100
writing the date for the initial delivery of water; however this
provision may be waived by mutual consent.
(c) Water for testing. When requested by the purchaser, the seller
will make available at the point of delivery, or other reasonably
close thereto, water sufficient for testing, flushing, and trench
filling the system of the purchaser during construction,
irrespective of whether the meeting equipment has been installed
at that time, at the regular contract rate herein provided, which
will be paid by the purchaser.
(d) Failure to deliver. That the seller will, at all times, operate and
maintain its system in an efficient manner and will take such
action as may be necessary to furnish the purchaser with
quantities of water required by the purchaser. Temporary or
partial failures to deliver water shall be remedied with all
possible dispatch. In the event of any extended shortage of water,
or if the supply of water available to the seller is otherwise
diminished over an extended period of time, the supply of
water to purchaser's customers shall be reduced or diminished
in the same ratio or proportion as the supply to seller's other
customers is reduced or diminished.
(e) Modification of contract. That the provisions of this contract
pertaining to the rate to be paid by the purchaser for water
delivered are subject to modification at the end of every one (1)
year period. The rate charged under this contract per one
thousand (1,000) gallons shall be equal to the base rate per
one thousand (1,000) gallons charged by the City of Savannah to
its residential and/or commercial customers located inside the
city.
(f) Regulatory agencies. That this contract is subject to such rules,
regulations, or laws as may be applicable to similar agreements in
this state and the seller and purchaser will collaborate in
obtaining such permits, certificates, or the like, as may be
required to comply therewith. In the event the purchaser shall
operate its system in a manner so as to clearly violate state
statutes or regulations to which this agreement is subject, or in
such a manner as to constitute an imminent threat to the seller's
supply system, then the seller shall have the right to discontinue
service until such time as such conditions are remedied.
(g) Miscellaneous. In the event the purchaser shall sell its water
distribution system and assets pertaining thereto to a utility
district, a corporation not for profit authorized to engage in such
utility services, a water co-op, or any other type of legal entity
formed under the laws of the State of Tennessee, this contract
shall be assignable with all other assets of the Aqua Utility
Company's water distribution system and such assignee, upon
notice of consummation of the sale given to the seller, shall
18-101
succeed to all rights and assume all liabilities of the purchaser
under this contract.
(h) Assignment. This contract may be assignable for security
purposes under any bond resolution adopted by the purchaser or
any successor of the purchaser under chapter 6 hereof. (1988
Code, § 13-802)

18-802. Standards. The City of Savannah Public Water Supply is to
comply with Tennessee Code Annotated, §§ 68-221-701 through 68-221-720 as well
as the rules and regulations for public water supplies, legally adopted in accordance
with this code, which pertain to cross connections, auxiliary intakes, bypasses, and
interconnections, and establish an effective ongoing program to control these
undesirable water uses. (1988 Code, § 8-502)
18-803. Construction, operation, and supervision. It shall be
unlawful for any person to cause a cross connection to be made, or allow one to exist
for any purpose whatsoever, unless the construction and operation of same have
been approved by the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation and
the operation of such cross connection, auxiliary intake, bypass or interconnection is
at all times under the direct supervision of the director of the waterworks of the
city. (1988 Code, § 8-503)
18-804. Statement required. Any person whose premises are supplied
with water from the public water supply and who also has on the same premises a
separate source of water supply, or stores water in an uncovered or unsanitary
storage reservoir from which the water stored therein is circulated through a piping
system, shall file with the director of waterworks a statement of the non-existence
of unapproved or unauthorized cross connections, auxiliary intakes, bypasses, or
interconnections. Such statement shall also contain an agreement that no cross
connection, auxiliary intake, bypass, or interconnection will be permitted upon the
premises. (1988 Code, § 8-504)

or his authorized representative shall have the right to enter, at any reasonable
time, any property served by a connection to the Savannah Public Water Supply for
the purpose of inspecting the piping system or systems therein for cross
connections, auxiliary intakes, bypasses, or interconnections. On request, the
owner, lessee, or occupant of any property so served shall furnish to the inspection
agency any pertinent information regarding the piping system or systems on such
property. The refusal of such information or refusal of access, when requested, shall
be deemed evidence of the presence of cross connections. (1988 Code, § 8-506)
18-104
18-807. Correction of existing violations. Any person who now has
cross connections, auxiliary intakes, bypasses, or interconnections in violation of the
provisions of this chapter shall be allowed a reasonable time within which to comply
with the provisions of this chapter. After a thorough investigation of existing
conditions and an appraisal of the time required to complete the work, the amount
of time shall be designated by the director of public utilities.
The failure to correct conditions threatening the safety of the public water
system as prohibited by this chapter and the Tennessee Code Annotated, § 68-221-
711, within a reasonable time and within the time limits set by the director of the
waterworks shall be grounds for denial of water service. If proper protection has not
been provided after a reasonable time, the utility shall give the customer legal
notification that water service is to be discontinued and shall physically separate
the public water supply from the customer's on-site piping system in such a manner
that the two (2) systems cannot again be connected by an unauthorized person.
Where cross connections, interconnections, auxiliary intakes, or bypasses are
found that constitute an extreme hazard of immediate concern of contaminating the
public water system, the director of public utilities shall require that immediate
corrective action be taken to eliminate the threat to the public water system.
Immediate steps shall be taken to disconnect the public water supply from the onsite
piping system unless the imminent hazard(s) is (are) corrected immediately.
(1988 Code, § 8-507)
18-808. Use of protective devices. Where the nature of use of the
water supplied a premises by the water department is such that it is deemed:
(1) Impractical to provide an effective air-gap separation.
(2) That the owner and/or occupant of the premises cannot, or is not
willing, to demonstrate to the official in charge of the water supply, or his
designated representative, that the water use and protective features of the
plumbing are such as to propose no threat to the safety or potability of the water
supply.
(3) That the nature and mode of operation within a premises are such that
frequent alterations are made to the plumbing.
(4) There is a likelihood that protective measures may be subverted,
altered, or disconnected, the Director of the Public Utilities of the City of Savannah
or his designated representative, shall require the use of an approved protective
device on the service line serving the premises to assure that any contamination
that may originate in the customer's premises is contained therein. The protective
device shall be a reduced pressure zone type backflow preventer approved by the
Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation as to manufacture, model,
and size. The method of installation of backflow protective devices shall be approved
by the director of public utilities prior to installation and shall comply with the
criteria set forth by the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation.
The installation shall be at the expense of the owner or occupant of the premises.
The Director of the Public Utilities of the City of Savannah shall have the
right to inspect and test the device or devices on an annual basis or whenever
deemed necessary by the director of public utilities or his designated representative.
18-105
Water service shall not be disrupted to test the device without the knowledge of the
occupant of the premises.
Where the use of water is critical to the continuance of normal operations or
protection of life, property, or equipment, duplicate units shall be provided to avoid
the necessity of discontinuing water service to test or repair the protective device or
devices. Where it is found that only one unit has been installed and the
continuance of service is critical, the director shall notify, in writing, the occupant of
the premises of plans to discontinue water service and arrange for a mutually
acceptable time to test and/or repair the device. The director shall require the
occupant of the premises to make all repairs indicated promptly, to keep the unit(s)
working properly, and the expense of such repairs shall be borne by the owner or
occupant of the premises. Repairs shall be made by qualified personnel acceptable
to the director of public utilities.
The failure to maintain backflow prevention devices in proper working
order shall be grounds for discontinuing water service to a premises. Likewise, the
removal, bypassing, or altering of the protective devices or the installation thereof
so as to render the devices ineffective shall constitute grounds for discontinuance of
water service. Water service to such premises shall not be restored until the
customer has corrected or eliminated such conditions or defects to the satisfaction of
the director of public utilities. (1988 Code, § 8-508)
18-809. Unpotable water to be labeled. In order that the potable
water supply made available to premises served by the public water supply shall be
protected from possible contamination as specified herein, any water outlet which
could be used for potable or domestic purposes and which is not supplied by the
potable system must be labeled in a conspicuous manner as:
WATER UNSAFE
FOR DRINKING
The minimum acceptable sign shall have black letters at least one inch (1")
high located on a red background. (1988 Code, § 8-509)
18-810. Violations. The requirements contained herein shall apply to
all premises served by the city water system whether located inside or outside the
corporate limits and are hereby made a part of the conditions required to be met for
the city to provide water services to any premises. Such action, being essential for
the protection of the water distribution system against the entrance of
contamination which may render the water unsafe health wise, or otherwise
undesirable, shall be enforced rigidly without regard to location of the premises,
whether inside or outside the corporate limits.
Any person who neglects or refuses to comply with any of the provisions of
this chapter shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction therefor,
shall be fined under the general penalty clause for this municipal code of
ordinances. (1988 Code, § 8-510)

approximately one thousand (1,000) BTU per cubic foot heat content and
approximately 0.6 specific gravity as referred to air, an at a nominal pressure of
seven inches (7”) water column above atmosphere. The department reserves the
right to furnish substitute or supplemental gas of different heat content and/or
specific gravity either in the event of emergency or for other reasons. Pressure
specified herein is nominal pressure and the department does not guarantee actual
pressure. (1988 Code, § 13-502)
19-103. Non-standard service. For service at other than standard
pressure, the customer shall confer with the department regarding the type of
19-3
service required. Before the customer proceeds with the purchase of equipment or
piping in such cases, he should contact the department, which will furnish
information, in writing, on the ability of the department to meet special
requirements. The customer shall pay the cost of any special installation which is
made to meet his peculiar requirements.
For billing purposes, the volume or quantity of gas delivered to a customer
using non-standard service, as metered or estimated, shall be corrected, in
accordance with Boyle’s Law, to its equivalent volume at a gauge pressure of four
(4) ounces per square inch. (1988 Code, § 13-503)
19-104. Obtaining service. Customers are reminded that a formal
application for either original or additional service must be made at the office of the
department and be duly approved before connection or meter installation orders will
be issued and work performed. (1988 Code, § 13-504)
19-105. Meters. No one shall do anything which will in any way
interfere with or prevent the proper registration of a meter. No one shall tamper
with or work on a gas meter without the written permission of the department. No
one shall install any pipe or other device which will cause gas to pass through or
around a meter without the passage of such gas being fully registered by the meter.
(1988 Code, § 13-505)
19-106. Additional load. Meters and equipment supplied by the
department for each customer have definite capacities and no major addition to the
equipment or load connected thereto shall be made except by consent of the
department. (1988 Code, § 13-506)
19-107. Meter tests. The department will, at its own expense, make
periodic tests and inspections of its meters in order to maintain a high standard of
accuracy. The department will make additional tests or inspection of its meters at
the request of the customer. If such tests show that the meter is accurate within
two percent (2%), slow or fast, no adjustments will be made in the customer’s bill
and a testing charge as per schedule of rates and charges shall be paid by the
customer. The department will make additional tests or inspection of its meters at
the request of the customer. In case the test shows the meter to be in excess of two
percent (2%), fast or slow, the meter will be replaced. An adjustment will be made
in the customer’s bill over a reasonable period as determined by the department.
Should a meter fail to properly register the amount of gas, the department
reserves the right to render an estimated bill from the best information available.
(1988 Code, § 13-507)
19-108. Meter locations. For new installations, department approval of
meter locations shall be obtained before any piping is installed. The customer or
owner of the premises shall provide a suitable location, satisfactory to the
19-4
department, for all meeting equipment. The location must protect this equipment
from undue exposure to heat, dampness, dust, dirt or other cause of damage. It
must permit ready access for inspection, repair or removal of the metering
equipment and must permit the meter being easily read from outside the building
except that meters in apartment buildings containing four (4) or more units, and in
offices and businesses places, may be installed in suitable locations open to access
during all normal business hours.
When two (2) or more meters are to be installed in one/(1) premise, such as
an office building or apartment building, they shall be grouped in one (1) common
place, accessible at all times during normal business hours. The expense of
installing such meter centers, except for the immediate connections from the meters
to the meter manifold shall be borne by the customer.
Except with written approval by the department, all meters shall be located
immediately adjacent to the point where the service line enters the building. In no
event shall any portion of the service line inside the building be concealed in walls
or otherwise nor shall any meter be located above the first or ground level floor.
Meters at present located in positions not in conformity with the foregoing
requirements shall be moved, at the expense of the customer, to locations which do
conform when:
(1) The building in which the meter is located is undergoing major
structural alterations involving change in the gas piping.
(2) The customer desires the meter to be relocated for his convenience.
(3) Changes are made in the building which make the meter
inaccessible.
(4) A customer is found to be preventing or avoiding proper registration by
the meter.
The department reserves the right to move a meter, at its own expense, to a
more accessible location despite the fact that it may have previously approved the
location no longer desired by the department. If the meter is moved by the
department, the customer will be required to move their service line to the new
meter location at no cost to the department.
Where a gas line is adjacent to industrial property, the city will pay for
labor to provide gas lines to the meters of industrial customers and the industrial
customers will pay for all materials, including the meter. Under special
circumstances, and upon consideration from the board of utilities, the city
commission may consider a modification of this policy. (1988 Code, § 13-508, as
amended by Ord. #564-4-98, June 1998)
19-109. Multiple service through a single meter. Service will not be
furnished through a single service line and meter to more than one (1) dwelling or
one (1) premises with the following exceptions:
(1) Building under one (1) ownership that has a number of apartments,
offices or stores under one (1) roof.
19-5
(2) Mobile home or trailer park (such park is defined as having three (3) or
more units).
Contract for services of the above exceptions shall be with the owner. (1988
Code, § 13-509)
19-110. Service lines. The department will install, in a location which
the department will determine, a service line from the gas distribution main to the
meter location. The customer shall reimburse the department for the cost of that
part of the service line in excess of one hundred feet (100’) as calculated from the
gas distribution main.
The service line from the main to the meter shall remain the property of the
department and will be maintained by the department. Damage to said service line
by customer, customer's agent, household member, etc. shall be repaired by the
department of which all cost for repair shall be borne by the customer unless
customer requested line location by the department and said location was
inaccurate.
If location of service line by the department was accurate and damage to said
service line was still incurred, customer will be responsible for repair cost by the
department. (1988 Code, § 13-510)
19-111. Point of delivery. Except as may be otherwise provided by
written agreement, the point of delivery for gas services to a customer by the
department shall be defined as the outlet side of the gas meter. All piping and
equipment beyond the point of delivery shall be the property of and be maintained
by the customer. The department shall not be liable for injury to person or property
on account of any defect or negligence in the installation, maintenance or use of any
piping or equipment beyond said pint of delivery.(1988 Code, § 13-511)
19-112. Multiple delivery points. The rates fixed in the schedule of
rates and charges for each class of service are based on the supply of service to the
entire premises through a single service line and meter location. Separate supply
for the same customer at other points of consumption shall be separately metered
and billed. (1988 Code, § 13-512)
19-113. Street excavations and restoration. In the event the
department shall remove any pavement and dig a trench in making the connection
from the gas main to the property line, and shall damage the surface of any street,
sidewalk, curb or gutter, then the department shall refill any ditch so dug and
repair any damage to any curb, gutter or sidewalk. In refilling the ditch in said
street, the department shall tamp the same and compact the dirt as near as possible
to the condition it was before the opening of such ditch, and shall place on top of the
same gravel or crushed stone for the purpose of the paved surface or pavement on
the street being replaced. The replacing of the surface or pavement on the street
shall be done by the street department of the City of Savannah within the corporate
19-6
limits. County and state roads shall be the responsibility of the department as
negotiated with the individual government entity. (1988 Code, § 13-513)
19-114. Main extensions.
(1) Gas service to any development, subdivision, large commercial or
industrial customer which requires any extensions, additions or improvements to
the department's gas system will be furnished only pursuant to written contract
satisfactory to the department and then only:
(a) When it appears to the satisfaction of the department that the
cost of any such required extensions, additions and improvements
will enable the department to receive such income as required to
amortize such cost over a ten (10) year period; or
(b) Upon the customer paying in advance the estimated cost of
making any such required extensions, additions or improvements,
or a part thereof.
(2) Except as herein provided, usual and ordinary extensions, additions
and improvement to the department's gas system required to furnish gas service to
existing residential and small commercial customers will be installed without cost
to individual customers if the extensions do not exceed one hundred feet (100') in
length per customer and provided that the extensions or improvements required
shall be installed only in streets, alleys, or other ways dedicated to public use or in
easements acceptable to the department. Main extensions in excess of one hundred
feet (100') may be made provided any excess cost over that for the stated footage
limits is paid by the customer on a non-refundable basis.
(3) All such extensions shall become the property of the department, as
they are made, even though all or some part of the cost thereof is paid by parties
other than the department. Main extensions will be sized by the department to
handle present and future requirements, but when the customer is required to
finance a main extension, the cost shall be based on the size necessary to serve the
demand, but in no event less than two inch (2") main. No refunds shall be made by
the department for service connections attached to the mains installed pursuant to
this section.
(4) Whenever the department is of the opinion that it is to the best
interests of the gas division to construct a gas main extension without requiring
strict compliance with the foregoing provisions of this section, such extensions may
be constructed upon such terms and conditions as shall be approved by the
department.
The authority to make gas main extensions pursuant to the foregoing
provisions of this section are permissive only, and nothing contained therein shall
be construed as requiring the department to make gas main extensions to furnish
service to any person or persons, even though such prospective customers meet all
of the requirements contained in the foregoing provisions of this section, so as to
authorize the department to make a main extension pursuant to said provisions.
(1988 Code, § 13-514)
19-7
19-115. Customer's piping and appliances--standards. All gas
piping beyond the outlet side of the meter shall be installed and maintained at the
expense of the customer. In the case of new installations, or replacement of or
change in now existing installations all such piping and appliance installations
shall be installed in accordance with the applicable requirements and specifications
of the Southern Building Standard Gas Code and in accordance with the ordinances
of the City of Savannah.
In case of irreconcilable conflicts between the requirements of the applicable
regulations mentioned above, the ordinances of the City of Savannah shall control
as to installations.

reasonable times for the purpose of reading meters, for testing, inspecting,
repairing, and replacing all equipment belonging to the department, and for
inspecting customer's piping, appliances, and premises in order to determine that
the department's rules and regulations are being complied with. (1988 Code, § 13-
516)
19-117. Inspections. The department shall have the right, but shall not
be obligated, to inspect any installation before gas is introduced or at any later time.
The department reserves the right to refuse or discontinue service to any piping,
equipment, or appliances, not in accordance with the Southern Building Standard
Gas Code specifications, or city ordinances, or which are not in accordance with any
special contract, these rules and regulations, or other requirements of the
department, but any failure to exercise this right shall not render the department
liable or responsible for any loss or damage resulting from defects in the
installation, piping, or appliances, or from violation of the International Fuel Gas
Code specifications, city ordinances, or the provisions of any special contract, or
from accidents which may occur upon the customer's premises.
The department shall not be obligated to connect and render service to new
buildings or premises not now approved for gas service until such time as approval
has been rendered by the department. (1988 Code, § 13-517, modified)
19-118. Notice of trouble. Customer shall notify the department
immediately should the service be unsatisfactory for any reason, or should there be
any defects, trouble, or accidents affecting the supply of gas. Such notice, if verbal,
should be confirmed in writing. (1988 Code, § 13-518)
19-8

Except as herein elsewhere expressly provided, all meters, service connections, and
other equipment furnished by the department shall be and remain the property of
the department. Customer shall provide a space for and exercise proper care to
protect the property of the department on his premises; and in the event of loss or
damage to the department's property, arising from neglect of customer to care for
same, the cost of necessary repairs or replacements shall be paid by the customer.
(1988 Code, § 13-519)
19-120. Customer's responsibility for violation of rules and
regulations. Where the department furnishes gas service to a customer, such
customer shall be responsible to the department for all violations of the rules,
regulations, and rate schedules of the department, which violations occur on the
premises served or in connection with such service. Personal participation by the
customer in any such violations shall not be necessary to impose such personal
responsibility on the customer. (1988 Code, § 13-520)
19-121. Resale service. The customer shall not directly or indirectly,
sell, sublet, assign, or otherwise dispose of the gas supplied to him by the
department, or any part thereof, except with written permission from the
department. No customer shall, in the distribution or use of gas furnished by the
department, distribute gas through any pipes installed across or along property
owned by any others, or installed on any street, alley, road or other public way.
(1988 Code, § 13-521)

523)
19-124. Damages due to pressure fluctuations. The department
shall not be liable for personal injuries or for any damages to a customer's
equipment or property, which may be caused by high pressure, by low pressure, or

responsible for protecting his service from pressure fluctuations by installing
automatic safety pilot lights, pressure regulators, and other standard protective
devices. (1988 Code, § 13-524)
19-9
19-125. Interruption of service. The department will endeavor to
furnish continuous gas service, and to maintain reasonably constant pressure, but
the department cannot and does not guarantee to the consumer any fixed pressure
or continuous service. The department shall not be liable for any damages for any
interruption of disturbance of service whatsoever.
In connection with the operation, maintenance, repair and extension of the
department's gas system, the gas supply may be shut off without notice, when
necessary or desirable; and each customer must be prepared for such emergencies.
The department shall not be held liable for any damages from such interruption of
service or for damages from the resumption of service without notice after any such

gas shortage, the department reserves the right to restrict the purposes for which
gas may be used by a customer and the amount of gas which a customer may use. A
time of gas shortage within the meaning of this rule shall be deemed to exist
whenever the actual use or the reasonably anticipated use of gas in any day or other
period of time, from the department's natural gas supplier without incurring any
overrun penalties.
Insofar as is reasonably practicable, priorities shall be established by the
department as required.

If a customer fails to comply with any restriction or curtailment made
effective by the department, the department may take such remedial actions as it
deems appropriate under the circumstances including temporarily disconnecting
gas service and charging additional amounts because of the excess usage of gas.
Where for any reason the exact amount of such excess usage cannot be determined,
the department reserves the right to estimate the amount of such excess usage from
the best information available.
Any customer who feels that the application of this section, as applied by the
department, works an undue hardship upon such customer, shall have the right to
appeal to the utility director for review, and in turn to appeal to the department
itself; but no variance from the restrictions of this section shall be allowed unless
and until the department finds that there are special circumstances working an
undue hardship so as to justify the requested variance and approve such variance.
(1988 Code, § 13-526)
19-127. Light-up service. The department will light and adjust
domestic or general service heating equipment (excluding gas logs) one (1) time

November). Any additional light-ups requested during the fall light-up season at
any one (1) address will be charged for (see schedule of rates and charges) each
19-10
light-up. In addition, the same service applies for summer cut-offs (normally May
through June). Services will be locked off during this time.
In case of leakage or other hazardous condition, the department will turn off
the gas and will restore service as soon as the emergency no longer exists without
charge for either. This does not apply to customers whose services have been
disconnected for non-payment of bill. (1988 Code, § 13-527)
19-128. Scope. These rules and regulations and the regularly
established rate schedules are a part of all contracts for receiving gas service from
the department and apply to all service received from the department, whether the
service is based upon contract, agreement, signed application, or otherwise. (1988
Code, § 13-528)
19-129. Conflict. In case of conflict between any provision of any rate
schedule and these rules and regulations, the rate schedule shall apply. (1988 Code,

amended, supplemented, or otherwise changed from time to time. Such changes,
when effective, shall have the same force as the present rules and regulations. (1988
Code, § 13-530)
19-131. Separability section. If any clause, sentence, paragraph,
section or part of these rules and regulations or the department's rate schedules
shall be declared invalid or unconstitutional, it shall not affect the validity of the

(1988 Code, § 13-531)
19-132. Filing and posting. A copy of these rules and regulations,
together with a copy of the department's schedule of rates and charges, shall be

APPENDIX A
CODE OF ETHICS
APP-A-1
Appendix A
1. Campaign finance.
All candidates for the chief administrative office (mayor), any candidates who
spend more than $500, and candidates for other offices that pay at least $100 a
month are required to file campaign financial disclosure reports. Civil penalties
of $25 per day are authorized for late filings. Penalties up to the greater of
$10,000 or 15 percent of the amount in controversy may be levied for filings
more than 35 days late. It is a Class E felony for a multicandidate political
campaign committee with a prior assessment record to intentionally fail to file
a required campaign financial report. Further, the treasurer of such a committee
may be personally liable for any penalty levied by the Registry of Election
Finance (T.C.A. § 2-10-101–118).
Contributions to political campaigns for municipal candidates are limited to:
a. $1,000 from any person (including corporations and other
organizations);
b. $5,000 from a multicandidate political campaign committee;
c. $20,000 from the candidate;
d. $20,000 from a political party; and
e. $75,000 from multicandidate political campaign committees.
The Registry of Election Finance may impose a maximum penalty of $10,000 or
115 percent of the amount of all contributions made or accepted in excess of
these limits, whichever is greater (T.C.A. § 2-10-301–310).
Each candidate for local public office must prepare a report of contributions that
includes the receipt date of each contribution and a political campaign
committee’s statement indicating the date of each expenditure (T.C.A.
§ 2-10-105, 107).
Candidates are prohibited from converting leftover campaign funds to personal
use. The funds must be returned to contributors, put in the volunteer public
education trust fund, or transferred to another political campaign fund, a
political party, a charitable or civic organization, educational institution, or an
organization described in 26 U.S.C. 170(c) (T.C.A. § 2-10-114).
2. Conflicts of Interest.
Municipal officers and employees are permitted to have an “indirect interest” in
contracts with their municipality if the officers or employees publicly
acknowledge their interest. An indirect interest is any interest that is not
“direct,” except it includes a direct interest if the officer is the only supplier of
APP-A-2
goods or services in a municipality. A “direct interest” is any contract with the
official himself or with any business of which the official is the sole proprietor,
a partner, or owner of the largest number of outstanding shares held by any
individual or corporation. Except as noted, direct interests are absolutely
prohibited (T.C.A. § 6-2-402, T.C.A. § 6-20-205, T.C.A. § 6-54-107–108,
T.C.A. § 12-4-101–102).
3. Disclosure conflict of interests.
Conflict of interest disclosure reports by any candidate or appointee to a local
public office are required under T.C.A. §§ 8-50-501 et seq. Detailed financial
information is required, including the names of corporations or organizations in
which the official or one immediate family member has an investment of over
$10,000 or 5 percent of the total capital. This must be filed no later than 30 days
after the last day legally allowed for qualifying as a candidate. As long as an
elected official holds office, he or she must file an amended statement with the
Tennessee Ethics Commission or inform that office in writing that an amended
statement is not necessary because nothing has changed. The amended
statement must be filed no later than January 31 of each year
(T.C.A. § 8-50-504).
4. Consulting fee prohibition for elected municipal officials.
Any member or member-elect of a municipal governing body is prohibited under
T.C.A. § 2-10-124 from “knowingly” receiving any form of compensation for
“consulting services” other than compensation paid by the state, county, or
municipality. Violations are punishable as Class C felonies if the conduct
constitutes bribery under T.C.A. § 39-16-102. Other violations are prosecuted
as Class A misdemeanors. A conviction under either statute disqualifies the
offender from holding any office under the laws or Constitution of the State of
Tennessee.
“Consulting services” under T.C.A. § 2-10-122 means “services to advise or assist
a person or entity in influencing legislative or administrative action, as that
term is defined in § 3-6-301, relative to the municipality or county represented
by that official.” “Consulting services” also means services to advise or assist a
person or entity in maintaining, applying for, soliciting or entering into a
contract with the municipality represented by that official. "Consulting
services" does not mean the practice or business of law in connection with

b. Under T.C.A. § 39-16-103, a person convicted of bribery is disqualified

to the conviction.
c. A public servant who requests a pecuniary benefit for performing an
act the person would have had to perform without the benefit or for a lesser fee,

refusing to qualify and enter upon the duties of the office for pecuniary gain, or
entering into any kind of borrowing or selling for anything of value with regard
to the office.
e. Exceptions to 1, 3, and 4, above include lawful contributions to political
campaigns, and a “trivial benefit” that is “incidental to personal, professional,
or business contacts” in which there is no danger of undermining an official’s
impartiality.
6. Official misconduct. official oppression, misuse of official information.
a. Public misconduct offenses under Tennessee Code Annotated § 39-16-
401 through § 39-16-404 apply to officers, elected of ficials, employees,
APP-A-4
candidates for nomination or election to public office, and persons performing
a governmental function under claim of right even though not qualified to do so.
b. Official misconduct under Tennessee Code Annotated § 39-16-402
pertains to acts related to a public servant’s office or employment committed
with an intent to obtain a benefit or to harm another. Acts constituting an
offense include the unauthorized exercise of official power, acts exceeding one’s
official power, failure to perform a duty required by law, and receiving a benefit
not authorized by law. Offenses under this section constitute a Class E felony.
c. Under Tennessee Code Annotated § 39-16-403, “Official oppression,”
a public servant acting in an official capacity who intentionally arrests, detains,
frisks, etc., or intentionally prevents another from enjoying a right or privilege
commits a Class E felony.
d. Tennessee Code Annotated § 39-16-404 prohibits a public servant’s use
of information attained in an official capacity, to attain a benefit or aid another
which has not been made public. Offenses under the section are Class B
misdemeanors.
e. A public servant convicted for any of the offenses summarized in
sections 2-4 above shall be removed from office or discharged from a position of
employment, in addition to the criminal penalties provided for each offense.
Additionally, an elected or appointed official is prohibited from holding another
appointed or elected office for ten (10) years. At-will employees convicted will
be discharged, but are not prohibited from working in public service for any
specific period. Subsequent employment is left to the discretion of the hiring
entity for those employees. Tennessee Code Annotated § 39-16-406.
7. Ouster law.
Some Tennessee city charters include ouster provisions, but the only general law
procedure for removing elected officials from office is judicial ouster. Cities are
entitled to use their municipal charter ouster provisions, or they may proceed
under state law.
The judicial ouster procedure applies to all officers, including people holding any
municipal “office of trust or profit.” (Note that it must be an “office” filled by an
“officer,” distinguished from an “employee” holding a “position” that does not
have the attributes of an “office.”) The statute makes any officer subject to such
removal “who shall knowingly or willfully misconduct himself in office, or who
shall knowingly or willfully neglect to perform any duty enjoined upon such
officer by any of the laws of the state, or who shall in any public place be in a
state of intoxication produced by strong drink voluntarily taken, or who shall
APP-A-5
engage in any form of illegal gambling, or who shall commit any act constituting
a violation of any penal statute involving moral turpitude” (T.C.A. § 8-47-101).
T.C.A. § 8-47-122(b) allows the taxing of costs and attorney fees against the
complainant in an ouster suit if the complaint subsequently is withdrawn or
deemed meritless. Similarly, after a final judgment in an ouster suit,
governments may order reimbursement of attorney fees to the officer targeted
in a failed ouster attempt
(T.C.A. § 8-47-121).
The local attorney general or city attorney has a legal “duty” to investigate a
written allegation that an officer has been guilty of any of the mentioned
offenses. If he or she finds that “there is reasonable cause for such complaint, he
shall forthwith institute proceedings in the Circuit, Chancery, or Criminal Court
of the proper county.” However, with respect to the city attorney, there may be
an irreconcilable conflict between that duty and the city attorney’s duties to the
city, the mayor, and the rules of professional responsibility governing attorneys.
Also, an attorney general or city attorney may act on his or her own initiative
without a formal complaint (T.C.A. § 8-47-101–102). The officer must be
removed from office if found guilty (T.C.A. § 8-47-120).

SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS
SAVANNAH MUNICIPAL/REGIONAL PLANNING COMMISSION
SAVANNAH, TENNESSEE
(08/08/06)
(11/08/18 amended)
ARTICLE I
GENERAL PROVISIONS
A. PURPOSE
Land subdivision is the first step in the process of community development. Once land has been cut up into streets, lots and blocks and publicly recorded, the correction of defects is costly and difficult. Subdivision of land sooner or later becomes a public responsibility, in that roads and streets must be maintained and various public services customary to urban areas must be provided. The welfare of the entire community is thereby affected in many important respects. It is therefore to the interest of the public, the developer and the future owners that subdivision be conceived, designed and developed in accordance with sound rules and proper minimum standards.
The following subdivision standards guiding the Planning Commission are designed to secure a coordinated layout with adequate provisions for traffic, light, air, recreation, transportation, water, drainage, and sanitary facilities and services; to promote a distribution of population and traffic which will tend to create conditions favorable to health, safety, convenience and prosperity.
The following regulations set forth the minimum standards to be adhered to by developers of lands for residential, commercial, and industrial uses, and to provide a guide for the Planning Commission and other city officials exercising their duties pertaining to the review, approval and administration of land subdivision development within the jurisdiction of the the Savannah Planning Region.
B. AUTHORITY
These subdivision regulations and the procedures and standards set forth herein are adopted by the Savannah Municipal/Regional Planning Commission under authority granted by Tennessee Code Annotated Sections 13-3-401 through 13-3-411. The Planning Commission has fulfilled the requirements set forth in these statutes as prerequisite to the adoption of such standards, having filed a certified copy of the Major Road Plan in the office of the Registrar of Hardin County, Tennessee.
SAVANNAH SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS I - 4
C. JURISDICTION
These regulations shall govern all subdivision of land outside of the corporate limits of Savannah located within the Savannah Planning Region. For the purpose of these regulations, “Planning Region” shall refer to this area. Within these regulations the term "subdivision" shall mean the division of a tract or parcel of land into two (2) or more lots, sites, or other divisions requiring new street or utility construction, or any division of less than five (5) acres for the purpose, whether immediate or future, of sale or building development, and includes re-subdivision and when appropriate to the context, relates to the process of resubdividing or to the land or area subdivided.
Any owner of land within the Planning Region wishing to subdivide land shall submit to the City of Savannah an application for subdivision according to the procedures outlined in Article II, which submittal shall conform to the minimum requirements as set forth in Article III. A copy of the certified deed shall be presented with the application for subdivision. In instances where the subdivider is not the owner a letter from the owner authorizing the subdivider to act on the owner's behalf shall be presented. Improvements shall be installed as required by Article IV of these regulations.
D. POLICY
It shall be the policy of the Savannah Municipal/Regional Planning Commission to encourage subdivision development which enhances the health, safety and welfare of the community and which optimizes the use of the land while providing a prudent balance between the economic considerations of the developer and the public interest. Conversely, it shall be the policy of the Planning Commission to disapprove proposed subdivision development which is deemed to be inefficient use of land, inconsistent with the needs and character of the community, economically untimely, or otherwise not in the public interest. Further, it shall be the policy of the Savannah Municipal/Regional Planning Commission to consider each proposed subdivision development on its merits in context with existing or planned land use, population and traffic distribution, and the needs and best interest of the community; consequently, the mere compliance with the minimum standards set forth in these regulations does not grant to the developer an implicit or explicit right to subdivision approval; accordingly, the Planning Commission may require that a proposed subdivision development exceed the minimum standards to satisfy site peculiar conditions or to conform to the existing neighborhood.

ARTICLE II
PROCEDURE FOR SUBDIVISION APPROVAL
A. GENERAL
The subdivider shall consult early and informally with the Planning Commission and its technical staff for advice and assistance before the preparation of the Master Design Plan and its formal application for approval. This will enable him to become thoroughly familiar with these regulations, the Major Thoroughfare Plan and other official plans or public improvements which might affect the area. Such informal review should prevent unnecessary and costly revisions.
The procedure for review and approval of subdivisions and its documentation consists of three (3) separate steps. The first formal step is the preparation of a Master Design Plan submitted for administrative content review and approval for subsequent acceptance and placement on the agenda for review and approval by the Planning Commission. The second step is the Construction Plat which must be reviewed and approved by administrative and technical staff designated by the Planning Commission. Unless special consideration is requested by the developer relative to staff review concerns or provisions of these regulations, the Planning Commission will not review the Construction Plat. The third step is the preparation and submittal of a Final Subdivision Plat with all the required certificates for submission to the Planning Commission consistent with Section “E” of this Article. In the event the developer requests special consideration for approval of the Construction Plat, said plat may be considered by the Planning Commission upon review of the Final Plat. No final plat shall be accepted on the agenda of the Planning Commission until the Master Design Plan has been reviewed and approved by the Planning Commission and the Construction Plat reviewed and approved by designated review staff or the Planning Commission. The Final Plat, once approved by the Planning Commission and signed by the Secretary of the Planning Commission becomes the instrument to be recorded by the developer at the Office of the Hardin County Register of Deeds.
B. APPLICATION ADMINISTRATION AND FEES
Any owner of land lying within the area of the jurisdiction of the Municipal/Regional Planning Commission wishing to divide such land into two (2) or more residential or commercial lots, sites or divisions (including remaining land from the predivided property) for the purpose of either immediate or future sale or building shall make application to the Planning Commission by submitting the required plans or plat of the proposed subdivision, along with the application and fees to the Community Development Department. Such plans and plats shall conform to the minimum standards for subdivision design as set forth in
SAVANNAH SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS II - 2
Articles III and IV of these regulations and such additional site peculiar criteria as may be deemed necessary by the Planning Commission or its technical staff.
1. Official Submission Dates and Deadlines

SAVANNAH SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS III - 1
ARTICLE III
GENERAL REQUIREMENTS AND STANDARDS OF DESIGN
A. GENERAL DESIGN CONCEPTS
Land subdivision design is a compromise among competing and often conflicting objectives. Users of these regulations should recognize that land subdivision is far more than a means of marketing land; it is primarily the first step in the process of building a community. Once land has been divided into lots, streets established, utilities installed and buildings constructed, correction of defects is costly and difficult. Moreover, the development pattern is permanently ingrained in the community and unlikely to be changed. Ultimately, subdivided land becomes a public responsibility requiring the maintenance of improvements and the provisions of public services. Additionally, for the sake of future owners and the community, subdivided lands should not only be presently marketable, but should remain competitive with future developments, thereby presenting a stable and liquid investment. Therefore, the interests of the public, the developer, and future owners are served by adherence to sound concepts and standards of design. To achieve the desired objectives, all subdivisions within the Savannah Planning Region must conform to the following four (4) basic design concepts.
1. External Factors
Subdivision design must provide for external factors of community-wide concern including the proper extension of major streets, extensions of utilities, preservation of major drainage channels and related floodlands, the reservation of needed school and park sites, and the preservation of sanitary services. Additional external factors to be considered include proximity to local, community, and regional shopping centers; to places of employment; to educational and recreational facilities; and to public transportation.
2. Land Use
Subdivision design must be related to the proposed and existing land uses. The layout of a subdivision is inseparable from the use to which the land is to be put. Moreover, adjacent land use patterns must be considered. Some uses, such as parks, certain institutional uses, and bodies of surface water, may be used in the design to create value. Others, such as railroads, power lines and associated easements, poorly subdivided lands, and unsightly strip commercial developments, may require special design techniques to minimize their depreciatory effect on property values.
SAVANNAH SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS III - 2
3. Natural Environment
Subdivision design must give due consideration to the natural environment. Areas of natural beauty, such as fine stands of trees and prominent terrain, should be conserved by the design.
Low areas subject to flooding or areas of unsuitable soil or ground water conditions should be avoided and not be put to enclosed uses.
The disposal of sewage and the preservation of ground water shall be considered paramount in the development of property in the Savannah Planning Region.
4. Internal Details
Subdivision design must give attention to internal design details including the proper layout of the streets, utilities, needed open space and adjustment of the design to topography and soil capabilities of the land. A major aspect of internal detailing is careful attention to drainage.
B. WATER DRAINAGE
Storm water drainage is a major aspect of land subdivision design; however, it should not dominate over other important design considerations. Nevertheless, considerable attention must be given to drainage design because of the potentially disastrous effects on life and property resulting from defective design. Accordingly, no land subdivision shall be approved within the Savannah Planning Region unless a detailed drainage plan for such subdivision has been submitted to and approved by Technical Review Staff and/or the Planning commission. The following principles are to be applied to all drainage design for land subdivision within the Savannah Planning Region.
1. Internal Regulation of Drainage
The rate at which water is discharged from all sources leaving a subdivision or other developed areas shall not be increased by more than 10% after development than before development unless approved by designated Technical Review Staff or the Planning Commission.
2. Drainage System Design
The storm water drainage system shall consist of a major and a minor element. The major element, which will operate infrequently, shall be designed to prevent the loss of life and significant property damage from any reasonable, foreseeable, rainfall event. The minor element, operating
SAVANNAH SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS III - 3
frequently, shall provide for an acceptable degree of convenient access to property during and after frequent, normal rainfall events.
C. STREET LAYOUT
The layout or arrangement of streets is the singularly, most important aspect of subdivision design. To a large extent, it determines the effectiveness of the drainage system. Additionally, the street layout determines the shape, size, and orientation of building sites and, to a major extent, the character and beauty of residential neighborhoods and the attractiveness of non-residential developments.
1. Conformity to the Major Street Plan
The location and width of all streets and roads shall conform to the official Major Street Plan and any other plans of the City of Savannah.
2. Relation to Adjoining Street System
The arrangement of streets in a subdivision shall provide for the continuation of existing streets in adjoining subdivisions (or their proper projection when adjoining property is not subdivided). The width shall be the same or greater than the existing street, but, in no case, less than the minimum width required. The arrangement of streets shall be such as to provide for future extension of utilities and storm water drainage, to prevent creation of severed parcels of land, and to cause no undue hardship on owners of adjoining properties.
3. Relation to Existing Topography
The arrangement of streets in a subdivision shall make optimum use of the existing natural topography by designing the layout around the natural drainage routing and by carefully adjusting the streets to the topography so as to minimize grading and drainage problems. Collector streets should generally follow valley lines. Land access streets should cross contours at right angles. Side hill street locations are to be avoided where possible.
4. Relation to Land Use Density
The arrangement of streets shall, insofar as is practical, optimize the total length of streets such that the cost per lot or building site for the construction and maintenance of streets, underground utilities, and other improvements are minimal. The use of cul-de-sacs in a subdivision may be an effective means of optimizing land use density relative to other improvements.
SAVANNAH SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS III - 4
5. Relation of Street Elevation to Drainage
Surface street elevation, at all points, shall be set to preclude periodic inundation due to the overflow of constructed or natural open channels, or due to local storm water runoff which has a flow depth exceeding the curb height. Where in commercial and industrial areas extruded curb and in residential areas v-ditch are not installed, no appreciable amount of runoff water shall be permitted on streets. Street elevation may be raised by fill embankment, providing such embankment does not result in flooding of lots or building sites within the subdivision, nor in increased flood heights upstream and downstream. Drainage openings through roadbed embankments shall not impede the flow of water, except where such embankment is an integral part of a planned detention basin requiring regulated outflow. In no case shall flooding of residential lots or building sites be permitted by design.
6. Street Right-of-Way
Street right-of-way, measured from lot line to lot line, shall be as shown on the Major Street Plan and shall not be less than listed below. In no case shall lots be reflected inclusive of dedicated right of way nor shall the street widths be modified solely for the purpose of increasing the area of marketable land, nor to accommodate a land use which might otherwise be inappropriate.
a. Arterial ............................................................... 80-150 feet*
Arterial streets are major thoroughfares connecting neighborhoods and centers of commerce within the community or state wide.
* or as may be established by the Tennessee Department of Transportation
b. Collector ............................................................ 60 feet
Collector streets are those which provide major circulation within neighborhoods and carry traffic from local streets to arterial streets.
c. Local ................................................................. 50 feet
Local streets provide access from properties fronting thereon to collector or arterial streets. Moving traffic is a secondary function of local streets.
SAVANNAH SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS III - 5
d. Dead-End Street (cul-de-sac)............................. 100 feet
Cul-de-sacs are permanent dead-end streets or courts designed so that they cannot be extended in the future.
Within the Savannah Corporate Limits, Cul-de-sacs or dead-end streets shall not exceed 1200 feet in length and shall serve no more than 30 lots regardless of frontage widths, dead-end street shall not exceed 2000 feet in length and shall not serve more than 50 lots within Savannah’s Planning Region. They shall be provided at the closed end with a right of way/property line radius of at least fifty (50) feet with an outside pavement radius of at least forty (40) feet. (Amended 11/08/18)
e. Temporary Cul-de-sacs ..................................... 50 feet
Where in the opinion of the Planning Commission it is desirable to provide for street access to adjoining property, proposed streets shall be extended by dedication to the boundary of such property. Such dead-end streets having a length greater than two hundred (200) feet shall be provided with a temporary turn around of either a circular or back-and-turn design.
Where deemed necessary by the Planning Commission, adequate rights of way shall be dedicated to connect with any temporary dead-end streets adjoining the subdivision.
7. Additional Width on Existing Streets
a. The entire right-of-way shall be provided where any part of the subdivision is on both sides of the existing street.
Streets designated as arterial or collector status streets on the Savannah Major Road Plan which do not have the minimum pavement widths shall have the additional pavement width and curb and gutter provided by the subdivider on both sides of the street.
b. Where the subdivision is located on only one side of an existing street, one-half (1/2) of the required right-of-way measured from the center line of the existing right-of-way shall be provided.
Streets designated as arterial or collector status streets on the Savannah Major Road Plan shall have the additional pavement width and curb and gutter added by the developer on the side of the street on which the subdivision is located.
SAVANNAH SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS III - 6
8. Restriction of Access
a. Where a subdivision fronts on an arterial street or highway, or where a non-residential use abuts on a street opposite a residential use area, the Planning Commission may require that frontage be provided on a marginal access street. Double frontage shall not be permitted between any residential or major street and a marginal access street.
b. For residential subdivisions bordering on an arterial street or highway, the Planning Commission may require, in lieu of a marginal access street, that "through" and "corner" lots be provided with double frontage on both the arterial street or highway and a minor residential street. In this case, the right of vehicular access to the arterial street or highway shall be permanently dissolved and such dissolution shall be noted permanently on the Final Plat of the Subdivision.
9. Street Alignment and Grades
In setting the alignment and grades for streets, due consideration shall be given to storm drainage. In general, the depth of flow in gutters and the allowable spread of water shall be consistent with the functional classification of the street. Arterial streets shall be designed to remain virtually free of water. Deeper flows and wider spreads may be tolerated on collector and land access streets. Street alignments and grades shall be designed so that, during severe rainfall events, the collector and minor land access streets can serve as open channels supplementary to the, normally piped, storm drainage system without flooding the adjoining lots or building sites; therefore, mid-block sags in street grades are to be avoided and grades are to be set so as to generally parallel storm sewer gradients. During frequent normal rainfall events, appreciable runoff shall not be permitted to flow across intersections. The rate of flow for runoff contained on streets shall not normally exceed ten (10) cubic feet per second.
10. Maximum Street Grades
Grades on arterial and collector streets shall not exceed seven (7) percent. Grades on all other streets shall not exceed ten (10) percent.
11. Horizontal Curves
Where a deflection angle of more than ten (10) degrees in the alignment of a street occurs, a curve of reasonably long radius shall be introduced. On streets with right of ways of sixty (60) feet or more in width, the
SAVANNAH SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS III - 7
centerline radius of curvature shall not be less than two hundred (200) feet. In all cases, horizontal curves shall be designed to provide a minimum of two hundred (200) feet of sight distance between any two points within the driving area over the paved street surface.
12. Vertical Curves
Every change in street grade shall be connected by a vertical curve designed to afford a minimum sight distance of two hundred (200) feet as measured from a driver's eyes, which are assumed to be four and one-half (4 1/2) feet above the pavement surface, to an object four (4) inches high on the pavement. Vertical curves shall be of standard parabolic design.
13. Intersections
a. The angle of intersection between two major streets or between a major street and a minor land access street shall, generally, be a right angle, but, in no case, shall such intersection be less than eighty (80) degrees. All other street intersections shall be as near a right angle as possible, but, in no case, less than seventy-five (75) degrees.
b. Property line radii at street intersections involving an arterial or collector street shall be not less than thirty-five (35) feet. All other intersections shall have property line radii of not less than twenty-five (25) feet.
14. Tangents
A tangent street segment shall be introduced between reverse or compound curves, where necessary, to provide a minimum sight distance of two hundred (200) feet between any two points within the paved street surface. Between reverse curves on arterial and collector streets, a tangent of not less than one hundred (100) feet in length shall be provided.
15. Street Jogs or Offsets
Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than one hundred twenty-five (125) feet shall not be allowed.
SAVANNAH SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS III - 8
16. Dead-End Streets
a. Cul-de-sacs designed to have one end permanently closed shall be no more than 1200 feet in length or a maximum of thirty (30) lots. They shall be provided at the closed end with a turnaround having an outside roadway diameter of at least eighty (80) feet and a street right-of-way diameter of at least one hundred (100) feet. The Planning Commission may approve an alternate design to meet unusual site conditions.
b. Where the Planning Commission determines a need for future access to adjacent properties, proposed subdivision streets shall be extended or additional street segments provided to the boundary of the subdivision at locations specified by the Planning Commission. Such extensions or additions shall be designed as temporary turnarounds having paved area with a diameter equal to the width of the required street right-of-way.
17. Private Streets and Travel Easements
A permanent travel easement may be permitted under certain conditions pursuant to Tennessee Code Annotated, Sections 13-3-411 and 13-4-308. These easements shall meet the following minimum standards, requirements and any special conditions attached by the Planning Commission, and the requirements and special conditions for the easement shall be placed on the Final Plat for recording.
a. A permanent easement shall be of a required width of no less than fifty (50) feet. However, the Planning Commission may require greater widths if necessary to meet special conditions presented by the site or reflected on the Final Plat.
(1) In instances, where a Travel Easement is connected to a street that is non-conforming, because its existence precedes the Town’s adoption of Subdivision Regulations, then that easement shall only be required to have the width of the right-of-way of the street to which it connects.
(2) In instances, where the Planning Commission finds that a property is constrained topographically, in such a manner, that any further subdivision would be an impossibility a Travel Easement of 20 feet in width for a residential property or 30 feet in width for a commercial property may be allowed. Any further subdivision of a property after it is granted a 20 or 30 feet in width Travel Easement shall constitute a forfeiture of the 20 or 30 feet in width travel
SAVANNAH SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS III - 9
easement. The property would then be required to meet all of the requirements for an improved street set forth in Article III of these regulations, including the requirement of at least 50 feet in width of right-of-way dedication.
b. A permanent easement providing legal access to more than one lot shall be improved to meet the road and construction standards as specified herein for public street improvements. Modification of said standards may be directed by the Planning Commission to meet site specific conditions.
c. Permanent easement improvements shall be maintained by the developer/owner or by a legally established home owner’s association or other similar group approved by the Planning Commission. The legal documents establishing the easement and the Home Owner’s Association shall be submitted with the Final Plat for review and approval and shall be recorded with the Final Plat.
d. If, at any future date, a permanent easement is submitted for acceptance as a public street or road, it shall be submitted to the Planning Commission for approval and recommendation to the City Board of Commissioners. In considering the easement for approval as a public street or road, the Planning Commission shall require the improvements to the easement to meet the minimum street construction standards in effect at the time the request for public acceptance is made.
e. A building permit may be issued for a building to be located on a recorded lot of record prior to the effective date of these regulations, which lot fronts on a permanent easement with access to an existing public street or road; provided, however, that any future subdivision of said lot or parcel shall be subject to these provisions.
18. Street Names
Proposed streets which are obviously in alignment with other already existing named streets shall bear the names of existing streets. In no case shall the name for a proposed street duplicate an existing street name irrespective of the suffix used, i.e., street, avenue, boulevard, drive, parkway, cove, court, or place. The names of all proposedstreets shall be approved by the E911 Board.
19. Alleys
SAVANNAH SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS III - 10
Alleys may be provided to serve the rear of lots or building sites used for commercial or industrial purposes. Alleys shall not be provided in any solely residential block. Re-subdivision of land for residential use in areas where alleys are existing shall provide for the vacation of such alleys.
D. STREET LIGHTING
Within the Savannah Planning Region, street lighting may be provided at the discretion of the subdivider. However if provided, standard street lights as recommended by the Tennessee Valley Electric Cooperative shall be installed and ownership and future maintenance of street lighting shall be the responsibility of a homeowner's association established by the subdivider. Any cost differential as a result of a deviation from the standard street lighting provisions of the utility provider having jurisdiction including underground service or special fixtures shall be paid by the subdivider.
E. LOT LAYOUT
In general, all lots within a subdivision shall have about the same area; however, a subdivision plan should not be predicated solely upon producing a maximum density. The lot layout plan should give balanced consideration to the natural topography of the tract being subdivided, to the conservation and preservation of the natural environment, to the provision of adequate open space, to the enhancement of the character and beauty of the community, to the optimization of "lot density to improvements" ratio, and to the protection of life and property.
1. Adequate Building Sites
Each lot shall contain a building site not subject to flooding or other hazards as defined in Section G of this article; and, such site shall be outside the limits of any easements, rights-of-way, building lines, side yards, rear yards, buffers, screens, or landscaped areas which are required by the Planning Commission.
2. Arrangement of Lots
Where practical, side lot lines shall be at right angles to straight street lines and radial to curved street lines. Each lot shall front on a minimum of fifty feet on a public street or road which has a right-of-way width of not less than fifty (50) feet. Where lots abut on an arterial street; double frontage, marginal access or other acceptable arrangements shall be made to control ingress and egress onto such streets from the individual lots.
3. Minimum Size of Lots
SAVANNAH SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS III - 11
The size, shape, and orientation of lots or building sites shall be as the Planning Commission deems appropriate for the intended use, topography of the site and for the protection of life and property on adjoining land.
All lots lots outside the City but within the planning region shall meet the size requirements of the TDEC county enviornmental specialist. Restrictions required by the county environmentalist for lot development shall be recorded on the plat.
4. Building Setback and Yard Requirements
a. All lots or tracts shall have at least the minimum front, side, and rear yards that are required by the Planning Commission. To accommodate conditions peculiar to a site, such as side yard drainage, the Planning Commission may require an increase in the yard requirements for a given lot or tract.
c. In the case of electrical transmission lines where easement widths are not definitely established, there shall be a minimum building setback line from the center of the transmission line as follows:
VOLTAGE LINE MINIMUM BUILDING SETBACK
46 KV 37 1/2 feet
69 KV 50 feet
161 KV 75 feet
5. Large Tracts or Parcels
Where land is subdivided into larger parcels than ordinary building sites, such parcels shall be arranged to allow for future opening of streets and for logical re-subdivision. In no case shall this be construed to allow the creation of severed parcels.
6. Lot Drainage and Grading
Where possible, lots shall drain toward the street or toward both the street and the rear lot lines. In case of drainage to the rear lot line, lateral drainage along rear lot lines shall be required, necessitating careful attention to grading. Where necessitated by the topography, side yard drainage may be required, in which case it may be necessary to increase minimum side yard requirements. Terracing of lots, particularly in a residential subdivision, shall be avoided unless essential for erosion control or to reduce the velocity of runoff.
SAVANNAH SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS III - 12
F. OPEN SPACE AND EASEMENTS
No single aspect of subdivision design contributes more to the attractiveness and value of a subdivision development than the effective use of open space. The provision of open space and easements, preferably designed for multiple uses, is an essential consideration in the planning and design of both residential and non-residential subdivisions.
1. Open Space for Control of Storm Water Runoff
Where necessary, design of permanent and temporary storm water detention or retention ponds shall be an integral part of subdivision design. Such design shall consider opportunities to create open space landscaped areas for storm water management ponds while at the same time considering dual uses, such as public neighborhood parks and playgrounds or private recreational areas.
2. Easements for Open Channel Drainage
Each open channel, natural or constructed, drainage way shall be provided an easement of width sufficient to accommodate major rainfall events. Such an easement shall also provide for operation of construction and maintenance equipment, erosion control, insect vector control, landscaping, and operations of any water-level flow control structures.
3. Easements for Utilities
As a matter of policy and practice, utility components shall be situated within the limits of public right of ways. The Planning Commission may require easements of not less than five (5) feet in width where deemed necessary to permit the efficient layout of utilities or to provide access to such utilities provided such easements shall not exceed a maximum of fifteen (15) feet in width. Unless approved by the Planning Commission, no landscape plantings except for lawn grasses and other appropriate ground cover vegetation, shall be permitted within a required utility easement. Planting restrictions within utility easements shall be noted on the final Plat.
4. Landscaped Buffers and Screens
Open space shall be reserved for fences, vegetative screening and other landscaped areas as required by the Planning Commission and by these Subdivision Regulations. The design of landscaped buffers and screens shall be in accordance with the Technical Specifications of the City of Savannah and shall be subject to review and approval of the Planning Commission. Where residential lots have a double frontage on public
SAVANNAH SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS III - 13
streets, there shall be a continuous screening of acceptable design along the rear of such lots.
5. Conservation and Preservation of Community Assets
For all types of land uses, due consideration shall be given to providing open space needed to conserve notable features of the natural environment such as large trees, watercourses, and prominent scenic terrain. Adequate provision shall be made to protect and preserve historical sites or similar community assets which add to the attractiveness and value of property.
6. Private Use Open Space
Open space may be reserved for private use pursuant to provisions of a home owner's association; however, such open space will not become the responsibility of the City of Savannah or Hardin County, rather the owners or members of an owner's association shall have full responsibility for all care, preservation, and maintenance of the grounds and facilities contained within the reserved open space. An appropriate provision, declaring the responsibilities of the owner or owner's association and absolving the City of Savannah and Hardin County of any responsibility for private use open space, shall be included in the covenants and restrictions of the subdivision.
7. Preservation of Open Space
Once an area has been designated as a greenbelt, landscaped area, buffer, screen or other permanent open space, whether for public or private use, it shall not be encroached upon by any building, structure, or parking area, and shall be so noted on the Final Plat of the subdivision.
G. SUITABILITY OF LAND
The Planning Commission shall not approve the subdivision of any land where it has been found that, in the public interest, the land is not suitable for subdivision development of the type proposed. Any land use which may result in increased upstream or downstream flooding, endanger health, life, or property or aggravate downstream erosion, sedimentation or pollution shall not be approved for subdivision. Any land within a proposed subdivision which is unsuitable for the intended use shall be reserved for open space or other compatible uses which will not be endangered by any inherent hazard of the site.
1. Residential Land Use
SAVANNAH SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS III - 14
Land, which is subject to flooding or which has unsuitable soil or ground water conditions, shall not be subdivided for any type of residential use.
2. Building Site Suitability
No lot or tract intended for use as a building site shall be permitted where a natural or man-made condition, on or adjacent to such lot or tract, may endanger the integrity of any building or structure erected on the site.
SAVANNAH SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS IV - 1
ARTICLE IV
PREREQUISITES TO FINAL SUBDIVISION APPROVAL
A. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
As a condition precedent to the final acceptance of any subdivision, subdivision addition or resubdivision, every subdivision developer shall be required to grade and improve streets and other public ways to install survey monuments, utilities, curbs, sidewalks, sewer, water mains, storm water inlets, surface and ground water drainage channels and structures, and buffer screens, and to prepare and plant landscaping in accordance with these regulations and standards referenced herein. In lieu of the completion of such improvements, prior to final subdivision acceptance, the Planning Commission may accept a bond, in an amount and with surety and conditions satisfactory to it, providing for and securing to the public by way of the Regional Planning Commission those moneys necessary to the actual construction and installation of such improvements within a period specified by the Savannah Municipal/Regional Planning Commission.
B. SURVEY MONUMENTS
Permanent and semi-permanent survey monumentation is an essential by-product of the land subdivision process. Such monumentation facilitates resurvey of the lands contained within the subdivision and provides survey control points for future cadastral and cartographic surveys and mapping. Each subdivision developer shall provide, at his expense, all survey monumentation and documentation specified herein.
1. Permanent Monuments
Concrete monuments four (4) inches in diameter or four (4) inches square, three (3) feet long, with a flat top, shall be set at all street corners, at all points where street lines intersect the exterior boundaries of the subdivision, and at angle points and points of curve in each street. The top of the monument shall have an indented cross to identify properly the location and shall be set flush with the finished grade.
2. Semi-permanent Monuments
a. All corners in the Subdivision not set with a permanent monument shall be marked with an iron rod not less than five-eighths (5/8") inch in diameter and twenty-four (24") inches long, and set flush with the finished grade of the surrounding surface.
b. Upon completion of subdivision development, these metal rods shall be protected by one (1) or more flagged guard stakes.
SAVANNAH SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS IV - 2
3. Unauthorized Survey Marks
Survey reference marks, benchmarks, witness marks, or auxiliary corners which are unsightly or damaging to curbs, gutters, sidewalks, driveways, and street pavements, shall not be permitted. Any such unauthorized marks and corners shall be removed or repaired by the developer at his expense, prior to the final approval of the subdivision plat.
a. Survey Documentation
The developer shall provide to the Community Development Department, prior to the final plat approval, a detailed description of all new and recovered permanent survey monuments lying within or on the boundary of the subdivision. Each description shall include:
i. A physical description of the monument.
ii. Instructions for locating the monument with respect to a fixed prominent landmark.
iii. Survey data in addition to that shown on the final plat which shall, when available, consist of adjusted plane coordinates and elevations, survey precision and accuracy, and datum to which coordinates and elevation refer.
iv. If the proposed subdivision consists of any property in a designated floodplain, as reflected on the Flood Insurance Rate Maps per the City’s participation in the National Flood Insurance Program, the developer shall be responsible for completing and submitting a FEMA Elevation Certificate to the City Recorder.
C. STORM DRAINAGE
The developer shall construct and install, at his expense within the subdivision, all channels, ditches and structures with sufficient hydraulic capacity to control stormwater run-off and emergent groundwater originating within and upstream of the subdivision. Drainage improvements also included proper building site and lot grading, and erosion and insect control.
SAVANNAH SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS IV - 3
1. Drainage Channels and Structures
