exist. The property owner shall have 90 days from date of
notification to enhance radio coverage and bring it within the
acceptable limits of these provisions.
1. Acceptance Testing Procedure.
§ 5-304 MANCHESTER CODE § 5-306
FWD:88
A. When an in-building radio system is required, and upon completion
of installation, it will be the building owner's responsibility to have
the radio system tested to ensure that two-way coverage on each
floor of the building is a minimum of 90%.
B. Each floor of the building shall be divided into a grid of
approximately 20 equal areas. A maximum of two nonadjacent
areas will be allowed to fail the test. In the event that three or more
the areas fail the test, in order to be more statistically accurate, the
floor may be divided into 40 equal areas. In such event, a maximum
of four nonadjacent areas will be allowed to fail the test. After the
40 area test, if the system continues to fail, the building owner(s)
shall have the system altered/modified to meet the 90% coverage
requirements.
C. The test shall be conducted using the most current M/A-COM
portable radio, or its equivalent, available to the Manchester
Township public safety entity, talking though the YCDES radio
system as specified by the authority having jurisdiction. A spot
located approximately in the center of a grid area will be selected
for the test, then the radio will be keyed to verify two-way
communications to and from the outside of the building through the
YCDES radio network. A minimum DAQ 3.4 will be required for this
test in order to consider the test to be acceptable. Once this test
"spot" has been selected for testing, prospecting for a 'better spot'
within the grid area will not be permitted.
D. The gain values of all amplifiers shall be measured and the test
measurement results shall be kept on file with the building owner
so that the measurements can be verified each year during the
annual tests. In the event that the measurement results become
lost, the building owner will be required to rerun the acceptance
test to reestablish the gain values.
2. Annual Tests. When an in-building radio system is required, the
building owner(s) shall test all active components of the system
including, but not limited to, amplifiers, power supplies and back-up
batteries, a minimum of once every 12 months. Amplifiers shall be
tested to ensure that the gain is the same as it was upon initial
installation and acceptance. Back-up batteries and power supplies shall
be tested under load for a period of one hour to verify that they will
properly operate during an actual power outage. If, within the one-hour
test period, in the opinion of the testing technician, the battery exhibits
symptoms of failure, the test shall be extended for an additional onehour
period until the testing technician confirms the integrity of the
battery. All other active components shall be checked to determine that
they are operating within the manufacturer's specifications for the
intended purposes.
3. Five-Year Tests. In addition to the annual test, the building owner(s)
shall perform a radio coverage test a minimum of every five years to

All tests shall be conducted, documented and signed by a person in
possession of a current FCC technical license or a current technician
certification issued by the APCO, NABER or the PCIA. All test records shall
be retained on the inspected premises by the building owner(s) and a copy
shall be submitted to Manchester Township and to the Executive Director of
the YCDES within 30 days from the date the test was conducted.
§ 5-308. Inspections. [Ord. 2007-06, 11/13/2007, § 1]
The Fire Chief or his/her designee, after providing reasonable notice to the
owner or his representative, shall have the right to enter onto the property
to conduct field-testing to be certain that the required minimum level of
radio coverage is present.
§ 5-309. Exemptions. [Ord. 2007-06, 11/13/2007, § 1]
This Part shall not apply to single-family dwelling units, attached or
detached, and multi-family dwelling units or building(s) and/or structure(s),
that do not exceed 35 feet in height and that are constructed of wood frame
as long as none of the aforementioned buildings make use of any metal
construction or any underground storage or parking areas. For purposes of
this Part, parking structures and stairwells are included in the definition of
"building" and stair shafts are included in the definition of "all parts of a
building" but elevators may be excluded.
§ 5-310. Violations and Penalties. [Ord. 2007-06, 11/13/2007, § 1]
ensure that the radio amplification system continues to meet the
requirements of the original acceptance test as set forth in Subsection
1 of this section.
1. Penalties. Any person who is found in violation of any provision of this
Part shall, upon conviction thereof, be sentenced to pay a fine of not
more than $1,000 and/or undergo imprisonment for a term not to
exceed 90 days. Each day the violation of this Part continues shall
constitute a separate offense.
2. The Township, in addition to any of the remedies available to it, may
take appropriate action at law or equity, civil or criminal, to enforce the
provisions of this Part, or to enjoin or otherwise restrain or prevent
violation of this Part, and this Part shall in no way restrict any remedies

Floodplain Areas. [Ord. 2015-04, 10/13/2015]
1. The identified floodplain area shall be:
A. Any areas of Manchester Township classified as special flood
hazard areas (SFHAs) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and the
accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs), dated
December 16, 2015, and issued by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA), or the most-recent revision thereof,
including all digital data developed as part of the Flood Insurance
Study; and
B. Any community-identified flood hazard areas.
2. The above-referenced FIS and FIRMs, and any subsequent revisions
and amendments, are hereby adopted by Manchester Township and
declared to be a part of this chapter.
1. The identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific
areas:
A. The Floodway Area shall be those areas identified in the FIS and
the FIRM as Floodway and which represent the channel of a
watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in
order to discharge the base flood without increasing the water
surface elevation at any point. This term shall also include floodway
areas which have been identified in other available studies or
sources of information for those special flood hazard areas where
no floodway has been identified in the FIS and FIRM.
(1) Within any Floodway Area, no encroachments, including fill,
new construction, substantial improvements, or other
development, shall be permitted unless it has been
demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
performed in accordance with standard engineering practice
that the proposed encroachment would not result in any
increase in flood levels within the community during the
occurrence of the base flood discharge.
(2) Within any Floodway Area, no new construction or
development shall be allowed, unless the appropriate permit is
obtained from the Department of Environmental Protection's
regional office.
§ 8-501 FOREWORD § 8-502

prepared by FEMA for which base flood elevations have been
provided and a floodway has been delineated.
(2) AE Area without floodway shall be those areas identified as an
AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA
for which base flood elevations have been provided but no
floodway has been determined.
(a) No permit shall be granted for any construction,
development, use, or activity within any AE Area/District
without floodway unless it is demonstrated that the
cumulative effect of the proposed development would not,
together with all other existing and anticipated
development, increase the BFE at any point.
(b) No new construction or development shall be located
within the area measured 50 feet landward from the topof-
bank of any watercourse, unless the appropriate permit
is obtained from the Department of Environmental
Protection's regional office.
C. The A Area/District shall be those areas identified as an A Zone on
the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no
base flood elevations have been provided. For these areas,
elevation and floodway information from other federal, state, or
other acceptable sources shall be used when available. Where
other acceptable information is not available, the base flood
elevation shall be determined by using the elevation of a point on
the boundary of the identified floodplain area which is nearest the
construction site.
(1) In lieu of the above, the applicant must determine the elevation
with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering techniques.
Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by
professional engineers or others of demonstrated
qualifications, who shall certify that the technical methods
used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts.
Studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in
sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by the
municipality.

changes. The community shall adopt and enforce floodplain regulations in
areas subject to annexation or corporate boundary changes which meet or
exceed those in 44 CFR 60.3.
Zones AO and AH, drainage paths shall be established to guide
floodwaters around and away from structures on slopes.
E. Community-identified flood hazard areas shall be those areas
where Manchester Township has identified local flood hazard or
ponding areas, as delineated and adopted on a local flood hazard
map using best available topographic data and locally derived
information such as flood of record, historic high-water marks, soils
or approximate study methodologies.
1. The identified floodplain area may be revised or modified by the Board
of Supervisors where studies or information provided by a qualified
agency or person documents the need for such revision. However, prior
to any such change to the special flood hazard area, approval must be
obtained from FEMA.

It shall be unlawful for any person to park a vehicle or to allow the same
to remain parked, at any time between 8:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m. on any of
the following portions of the highways of the Township on the days hereby

1. Only angle parking shall be permitted on the following portions of
streets:
Street Side Between
[Reserved]
2. On all streets where angle parking is required, every vehicle parked at
the angle shall be parked with its front nearest the curb.
1. Findings and Purpose. The Township finds that:
A. Certain residential areas in the Township are subjected to
commuter vehicle parking, therefore, depriving the residents of
those areas of spaces in which to park their own vehicles;
B. Those residential streets are also subjected to a high degree of
commuter traffic which substantially reduces the quality of the
ambient air level; and,
C. The establishment of a parking permit program for certain affected
areas should facilitate efficient movement of traffic by providing for
§ 15-407 FOREWORD § 15-410
FWD:253
parking preference during certain hours of the day and days of the
week. Therefore, the Township considers it to be in the interest
of the people of the Township to provide for the establishment of
a residential permit parking program to insure primary access to
available parking spaces by neighborhood residents and also to
provide a cleaner ambient air level.
2. Definitions. For the purpose of this section, words and terms listed in
this subsection, as follows, shall have the following meanings:
COMMUTER VEHICLE  A motor vehicle parked in a residential area
by a person not a resident of that residential area;
PROPRIETOR  A person who owns or leases real estate within a
residential area of which he is not a resident, but who owns or manages
a business enterprise or professional office maintained at that address;
for the purpose of this section, a proprietor shall be entitled to one
parking permit for that business or professional office address;
RESIDENT  A person who owns or leases real property within a
residential area and who maintains either a voting residence, or bona
fide occupancy, or both, at that address;
RESIDENTIAL AREA  A contiguous area containing public highways
or parts of public highways primarily abutted by residential property or
residential and non-business property (such as schools, parks, places of
worship, hospitals and nursing homes).
3. Criteria. The residential areas designated in Subsection 4 of this
section are those deemed impacted and hence eligible for residential
parking on the basis of the following criteria:
A. During any period between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 6:30 p.m.,
Monday through Saturday, except legal holidays, the number of
vehicles parked (or standing), legally or illegally, on the streets in
the area is equal to 70% or more of the legal, on-street parking
capacity of the area. For the purpose of this criterion, a legal
parking space shall be 20 linear feet.
B. During the same period as specified in Subsection 3A, directly
above, 10% or more of the vehicles parked (or standing) on the
streets in the area are not registered in the name of a person
residing in the area. For the purpose of this criterion, the latest
available information from the Bureau of Motor Vehicles and
Licensing of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation
regarding registration of motor vehicles shall be used; provided, in
determining that a specific area identified as impacted and eligible
for residential permit parking is designated as a residential permit
parking area, the following factors are taken into consideration:
(1) The local and metropolitan needs with respect to clean air and
environment;
§ 15-410 MANCHESTER CODE § 15-410
FWD:254
(2) The possibility of a reduction in total vehicle miles driven in the
Township;
(3) The likelihood of alleviating traffic congestion, illegal parking
and related health and safety hazards;
(4) The proximity of public transportation to the residential area;
(5) The desire and need of the residents for residential permit
parking and their willingness to bear the administrative costs
in connection with it; and,
(6) The need for parking in excess of the residential permit
parking program in proximity to establishments located in the
residential permit parking area and used by the general public
for religious, health or educational purposes.
4. Designation of Residential Permit Parking Areas. The following are
designated as residential permit parking areas:
Area Bounded by and Including
[Reserved]
Signs shall be erected along the streets in each residential permit
parking area, indicating the days, hours, locations and conditions
under which parking shall be by permit only.
5. Application for Permit. Application for a residential parking permit shall
be made to the Chief of Police by the person desiring the permit, who
shall be only the owner or the driver of a motor vehicle who resides on
or is a proprietor of property immediately adjacent to a street or other
location within a residential parking permit area. A separate
application shall be required for each motor vehicle, and each
application shall be accompanied by a permit fee, set pursuant to a
resolution of the Board of Supervisors, which shall be for the use of the
Township, to be applied to the cost of administering the residential
permit parking program. Each application shall contain the following
information: the name of the owner or the driver, as the case may be, of
the motor vehicle; the address of the resident or the proprietor, as the
case may be; the make, model and registration number of the motor
vehicle; and the driver number as taken from the applicant's current
driver's license. At the discretion of the Chief of Police, the applicant
shall be required, at the time of making application, to present his
driver's license and the vehicle registration card.
6. Issuance of Permit. Upon receipt of the application and the permit fee,
and determination by him that the information upon the application
shows that the applicant is entitled to a residential parking permit, the
Chief of Police shall issue to the applicant a residential parking permit,
which shall be valid for the remainder of the calendar year. The permit
shall display the serial and registration numbers of the motor vehicles,
the residential parking area number, and the expiration date. The
§ 15-410 FOREWORD § 15-410
FWD:255
permit shall be renewable annually before the expiration date, upon
making application for renewal and payment of the permit fee. It shall
be unlawful and a violation of this section for any person to display
other than the current and valid permit while standing or parking in a
residential permit parking area at any time when those permits are to
be displayed.
7. Temporary and Exemption Parking Permits. Temporary parking permits
may be issued by the Chief of Police, upon payment of a fee established
pursuant to a resolution, to bona fide visitors of residents of a
designated residential permit parking area, and exemption parking
permits may be issued, without payment of a fee, to handicapped
persons.
8. Responsibility of Permit Holder.
A. Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, the
holder of a residential parking permit shall be permitted to stand or

(1) By meters installed and maintained by said water company or
any other private or public water company.
(2) By meters maintained and installed by the property owner as
may be required, approved and inspected by the Township.
B. Excluded Water. Exclusion from the sewer system and treatment
plant of non-contaminated waste waters may be required by the
Township or such exclusion may be optional with the property
owner if not required by the Township. When such waste waters
are not discharged to the sewer system, sewer rentals shall be
based upon total water consumption, less waste waters not
discharged to the sewer system. Waste waters not discharged to
the sewer system may be determined from meters installed and
maintained by the owner, or the owner may elect to measure the
volume of waste actually discharged to the sewer system as
provided for below.
C. Sewer Meters. The Township may require a nonresidential
establishment, or the nonresidential establishment may elect to
install, pay for and maintain a meter approved by the Township for
measuring waste water discharged to the sewer system, in which
case sewer rentals shall be based upon the actual volume of wastes
discharged to the sewer system.
§ 18-215 MANCHESTER CODE § 18-215
FWD:308
D. Sewer Rental Surcharges for Non-Domestic Wastes. In addition to
sewer rent for collection and treatment of sewage discharged into

excess of the following concentrations.
(1) Suspended Solids. Three hundred fifty milligrams per liter.
(2) BOD Three hundred milligrams per liter.
(3) BOD One thousand eight hundred milligrams per liter.
The total surcharge fee shall equal the sum of each such
surcharge fee as calculated by the following formulas:
(1) If SS is greater than 350 mg/L, a surcharge shall be
assessed for SS in an amount equal to:
8.34 x Q x (SS - 350) x K1
1,000,000
(2) If BOD is greater than 300 mg/L, a surcharge shall be
assessed for BOD in an amount equal to:
8.34 x Q x (BOD - 300) x K2
1,000,000
(3) If BOD is greater than 1,800 mg/L, a surcharge shall be
assessed for BOD in an amount equal to:
8.34 x Q x (BOD - 1,800) x K2
1,000,000
Where: Q = Volume in gallons.
BOD = 5-day biochemical oxygen demand of
sewage in milligrams per liter.
SS = Suspended solids of sewage in milligrams
per liter.
K1 = Cost factor per pound of SS.
K2 = Cost fact per pound of BOC.
§ 18-215 FOREWORD § 18-215
FWD:309
Cost factors K1 and K2 shall be determined by administrative
order of the City of York, operator of the sewage treatment
facility, based upon costs and are hereby incorporated by
Township. The strength of any sewage subject to surcharge
shall be determined quarterly, or more frequently as the
Township and City of York shall determine, based upon
sampling by the Township or City or their designees. However,
the Township or City of York may, if they so elect, determine
the strength of sewage based upon the results of routine
sampling and analysis from previous quarters or from the
results of analysis of sewage from similar customers.
E. Inspection Facilities. When directed by the Township
nonresidential establishments shall install, pay for and maintain a
manhole or other device as may be approved by the Township to
facilitate observation, measurement and sampling of wastes
discharged to the sewer system and treatment plant. The
Township, or its duly authorized representatives, shall at all
reasonable times be permitted to enter upon any and all properties
for the purpose of inspecting all metering devices and of observing,
measuring and sampling wastes discharged to the sewer system
and treatment plant. Any nonresidential establishment that desires
to connect with the sewer system or which is connected to the
sewer system and plans to change its operations so as to materially
alter the characteristics and/or volumes of wastes discharged
therefrom shall notify the Township, in writing, at least 10 days
before making such connection or changing its operation.
F. Installation and Maintenance of Meters. If the owner of any
industrial or commercial establishment shall be required, pursuant
to the foregoing provisions, to install a water meter or meters or a
meter or meters for measuring waste waters, it shall be the duty of
such owner to furnish and install such meter at his own expense,
and in such case and also if such owner shall have voluntarily
installed such meter or meters, such owner shall be required to
maintain the same in good operating condition and make all
necessary repairs and replacements. If the owner, being obligated
to do so, shall fail to furnish or install such meter or meters or shall
fail to maintain the same as above provided, then in any such case
after 10 days written notice by the Township to perform such
obligation, the Township may enter onto such property, at all
reasonable times, and install such meter or meters or repair and
maintain the same, as the case may be, and charge the cost of such
installation or repair to such owner. Bills for such installation or
repairs if made by the Township shall be due and payable
immediately upon completion of the work and then shall be
collected in the same manner as quarter annum bills for sewer
rentals and charges.
§ 18-215 MANCHESTER CODE § 18-215
FWD:310
G. Amendments and Modifications. Additional classifications and
sewer rentals or charges or modifications of the schedules
contained in Subsection 1 may be established by Manchester
Township, from time to time, as deemed necessary.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Supervisors, upon
resolution of said Board, is hereby empowered to modify the rates
set forth in this Part to provide for increases or decreases in the
treatment charge imposed by the municipality or municipality
authority owning or operating the applicable wastewater treatment
facility or in the Township maintenance charge for the sewer
system.
3. Time and Method of Payment, Penalties and Interest.
A. Sewer rentals for all sewer rental units shall be billed each quarterannum
on the first day of each January, April, July and October,
commencing on the first next succeeding billing date upon which
waste is first discharged into the sewer system and shall be due and
payable immediately.
B. If the full amount of such bill shall not be paid within 30 days from
the date of billing, an additional sum of 10% shall be added to such
net bill, which net bill plus such additional sum shall constitute the
gross amount thereof. Any bill that remains unpaid after 90 days
shall be entered as lien pursuant to the Municipal Lien Law, which
lien shall include attorneys' fees and costs for collection of same.
[Amended by Ord. No. 2018-01, 2/13/2018]
C. Failure of any owner to receive quarterly bills for sewer rentals and
charges or failure of any owner to receive a correct bill for sewer
rentals and charges by reason of the failure of such owner to notify
the Township of the use or uses of which an improved property or
any portion thereof is made, pursuant to the notice requirements of
§ 18-218, Subsection 5, shall not excuse non-payment or failure to
pay the amount that would be properly applicable to the use or uses
of which said improved property is made and shall not result in an
extension of the period of time during which the net bill shall be
payable.
4. Apportionment. Whenever sewer service to any sewer rental unit
begins after the first day or terminates before the last day of any
quarterly period, the sewer rentals for such sewer rental unit for such
quarterly period shall be for that portion of the quarterly period during
which the sewer rental unit is served. However, in making such
apportionment, a fraction of a month amounting to 1/2 or more of a
month shall be counted as a full month and a fraction of a month
amounting to less than 1/2 a month shall be disregarded.
5. Collection of Delinquent Rental, Liens. Delinquent bills for sewer
rentals together with all charges, expenses and fees added thereto
shall, in the manner provided by law, become a lien upon the property

which said industrial waste discharge shall be admitted into the
sewer system together with special charges or surcharges or the
formula for computing any special charges or surcharges with
respect to the discharge of such industrial waste, which terms and
conditions and charges or surcharges shall be deemed a part of this
Part. The discharge of such industrial waste shall be subject to all
applicable provisions of this Part. The Township has entered into
agreements with the City of York, Springettsbury Township and
Dover Township for transportation and treatment of sewage and
industrial waste from areas of the Township as appropriate under
drainage basin concepts, determinations under Act 537 and
decisions of other regulatory agencies. Copies of said agreements,
together with ordinances incorporated by reference, which bind
the Township to certain stipulations i.e., quality and quantity of
waste, are on file with the Plumbing Inspector, and each applicant
and/or owner applying for a plumbing permit is responsible to
ascertain which agreements and ordinances apply to his area and
to comply with all such requirements. Applicants for plumbing
permits, which will involve the connection and discharge of
industrial waste, understand that a contract between the industry
and the Township for such discharge must be consummated as a
condition precedent to the issuance of a plumbing permit.
B. Required Survey Data. Any person desiring to make or use a
connection to the sewer system through which industrial waste
shall be discharged into the sewer system shall file with this
Township and "industrial waste questionnaire," to be furnished by
this Township which shall supply to the Township pertinent data,
including estimated quantity of flow, characteristics and
constituents, with respect to industrial waste proposed to be
discharged into the sewer system. The cost of obtaining all such
data shall be borne by the person desiring to make or use a
connection to the sewer system.
C. Control Manholes. Any person who shall discharge industrial waste
into the sewer system, when required by this Township, shall
§ 18-215 MANCHESTER CODE § 18-216
FWD:312
construct and thereafter properly shall maintain, at his own
expense, a suitable control manhole or manholes or metering
chamber and such other devices as may be approved by this
Township to facilitate observation, measurement and sampling by
this Township of industrial waste discharged to the sewer system.
Any such control manhole or manholes or metering chamber, when
required by this Township, shall be constructed at an accessible,
safe, suitable and satisfactory location in accordance with plans
approved by this Township prior to commencement of construction.
D. Changes in Types of Wastes. Any person discharging sanitary
sewage and/or industrial waste into the sewer system and
contemplating a change in the method of operation which will alter
the characteristics and/or volumes of wastes at the time being
discharged into the sewer system shall notify this Township, in
writing, at least 10 days prior to consummation of such change.
E. Variation in Rate of Discharge. This Township reserves the right to
require any person discharging industrial waste having large
variations in rates of waste discharge to install suitable regulating
devices for equalizing waste flows to the sewer system.
2. Unacceptable Sanitary Sewage and Industrial Waste.
A. The discharge of excessive amounts of unpolluted water or waste to
a sanitary sewer is expressly prohibited; however, such discharges
to storm sewers will be permitted wherever such sewers are
available and of adequate capacity. The Township reserves the right
to define the amount it deems excessive in each particular instance.
B. The discharge of garbage to the sewer system is expressly
prohibited, except for the use of a garbage grinder or garbage
disposal unit.
C. No person shall discharge to the sewer system any sanitary sewage
or industrial waste having any of the following characteristics:
(1) Wastes containing liquids, solids or gases which by reason of
their nature or quality may cause fire, explosions or be in any
other way injurious to persons, the structures of the sewer
system or its operation.
(2) Wastes having a temperature in excess of 150° F. or less than
32° F.
(3) Wastes having a pH lower than 5.5 or higher than 9.5 or having
any corrosive properties capable of causing damage or hazards
to personnel or to structures or equipment which is a part of
the sewer system. Where the Township deems it advisable, it
may require any person discharging industrial waste to install
and maintain at his own expense, in a manner approved by the
§ 18-216 FOREWORD § 18-216
FWD:313
Township, a suitable device to continuously measure and
record the pH of the wastes so discharged.
(4) Wastes containing any noxious or malodorous gas or
substances, which either singly or by interaction with sewage
or other wastes are, in the opinion of the Township, likely to
create a public nuisance or hazard to life or to prevent entry to
sewerage structures for their maintenance and repair.
(5) Wastes containing ashes, cinders, sand, mud, straw, shavings,
metal, glass, rags, feathers, tar, plaster, wood, hair, chemical or
paint residues, greases, lime, slurry or viscous materials of
such characters or in quantity that, in the opinion of the
Township, they may cause an obstruction to the flow in the
sewers or otherwise interfere with the proper operation of the
sewer system. Attention is called to the fact that the maximum
permissible concentration will vary throughout the sewer
system depending upon the size of the particular interceptor
sewer receiving the same and the flows therein.
(6) Wastes containing insoluble, non-flocculent substances having
a specific gravity in excess of 2.65.
(7) Wastes containing the soluble substances in such
concentrations as to cause the specific gravity of the waste to
be greater than 1.1.
(8) Wastes which violate in any respect the provisions and
limitations of agreements entered into by the Township or may
be entered into by the Township with the City of York or with
any other municipalities regarding the use of their sewer
systems and disposal facilities.
3. Indemnify and Hold Harmless Township from Any Liability or Expense.
A. Township Responsibility. As indicated in Subsection 1A, the
Township has entered into agreements with the City of York and
other municipalities for transportation and treatment of sewage
and industrial waste from areas of the Township. These
agreements, together with ordinances incorporated by reference
bind the Township to certain stipulations, i.e., quantity and quality
of waste discharged into the sewer system. Violation of any of these
agreements or of any applicable ordinance of another municipality
shall be a violation of this Part.
(1) Any person who shall discharge or cause to be discharged into
the sewer system any industrial waste that fails to meet the
quantity and quality standard as set forth in the
aforementioned agreements shall indemnify and hold harmless
Township from liability or expense, including reasonable
attorney's fees, that Township may incur by that persons's

within a housing development prior to its individual sale, he shall meet all
conditions as set forth in this section and in other sections of this Part and
the Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance [Chapter 22]. Plot plans
for such a development must be submitted to the Township which must
include a provision for maintenance bond protecting the Township against
defects pursuant to the Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance
[Chapter 22] and must also include a covenant to convey to the Township
the sewer so constructed other than building sewers, when the said sewers
are connected to the sewer system. Said plans must be approved by the
Township prior to any construction. Sewer plans conforming to all
specifications established by the Township, as to type of pipe, location
of mains, size of pipe, grades, methods, workmanship and the type and
construction of all necessary appurtenances must be prepared, approved by
the Township and approval obtained from the necessary state agencies. The
engineering fees and charges for permits shall be paid by the builder or
developer. In no case will lesser standards than exist in the sewer system
presently constructed and as required in Township ordinances be permitted
for any future extensions. Upon approval of such plans by the Township,
the extensions may be constructed by and at the expense of the builder or
developer, but only under the inspection of an inspector designated by the
Township. The cost of such inspection, including salaries and expenses shall
be borne by the builder or developer making the extensions.

any other private or public water company.
(2) By meters maintained and installed by the property owner as
may be required, approved and inspected by the Township.
B. Excluded Water. Exclusion from the sewer system and treatment
plant of non-contaminated waste waters may be required by the
Township or such exclusion may be optional with the property
owner if not required by the Township. When such waste waters
are not discharged to the sewer system, sewer rentals shall be
based upon total water consumption, less waste waters not
discharged to the sewer system. Waste waters not discharged to
the sewer system may be determined from meters installed and
maintained by the owner or the owner may elect to measure the
volume of waste actually discharged to the sewer system as
provided for below.
C. Sewer Meters. The Township may require a nonresidential
establishment or the nonresidential establishment may elect to
install, pay for and maintain a meter approved by the Township for
measuring waste water discharged to the sewer system, in which
case sewer rentals shall be based upon the actual volume of wastes
discharged to the sewer system.

excess of the following concentrations:
(1) Suspended Solids. 350 milligrams per liter.
(2) BOD: 300 milligrams per liter.
(3) BOD: 1,800 milligrams per liter.
The total surcharge fee shall equal the sum of each such
surcharge fee as calculated by the following formulas:
(1) If SS is greater than 350 mg/L, a surcharge shall be
assessed for SS in an amount equal to:
8.34 x Q x (SS - 350) x K1
1,000,000
(2) If BOD is greater than 300 mg/L, a surcharge shall be
assessed for BOD in an amount equal to:
8.34 x Q x (BOD - 300) x K2
1,000,000
(3) If BOD is greater than 1,800 mg/L, an additional
surcharge shall be assessed for BOD in an amount equal
to:
8.34 x Q x (BOD - 1,800) x K2
1,000,000
Where: Q = Volume in gallons.
BOD = 5 day biochemical oxygen demand of
sewage in milligrams per liter.
SS = Suspended solids of sewage in milligrams
per liter.
K1 = Cost factor per pound of SS.
K2 = Cost fact per pound of BOD.
§ 18-325 FOREWORD § 18-325
FWD:327
Cost factors K1 and K2 shall be determined by administrative
order of the City of York, operator of the sewage treatment
facility, based upon costs and are hereby incorporated by
Township. The strength of any sewage subject to surcharge
shall be determined quarterly, or more frequently as the
Township and the City of York shall determine, based upon
sampling by the Township or City or their designees. However,
the Township or City of York may, if they so elect, determine
the strength of sewage based upon the results of routine
sampling and analysis by the producer of such sewage or the
results of analysis from previous quarters or from the results
of analysis of sewage from similar customers.
E. Inspection Facilities. When directed by the Township
nonresidential establishments shall install, pay for and maintain a
manhole or other device as may be approved by the Township to
facilitate observation, measurement and sampling of wastes
discharged to the sewer system and treatment plant. The
Township, or its duly authorized representatives, shall at all
reasonable times be permitted to enter upon any and all properties
for the purpose of inspecting all metering devices and of observing,
measuring and sampling wastes discharged to the sewer system
and treatment plant. Any nonresidential establishment that desires
to connect with the sewer system or which is connected to the
sewer system and plans to change its operations so as to materially
alter the characteristic and/or volumes of wastes discharged
therefrom shall notify the Township, in writing, at least 10 days
before making such connection or changing its operations.
F. Installation and Maintenance of Meters. If the owner of any
industrial or commercial establishment shall be required pursuant
to the foregoing provisions to install a water meter or meters or a
meter or meters for measuring waste waters, it shall be the duty of
such owner to furnish and install such meter at his own expense
and in such case and also if such owner shall have voluntarily
installed such meter or meters, such owner shall be required to
maintain the same in good operating condition and make all
necessary repairs and replacements. If the owner, being obligated
so to do, shall fail to furnish or install such meter or meters or shall
fail to maintain the same as above provided, then in any such case
after 10 days written notice by the Township to perform such
obligation, the Township may enter onto such property at all
reasonable time and install such meter or meters or repair and
maintain the same, as the case may be, and charge the cost of such
installation or repair to such owner. Bills for such installation or
repairs if made by the Township shall be due and payable
immediately upon completion of the work and then shall be
collected in the same manner as quarter-annum bills for sewer
rentals and charges.

resolution of said Board, is hereby empowered to modify the rates
set forth in this Part to provide for increases or decreases in the
treatment charge imposed by the municipality or municipality
authority owning or operating the applicable wastewater treatment
facility or in the Township maintenance charge for the sewer
system.
3. Time and Method of Payment, Penalties and Interest.
A. Sewer rentals for all sewer rental units shall be billed each quarterannum
on the first day of January, April, July and October,
commencing on the first next succeeding billing date upon which
waste is first discharged into the sewer system and shall be due and
payable immediately.
B. If the full amount of such bill shall not be paid within 30 days from
the date of billing, an additional sum of 10% shall be added to such
net bill, which net bill plus such additional sum shall constitute the
gross amount thereof. Any bill that remains unpaid after 90 days
shall be entered as a lien pursuant to the Municipal Lien Law,
which lien shall include attorneys' fees and costs for collection of
same. [Amended by Ord. No. 2018-01, 2/13/2018]
C. Failure of any owner to receive quarterly bills for sewer rentals and
charges due to the failure of such owner to notify the Township of
his correct address, or failure of any owner to receive a correct bill
for sewer rentals and charges by reason of the failure of such
owner to notify the Township of the use or uses of which an
improved property or any portion thereof is made, pursuant to the
notice requirements of § 18-328(5) shall not excuse nonpayment or
failure to pay the amount that would be properly applicable to the
use or uses of which said improved property is made and shall not
result in an extension of the period of time during which the net bill
shall be payable.
4. Apportionment. Whenever sewer service to any sewer rental unit
begins after the first day or terminates before the last day of any
quarterly period, the sewer rentals for such sewer rental unit for such
quarterly period shall be for that portion of the quarterly period during
which the sewer rental unit is served. However, in making such
apportionment, a fraction of a month amounting to 1/2 or more of a
month shall be counted a full month and a fraction of a month
amounting to less than 1/2 a month shall be disregarded.

sewer system together with special charges or surcharges or the
formula for computing any special charges or surcharges with
respect to the discharge of such industrial waste, which terms and
conditions and charges or surcharges shall be deemed a part of this
Part. The discharge of such industrial waste shall be subject to all
applicable provisions of this Part. Township has entered into
agreements with the City of York, Springettsbury Township and
Dover Township for transportation and treatment of sewage and
industrial waste from areas of Township as appropriate under
drainage basin concepts, determinations under Act 537 and
decisions of other regulatory agencies. Copies of said agreements,
together with ordinances incorporated by reference, which bind
Township to certain stipulations, i.e., quality and quantity of waste
are on file with the Plumbing Inspector and each applicant and/or
owner applying for plumbing permit is responsible to ascertain
which agreements and ordinances apply to his area and to comply
with all such requirements. Applicants for plumbing permits, which
will involve the connection and discharge of industrial wastes,
understand that a contract between the industry and Township for
such discharge must be consummated as a condition precedent to
the issuance of a plumbing permit.
B. Required Survey Data. Any person desiring to make or use a
connection to the sewer system through which industrial waste
shall be discharged into the sewer system shall file with this
Township an "industrial waste questionnaire," to be furnished by
this Township which shall supply to this Township pertinent data,
including estimated quantity of flow, characteristics and
constituents, with respect to industrial waste proposed to be
discharged into the sewer system. The cost of obtaining all such
data shall be borne by the person desiring to make or use a
connection to the sewer system.

where required by this Township, shall be constructed at an
accessible, safe, suitable and satisfactory location in accordance
with plans approved by this Township prior to commencement of
construction.
D. Changes in Types of Wastes. Any person discharging sanitary
sewage and/or industrial waste into the sewer system and
contemplating a change in the method of operation which will alter
the characteristics and/or volumes of wastes at the time being
discharged into the sewer system shall notify this Township, in
writing, at least 10 days prior to consummation of such change.
E. Variations in Rate of Discharge. This Township reserves the right to
require any person discharging industrial waste having large
variations in rates of waste discharge to install suitable regulating
devices for equalizing waste flows to the sewer system.
2. Unacceptable Sanitary Sewage and Industrial Wastes.
A. The discharge of excessive amount of unpolluted water or waste to
a sanitary sewer is expressly prohibited; however, such discharges
to storm sewers will be permitted wherever such sewers are
available and of adequate capacity. The Township reserves the right
to define the mount it deems excessive in each particular instance.
B. The discharge of garbage to the sewer system is expressly
prohibited, except for the use of a garbage grinder or garbage
disposal unit.
C. No person shall discharge to the sewer system any sanitary sewage
or industrial waste having any of the following characteristics:
(1) Wastes containing liquids, solids or gases which by reason of
their nature or quality may cause fire, explosions or be in any
other way injurious to persons, the structures of the sewer
system or its operation.
(2) Wastes having a temperature in excess of 150° F. or less than
32° F.
(3) Waste having a pH lower than 5.5 or higher than 9.5 or having
any corrosive properties capable of causing damage or hazards
to personnel or to structures or equipment which is a part of
the sewer system. Where the Township deems it advisable, it

may require any person discharging industrial waste to install
and maintain, at his own expense, in a manner approved by
the Township, a suitable device to continuously measure and
record the pH of the wastes so discharged.
(4) Wastes containing any noxious or malodorous gas or
substances, which either singly or by interaction with sewage
or other wastes are, in the opinion of the Township, likely to
create a public nuisance or hazard to life or to prevent entry to
sewerage structures for their maintenance and repair.
(5) Wastes containing ashes, cinders, sand, mud, straw, shavings,
metal, glass, rags, feathers, tar, plaster, wood, hair, chemical or
paint residues, greases, lime, slurry or viscous materials of
such characters or in quantity that, in the opinion of the
Township, they may cause an obstruction to the flow in the
sewers or otherwise interfere with the proper operation of the
sewer system. Attention is called to the fact that the maximum
permissible concentration will vary throughout the sewer
system depending upon the size of the particular interceptor
sewer receiving the same and the flows therein.
(6) Waste containing insoluble, non-flocculent substances having a
specific gravity in excess of 2.65.
(7) Wastes containing the soluble substances in such
concentrations as to cause the specific gravity of the waste to
be greater than 1.1.

of noncontaminated wastewaters may be required by the Township or
such exclusion may be optional with the property owner if not required
by the Township. When such wastewaters are not discharged to the
sewer system, sewer rentals shall be based upon total water
consumption, less wastewaters not discharged to the sewer system.
Wastewaters not discharged to the sewer system may be determined
from meters installed and maintained by the owner or the owner may
elect to measure the volume of waste actually discharged to the sewer
system as provided for below.
3. Sewer Meters. The Township may require a nonresidential
establishment, or the nonresidential establishment may elect to install,
pay for and maintain a meter approved by the Township for measuring
wastewater discharged to the sewer system, in which case sewer
rentals shall be based upon the actual volume of wastes discharged to
the sewer system.
4. Sewer Rental Surcharges for Nondomestic Wastes. In addition to sewer
rent for collection and treatment of sewage discharged into the sewer
system by commercial and industrial users, further charges shall be
made for all sewage discharged into the sewer system having

§ 18-516 FOREWORD § 18-517
FWD:351
B. BOD Three hundred milligrams per liter.
C. BOD One thousand eight hundred milligrams per liter.
The total surcharge fee shall equal the sum of each such surcharge
fee as calculated by the following formulas:
(1) If SS is greater than 350 mg/L, a surcharge shall be assessed
for SS in an amount equal to:
8.34 x Q x (SS - 350) x K1
1,000,000
(2) If BOD is greater than 300 mg/L, a surcharge shall be
assessed for BOD in an amount equal to:
8.34 x Q x (BOD - 300) x K2
1,000,000
(3) If BOD is greater than 1,800 mg/L, an additional surcharge
shall be assessed for BOD in an amount equal to:
8.34 x Q x (BOD - 1,800) x K2
1,000,000
Where: Q = Volume in gallons.
BOD = 5 day biochemical oxygen demand of
sewage in milligrams per liter.
SS = Suspended solids of sewage in milligrams
per liter.
K1 = Cost factor per pound of SS.
K2 = Cost factor per pound of BOD.
Cost factors K1 and K2 shall be determined by administrative
order of the City of York, operator of the sewage treatment facility,
based upon costs and are hereby incorporated by Township. The
strength of any sewage subject to surcharge shall be determined
quarterly, or more frequently as the Township and City of York
shall determine, based upon sampling by the Township or City of
York or their designees. However, the Township or City of York
may, if they so elect, determine the strength of sewage based upon
the results of routine sampling and analysis by the producer of
such sewage or the results of analysis from previous quarters or
from the results of analysis of sewage from similar customers.
5. Inspection Facilities. When directed by the Township nonresidential
establishments shall install, pay for and maintain a manhole, or other
device as may be approved by the Township, to facilitate observation,
measurement and sampling of wastes discharged to the sewer system
and treatment plant. The Township, or its duly authorized
representatives, shall at all reasonable times be permitted to enter

other private or public water company.
(2) By meters maintained and installed by the property owner as
may be required, approved and inspected by the Township.
B. Excluded Water. Exclusion from the sewer system and treatment
plant of non-contaminated wastewaters may be required by the
Township or such exclusion may be optional with the property if not
required by the Township. When such wastewaters are not
discharged to the sewer system, sewer rentals shall be based upon
total water consumption, less wastewaters not discharged to the
sewer system. Wastewaters not discharged to the sewer system
may be determined from meters installed and maintained by the
owner or the owner may elect to measure the volume of waste
actually discharged to the sewer system as provided for below.
C. Sewer Meters. The Township may require a nonresidential
establishment, or the nonresidential establishment may elect to
install, pay for and maintain a meter approved by the Township for
measuring wastewater discharged to the sewer system, in which
case sewer rentals shall be based upon the actual volume of wastes
discharged to the sewer system.
D. Sewer Rental Surcharges for Non-Domestic Wastes. In addition to
sewer rent for collection and treatment of sewage discharged into
the sewer system by commercial and industrial users, further
charges shall be made for all sewage discharged into the sewer

system having suspended solids and biochemical oxygen demand in
excess of the following concentrations:
(1) Suspended solids: 350 milligrams per liter.
(2) BOD: 300 milligrams per liter.
(3) BOD: 1,800 milligrams per liter.
The total surcharge fee shall equal the sum of each such
surcharge fee as calculated by the following formulas:
(1) If SS is greater than 350 mg/L, a surcharge shall be
assessed for SS in an amount equal to:
8.34 x Q x (SS - 350) x K1
1,000,000
(2) If BOD is greater than 300 mg/L, a surcharge shall be
assessed for BOD in an amount equal to:
8.34 x Q x (BOD - 300) x K2
1,000,000
(3) If BOD is greater than 1,800 mg/L, an additional
surcharge shall be assessed for BOD in an amount equal
to:
8.34 x Q x (BOD - 1,800) x K2
1,000,000
Where: Q = Volume in gallons.
BOD = 5 day biochemical oxygen demand of
sewage in milligrams per liter.
SS = Suspended solids of sewage in
milligrams per liter.
K1 = Cost factor per pound of SS.
K2 = Cost factor per pound of BOD.
Cost factors K1 and K2 shall be determined by administrative
order of the City of York, operator of the sewage treatment
facility, based upon costs and are hereby incorporated by
Township. The strength of any sewage subject to surcharge
shall be determined quarterly, or more frequently as the
Township and City of York shall determine, based upon
sampling by the Township or City or their designees. However,
the Township or City of York may, if they so elect, determine
the strength of sewage based upon the results of routine
sampling and analysis by the producer of such sewage or the
results of analysis from previous quarters or from the results
of analysis of sewage from similar customers.

E. Inspection Facilities. When directed by the Township
nonresidential establishments shall install, pay for and maintain a
manhole, or other device as may be approved by the Township to
facilitate observation, measurement and sampling of wastes
discharged to the sewer system and treatment plant. The
Township, or its duly authorized representatives, shall at all
reasonable times be permitted to enter upon any and all properties
for the purpose of inspecting all metering devices and of observing,
measuring and sampling wastes discharged to the sewer system
and treatment plant. Any nonresidential establishment that desires
to connect with sewer system or which is connected to the sewer
system and plans to change its operations so as to materially alter
the characteristic and/or volumes of wastes discharged therefrom
shall notify the Township, in writing, at least 10 days before making
such connection or changing its operation.
F. Installation and Maintenance of Meters. If the owner of any
industrial or commercial establishment shall be required pursuant
to the foregoing provisions to install a water meter or meters or a
meter or meters for measuring wastewaters, it shall be the duty of
such owner to furnish and install such meter at his own expense
and in such case also if such owner shall be required to maintain
the same in good operating condition and make all necessary
repairs and replacements. If the owner, being obligated to do so,
shall fail to furnish or install such meter or meters or shall fail to
maintain the same as above provided, then in any such case after
10 days written notice by the Township to perform such obligation,
the Township may enter onto such property at all reasonable times
and install such meter or meters or repair and maintain the same,
as the case may be, and charge the cost of such installation or
repair to such owner. Bills for such installation or repairs if made
by the Township shall be due and payable immediately upon
completion of the work and then shall be collected in the same
manner as quarter-annum bills for sewer rentals and charges.
G. Amendments and Modifications. Additional classifications and
sewer rentals or charges or modifications of the schedules
contained in Subsection 1 may be established by Manchester
Township, from time to time, as deemed necessary.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Supervisors, upon
resolution of said Board, is hereby empowered to modify the rates
set forth in this Part to provide for increases or decreases in the
treatment charge imposed by the municipality or municipality
authority owning or operating the applicable wastewater treatment
facility or in the Township maintenance charge for the sewer
system.

§ 18-702. Appointment of Pretreatment Administrator. [Ord.
2003-09, 4/1/2003, § 1]
Pretreatment Administrator. The Board of Supervisors hereby appoints by
law for authority a pretreatment administrator, who shall be the agent or
employee of Springettsbury Township so designated and appointed for that
purpose by Springettsbury Township. Such pretreatment administrator is
hereby delegated by the Board of Supervisors all lawful authority as may be

§ 18-703. Admission of Industrial Wastes to the Public Sanitary
Sewage System. [Ord. 2003-09, 4/1/2003, § 1]
1. General.
A. The economy and desirability of the combined treatment of
industrial wastes, holding tank wastes, trucked industrial wastes
and sanitary sewage is recognized. In general, any and all
industrial wastes, trucked industrial wastes, and septage may be
discharged to the public sanitary sewage system, except those that
are deemed harmful to the system or are specifically prohibited by
this Part. However, it is recognized that the treatment of these
wastes add to the cost of operating and maintaining the public
sanitary sewage system. Such additional costs must, therefore, be
borne by the person or persons receiving the benefit of such
treatment.
B. In addition, the acceptance of trucked wastes, including those
described as holding tank wastes, septage and trucked industrial
wastes, is based solely on the ability of the wastewater treatment
facility to assimilate those wastes without potential for interference
or pass through. If and when Springettsbury Township determines
that acceptance of any trucked waste has a potential to cause
interference or pass through, Springettsbury Township may deny
the discharge of said waste without any prior notice to the licensed
waste hauler or waste generator regardless of permits held by the
waste hauler or waste generator.
2. Harmful Wastes. Springettsbury Township reserves the right to refuse
connection to the public sanitary sewage system for the discharge of
deleterious industrial wastes, to refuse the discharge of any trucked
industrial waste, holding tank waste or septage, or to compel
discontinuance of the use of the system for such wastes, or to require
pretreatment and/or equalization of flow thereof in order to prevent
harmful or adverse effect upon the system. The design, construction
and operation of such pretreatment facilities and/or flow equalization
facilities shall be made at the sole expense of the person discharging
§ 18-701 FOREWORD § 18-703

Township Board of Supervisors or their designated representative.
3. Harmful Characteristics. In general, wastes shall be considered
harmful to the public sanitary sewage system if it may cause any of the
following damaging effects:
A. Chemical reaction either directly or indirectly with the materials of
construction of the public sanitary sewage system in such a manner
as to impair the strength or durability of any sewer system
structures.
B. Mechanical action that will destroy any sewer system structures.
C. Restriction of the hydraulic capacity of any sewer system
structures.

FWD:399
§ 18-706. Violation Notice, Remedies and Penalties. [Ord. 2003-09,
4/1/2003, § 1]
those substances referenced in Subsection 3I of this section that do
not have daily composite information.
C. Composite Limitations. Waste sample collected to determine
compliance with the provisions of this section shall be taken at the
manhole or metering chamber referred to in this section, or in the
absence of such manhole or metering chamber, at such place as
Springettsbury Township shall determine will provide a
representative sample of the discharge, or at any other place
mutually agreed upon by Springettsbury Township and user.
6. Analytical Methods. All analyses of samples shall be performed in
accordance with procedures contained in 40 CFR, Part 136 and
amendments hereto or any method approved by the EPA.
1. Enforcement Response. Enforcement actions taken by Springettsbury
Township shall be consistent with an enforcement response plan
maintained at the wastewater treatment facility.
2. Notice of Violation. Whenever the pretreatment administrator finds that
any user or waste hauler or waste generator has violated any provisions
of this Part or an industrial user permit, a commercial/industrial
discharge permit, a waste hauler license, a waste permit, an order or a
compliance schedule, the pretreatment administrator or his duly
authorized representative may serve upon said user a written notice of
violation. If required by Springettsbury Township, a written response to
the notice, including an explanation of the cause of the violation and a
plan for correction and prevention thereof, must be submitted to the
pretreatment administrator within 10 working days of receipt of the
notice. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for
any violation occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation.
3. Compliance Schedule. When required by the pretreatment
administrator, compliance schedules must be developed by existing or
new users and approved by the pretreatment administrator. These
schedules shall contain increments of progress in the form of dates for
the commencement and completion of major events leading to the
construction and operation of additional pretreatment equipment
required to meet present or proposed applicable pretreatment
standards. No increment of progress shall exceed nine months. The
pretreatment administrator shall have the right to deny or to require
the modification of proposed compliance schedules. Users under
compliance schedules shall submit progress reports to the
pretreatment administrator no later than 14 days following each
milestone date in the schedule and 14 days following the final date of
compliance. Failure to meet required milestone dates shall constitute a
violation of this Part.
§ 18-705 MANCHESTER CODE § 18-706
FWD:400
4. Administrative Fine. Notwithstanding any other section of this Part, any
user, or waste hauler or waste generator who is found to have violated
any provision of this Part or an industrial user permit, or a commercial/
industrial discharge permit, or a waste hauler license or a waste permit,
or an order issued hereunder, or is found to be in significant
noncompliance (SNC) may be fined in an amount no less than $1,000
per violation. Each day on which noncompliance shall occur or continue
shall be deemed a separate and distinct violation. All fine money shall
be made payable to the Springettsbury Township WWTF.
Springettsbury Township shall have such other collection remedies as it
has to collect other service charges. Unpaid charges, fines and
penalties shall constitute a lien against the individual user's property.
[Amended by Ord. 2011-01, 1/11/2011]
A. Any user, or waste hauler or waste generator that desires to
dispute such fines must file a request before Springettsbury
Township to reconsider the fine within 10 working days of being
notified of the fine. The Springettsbury Township treatment facility
shall include as part of the notice of an administrative fine a
description of the applicable appeals process to be followed,
including the name, address and telephone number of the person
responsible for accepting such appeal. Where Springettsbury
Township believes the request has merit, it shall convene a hearing
on the matter within 15 working days of receiving the request from
the user.
B. Anyone assessed an administrative fine shall have 30 days to pay
the proposed fine in full or, if the user wishes to contest either the
amount of the fine or the fact of the violation, the user must file an
appeal of the action. All appeals are to be made pursuant to the
instructions included in the notice of administrative fine
assessment. Failure to appeal within this period shall result in a
waiver of all legal rights to contest the violation or the amount of
the fine.
5. Administrative Order (AO). Where Springettsbury Township finds that a
user has violated or continues to violate any provisions of this Part,
permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, Springettsbury Township may issue an order to the
user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into
compliance within a time period set by Springettsbury Township. If the
user does not come into compliance within the specified time period,
sewer service shall be discontinued unless adequate treatment
facilities, devices or other related appurtenances are installed and
properly operated. Administrative orders may also contain other
requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional selfmonitoring
and management practices designed to minimize the
amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. An administrative order
may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a federal
pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does an administrative
§ 18-706 FOREWORD § 18-706
FWD:401
order release the user of liability for any violation, including any
continuing violation. Issuance of an administrative order shall not be a
prerequisite to taking any action against the user.
6. Injunctive Relief. Whenever a user has violated or continues to violate
the provisions of this Part, an industrial user permit or a commercial/
industrial discharge permit or an order issued hereunder, the
pretreatment administrator, through counsel, may petition the court for
the issuance of a preliminary or permanent injunction (or both, as may
be appropriate), which restrains or compels the activities on the part of
the user. The pretreatment administrator shall have such remedies to
collect all fees incurred by Springettsbury Township as a result of this
petition as it has to collect other sewer service charges, including a
request for payment of costs and attorneys' fees as may be authorized
by law. [Amended by Ord. 2011-01, 1/11/2011]
7. Industrial User Permit or Commercial/Industrial Discharge Permit
Revocation. Any user who violates any of the following conditions of this
Part, of an industrial user permit or of a commercial/industrial
discharge permit or of any order may be subject to the revocation of its
permit:
A. Failure of a user to factually report the wastewater constituents
and characteristic of his discharge.
B. Failure of user to report significant changes in wastewater
constituents and characteristics.
C. Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the
purposes of inspection or monitoring.
D. Violation of the conditions of the permit.
Springettsbury Township shall not revoke an industrial user permit
or commercial/industrial discharge permit without first allowing
the noncompliant user the opportunity to show cause under this
section why the proposed action should not be taken. Before any
further discharge of wastewater may be made by a user whose
permit has been revoked, the user must apply for and be granted
a reinstatement of the revoked permit or a new permit, as
Springettsbury Township may require and pay all delinquent fees,
charges and costs occasioned by the violation in accordance with
all conditions set forth in this Part and the procedural guidelines
recorded and available at the wastewater treatment facility.
Springettsbury Township will not renew an industrial user permit
or commercial/industrial discharge permit until all delinquent fees,
charges and costs occasioned are paid in full, or arrangements
have been made with Springettsbury Township on a payment plan
approved by it.
§ 18-706 MANCHESTER CODE § 18-706
FWD:402
8. Waste Hauler License Revocation. Any waste hauler who violates any
provision of this Part or of their waste hauler license or of a waste
permit held by the waste hauler or of any additional requirements set
by Springettsbury Township, may be subject to immediate license
revocation. In addition, Springettsbury Township may immediately and
without notice revoke any waste hauler license if it determines that the
acceptance of the waste is detrimental to the overall operation of the
wastewater treatment facility.
9. Waste Permit Revocation. Any waste generator who violates any
provision of this Part or of their waste permit or of any additional
requirements set by Springettsbury Township, may be subject to
immediate license revocation. In addition, Springettsbury Township
may immediately and without notice revoke any waste permit if it
determines that the acceptance of the waste is detrimental to the
overall operation of the wastewater treatment facility.
10. Show Cause Hearing. The pretreatment administrator may order any
user which causes or contributes to a violation of this Part or industrial
user permit or commercial/industrial discharge permit or order issued
hereunder, to show cause why a proposed enforcement action should
not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and
place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action and the reasons
for such action and a request that the user show cause why this
proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the
meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail to
any principal executive, general partner, corporate officer or owner of
the industrial user at least 10 days prior to the hearing. Whether or not
a duly notified user appears as noticed, immediate enforcement action
may be pursued.
11. Emergency Response. The pretreatment administrator may suspend
the wastewater treatment service and/or industrial use permit or
commercial/industrial discharge permit whenever such suspension is
necessary in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge presenting
or causing an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or
welfare of person, wastewater treatment facility or the environment.
A. Any user notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment
service and/or industrial user permit or commercial/industrial
discharge permit shall immediately stop or eliminate its
contribution. In the event or a user's failure to immediately comply
voluntarily with the suspension order, the pretreatment
administrator shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including
the immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or
minimize damage to the wastewater treatment facility, its receiving
stream or endangerment to any individuals. The pretreatment
administrator shall allow the user to recommence its discharge
when the endangerment has passed, unless the permit revocation
proceedings set forth in Subsection 7 of this section are initiated
against the user.
§ 18-706 FOREWORD § 18-706
FWD:403
B. Any user which is responsible, in whole or in part, for imminent
danger shall submit a detailed written statement describing the
causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence to the pretreatment administrator
prior to the date of the show cause hearing described in Subsection
1 of this section.
12. Criminal Penalties.
A. With or without notice, any person who shall violate any provisions
of this Part, an industrial user permit, a commercial/industrial
discharge permit, a waste hauler license, a waste permit, or order
upon conviction thereof in an action brought before a district
justice in the manner provided for the enforcement of summary
offense under the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure, shall
be sentenced to pay a fine of not more than $1,000 plus costs and,
in default of payment of said fine and costs, to a term of
imprisonment not to exceed 90 days. Each day that a violation of
this Part continues or each section of this Part which shall be found
to have been violated shall constitute a separate offense. All fine
money assessed through suit or summary proceedings before any
district justice, pursuant to this section, shall be transferred to the
Springettsbury Township sewer fund.
B. The pretreatment department may recover reasonable legal fees,
court costs and other expenses associated with enforcement
activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses and the
cost of any actual damages incurred by Springettsbury Township.
13. Public Notification. Springettsbury Township shall, at least annually,
publish in the largest daily newspaper distributed in the Township, a list
of industrial users which in the last 12 months were significantly
violating applicable pretreatment standards or other pretreatment
requirements or that were determined to be in significant
noncompliance. Significant noncompliance shall be determined
according to guidelines set in 40 CFR § 403.8(f)(2)(vii) or amendments
thereto.
14. Civil Penalties and Costs.
A. Any person who shall violate the provisions of this Part, any permit
issued pursuant to the Part or any regulation adopted under this
Part may, after notice and hearing as hereinafter provided, be
assessed a civil penalty for such violation and, in addition to such
penalty, be assessed the cost of any damages caused by the
violation or the cost of correcting such violation.
B. Before assessing a civil penalty or costs, Springettsbury Township
shall provide the violator with a written notice of proposed
assessment citing the ordinance provision, permit or regulation
violated with an offer to conduct an assessment hearing to evaluate
the violation and the amount of the penalty or cost. Said notice
§ 18-706 MANCHESTER CODE § 18-706
FWD:404
shall contain an explanation of the right to a hearing and the
right to appeal from the assessment made. [Amended by Ord.
2011-01, 1/11/2011]
C. Springettsbury Township shall assign a representative to hold the
assessment hearing who will normally be Springettsbury
Township's Director of Wastewater Treatment. In no event shall the
pretreatment administrator act as the hearing officer.
D. The assessment hearing shall be informal and shall not be
governed by requirements for formal adjudicatory hearings. The
hearing shall be held at the administrative offices of the
wastewater treatment facility at the convenience of the parties;
provided, however, that should the violator fail or refuse to agree as
to time for the hearing, the hearing officer shall fix a time and
direct the violator's attendance. Should the violator fail or refuse to
attend, the hearing officer may proceed with the hearing and if
appropriate, assess a civil penalty and/or costs.
E. A civil penalty may be assessed whether or not the violation was
willful. The amount of the penalty shall not be less than $1,000 per
day per violation; provided, however, that any industrial user who
shall violate the Township's pretreatment standards and/or the
requirements of Springettsbury Township's approved pretreatment
program may be assessed a penalty not to exceed $25,000 per day
per violation, as provided in the Publicly Owned Treatment Works
Penalty Law. In determining the amount of the penalty, the hearing
officer shall consider the following: [Amended by Ord. 2011-01,
1/11/2011]
(1) The willfulness of the violation.
(2) Damages to air, water, land or other natural resources or their
user.
(3) Cost of restoration and abatement.
(4) Savings resulting to the person in consequence of the violation.
(5) Deterrence of future violations.
(6) History of past violations.
(7) Other relevant factors.
F. If a person against whom a civil penalty and costs has been
assessed fails to pay the amount assessed in full or appeal the
assessment de novo as provided in Subsection 14G of this section
hereof within 30 days following the date of assessment, such failure
to pay or perfect an appeal shall constitute a separate violation for
which an additional civil penalty may be assessed after notice and
hearing. Additional violations shall be deemed to occur and
§ 18-706 FOREWORD § 18-706
FWD:405
additional civil penalties may be assessed each time a person fails
to pay or perfect an appeal.
G. A person assessed with a civil penalty or costs pursuant to this
section shall have 30 days to pay the penalty and costs in full. If the
person assessed wishes to contest the violation or the penalty or
costs assessed, such person shall have the right to appeal de novo
to the Springettsbury Township Board of Supervisors for a hearing
under the Local Agency Law. The notice of appeal and request for
hearing shall be filed within 30 days of the date of receipt of notice
of the action appealed. The notice of the appeal must be
accompanied by the amount of the civil penalty and/or costs to be
held in an escrow account by Springettsbury Township. In lieu of
such payment, the appellant may post an irrevocable letter of
credit for the required amount issued by a federal or
commonwealth chartered lending institution or an appeal bond in
such amount executed by a surety licensed to do business in this
commonwealth and in a form satisfactory to the Springettsbury
Township. If after the Local Agency Law review or final judicial
review the civil penalty and/or costs are removed or reduced the
amount paid into escrow shall be adjusted accordingly and the
balance remitted to the appellant within 30 days, or in the case of a
letter of credit or surety bond having been posted, upon payment of
the amount due, such letter of credit or bond shall be released.
Failure to make the required deposit in escrow or submit an
irrevocable letter of credit or a surety as provided in this section,
shall result in a waive of all legal rights to appeal the violation or
the amount of the penalty and/or costs assessed.
H. In any case where the Springettsbury Township determines that
the violation is of a continuing nature, Springettsbury Township
may impose a weekly assessment of not more than $2,500 per week
for each week the violation continues unabated by the violator.
Such weekly assessment shall accrue indefinitely after the date of
notice of the assessment to the violator.
I. All civil costs and penalties assessed pursuant to this section shall
be payable to the Springettsbury Township Sewer Fund and shall
be collectible in any manner provided by law for the collection of
debts. Unpaid civil penalties and/or costs, together with interest
and any costs that may accrue, shall constitute a judgment in favor
of Springettsbury Township and be a lien upon the real property of
the violator from the date such amount has been entered and
docketed on the record by the Prothonotary of York County.
15. Fines and Civil Penalties Collected. All fines and civil penalties collected
pursuant to Subsection 13 or 14 of this section shall be placed in a
restricted account and shall only be used for the repair of damage or
mitigation of threats to the public health, to pay any penalties imposed
on Springettsbury Township by the federal or state governments for
violation of pretreatment standards, for costs incurred to investigate

readily and easily accessible for maintenance by the user and for
inspection by Springettsbury Township. AU plumbing appurtenances
and grease trap installations shall conform to the most recent BOCA
requirements.
15. Pretreatment Facility Requirements. Pretreatment facilities including,
but not limited to, grease traps, shall be provided by a user when, in the
opinion of Springettsbury Township, they are necessary for the proper
handling of wastes containing excessive amounts of pollutants. All
pretreatment facilities shall be of type and capacity approved by
Springettsbury Township and shall be located to be easily accessible for
cleaning, inspection and maintenance. Where installed, all
pretreatment facilities shall be maintained by the user, at his own
expense, and shall be kept in continuous and efficient operation at all
times.
16. Notice of Changed Discharge Requirements. Each user shall notify the
pretreatment administrator of any planned significant changes to the

2011-01, 1/11/2011]
1. Surcharges. Although the sewage treatment works will be capable of
treating certain industrial wastes and wastes generated from a
commercial establishment, the actual treatment of such wastes may
increase the cost of operating and maintaining the public sanitary
sewage system. Therefore, there shall be imposed upon each person
discharging such waste into the public sanitary sewage system a
surcharge, or surcharges which are intended to cover such additional
costs. Such surcharges shall be in addition to the regular sewage
service charges established by Springettsbury Township, and shall be
payable as herein provided.
§ 18-707 MANCHESTER CODE § 18-708
FWD:412
2. Determination of Surcharges. The strength of any waste, the discharge
of which is to be subject to surcharge as determined by this section,
shall be determined quarterly, or more frequently as the Township shall
determine, from samples taken either at the manhole or metering
chamber referred to herein, or at any other sampling point mutually
agreed upon by the Township and the producer of such waste. The
frequency and duration of the sampling period shall be such as, in the
opinion of the Township, shall permit a reasonably reliable
determination of the average composition of such waste, exclusive of
stormwater runoff. Samples shall be collected or their collection
supervised by a representative of the Township and shall be samples
that reasonably reflect the characteristics of the waste over a twentyfour-
hour period. Except as hereinafter provided, the strength of the
waste so found by analysis shall be used for establishing the surcharge
or surcharges. The costs of sample collection and analysis for the
purpose of determining surcharge rates shall be set through a
resolution by the Board of Supervisors of Springettsbury Township.
However, the Township may, if it so elects, accept the results of routine
sampling and analyses by the producer of such wastes in lieu of making
its own sampling and analyses.
3. Calculation of Surcharges. In the event that, after sampling and
analysis as prescribed in this section, any waste found by the
Springettsbury Township to have pollutants of BOD concentration in
excess of 300 mg/L and/or total suspended solids concentration in
excess of 350 mg/L and/or total phosphate as P concentration in excess
of 10 mg/L, the producer of said waste shall pay a strength of waste
surcharge in addition to the flat rate of volume charge set forth by
Springettsbury Township, which surcharge shall be computed by using
the following formula:
Factor (%) = 60
+
15[(BOD - 5 mg/
L)]
[300]
+
15[(TSS mg/L)]
[350]
+
10[(P mg/L)
[10]
- 100
Where the concentration of the waste is less than 300 mg/L for BOD or 350 mg/L for total
suspended solids or 10 mg/L for phosphate as P, the values in parentheses for BOD and/or total
suspended solids and/or total phosphate as P shall be equal to 1. The amount of the strength of
waste surcharge shall be computed by multiplying the flat rate of volume charge, as set forth
by Springettsbury Township for collection, transportation and treatment, by the surcharge factor
derived above.
4. The strength of waste surcharges provided for in this section shall be
added to the sewage service charge imposed by the Springettsbury
Township.
5. Sampling Fees and Schedules for Significant Industrial Users. All
significant industrial users requiring an industrial user permit shall be
assessed a fee for service charge for each scheduled sampling and
unscheduled compliance sampling to be performed by Springettsbury
§ 18-708 FOREWORD § 18-708
FWD:413

Properties Outside Springettsbury Township. [Ord. 2003-09, 4/1/
2003, § 1]
The rates for the transportation and treatment of sewage from properties
outside the geographical limits of Springettsbury Township, including
strength of water surcharges, shall be such amount as the Springettsbury
Township Board of Supervisors will have negotiated and agreed, in writing,
with Manchester Township.
Township. The charge to the significant industrial user for each
scheduled sampling shall be set through a resolution by the Board of
Supervisors of Springettsbury Township. The charge to the significant
industrial user for each unscheduled compliance sampling shall be
120% of the cost of each scheduled sampling.
6. Sampling Fees and Schedules for Commercial Users.
A. All commercial users requiring an industrial user permit shall be
assessed a fee for service charge for each scheduled sampling and
unscheduled compliance sampling to be performed by
Springettsbury Township. The charge to the commercial user for
each scheduled sampling shall be set through a resolution by the
Board of Supervisors of Springettsbury Township. The charge to
the significant industrial user for each unscheduled compliance
sampling shall be 120% of the cost of each scheduled sampling.
B. A sampling frequency table shall be on file at the wastewater
treatment facility for each significant industrial user and
commercial user and shall indicate the number of scheduled
samplings that are to be routinely performed by Springettsbury
Township for a certain time period, not including unscheduled
compliance samplings. Springettsbury Township shall sample all
significant industrial users and commercial users at least once per
year.
C. The scheduled sampling frequency shall be based on several
criteria including, but not limited to: flow, SIC number and
historical waste characteristics including past ordinance violations.
Periodic reviews of data at least once per year but not more
frequently than every six months may result in revisions of the
table. An unscheduled compliance sample may be collected from
any user within 30 days after Springettsbury Township identifies a
violation of any provision of § 18-705(2) or (3) of this Part resulting
from any scheduled or unscheduled sampling.
7. Other Sampling and Testing Fees. Springettsbury Township may collect
waste samples, make inspections and incur other expenses in order to
determine user compliance with applicable rules and regulations and
may assess users certain fees for those services in accordance with a
resolution set by the Springettsbury Township Board of Supervisors.

costs, damages and liabilities which may accrue or be claimed to
accrue by reason of the permitted waste disposal activity.
E. Permit holders shall comply with the conditions of the permit and
failure to do so constitutes a violation of this Part.
F. A permit holder shall notify the pretreatment coordinator of any
planned significant changes to its operations which might alter the
nature, quality or volume of its industrial waste at least 30 days
before the change. In response to such a notice the pretreatment
coordinator may modify the permit or require application for a new
permit. For purposes of this requirement, significant changes
include, but are not limited to, flow increases of 20% or greater and
the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants.
G. A permit may be suspended or revoked in whole or in part by the
pretreatment coordinator for cause including, but not limited to:
(1) Violation of any terms or conditions of the permit, federal or
state pretreatment requirements or this Part.
(2) Obtaining the permit by misrepresentation or failure to
disclose fully all relevant facts.
(3) A change in any condition including, but not limited to,
changes in state or federal regulations or changes in the POTW
that require either a temporary or permanent reduction or
elimination of the permitted discharge.
(4) Knowingly making any false statement, representation or
certification in any record or other document submitted or
required by the permit.
(5) Tampering with or knowingly rendering inaccurate any
monitoring device or method required to be maintained under
the permit or used by Dover Township to monitor the
discharge.
H. Permit Conditions.
(1) Industrial waste permits shall be expressly subject to all
provisions of this Part and all other applicable state, federal
and local regulations, user charges and fees. Where federal or
state pretreatment regulations impose additional requirements
or more stringent requirements than those stated in the
industrial waste permit, these requirements and limits become
§ 18-805 FOREWORD § 18-805
FWD:421
part of the permit whether or not they are stated in the permit.
Obtaining an industrial waste permit does not relieve a permit
holder of the obligation to comply with all federal and state
pretreatment standards or requirements or with any other
requirements of federal, state and local law. Permits shall
contain the following:
(a) The term of the permit.
(b) A statement that the wastewater discharge permit is
nontransferable without prior notification to Dover
Township in accordance with Subsection 11 of this section.
(c) Effluent limits based on applicable pretreatment
standards.
(d) Self monitoring, sampling, reporting, notification and
recordkeeping requirements.
(e) A statement of applicable civil and criminal penalties for
violation of pretreatment standards and requirements and
any applicable compliance schedule. Such schedule may
not extend the time for compliance beyond that required
by applicable federal, state or local law.
(2) Wastewater discharge permits may contain, but need not be
limited to, the following conditions:
(a) Limits on the average and/or maximum rate of discharge,
time of discharge and/or requirements for flow regulations
and equalization.
(b) Requirements for the installation of pretreatment
technology, pollution control or construction of
appropriate containment devices, designed to reduce,
eliminate or prevent the introduction of pollutants into the
treatment works.
(c) Requirements for the development and implementation of
spill control plans or other special conditions, including
management practices necessary to adequately prevent
accidental, unanticipated or non-routine discharges.
(d) Development and implementation of waste minimization
plans to reduce the amount of pollutants discharged to the
POTW.
(e) The unit charge or schedule of user charges and fees for
the management of wastewater discharged to the POTW.
(f) Requirements for installation and maintenance of
inspection and sampling facilities and equipment.
§ 18-805 MANCHESTER CODE § 18-805
FWD:422
(g) Other conditions as deemed appropriate by the
pretreatment coordinator to ensure compliance with this
Part and state and federal laws, rules and regulations.
I. Permit Duration. An industrial permit shall be issued for a specified
time period not to exceed five years. A permit holder shall apply for
permit re-issuance a minimum of 120 days prior to the expiration of
the existing permit if he desires to avoid lapses in the permit.
J. Change in Conditions. The terms and conditions of a permit may be
subject to modification by Dover Township during the term of the
permit should change in federal or state pretreatment regulations
occur or other just cause exist. The permit holder shall be informed
of any proposed changes in his permit at least 30 days prior to the
effective date of the change. Any changes or new conditions in the
permit shall include a reasonable time schedule for compliance.
K. Permit Transfer. Industrial waste permits may be transferred to a
new owner or user only if the permittee gives at least 30 days
advance notice to the pretreatment coordinator and the
pretreatment coordinator approves the wastewater discharge
permit transfer. The notice must include a written certification by
the new owner or user which:
(1) States that the new owner and/or user has no immediate intent
to change the facility's operations and processes.
(2) Identifies the specific date on which the transfer is to occur.
(3) Acknowledges full responsibility for complying with the
existing industrial waste permit.
Failure to provide advance notice of a transfer renders the
industrial waste permit void as of the date of facility transfer.
L. Certification of Reports. All industrial waste permit applications
and user reports must be signed by an authorized representative of
the user and contain the following certification statement:
"I certify under penalty of law that this document and all
attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision in
accordance with a system designed to assure that qualified
personnel properly gather and evaluate the information submitted.
Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the
system, or those person directly responsible for gathering the
information, the information submitted is, to the best of my
knowledge and belief, true, accurate and complete. I am aware
that there are significant penalties for submitting false information,
including the possibility of fine and imprisonment for knowing
violations."
§ 18-805 FOREWORD § 18-805
FWD:423
5. Reporting, Sampling and Testing. The holder of an industrial waste
permit shall furnish the pretreatment coordinator with written and
signed reports of sample testing at a frequency specified in the
industrial waste permit. Samples shall be collected, preserved and
analyzed promptly, in accordance with 40 CFR, Part 136. Users shall
also furnish other report as required by federal or state pretreatment
regulations.
6. Control Manhole. Any person discharging industrial waste into the
POTW shall construct and maintain, at his expense, a suitable control
manhole or manholes downstream from any treatment works to
facilitate observation, measurement and sampling of all wastes from
the facilities. The control manhole or manholes shall be located and
built in a manner approved by the pretreatment coordinator. The
control manhole shall be accessible to the pretreatment coordinator or
his representatives at all time. Failure of a user to provide such access
is a violation of this Part.
7. Slug Loading. A user shall notify the pretreatment coordinator
immediately of any planned or unplanned discharge of waste of a
strength or character unusual for that user or in violation of an
industrial waste permit. A written follow-up report thereof shall be filed
by the user within five days. The report shall specify:
A. Description of the discharge, the cause thereof and the impact on
the user's compliance status.
B. Duration of noncompliance, including exact dates and times and, if
noncompliance continues, the time by which compliance is
reasonably expected to occur.
C. All steps taken or to be taken to reduce, eliminate and prevent
recurrence of the discharge.
8. Inspections. The pretreatment coordinator and other duly authorized
agents of the pretreatment coordinator bearing proper credentials and
identification shall be permitted to enter upon all properties for the
purposes of inspection, observation, measurement, sampling and
testing and to examine and copy records of operation required by Dover
Township, federal or state agencies in accordance with the provisions of
this Part.
9. Enforcement Response. Enforcement actions taken by Dover Township
shall be consistent with an enforcement response plan maintained by
the pretreatment coordinator.
10. Notice of Violation. Whenever Dover Township finds that any user has
violated any provision of this Part, an industrial waste permit or a
compliance order, the pretreatment coordinator may serve or cause to
be served upon such person, a written notice either personally or by
certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, stating the nature
of the alleged violation. Within 30 days of the date of receipt of the
§ 18-805 MANCHESTER CODE § 18-805
FWD:424
notice, the user shall submit an explanation of the violation and a plan
for the correction and prevention of violations of this Part.
11. Administrative Fines (Civil Penalties). Notwithstanding any other
section of this Part, any user or waste hauler who is found to have
violated any provision of this Part, or an industrial waste permit, or a
waste hauler license shall be fined in an amount not to exceed $25,000
per violation. Each day on which noncompliance shall occur or continue
shall be deemed a separate and distinct violation. All fine money shall
be payable to the Dover Township Sewer Fund and shall be added to the
next scheduled sewer bill.
A. Person who desire to dispute such fines must file a request before
Dover Township to reconsider the fine within 10 working days of
being notified of the fine. Where Dover Township believes the
request has merit, it shall convene a hearing on the matter within
15 working days of receiving the request.
B. Dover Township shall include with any notice of an assessment of a
civil penalty a notice of the appeals process to be followed,
including the name, address and telephone number of the person
responsible for accepting such appeal.
C. Dover Township shall include as part of its pretreatment program
procedures a civil penalty assessment policy and shall provide
notice of this policy in each industrial waste permit.
D. Civil penalties collected pursuant to this Part shall be placed in the
Dover Township Sewer Fund and shall be used for the repair of
damage and any additional maintenance needed or any additional
costs imposed as a result of the violation for which the penalty was
imposed, to pay any penalties imposed on the POTW by federal or
state government for violation of pretreatment standards, for the
costs incurred by the POTW to investigate and take the
enforcement action that resulted in a penalty being imposed, for
the monitoring of discharges in the pretreatment program and for
capital improvements to the treatment works, including sewage
collection lines which may be required by the pretreatment
program. Any remaining funds may be used for capital
improvements to the treatment works, including collection lines.
12. Administrative and Consent Orders. When the pretreatment
coordinator finds that a user has violated any provision of this Part, the
pretreatment coordinator may issue an order to the user responsible for
the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a
specified time. If the users does not come into compliance, sewer
service may be discontinued. Administrative orders may also contain
other requirements to address the noncompliance, such as
management practices and additional self-monitoring. Dover Township
may also enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance
or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user
§ 18-805 FOREWORD § 18-805
FWD:425
responsible for noncompliance. Such documents shall include specific
action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within
a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall be
judicially enforceable. Such order or agreements may not extend a
deadline for compliance established by a federal or state pretreatment
standard, nor do they relieve a user of liability for any violation(s).
13. Suspension and Termination of Service.
A. Emergency Suspension of Service. Dover Township may for good
cause suspend the wastewater treatment service to any use when it
appears to Dover Township that an actual or threatened discharge
presents or may present an imminent or substantial danger to the
health or welfare of persons or to the environment, interferes with
the operation of the POTW or violates any pretreatment limits
imposed by this Part. Continued discharge by a user after receipt of
an order to cease a discharge to the POTW is a violation of this Part.
If a user shall fail to comply with a suspension order, Dover
Township may commence judicial proceedings to compel
compliance.
B. Revocation of Treatment Services. In addition to the provisions of
Subsection 11 hereof, a user who violates the following conditions
is subject to discharge termination:
(1) Violation of the conditions of this Part or any order entered
with respect thereto.
(2) Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge.
(3) Failure to report significant changes in wastewater
constituents and characteristics.
(4) Failure to permit reasonable access to the user's premises for
the purpose of inspection, monitoring or sampling.
C. Judicial Proceedings. Whenever a user has violated the provisions
of this Part, Dover Township may petition the court for the issuance
of a preliminary or permanent injunction (or both, as may be
appropriate), which restrains or compels the activities on the part
of the user. Following the entry of any order by Dover Township
with respect to violations of this Part, Dover Township may
commence an action for legal and/or equitable relief in any
appropriate court.
D. Show Cause Hearing. The pretreatment coordinator may order a
user which has violated any provision of this Part to appear before
the pretreatment coordinator to show cause why a proposed
enforcement action, including termination of services, should not
be taken. Notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by
registered mail, return receipt requested, at least seven days prior
§ 18-805 MANCHESTER CODE § 18-805
FWD:426
to the hearing. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or
prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.
14. Criminal Penalties. With or without notice, any person, firm or
corporation who shall violate the provisions of this Part, an industrial
waste permit, a waste hauler license or order upon conviction thereof in
an action brought before a district justice in the manner provided for
the enforcement of summary offenses under the Pennsylvania Rules of
Criminal Procedure, shall be sentenced to pay a fine of not more than
$1,000 plus costs and, in default of payment of said fine and costs, to a
term of imprisonment not to exceed 90 days. Each day that a violation
of this Part or each section of this Part which shall be found to have
been violated shall constitute a separate offense. All fine money
assessed through suit or summary proceedings before any district
justice, pursuant to this section, shall be transferred to the Dover
Township Sewer Fund.
15. Fees and Surcharges for Wastes.
A. Surcharges. Certain wastes may increase the cost of operating the
POTW. Therefore there shall be imposed upon each user
discharging such waste a surcharge or surcharges to cover such
additional costs. The surcharges shall be in addition to the regular
sewage charges and shall be payable as herein provided.
B. Determination of Surcharges. The strength of any waste, discharge
of which is to be subject to surcharge, shall be determined
quarterly or more frequently as Dover Township shall determine,
based upon sampling and analysis by Dover Township or its
designees. However, Dover Township may, if it so elects, determine
the strength of the sewage based upon the results of routine
sampling and analysis by the producer of such sewage or the
results of analysis from previous quarters or the results of analysis
of sewage from similar customers.
C. Calculation of Surcharges. Surcharges shall be made for all sewage
or waste discharged into the POTW by nonresidential users that
have concentrations for certain parameters in excess of certain
concentration limits as listed below:
Parameters Concentration Limits in mg/L
Ammonia (as Nitrogen) 15
BOD 300
Phosphate 10
Suspended Solids 350
Surcharges for each parameter in excess of its concentration limit
shall be calculated using the formula below:
§ 18-805 FOREWORD § 18-805
FWD:427
Surcharge = .00000834 x Q x (Concentration - Concentration Limit) x K
Q = Volume in gallons.
K = Cost factor per parameter.
Cost factors shall be set through a resolution set by the Dover
Township Board of Supervisors based on costs, toxicity and impact
on sludge disposal.
16. Sampling fees and schedules for users requiring an industrial waste
permit shall be assessed a fee for service charge for sampling
scheduled in the permit and for unscheduled compliance sampling to be
performed by Dover Township. The charge to each user for each
sampling shall be set through a resolution by the Dover Township Board
of Supervisors.
17. Waste Hauler Licenses.
A. The economy and desirability of the combined treatment of septage
and holding tank wastes is recognized. In general, septage, holding
tank waste and trucked industrial and commercial wastes may be
discharged to the POTW except those that are deemed harmful to
the system or are specifically prohibited by this Part. The
acceptance of trucked waste is based solely on the ability of the
POTW to assimilate those wastes without potential for interference
and pass through. If and when Dover Township determines that the
acceptance of any trucked waste has a potential to cause
interference and pass through, Dover Township may deny the
discharge of said waste without any prior notice to the licensed
waste hauler or waste generator regardless of permits or licenses
held.
B. All persons desiring to transport and discharge waste to the POTW
through use of a truck or means of conveyance other than a sewer
shall first make application with Dover Township for a waste hauler
license on a form approved by Dover Township. No trucked waste
shall be discharged to any discharge point in the POTW except
those specifically designated by Dover Township and at a time
approved by Dover Township.
C. Waste hauler licenses shall be issued for a specific time period not
to exceed one year and shall contain limits considered appropriate
by the pretreatment coordinator. Licenses shall not be assigned or
transferred or sold without approval of Dover Township. Any
succeeding owner shall comply with the terms and conditions of the
existing license.
D. All waste generators proposing to dispose of trucked industrial
wastes at the POTW shall make application for an industrial waste
permit on a form approved by Dover Township. After evaluation
and acceptance of the data furnished as a complete application,
§ 18-805 MANCHESTER CODE § 18-805
FWD:428
Dover Township may at its sole discretion either refuse to issue
or may issue an industrial waste permit to the waste generator
subject to terms and conditions provided herein. No permit shall
be issued for trucked industrial waste, that is a hazardous waste.
Dover Township may require that the waste generator enter into a
contract for the disposal of trucked industrial waste.
E. Any waste hauler who violates any provision of this Part or of their
waste hauler license or of any additional requirements set by Dover
Township, may be subject to immediate license revocation. In
addition, Dover Township may immediately and without notice
revoke any waste hauler license if Dover Township determines that
the acceptance of the waste is detrimental to the operation of the
POTW.
18. Hazardous Wastes.
A. Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall
notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division
Director and state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any
discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise
disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR, Part 261.
Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as
set forth in 40 CFR, Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number and
the type of discharge (continuous, batch or other). If the user
discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar
month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following
information to the extent such information is known and readily
available to the user; an identification of the hazardous
constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and
concentration of such constituents in the waste-stream discharged
that calendar month and an estimation of the mass of constituents
in the waste-stream expected to be discharged during the following
12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 days
after the discharge commences. Any notification under this section
needed be submitted only once for each hazardous waste
discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions must be
submitted under Subsection 4H of this section. The notification
requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already
reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards
under the self-monitoring requirements of this Part.
B. Discharges are exempt from the requirements of Subsection 18A
above, during a calendar month in which they discharge no more
than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute
hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR, §§ 261.30(d) and
261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of non-acute
hazardous wastes in a calendar month or of any quantity of acute
hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR, 261.30(d) and 261.33(d)
requires a one time notification. Subsequent months during which
§ 18-805 FOREWORD § 18-805
FWD:429
the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous
waste do not require additional notification.
C. In the case of any new regulations under § 3001 of RCRA
identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing
any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must
notify the pretreatment coordinator, the EPA Regional Waste
Management Waste Division Director and state hazardous waste
authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the
effective date of such regulations.
D. In the case of any notification made under this section, the user
shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and
toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has
determined to be economically practical.
E. This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance
not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this Part, a permit
issued thereunder or any applicable federal or state law.
19. Confidential Information. Information and data on a user obtained from
reports, surveys, wastewater discharge permit applications,
wastewater discharge permits and monitoring programs and from
Dover Township's inspection and sampling activities, shall be available
to the public without restriction, unless the user specifically requests,
and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the pretreatment
coordinator, that the release of such information would divulge
information, process or methods of production entitled to protection as
trade secrets under applicable state law. Any such request must be
asserted at the time of submission of the information or data. When
requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that such
information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which
might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made
available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available
immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to
the NPDES program or pretreatment program and in enforcement
proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater
constituents and characteristics and other "effluent data" as defined by
40 CFR, § 2.302 will not be recognized as confidential information and
will be available to the public without restriction.
20. Publication of Users in Significant Noncompliance. Dover Township
shall publish annually, in the largest daily newspaper published in the
Township, a list of the users which, during the previous 12 months,
were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment
standards and requirements. The term significant noncompliance shall
mean:
A. Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as
those in which 66% or more of wastewater measurements taken
§ 18-805 MANCHESTER CODE § 18-805
FWD:430
during a six month period exceed the daily maximum limit or
average limit for the same pollutant parameter by any amount.
B. Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in
which 33% or more of wastewater measurements taken for each
pollutant parameter during a six-month period equals or exceeds
the product of the daily maximum limit or the average limit
multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4 BOD, TSS, fats, oils and
greases and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH).
C. Any other discharge violation 'that the pretreatment coordinator
believes has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges,
interference or pass through, including endangering the health of
POTW personnel or the general public.
D. Any discharge of pollutants that has cause imminent endangerment
to the public or to the environment or has resulted in the
pretreatment coordinator's exercise of its emergency authority to
halt or prevent such a discharge.
E. Failure to meet, within 90 days of the scheduled date, a compliance
schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or
enforcement order for starting construction, completing of
construction or attaining final compliance.
F. Failure to provide within 30 days after the due date, any required
reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on
compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines,
periodic self-monitoring reports and reports on compliance with
compliance schedules.
G. Failure to accurately report noncompliance.
H. Any other violation(s) which the pretreatment coordinator
determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of
the local pretreatment program.
21. National Categorical Pretreatment Standards. The National
Pretreatment Standards and Categorical Pretreatment Standards found
at 40 CFR, Chapter 1, Subchapter N, Parts 403-471 are hereby
incorporated.
A. Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in
terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in
wastewater, the pretreatment coordinator may impose equivalent
concentration or mass limits in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(c).
B. When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is
mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the
pretreatment coordinator shall impose an alternate limit using the
combined waste-stream formula in 40 CFR § 403.6(e).
§ 18-805 FOREWORD § 18-805
FWD:431
C. A user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment
standard if the user can prove, pursuant to the procedural and
substantive provisions in 40 CFR, § 403.13, that factors relating to
its discharge are fundamentally different from the factors
considered by EPA when developing the categorical pretreatment
standard.
D. A user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard
in accordance with 40 CFR, § 403.15.
22. Dilution. No user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any
way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute
for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge
limitation unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment
standard or requirement. The pretreatment coordinator may impose
mass limitations on users who are using dilution to meet applicable
pretreatment standards or requirements or in other cases when the
imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.
23. Reporting Requirements.
A. Baseline Monitoring Reports.
(1) Within either 180 days after the effective date of a categorical
pretreatment standard or the final administrative decision on a
category determination under 40 CFR, § 403.6(a)(4),
whichever is later, existing categorical users currently
discharging to or scheduled to discharge to the POTW shall
submit to the pretreatment coordinator a report which
contains the information listed in Subsection 23B below. At
least 90 days prior to commencement of their discharge, new
sources and sources that become categorical users subsequent
to the promulgation of an applicable categorical standard shall
submit to the pretreatment coordinator a report which
contains the information listed in Subsection 23B below. A new
source shall report the method of pretreatment it intends to
use to meet applicable categorical standards. A new source
also shall give estimates of its anticipated flow and quantity of
pollutants to be discharged.

diagram which indicates points of discharge to the POTW
from the regulated processes.
(d) Flow Measurement. Information showing the measured
average daily and maximum daily flow, in gallons per day,
to the POTW from regulated process streams and other
streams, as necessary, to allow use of the combined wastestream
formula set out in 40 CFR, 403.6(e).
(e) Measurement of Pollutants.
1) The categorical pretreatment standards applicable to
each regulated process.
2) The results of sampling and analysis identifying the
nature and concentration and/or mass where required
by the standard or by the pretreatment coordinator of
regulated pollutants in the discharge from each
regulated process. Instantaneous, daily maximum and
long-term average concentrations or mass where
required shall be reported. The sample shall be
representative of daily operations and shall be
analyzed in accordance with procedures set out in
Subsection 5 of this section.
3) Sampling must be performed in accordance with
procedures set out in Subsection 5 of this section.
(f) Certification. A statement, reviewed by the user's
authorized representative and certified by a qualified
professional, indicating whether pretreatment standards
are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, whether
additional operation and maintenance (O and M) and/or
additional pretreatment is required to meet the
pretreatment standards and requirements.
(g) Compliance Schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or O
and M will be required to meet the pretreatment
standards, the shortest schedule by which the user will

shall apply to the compliance schedule required by Subsection
23A(2)(g) of this section:
(1) The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of
dates for the commencement and completion of major events
leading to the construction and operation of additional
pretreatment required for the user to meet the applicable
pretreatment standards (such events include, but are not
limited to, hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final
plans, executing contracts for major components, commencing
and completing construction and beginning and conducting
routine operation).
(2) No increment referred to above shall exceed nine months.
(3) The user shall submit a progress report to the pretreatment
coordinator no later than 14 days following each date in the
schedule and the final date of compliance, including as a
minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of
progress, the reason for any delay and, if appropriate, the
steps being taken by the user to return to the established
schedule.
(4) In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such
progress reports to the pretreatment coordinator.
C. Reports on Compliance with Categorical Pretreatment Standard
Deadline. Within 90 days following the date for final compliance
with applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case
of a new source following commencement of the introduction of
wastewater into the POTW, any user subject to such pretreatment
Standards and requirements shall submit to the pretreatment
coordinator a report containing the information described in
Subsection 23A(2)(a)-(f) of this section. For users subject to
equivalent mass or concentration limits established in accordance
with the procedures in 40 CFR, 403.6(c), this report shall contain a
reasonable measure of the user's long-term production rate. For all
other users subject to categorical pretreatment standards
expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of
production (or other measure of option), this report shall include
the user's actual production during the appropriate sampling
period. All compliance reports must be signed and certified in
accordance with Subsection 4L of this section.
D. Periodic Compliance Reports.
(1) All significant industrial users shall, at a frequency determined
by the pretreatment coordinator but in no case less than twice
a year (in June and December), submit a report indicating the
nature and concentration of pollutants in the discharge which
are limited by pretreatment standards and the measured or
§ 18-805 MANCHESTER CODE § 18-805
FWD:434
estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting
period. All period compliance reports must be signed and
certified in accordance with Subsection 4L of this section.
(2) All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's
discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement
facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean and maintained
in good working order at all time. The failure of a user to keep
its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be
grounds for the user to claim that sample results are
unrepresentative of its discharge.
(3) If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section
monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by
pretreatment coordinator, using the procedures prescribed in
Subsection 5 of this section, the results of this monitoring shall
be included in the report.
E. Reports of Potential Problems.
(1) In the case of any discharge including, but not limited to,
accidental discharges, discharges of a non-routine, episodic
nature, a non-customary batch discharge or a slug load, that
may cause potential problems for the POTW, the user shall
immediately telephone and notify the pretreatment
coordinator of the incident. This notification shall include the
location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and
volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the user.
(2) Within five days following such discharge, the user shall,
unless waived by the pretreatment coordinator, submit a
detailed written report describing the cause(s) of the discharge
and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar
future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user
of any expense, loss, damage or other liability which may be
incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources
or any other damage to person or property, nor shall such
notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties or other
liability which may be imposed pursuant to this Part.
(3) A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin
board or other prominent place advising employees whom to
call in the event of a discharge described in Subsection 23E(1)
above. Employers shall ensure that all employees, who may
cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the emergency
notification procedure.
F. Reports from Unpermitted Users. All users not required to obtain a
wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to
the pretreatment coordinator as the pretreatment coordinator may
require.
§ 18-805 FOREWORD § 18-805
FWD:435
G. Notice of Violation/Repeal Sampling and Reporting. If sampling
performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify
pretreatment coordinator within 24 hours of becoming aware of the
violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and
submit the results of the repeat analysis to pretreatment
coordinator within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation.
The user is not required to re-sample if Dover Township monitors at
the user's facility at least once a month or if Dover Township
samples between the user's initial sampling and when the user
receives the results of this sampling.

concentration, which could cause a violation of the prohibited discharge
standards in § 18-902 of this Part. A slug discharge is any discharge of a
non-routine, episodic nature, including, but not limited to, an accidental
spill or a non-customary batch discharge, which has a reasonable potential
to cause interference or pass-through, or in any other way violate the
POTW's regulations, local limits or permit conditions.
STORMWATER  Stormwater runoff, snow melt runoff, and surface runoff
and drainage.
STORM SEWER OR STORM DRAIN  A sewer that carries storm and
surface waters and drainage, but excludes sewage and polluted industrial
wastes.

the average dry weather hydraulic or organic capacity of the POTW
treatment plant.
(b)
Is designated as such by the City of York on the basis that it has a
reasonable potential for adversely affecting the POTW's operation
or for violating any pretreatment standard or requirement.
(c)
The general manager may determine that an industrial user subject
to categorical pretreatment standards is a non-significant categorical
industrial user rather than a significant industrial user on a finding that
the industrial user never discharges more than 100 gallons per day
(gpd) of total categorical wastewater (excluding sanitary, non-contact
cooling and boiler blowdown wastewater, unless specifically included in
the pretreatment standard) and the following conditions are met:
The industrial user, prior to the general manager's finding, has
consistently complied with all applicable categorical pretreatment
standards and requirements.
(a)

wastewater.
(c)
(3)
Upon a finding that a user meeting the criteria in § 18-902 of this
Part has no reasonable potential for adversely affecting the POTW's
operation or for violating any pretreatment standard or requirement,
the general manager may at any time, on its own initiative or in
response to a petition received from an industrial user, and in
accordance with procedures in federal pretreatment requirements of
40 CFR, Chapter I, Subchapter N, determine that such user should not
be considered a significant industrial user.
(4)

Black Bridge Road, York, PA 17402.
UPSET  An exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and
temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because
of factors beyond the reasonable control of the industrial user. An upset
does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error,
improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities,
lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation [40 CFR
403.16(a)].
USER  A source of indirect discharge.

neutralization of water prior to discharge to an on-site sanitary sewer
cleanout. The addition of cooling water or unpolluted water or an
increase in the use of process water for the purpose of reducing the
concentrations of substances that are limited or prohibited by this Part
or federal pretreatment standard or requirement shall be prohibited.
No user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any way
attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for
adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation
unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or
requirement. The general manager may impose mass limitations on
users who are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards
or requirements, or in other cases when the imposition of mass
limitations is appropriate.

which, either singly or by interaction with other wastes, are
sufficient to create a public nuisance or a hazard to life, or prevent
entry into the sewers for maintenance or repair.
S. Wastewater that imparts color that cannot be removed by the
POTW treatment process, such as, but not limited to, dye wastes
and vegetable tanning solutions, which consequently imparts color
to the treatment plant's effluent.
T. Sludges, screenings, or other residues from the pretreatment of
industrial wastes.
U. Detergents, surface-active agents, or other substances that might
cause excessive foaming in the POTW or its effluent.

pretreatment standards, or local limits, for categorical industrial users.
The City of York and Manchester Township hereby incorporate by
reference all federal categorical pretreatment standards at 40 CFR,
Chapter I, Subchapter N, as if they were fully set forth herein, and such
standards shall be the standards applied under this Part to the
appropriate classes of industrial user.
A. Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in
terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in
wastewater, the general manager may impose equivalent
concentration or mass limits as allowed by federal pretreatment
regulation.
B. When the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are
expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production,
the general manager may convert the limits to equivalent
limitations expressed either as a mass of pollutant discharged per
day or effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent
limitations applicable to individual industrial users.
C. When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is
mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the
general manager shall impose an alternate limit in accordance with
40 CFR 403.6(e).
D. A categorical industrial user may obtain a net/gross adjustment to a
categorical pretreatment standard in accordance with the
requirements of 40 CFR 403.15.
§ 18-902 FOREWORD § 18-902
FWD:445
E. When a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in
terms of pollutant concentrations, an industrial user may request
that the general manager convert the limits to equivalent mass
limits. The determination to convert concentration limits to mass
limits is within the discretion of the general manager. The general
manager may establish equivalent mass limits only if the industrial
user meets all of the requirements of 40 CFR 403.6(c)(5)(i)(A)
through 40 CFR 403.6(c)(5)(i)E).
F. The general manager may, at his discretion, convert the mass limits
of the categorical pretreatment standards of 40 CFR Part 414, 419
and 455, and other parts as EPA may amend from time to time, to
concentration limits for the purposes of calculating limitations
applicable to individual industrial users. The industrial user shall
meet the requirements of 40 CFR 403.6(d) regarding dilution and
40 CFR 403.17 regarding bypass, and, for those industrial users
that mix process effluent prior to treatment with wastewater other
than those generated by the regulated process, shall provide
information regarding the pollutant concentrations and waste
stream flows at the sample point.
G. Once included in its permit, the industrial user must comply with
the equivalent limitations developed in this section in lieu of the
promulgated categorical standards from which the equivalent
limitations were derived.
H. Many categorical pretreatment standards specify one limit for
calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit
for calculating maximum monthly average, or four-day average,
limitations. Where such standards are being applied, the same
production or flow figure shall be used in calculating both the
average and the maximum equivalent limitations.
I. Any industrial user operating under a permit incorporating
equivalent mass or concentration limits calculated from a
production-based standard shall notify the general manager within
two business days after the user has a reasonable basis to know
that the production level will significantly change within the next
calendar month. Any user not notifying the general manager of
such anticipated change will be required to meet the mass or
concentration limits in its permit that were based on the original
estimate of the long term average production rate.
J. The general manager may impose mass limitations in addition to
concentration limitations. The general manager may approve
accepting discharges from a permitted industrial user that are of
unusual strength or character based on water conservation or
other resource conservation measures employed by the industrial
user. Mass limitations may be determined where allowed by federal
and local regulations, such as converting concentrations to mass,

§ 18-903. Industrial Wastes. [Ord. 2010-09, 9/14/2010, § 1]
allocating maximum allowable headworks loadings or any other
method deemed appropriate.
4. The general manager may develop best management practices (BMPs)
in individual wastewater discharge permits to implement local limits,
the requirements of § 18-902(b) and 40 CFR 403.5(a)(1) and (b), and
certain established categorical pretreatment standards and effluent
limits.
1. Treatment of Industrial Wastes. This Part sets forth uniform
requirements for users of the publicly owned treatment works and
enables the POTW to comply with all applicable state and federal laws,
including the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. § 1251 et seq.) and federal
pretreatment standards and requirements (40 CFR, Chapter I,
Subchapter N). The economy and desirability of the combined
treatment of industrial wastes and sanitary sewage is recognized.
However, not all types and quantities of industrial wastes can be so
treated. Hence it shall be the established policy of the City of York and
Manchester Township to admit those types and quantities of industrial
wastes that are not harmful or damaging to the structures, processes or
operation of the sewage works or are not specifically prohibited by this
Part. It is also recognized that to provide this service, additional
facilities are required, the cost of which shall be borne by those persons
receiving benefits. Additionally, the City of York and industry shall
comply with federal pretreatment regulations. To correctly evaluate
such users or potential users, all facilities that would otherwise be
subject to categorical pretreatment regulations must submit a complete
wastewater permit application at least 90 days before the
commencement of operations, regardless if the facility intends to
discharge wastewater or not. Each user must notify the general
manager of any significant changes to the user's operations or system
that might alter the nature, quality or volume of its wastewater at least
30 days before the anticipated change.
2. Approval Required for Industrial Wastes. In order to control the
admission of industrial waste, the discharge into any sanitary sewer of
any industrial waste having the following characteristics shall be
prohibited unless an industrial wastewater discharge permit is
obtained:
A. A daily average BOD concentration greater than 300 mg/l.
B. A daily average suspended solids concentration greater than 350
mg/l.
C. An average daily flow greater than 25,000 gallons per day of
process wastewater.
§ 18-902 FOREWORD § 18-903
FWD:447
D. Any toxic pollutant that is found in concentrations greater than
found in domestic sewage.
E. Any wastes which are considered by the general manager to offer
possibilities of harm to structures, processes, or operation of the
sewage works or to have significant impact, either singly or in
combination with other contributing industries, on the treatment
process, the quality of sludge, the system's effluent quality or air
emissions generated by the system.
Industries defined as significant industrial users shall be permitted
and/or regulated in accordance with the federal pretreatment
requirements of 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N. Permits shall be
granted by the City of York upon the review and approval of the
general manager. The City of York reserves the right to deny new
or existing contributions to the system if, because of the volume
or characteristics, such wastes are determined by the City of York
to be detrimental to the operation of the sewage works or have
the potential to cause or contribute to the violation of any laws,
regulations, orders or permit conditions applicable to the City of
York or the York City Sewer Authority.
3. Survey Data Required. All persons who are now discharging, or are
planning to discharge, industrial wastes into any sanitary sewer shall
upon the request of the general manager or his designee, complete and
file with the general manager, a permit application which furnishes
pertinent data, inclusive of quantity of flow and analysis of the
industrial wastes discharged, as set forth in Subsection 4A hereof. Any
person desiring to make a new connection, a new discharge, or a
significant change in the volume, nature, or rate of a discharge, shall
complete and file with the general manager a permit application which
furnishes pertinent or predicted data inclusive of quantity of flow and
an analysis of the industrial, waste to be discharged into the sewage
works as set forth in Subsection 4A hereof. Such permit application
shall be submitted at least 120 days before the expected or change in
discharge is to occur.
4. Industrial Wastewater Discharge Permit Application.

6. Compliance with Permits.
A. Permit holders shall comply with the conditions of the permit and
failure to do so constitutes a violation of this Part.
B. Should a permit holder significantly change the volume of its
discharge or change its character for any reason, he shall
immediately notify the general manager of such changes and the
general manager may require an application for a new permit.
C. A permit may be suspended or revoked in whole or in part, or
modified, by the general manager for cause including but not
limited to the following:
(1) Violation of any terms or conditions of the permit.
(2) Obtaining the permit by misrepresentation or failure to
disclose fully all relevant facts.

in state or federal regulations or changes in the treatment
process that require either a temporary or permanent
reduction or elimination of the permitted discharge.
D. All categorical industrial users are required to be regulated in
accordance with federal pretreatment regulations.
7. Permit Duration and Evaluation. An industrial wastewater discharge
permit shall be issued for a specified time period not to exceed three
years from the effective date of the permit. A wastewater discharge
permit may be issued for a period less than three years at the discretion
of the general manager. A permit holder shall apply for permit
reissuance by submitting a complete permit application a minimum of
120 days prior to the expiration of the existing permit. The general
manager will evaluate the data furnished by the user and may require
additional information. The terms and conditions of the permit may be
subject to modification by the City of York during the term of the permit
should changes in federal pretreatment regulations occur, changes at
the facility occur, or other just cause exists. Any changes or new
conditions in the permit shall include a reasonable time schedule for
compliance. The general manager may deny any application for a
wastewater discharge permit. All wastewater discharge permits issued
to a user are void upon the issuance of a new wastewater discharge
§ 18-903 FOREWORD § 18-903
FWD:451
permit to that user. Wastewater discharge permits shall be void upon
cessation of operations.
8. Permit Issuance Procedures. A permit shall be issued with a minimum
thirty-day comment period between the issuance date and effective
date. The permit holder may submit written comments on the permit
conditions during the comment period for review and response by the
general manager. The permit may be modified by the general manager
in response to comments. Upon the expiration of the comment period,
on the effective date of the permit, the permit shall become effective,
subject to the right of appeal as set forth in § 18-917.
9. Permit Transfer. Industrial wastewater discharge permits are issued to
a specific person for a specific operation. A wastewater discharge
permit shall not be reassigned, transferred, sold, applied to different
premises or a new or changed operation without the written approval of
the general manager.
10. Pretreatment. All persons using the sewage works shall provide
wastewater treatment as required to comply with this Part and with all
federal pretreatment standards, requirements and prohibitions within
the time limitations specified by federal regulation or other limits that
may from time to time be set by regulatory agencies.
A. Any facilities necessary for compliance shall be provided, operated,
and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans describing
such facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the
general manager before such facilities are constructed. The
submission of such plans and operating procedures shall in no way
relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying such facilities
as necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to the POTW under
the provisions of this Part.
B. Whenever deemed necessary, the general manager may require
users to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods,
designate that certain wastewater be discharged only into specific
sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate
sewage waste streams from industrial waste streams, and such
other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and
determine the user's compliance with the requirements of this Part.
C. The general manager may require any person discharging into the
POTW to install and maintain, on their property and at their
expense, a suitable storage and flow-control facility to ensure
equalization of flow. An individual wastewater discharge permit
may be issued solely for flow equalization.
D. Users with the potential to discharge substances harmful to the
POTW, which includes the sewer system, (i.e., flammable
substances, corrosive substances) may be required to install and
maintain detection meters or monitoring devices.
§ 18-903 MANCHESTER CODE § 18-903
FWD:452
11. Certification of Reports. Any person signing a permit application,
baseline monitoring report, periodic self-monitoring report,
questionnaire, compliance schedule, BMP submission or
documentation, final compliance report, periodic compliance report,
and any other required report shall make the following certification and
be signed in accordance with the signatory requirements of Subsection
18:
"I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments
were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with
a system designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather
and evaluate the information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the
person or persons who manage the system, or those persons directly
responsible for gathering the information, the information submitted is,
to the best of my knowledge and belief, true, accurate, and complete.
I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false
information, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment for
knowing violations."
A facility determined to be a non-significant categorical industrial user
by the general manager must annually submit the federally required
certification statement regarding non-significant categorical industrial
users and be signed in accordance with the signatory requirements of
Subsection 18.
12. Sampling and Analysis. The holder of an industrial wastewater
discharge permit shall furnish the general manager with written and
signed reports of sample analysis at a frequency specified in the
industrial wastewater discharge permit. Data used to satisfy reporting
requirements must be based on samples collected during the reporting
period and must be representative of conditions during the reporting
period.
A. If a user monitors any regulated pollutant at the appropriate
sampling location more frequently than required by the general
manager, the results of the monitoring shall be submitted to the
City of York.
B. Samples to be used for surcharge purposes shall be composite
samples and be representative of the discharge from the facility.
Grab samples may be used for surcharge purposes where the
physical set-up of the facility so dictates or wastewater is collected
over a period of time and is discharged as a daily basis or less
frequent batch basis. Grab samples that may represent an unusual
discharge from the facility may be used for surcharge purposes for
the period of time and volume such discharges occurred.
C. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be
properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working
order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring
§ 18-903 FOREWORD § 18-903
FWD:453
facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to
claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge.
D. Samples shall be collected, preserved and analyzed promptly, in
accordance with 40 CFR, Part 136, to insure accurate results. If 40
CFR, Part 136, does not contain sampling or analytical techniques
for the pollutant in question, or where the EPA determines that the
Part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for
the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be performed
by using validated analytical methods approved by the EPA.
Pennsylvania laboratories or facilities that test or analyze
environmental samples to demonstrate compliance with an
industrial wastewater discharge permit, this Part or pretreatment
standard shall be in compliance with the laboratory accreditation
requirements of Act 90 of 2002 (27 Pa.C.S.A. §§ 4101-4113) or the
National Environmental Laboratory Accreditation Program
(NELAP), relating to environmental laboratory accreditation.
Laboratories or testing facilities outside of Pennsylvania that test
or analyze environmental samples to demonstrate compliance with
an industrial wastewater discharge permit, this Part or
pretreatment standard shall be in compliance with the laboratory
accreditation requirements of the National Environmental
Laboratory Accreditation Program (NELAP), relating to
environmental laboratory accreditation.
E. City of York representatives may sample and inspect the waste by
composite sample or by grab sample in order to verify the analysis
being submitted by the industry. If the results obtained by the City
of York differ from those obtained by the industrial user, the City of
York will notify the industrial user and conduct confirmatory
sampling and/or investigate the sampling, preservation, and testing
methods employed.
F. No person shall maliciously, willfully, or negligently break, damage,
destroy, uncover, deface, tamper with or prevent access to any
structure, appurtenance or equipment, or other part of the POTW.
G. If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must
notify the general manager within 24 hours of becoming aware of
the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis
and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the general
manager within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation.
Where the City of York has performed the sampling and analysis in
lieu of the user, the City of York must perform the repeat sampling
and analysis unless it notifies the user of the violation and requires
the user to perform the repeat analysis. Resampling is not required
if the City of York performs sampling of the user between the time
when the initial sampling was conducted and the time when the
user or the City of York receives the results of this sampling.
§ 18-903 MANCHESTER CODE § 18-903
FWD:454
13. Control Manhole. Any significant industrial user, and any other
industrial user that the general manager deems, discharging industrial
wastes into any sanitary sewer shall construct and maintain at their
expense a suitable control manhole, or manholes, downstream from any
treatment storage, or other approved works, to facilitate observation,
measurement and sampling of all wastes, including domestic sewage,
from the establishment. The control manhole or manholes shall be
placed at suitable locations to provide safe access and representative
sampling. The control manhole shall comply with applicable
construction standards and specifications in accordance with the
general manager's requirements and shall be constructed and
maintained in such a manner to enable the placement of sampling
equipment and to enable the general manager to perform monitoring
activities. The control manhole shall be accessible to the general
manager or his representatives at all times for sampling, and shall not
be obstructed or located within secure areas such that the general
manager cannot gain unrestricted access.
14. Slug Discharge. The person in charge of a facility shall notify the
general manager or his designated representative immediately in the
case of any upset, slug discharge or other discharge of unusual
strength, volume, or other characteristics, whether or not such
discharge is in violation of the wastewater discharge permit. In such a
case, in addition to the immediate report, the user shall submit a
written report within five days of the incident specifying:
A. Description of the upset, the cause thereof and the upset's impact
on a user's compliance status.
B. Duration of noncompliance, including exact dates and times of
noncompliance, and if the noncompliance continues, the time by
which compliance is reasonably expected to occur.
C. All steps taken or to be taken to reduce, eliminate and prevent
recurrence of such an upset or other conditions of noncompliance.
Whenever changes are made at a facility that may affect the
potential for a slug discharge to occur, the user shall notify the
general manager in advance, if possible, or within 24 hours of
making such changes.
15. Slug Discharge Control Plans. The general manager shall evaluate
whether each significant industrial user needs a slug discharge control
plan or other action to control slug discharges. Such evaluation shall
occur within one year of an industrial user being identified as
significant. The general manager may require any user to develop,
submit for approval, and implement such a plan or take such other
action that may be necessary to control slug discharges. Alternatively,
the general manager may develop such a plan for any user. The POTW
may choose to require a significant industrial user to take specific,
preventative physical or procedural actions instead of requiring the
§ 18-903 FOREWORD § 18-903
FWD:455
development of a slug control plan. Such preventative actions and any
slug control plan development requirements shall be included in the
SIU's control mechanism. Any changes at a user's facility can cause
the general manager to re-evaluate the need for a slug control plan.
An accidental discharge/slug discharge control plan shall address, at
a minimum, the following, in addition to any other items the general
manager may determine:
A. Description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch
discharges.
B. Description of stored chemicals.
C. Procedures for immediately notifying the general manager of any
accidental or slug discharges, as required by Subsection 14.
D. Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental spills or
slug discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to,
inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer
of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site
runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or
equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants
(including solvents), and/or measures and equipment for
emergency response.
16. Fees for Sampling, Analyses and Inspections. The City of York or its
designated agent shall inspect properties discharging waste other than
domestic wastewater into the sewage works and obtain and analyze
samples therefrom to enforce provisions of this Part, to comply with
local, state, and federal requirements, and to determine applicable
surcharges. Fees for such services shall be assessed in accordance with
a schedule established by administrative order based on costs. Fees for
such services provided by independent laboratories shall be invoiced at
cost.
17. Spill Prevention Plans. Any person storing any material in excess of the
threshold planning quantity established by SARA III, the Emergency
Planning and Community Right to Know Act, shall submit a spill
prevention, control and countermeasure plan addressing the potential
of an accidental discharge to the sewer system to the general manager
for review and approval. Any industrial user storing flowable solids in
bulk in excess of 500 pounds, or any liquids in excess of 100 gallons
(except for water and heating oil stored for use on the premises), shall
report this to the general manager annually, including the quantity and
nature of each such material, and shall develop and submit a spill
prevention, control and countermeasure plan if so directed by the
general manager.
18. Signatory Requirements. Industrial user reports and submissions
requiring signature and certification, which include, but are not limited
to, permit applications, industrial questionnaires, baseline monitoring
reports, compliance schedules, BMPs, final compliance reports and
§ 18-903 MANCHESTER CODE § 18-903
FWD:456
periodic compliance reports, shall be signed by an authorized or duly
authorized representative as follows:
A. By a responsible corporate officer, if the industrial user submitting
the reports is a corporation. For the purpose of this paragraph a
responsible corporate officer means:
(1) A president, secretary, treasurer, or vice-president of the
corporation in charge of a principle business function, or any
other person who performs similar policy or decision-making
functions for the corporation.
(2) The manager of one or more manufacturing, production, or
operating facilities, provided, the manager is authorized to
make management decisions which govern the operation of the
regulated facility including having the explicit or implicit duty
of making major capital investment recommendations, and
initiate and direct other comprehensive measures to assure
long-term environmental compliance with environmental laws
and regulations; can ensure that the necessary systems are
established or actions taken to gather complete and accurate
information for control mechanism requirements; and where
authority to sign documents has been assigned or delegated to
the manager in accordance with corporate procedures.
B. By a general partner or proprietor if the industrial user submitting
the reports is a partnership or sole proprietorship respectively.
C. By a duly authorized representative of the individual designated in
Subsection 18A or 18B of this section if:
(1) The authorization is made in writing by the individual
described in Subsection 18A or 18B of this section.
(2) The authorization specifies either an individual or a position
having responsibility for the overall operation of the facility
from which the industrial discharge originates, such as the
position of plant manager, operator of a well, or well field
superintendent, or a position of equivalent responsibility, or
having overall responsibility for environmental matters for the
company.
(3) The written authorization is submitted to the general manager
of the POTW.
D. If an authorization under Subsection 18C of this section is no
longer accurate because a different individual or position has
responsibility for the overall operation of the facility, or overall
responsibility for environmental matters for the company, a new
authorization satisfying the requirements of Subsection 18C of this
section must be submitted to the general manager of the POTW
§ 18-903 FOREWORD § 18-903
FWD:457
prior to or together with any reports to be signed by an authorized
representative.
19. Hauled Wastewater. The general manager may prohibit or accept the
disposal of hauled industrial or non-industrial wastewater to the POTW.
In no case shall any hazardous waste as that term is defined by the
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act be discharged as hauled
waste.
A. Hauled or trucked wastewater may be introduced into the POTW
only at locations designated by the general manager, and at such
times as are established by the general manager. The general
manager may refuse a hauler or generator the ability to discharge a
particular hauled wastewater load if it cannot be determined that
the load will not violate the requirements of this Part or any federal
or state pretreatment or waste requirements, or cause
interference, pass-through or biosolids contamination. The
discharge of hauled wastewater is subject to all other requirements
of this Part and applicable state and federal laws. The general
manager may develop procedures to ensure compliance with this
Part and state and federal requirements.
B. The general manager may require the haulers and/or generators of
hauled or trucked industrial or non-industrial wastewater to obtain
wastewater discharge permits.
C. No individual load may be discharged into the POTW without the
prior consent of the general manager. The issuance of a permit to a
hauler or generator does not constitute consent to discharge nor
guarantee the ability to discharge any particular load. The general
manager may collect samples of each hauled load to ensure
compliance with this Part, any federal pretreatment standards and
state and federal law. The general manager may require the
industrial wastewater hauler to provide a waste analysis of any load
prior to discharge.
D. Industrial wastewater haulers must provide a waste-tracking form
for every load. This form shall include, at a minimum, the name and
address of the industrial waste hauler, permit number, truck
identification, names and addresses of sources of waste, and
volume and characteristics of waste. The form shall identify the
type of industry, known or suspected waste constituents, and
whether any wastes are RCRA hazardous wastes.
20. Additional Measures. Whenever deemed necessary, the general
manager may require users to restrict their discharges during peak
flow periods, designate that certain wastewater be discharged only into
specified sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of discharge,
separate sewage waste streams from industrial waste streams, and
such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and/or
§ 18-903 MANCHESTER CODE § 18-903
FWD:458
determine the user's compliance with the requirements of this Part or
the user's permit.
21. Reports from Unpermitted Users. All industrial or commercial users not
required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall provide
appropriate reports to the general manager as the general manager
may require.
22. Compliance Schedules. The following conditions shall apply to a
compliance schedule for meeting categorical pretreatment standards
under 40 CFR 403.12:
A. The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates
for the commencement and completion of major events leading to
the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required
for the user to meet the applicable pretreatment standards (such
events include, but are not limited to, hiring an engineer,
completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts for
major components, commencing and completing construction, and
beginning and conducting routine operation).
B. No increment referred above shall exceed nine months.
C. The user shall submit a progress report to the general manager no
later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the final
date of compliance including, as a minimum, whether or not it
complied with the increment of progress to be met on such date
and, if not, the date on which it expects to comply with this
increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and the steps being
taken by the user to return construction to the established
schedule. In no event shall more than nine months elapse between
such progress reports to the general manager.
23. Reports on Compliance with Categorical Pretreatment Standard
Deadline. The following conditions shall apply to a compliance schedule
for meeting categorical pretreatment standards under 40 CFR 403.12:
A. Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with
applicable categorical pretreatment standards or in the case of a
new source following commencement of the introduction of
wastewater into the POTW, any industrial user subject to
pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the
general manager a report containing the information required for a
baseline report required under 40 CFR 403.12 (b)(4)-(6). For
industrial users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits
established by the City of York in accordance with the requirements
of 40 CFR 403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure
of the user's long-term production rate. For all other industrial
users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in
terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or
other measure of operation), this report shall include the user's
actual production during the appropriate sampling period.

§ 18-904. Access to Premises; Right of Entry. [Ord. 2010-09, 9/14/
2010, § 1]
1. The general manager and other duly authorized employees of the City
of York bearing proper credentials and identification shall be permitted
to enter upon all properties at reasonable times to carry out all
inspection, surveillance, observation, measurement, monitoring
procedures, sampling and testing necessary to determine, independent
of information supplied by industrial users, compliance or
noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and
requirements and ordinance requirements by industrial users. The
general manager shall have the right to enter any premises of any
industrial user in which a discharge source or treatment system is
located, or in which records are required to be kept under 40 CFR
403.12(o), to ensure compliance with pretreatment standards or
requirements, any wastewater discharge permit, the requirements of
this Part, or an order issued hereunder. Users shall allow the general
manager ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of
inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the
performance of any additional duties. The authority of the general
manager shall be at least as extensive as the authority provided under
§ 308 of the Clean Water Act.
A. Where a user has security measures in force that require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user
shall make necessary arrangements with its security personnel so
that, upon presentation of suitable identification, the general
manager shall be permitted to enter without delay for the purposes
of performing specific responsibilities.
B. The general manager shall have the right to set up on the user's
property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to
conduct sampling and/or metering of the user's operations.
C. Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly
removed by the user at the written or verbal request of the general
manager and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such
access shall be the responsibility of the user.
D. If the general manager has been refused access to a building,
structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a
violation of this Part, or that there is a need to inspect and/or
sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program of the
City of York designed to verify compliance with this Part or any
permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public
health, safety and welfare of the community, the general manager
may seek issuance of a search warrant from the appropriate Court.

1. All owners or users of private sewers shall not, either directly or
through an intervening public or private storm sewer, drain domestic
sewage into any natural or man-made watercourse within the City of
York or Manchester Township limits. Any such discharge shall be
discontinued immediately upon notice from the City of York, with the
notice served upon such owner or user, or, if nonresident in the City of
York, upon the agent thereof or upon the party in possession, and if
there is no agent or party in possession, then by notice posted upon the
most public part of the property. Such owner shall cease discharge and
at his own expense, connect his house drain with the sanitary sewer
system. Nothing herein shall forbid the continuation of the drainage
through such private or public stormwater sewers of roof, surface or
ground water.
2. The discharge or spilling of industrial waste or waste water or of any
hazardous, toxic, colored or oil-bearing matter into a natural
watercourse either directly or indirectly via public or private storm
sewer, ditch or culvert is prohibited unless such discharge is in
accordance with the permit issued by the United States Environmental
Protection Agency or the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Protection or consists of unpolluted cooling, boiler or distilled water.
1. Every garage or other structure for the housing, sale or repair of
vehicles in which vehicles are washed, cleaned or repaired shall, before
being connected with the sewage works, be provided with proper
means for draining the floors and repair pits, as hereinafter provided.
2. Any drain in the floor or repair pit of any garage or other structure for
the housing, sale or repair of vehicles shall have a special connection
discharging through an interceptor, which shall be located under the
direction of the City of York, before being connected to the house drain.
The interceptor shall be so arranged as to intercept all oils, gasoline or
other flammable fluids, as well as sand, silt and other solids, for the
purpose of excluding the same from the sewage works. It shall be
water-tight, so located as to be provided a suitable approved manhole
frame and cover, and shall be of design and capacity approved by the
City of York. The oils and other flammable fluids that accumulate in
such interceptors shall be pumped or otherwise removed, and the
interceptors shall be so maintained as to insure the exclusion of the
same from the sewage works. They shall be kept free from sand, silt or
other solids and shall be subject to regular inspection by the City of
York. The contents of the same shall be promptly disposed of after
removal to the satisfaction of the City of York.
3. Every garage or other structure used for the housing, sale or repair of
vehicles connected with any public or private sewer shall be provided

60 days after notice from the City of York.
1. All hotels, restaurants, boarding houses and public eating places,
before draining into the sewage system, shall install grease
interceptors on fixtures as required by the City of York.
2. The greases, oils and solid materials that accumulate in such
interceptors shall be pumped or otherwise removed, and the
interceptors shall be so maintained as to insure the exclusion of the
same from the sewage works. They shall be subject to regular
inspection by the City of York and Manchester Township. The contents
of same shall be promptly disposed of after removal to the satisfaction
of the City of York and Manchester Township. On the notice by the
general manager, any such establishment may be required to maintain
for a period of three years all records related to maintenance of such
interceptors and the removal of grease therefrom, and to make such
records available to the general manager on request.
1. Any owner or other person who violates or refuses to comply with any
provision of this Part or any notice given under the authority of the
same, or who obstructs or interferes with any person in the execution of
any of the provisions hereof, shall be subject to the penalty provided in
§ 18-919.
2. In addition, the violation of the provisions of this Part, or of any permit
issued to an industrial user hereunder, may be declared to be a public
nuisance, subject to the authority of the City Board of Health, as
provided by the Third Class City Code. The Board may issue orders
requiring the abatement, prevention, or alteration of such a nuisance or
take such other action as shall be deemed necessary to prevent, abate,
correct, or avoid such nuisance.
§ 18-906 MANCHESTER CODE § 18-910
FWD:462
1. Sewer Rental Surcharges for Nondomestic Wastes. In addition to sewer
rent for collection and treatment of sewage discharged into the sewage
works by commercial and industrial users, further charges shall be
made for all sewage discharged into the sewage works having values
for certain parameters in excess of certain concentration thresholds as
listed below:
Parameters Concentration Thresholds in mg/l
Ammonia (as Nitrogen) 15
Arsenic 0.004
BOD 300
Cadmium, Total 0.004
Chromium, Total 0.06
Copper, Total 0.1
Cyanide, Total 0.05
Lead, Total 0.06
Nickel, Total 0.03
Phosphate (as Phosphorus) 9.0
Mercury, Total 0.0004
Silver, Total 0.006
Suspended Solids 350
Zinc, Total 0.3
The total surcharge shall equal the sum of each of the surcharges
applicable to the waste in accordance with the formula below:
SC = 8.34 x Q x (Value of Parameter - Concentration Threshold)
x K/1,000,000
SC = Surcharge for parameter
Q = Volume in gallons
K = Cost factor for parameter
Cost factors shall be established by administrative order based on
toxicity, impact on sludge disposal, pretreatment program goals, and
on costs for treatment. The strength of any sewage subject to
surcharge shall be determined quarterly, or more frequently as the
City of York shall determine, based upon sampling and analysis by the
City of York or its designees. However, the City of York may if it so
elects, determine the strength of the sewage based upon the results of
routine sampling and analysis by the producer of such sewage or the
results of analysis and flow from previous quarters or from the results
of analysis and flow of sewage from similar customers.
2. Methods of Measuring Volume for Surcharge Purposes.
§ 18-910 FOREWORD § 18-910
FWD:463
§ 18-911. Remedies. [Ord. 2010-09, 9/14/2010, § 1]
A. Whenever a person purchasing all water used from a public water
provider discharges all sewage to the POTW at one point, the
volume of water purchased shall be used as a measure of the
quantity of sewage discharged.
B. Whenever a person obtains water from other sources or claims that
alternate means of disposal reduces the volume of sewage
discharged, or whenever sewage is discharged at more than one
point to the POTW, the City of York and Manchester Township shall
require the person to install at his expense a meter or meters, as
may be required to measure the volume or volumes of sewage
discharged to the POTW at the point or points of entry. All meters
or other measuring devices installed or required to be used under
any provision of this Part may be tested or inspected by the City of
York or by its designee whenever deemed necessary by the City of
York. The owner of the property upon which such measuring device
is installed shall be responsible for its testing, maintenance and
safekeeping, and all repairs thereto shall be made at the property
owner's expense, whether such repairs are made necessary by
ordinary wear and tear or other causes. Owners shall test and or
calibrate meters in a manner and at a frequency satisfactory to the
City of York and Manchester Township.
1. Emergency Suspension of Service. The City of York may for good cause
shown suspend the wastewater treatment service to any person when it
appears to the City of York that an actual or threatened discharge
presents or may reasonably present an imminent or substantial danger
to the health or welfare of persons or to the environment, interferes
with the operation of the POTW, or violates any pretreatment standard
or requirement imposed by this Part. In the event of failure to comply
voluntarily with a suspension order within the specified time, the City of
York may commence judicial proceedings to compel compliance with
such order. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a
hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section. A user
affected by an emergency suspension will be entitled to a hearing
afterwards at the user's request pursuant to § 18-917 of this Part.
A. Any user notified of a suspension of its service shall immediately
stop or eliminate its discharge. In the event of a user's failure to
immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the
general manager may take such steps as deemed necessary,
including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent
or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or
endangerment to any individuals. The general manager may allow
the user to recommence its discharge when the user has
demonstrated to the satisfaction of the general manager that the
period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination
§ 18-910 MANCHESTER CODE § 18-911
FWD:464
proceedings in Subsection 2 of this section are initiated against the
user.
B. A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written
statement, describing the causes of the harmful discharge and the
measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the general
manager prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing
under Subsection 4 of this section.
2. Revocation of Treatment Services. The City of York may seek to
terminate the wastewater treatment services to any person and/or
revoke a wastewater discharge permit, for good cause, for, but not
limited to, the following reasons:
A. Failure to factually report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge.
B. Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater
volume, constituents or characteristics prior to discharge as
provided by §§ 18-903(3) and 18-903(6)(B) of this Part.
C. Violation of this Part or any permit or order issued under this Part
following within one year a prior violation of the same kind.
D. Misrepresentation or failure to fully disclose all relevant facts in
the wastewater discharge permit application.
E. Falsifying self-monitoring reports and certification statements.
F. Tampering with monitoring equipment.
G. Being found to be in significant noncompliance, as defined in
§ 18-912 of this Part.
H. Failure to pay civil penalties assessed under this Part.
I. Failure to pay sewer charges, surcharges or fees for services.
J. Failure to meet compliance schedules.
K. Failure to complete a wastewater survey or a wastewater discharge
permit application as provided by § 18-903(3) of this Part.
L. Failure to provide advance notice of the transfer of business
ownership of a permitted facility.
Such person will be notified of the proposed termination of its
discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under
Subsection 4 of this section why the proposed action should not be
taken. Exercise of this option by the general manager shall not be
a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the
person.
§ 18-911 FOREWORD § 18-911
FWD:465
3. Notification of Violation; Administrative Adjustment. Whenever the City
of York finds that any person has engaged in conduct that constitutes a
violation of any provision of this Part or of a permit issued hereunder,
the City of York may serve or cause to be served upon such person, a
written notice either personally or by certified or registered mail,
return receipt requested, stating the nature of the alleged violation.
Within 30 days of the date of receipt of the notice, the person shall
respond in writing to the City of York, advising of its position with
respect to the allegations. Thereafter the parties shall meet to ascertain
the veracity of the allegations and where necessary, establish a plan for
the satisfactory correction thereof.
4. Show Cause Hearing. Whenever a violation or series of violations occur
that may result in suspension of service, termination of service,
summary charges, or other enforcement action, the general manager
may issue an order to such violator to appear and show cause before a
hearing board assembled for the purpose, why the proposed
enforcement action should not be taken. The procedures for such a
hearing shall be set forth in § 18-917 hereof. The notice of the hearing
shall be served on the person either personally or by certified or
registered mail, return receipt requested, specifying the time and place
of a hearing to be held by the City of York or its designee regarding the
violation, the reasons why the enforcement action is to be taken, the
proposed enforcement action, and directing the person to show cause
before the City of York, or its designee, why the proposed enforcement
action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served no
less than seven days before the hearing. Service may be made on any
authorized representative of the person or user or on anyone in
apparent authority found at the premises of such user. The proceedings
at the hearing shall be considered by the hearing board, which board
shall then instruct the general manager as to the enforcement action, if
any, to be taken, or as to additional actions to be taken by the general
manager. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the person.
5. Injunctive Relief. When the general manager finds that a user has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this Part, an individual
wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the general manager, acting
through the City Solicitor's Office, may commence an action in the
Court of Common Pleas for legal and equitable relief and, where
deemed appropriate, may seek a temporary restraining order or
preliminary injunction to restrain violations of or compel compliance
with the Part, permit, order, or other requirement. The filing of such an
action shall not be a bar to taking other enforcement actions.
6. Remedies Nonexclusive. The remedies provided for in this Part are not
exclusive. The general manager may take any, all, or any combination of
these actions against a noncompliant user. Further, the general
manager is empowered to take more than one enforcement action
§ 18-911 MANCHESTER CODE § 18-911
FWD:466
against any noncompliant user. The City of York may take any actions
afforded to it under state law.
7. Consent Orders. The general manager may enter into consent orders,
assurances of compliance, or other similar documents establishing an
agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such
documents shall include specific action to be taken by the user to
correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the
document. Such documents shall be judicially enforceable as contracts,
and violations of the terms thereof may be deemed a violation of this
Part subject to all of the penalties provided herein.
8. Compliance Orders. When the general manager finds that a user has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this Part, a wastewater
discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment
standard or requirement, the general manager may issue an order to
the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into
compliance within a specified time. Any such order shall inform the
person of the opportunity to request a hearing before a hearing board
constituted by the Sanitary Sewer Board of Appeals, as set forth in
§ 18-917 hereof. If the user does not come into compliance within the
time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless the user
demonstrates to the satisfaction of the general manager, a good faith
effort to do so, which may include evidence of hiring a consultant,
ordering of pretreatment equipment, creation of a pollution prevention
plan, or other affirmative acts aimed at achieving compliance in the
shortest possible time. Compliance orders also may contain other
requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional selfmonitoring
and/or management practices designed to minimize the
amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order
cannot extend the deadline for compliance established for a
pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order
relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing
violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
9. Payment of Outstanding Fees and Penalties. The general manager may
decline to issue or reissue an individual wastewater discharge permit to
any user who has failed to pay any outstanding fees, fines or penalties
incurred as a result of any provision of this Part, a previous individual
wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder.
10. Cease and Desist Orders. When the general manager finds that a user
has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this Part, an
individual wastewater discharge permit, or order, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations
are likely to recur, the general manager may issue an order to the user
directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user
to:
A. Immediately comply with all requirements.
§ 18-911 FOREWORD § 18-911
FWD:467
§ 18-912. Public Notice of Significant Violators. [Ord. 2010-09, 9/
14/2010, § 1]
B. Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation,
including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.
Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
Any such order shall inform the person of the opportunity to
request a hearing before a hearing board constituted by the
Sanitary Sewer Board of Appeals, as set forth in § 18-917 hereof.
1. The City of York shall annually provide public notification in a
newspaper of general circulation that provides meaningful public
notice within the jurisdiction(s) served by the POTW of industrial users
which, at any time during the previous twelve months, were in
significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and
requirements. For the purposes of this provision, a significant industrial
user (or any industrial user that violates Subsection 1C, D, or H of this
section) is in significant noncompliance if its violation meets one or
more of the following criteria:
A. Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as
those in which 66% or more of all of the measurements taken for
the same pollutant parameter during a six-month period exceed (by
any magnitude) a numeric pretreatment standard or requirement,
including instantaneous limits, as defined by 40 CFR 403.3(1).
B. Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in
which 33% or more of all of the measurements taken for the same
pollutant parameter during a six-month period equal or exceed the
product of the numeric pretreatment standard or requirement
including instantaneous limits, as defined by 40 CFR 403.3(1)
multiplied by the applicable TRC. There are two groups of TRC:
Group I for BOD, TSS, fats, oil, and grease TRC = 1.4
Group II for all other pollutants except pH TRC = 1.2
C. Any other violation of a pretreatment standard or requirement as
defined by 40 CFR 403.3(1) (daily maximum, long-term average,
instantaneous limit, or narrative standard) that the POTW
determines has caused, alone or in combination with other
discharges, interference or pass through (including endangering
the health of POTW personnel or the general public).
D. Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent
endangerment to human health, welfare or to the environment or
has resulted in the POTW's exercise of its emergency authority to
halt or prevent such a discharge.

§ 18-913. Public Access to Information. [Ord. 2010-09, 9/14/2010,
§ 1]
Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater
discharge permit applications, individual wastewater discharge permits,
and monitoring programs, and from the general manager's inspection and
sampling activities, shall be available to the public without restriction,
unless the user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the general manager, that the release of such information
would divulge information, processes, or methods of production entitled to
protection as trade secrets under applicable state and federal law. Any such
request must be asserted at the time of submission of the information or
data if the industrial user stamps "confidential business information" over
all parts for which protection is sought. When requested and demonstrated
by the user furnishing a report that such information should be held
confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or
secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public,
but shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental
agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment program,
and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report.
Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other effluent data, as
defined at 40 CFR 2.302 shall not be recognized as confidential information
and shall be available to the public without restriction. In compliance with
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania's Right-To-Know Law, requests for City
of York records shall be submitted to the City of York's Open Records
Officer.
§ 18-914. Hazardous Waste. [Ord. 2010-09, 9/14/2010, § 1]
E. Failure to meet, within 90 days after the schedule date, a
compliance schedule milestone contained in a local control
mechanism or enforcement order for starting construction,
completing construction, or attaining final compliance.
F. Failure to provide, within 30 days after the due date, required
reports such as baseline monitoring reports, ninety-day compliance
reports, periodic self-monitoring reports, reports on best
management practices, and reports on compliance with compliance
schedules.
G. Failure to accurately report noncompliance.
H. Any other violation or group of violations, which may include a
violation of best management practices, which the POTW
determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of
the local pretreatment program.
1. Users may not discharge to the POTW any hazardous waste which, if
otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR 261
unless written authorization is obtained from the general manager. It is
at the general manager's discretion to accept such waste. Any request

Users subject to the reporting requirements of this Part shall retain, and
make available for inspection and copying, all records of information
obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this Part, any
additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities
undertaken by the user independent of such requirements, documentation
associated with compliance of best management practices-based
pretreatment standards or local limits, and documentation associated with
any certification statements (i.e., TTO certification statement for metal
finishers). Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time
of sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates
analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical
techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records
shall remain available for a period of at least three years. This period shall
be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the
user or the City of York, or where the user has been specifically notified of
a longer retention period by the general manager.
Written reports will be determined to have been submitted on the date
postmarked. For reports, which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail
facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of
the report shall govern.
§ 18-916. Administration. [Ord. 2010-09, 9/14/2010, § 1]
Except as otherwise provided herein, the general manager shall administer,
implement, and enforce the provisions of this Part. Any powers granted to
or duties imposed upon the general manager may be delegated to a duly
authorized City of York employee.
§ 18-917. Appeals. [Ord. 2010-09, 9/14/2010, § 1]
shall include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40
CFR 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge
(continuous, batch, or other) and other information that the general
manager requires to make an informed decision. If the general manager
grants permission to the user to discharge such waste, the user shall
notify the EPA Regional Waste Management Division and Pennsylvania
hazardous waste authorities in writing in accordance with applicable
federal and state requirements. Any such notification submitted to the
EPA Regional Waste Management Division and Pennsylvania hazardous
waste authorities shall be copied to the general manager. This
notification requirement does not apply to pollutants already reported
under the self-monitoring requirements of this Part.
2. Users shall permit the general manager, or duly authorized
representatives, to inspect hazardous waste generation, treatment,
storage, and disposal procedures, and the records generated from the
management of hazardous waste.

1. Purpose.
§ 22-409 FOREWORD § 22-410
FWD:541
A. New land developments and expansions of existing developments
can have a significant impact on the transportation system,
particularly if adequate planning and consideration of system
improvements are not addressed. In order to ensure that a highway
system can satisfactorily accommodate a proposed development,
B. A traffic impact study (TIS) may be required to analyze relevant
impact issues. A TIS is a comprehensive study that analyzes all
surface transportation modes that would be affected by a
development, including pedestrians, bicycles, and public
transportation services. The impact analysis area will generally be
larger than just the immediate site.
C. The TIS concludes whether any transportation improvements are
necessary to accommodate new and/or future traffic volumes
generated by the proposed development or general growth of
background traffic volumes. These improvements could include
right turn lanes, left turn lanes, additional through lanes,
acceleration lanes, bicycle lanes, bus stops, sidewalks, islands,
medians, access control, traffic signals, removal and/or
consolidation of existing approaches, etc.
D. The TIS documents the extent of the impact of the proposed
development on the highway system, including trips added,
resulting levels of service during weekday a.m., p.m. and Saturday
(when necessary) peaks, and the need for auxiliary lanes or other
special capacity or safety features. Required changes in traffic
control, land use, access, pedestrian or bicycle usage must also be
documented.
E. Additionally any changes effecting safety or traffic operations on
the Township or State highway system including, but not limited to,
striping, channelization, medians, islands, signalization and/or
changes in access, shall be documented by the developer to show
that all adjacent and/or affected property owners and businesses
have been contacted and the impacts to their property has been
discussed. A list of the names and addresses of all adjacent and/or
affected property owners and businesses that were contacted shall
be included with the TIS.
2. When Required.
A. A TIS shall be required with the submission of a new site plan,
preliminary subdivision plan for a new or expanded existing
development, or an official zoning district map application. The TIS
shall be submitted when the following are exceeded:
(1) Residential developments in excess of 20 dwelling units.
(2) Nonresidential projects in excess of 10,000 square feet of floor
area.
§ 22-410 MANCHESTER CODE § 22-410
FWD:542
(3) Any commercial project with drive-through service proposed.
B. Projects, other than residential single lot developments, with direct
vehicular access proposed to Route 30, North George Street,
Susquehanna Trail, Greenbriar Road, Roosevelt Avenue, Board
Road, or Church Road.
C. Expansion to any existing use exceeding 5,000 square feet or
increasing the square footage by 5,000 square feet or more if no
traffic impact study has been approved for the use in the five-year
period preceding the application for expansion.
D. In addition, a traffic impact study shall be prepared whenever
either one of the following conditions exist within the traffic impact
study area:
(1) Current safety or congestion problems exist in the local area,
such as high-accident location(s), confusing intersection(s), or
a congested intersection(s), which affects access to the
development.
(2) The capacity of the existing roadway system to handle
increased traffic volume, or the ability to improve the roadway
system to handle increased traffic is limited.
3. Impact Analysis Area.
A. There are several thresholds that must be analyzed to determine
the scope of study area for each project. The thresholds are based
on the number of trips to be generated in a twenty-four-hour
period, which are referred to as average daily traffic volumes
(ADT). In any event the applicant shall contact the Township to
obtain concurrence for the level of study.
(1) Level I (0-200 ADT). Include each access point to the
development including public streets/roadways, joint
permanent easements and private driveways. A Level I study is
generally required for larger residential subdivisions, small
office developments or smaller commercial developments.
(2) Level II (201-3,000 ADT)-Level II (200-3,000 ADT). Include
each access point to the development including public streets/
roadways, joint permanent easements and private driveways.
In addition, the study shall include the first major intersection
beyond each site point of access. Major intersections are
intersections controlled by traffic signals or stop signs and
could include driveways. If there are no nearby major
intersections Township staff will determine the extent of the
study area. If a freeway interchange is nearby the project site
to be developed it shall be included in the study. This level of
study is commonly required for moderately sized commercial
developments and larger office complexes.
§ 22-410 FOREWORD § 22-410
FWD:543
(3) Level III (More than 3000 ADT). Level III studies shall include
each access point to the development including public streets/
roadways, joint permanent easements and private driveways.
In addition, the study area shall include at least the first major
intersection beyond each site point of access and any
intersection beyond that that will increase by 100 or more peak
directional trips generated by the development. In any event
the exact area to be studied shall be determined by Township
staff with input from the preparer of the study. Level III studies
are usually warranted only with very large mixed-used and
commercial developments.
4. Who Should Prepare Transportation Impact Study. Traffic impact
studies shall be prepared under the supervision of qualified and
experienced transportation professional that has specific training in
traffic and transportation engineering and planning and several years
of experience related to preparing transportation studies.
5. Context and Framework.
A. Existing Conditions.
(1) Collect baseline data including manual turning movement
counts at each intersection and automatic traffic recorder
(ATR) counts on each road segment. Include vehicle
classification and speed analysis. Consideration must be given
to the time of year the counts are performed and adjusted
accordingly. Data will not be accepted if it is older than two
years.
(2) Collect crash data.
(3) Collect geometric information at each intersection including
primary traffic control devices, signs and pavement markings.
Obtain traffic signal plans for each signalized intersection to
determine signal operation, phasing and timing. Also to
determine if the signal is interconnected and coordinated. If a
signalized intersection is included in the study area and it is
interconnected and coordinated, all intersections in the system
must be included in the study.
(4) Photographs of each intersection and of other pertinent
geometric conditions must be obtained and included in the
study.
(5) Determine if there are other developments that have either
been approved for development or are under development that
need to be included as background data.
B. Projected or Non-site Traffic.
§ 22-410 MANCHESTER CODE § 22-410
FWD:544
(1) Estimates of non-site traffic are required to complete the
analysis of horizon-year conditions. These estimates
characterize the "base" conditions-that is, without the subject
site being developed.
(a) Through traffic consists of all movements through the
study area, without either an origin or a destination in the
study area (sometimes referred to as "background
traffic").
(b) Other development traffic consists of other developments
in the study area, with an origin and/or destination in the
study area (sometimes referred to as pipeline
development).
(2) Methodology of projecting non-site traffic.
(a) Build-up method, using specific developments.
(b) Use of area or sub-area transportation plan modeled
volumes.
(c) Trends or growth rate method.
C. Future Conditions. Analyze future base conditions to provide
assessment of how traffic will operate in the study horizon year
without the study site being developed as proposed.
(1) The analysis shall be prepared for the anticipated opening year
of the development, assuming full build-out and occupancy.
(2) A second analysis shall be prepared for the opening year plus
10 years. This shall be referred to as the horizon year.
D. Site Traffic Generation.
(1) Estimate the amount of traffic to be generated by the proposed
development for both the peak hours of the adjacent street and
the peak hour of the generator. Use of the Institute of
Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation Manual is
recommended.
(a) Collect additional data if:
1) The study site is not compatible with the ITE land use
code definition;
2) There are only one or two data points (preferably if
there are five or fewer data points);
3) The independent variable does not fall within the
range of data; or,
§ 22-410 FOREWORD § 22-410
FWD:545
4) Neither the weighted average rate line nor the fitted
curve falls within the data cluster for the size of this
specific development.
(2) Use the regression equation when:
(a) A regression equation is provided;
(b) The independent variable is within the range of data; or,
(c) Either the data plot has at least 20 points or the
correlation coefficient R2 > 0.75, equation falls within the
data cluster in the plot, and standard deviation > 110 of
the weighted average rate.
(3) Use the weighted average rate when:
(a) There are at least three (preferably six) data points;
(b) The independent variable is within the range of data;
(c) The standard deviation < 110% of the weighted average
rate;
(d) R2 < 0.75 or no equation is provided; or,
(e) The weighted average rate falls within the data cluster in
the plot.
E. Site Traffic Distribution and Assignment. Distribute the site
generated traffic onto the roadway network utilizing one of three
methods, including:
(1) Analogy.
(2) Model.
(3) Surrogate data methods.
F. Site Access and Off-Site Improvements.
(1) The preferred level-of-service in Manchester Township is LOS
D. All intersections and their approach movements should
operate at or above this level-of-service. If they do not operate
at LOS D or better then improvement mitigation measures
must be recommended to improve the LOS to D or above.
(2) Any new access, new intersection or addition of a leg to an
existing intersection must operate at a level-of-service C or
better.
(3) Roadway segment analysis must also be provided. The degree
of adequacy of roadway segments between intersections is
directly related to the number of traffic lanes, intersection
§ 22-410 MANCHESTER CODE § 22-410
FWD:546
spacing, vehicular queuing requirements at successive
intersections and weaving or merging requirements.
(4) Cost opinions for all improvements must be provided. The cost
opinions must include design, construction, right-of-way,
utilities, inspection and any other cost to complete the
recommended improvement.

period after receipt of the notification under the above paragraph,
a lump sum equal to the amount of the tax that was not withheld
from the person due to the exemption certificate filed by the
person, plus the per payroll amount due for that first payroll period.
C. The amount of tax withheld per payroll period for the remaining
payroll periods in that calendar year shall be the same amount

confirms a transfer previously recorded but which does not extend
or limit existing record legal title or interest.

his principal, there is a rebuttable presumption that the
property is the property of the grantee in his individual
capacity if the grantee claims an exemption from taxation
under this subsection.

STORMWATER MANAGEMENT
A.
General Provisions.
§ 26-101. Short Title. [Ord. 2012-05, 6/12/2012]
This Part shall be known and may be cited as the "Manchester Township
Stormwater Management Ordinance."
§ 26-102. Statement of Findings. [Ord. 2012-05, 6/12/2012]
§ 26-103. Purpose. [Ord. 2012-05, 6/12/2012]
1. The Board of Supervisors of Manchester Township finds that:
A. Inadequate management of accelerated runoff of stormwater
resulting from development throughout a watershed increases
flows and velocities, contributes to erosion and sedimentation,
overtaxes the carrying capacity of streams and storm sewers,
greatly increases the cost of public facilities to carry and control
stormwater, undermines floodplain management and flood-control
efforts in downstream communities, reduces groundwater
recharge, threatens public health and safety, and increases nonpoint-
source pollution of water resources.
B. Federal and state regulations and the York County Watershed
Management Plan require Manchester Township to implement a
program of stormwater controls. Manchester Township is required
to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from its separate
storm sewer systems under the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES).
1. The purpose of this Part is to promote health, safety, and welfare within
Manchester Township and its watershed(s) by minimizing the harm and
maximizing the benefits described in § 26-102 of this Part, through
provisions designed to:
A. Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including
regulations at 25 Pa. Code Ch. 93, to protect, maintain, reclaim,
and restore the existing and designated uses of the waters of this
commonwealth.
B. Preserve the natural drainage systems as much as possible.
C. Manage stormwater runoff close to the source.
D. Provide procedures and performance standards for stormwater
planning and management.

All regulated activities and all activities that may affect stormwater runoff,
including land development and earth disturbance activity, are subject to
regulation by this Part. Stormwater management and erosion and
sedimentation control during construction activities are specifically not
regulated by this Part but shall continue to be regulated under existing laws
and ordinances.
§ 26-106. Repealer. [Ord. 2012-05, 6/12/2012]
Any other ordinance provision(s) or regulation of the Township inconsistent
with any of the provisions of this Part is (are) hereby repealed to the extent
of the inconsistency only.
§ 26-107. Severability. [Ord. 2012-05, 6/12/2012]
In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction declares any section or
provision of this Part invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of
any of the remaining provisions of this Part.
E. Maintain groundwater recharge to prevent degradation of surface
water and groundwater quality and to otherwise protect water
resources.
F. Prevent scour and erosion of stream banks and streambeds.
G. Provide proper operation and maintenance of all SWM BMPs that
are implemented within Manchester Township.
H. Provide standards to meet NPDES permit requirements to which
Manchester Township is subject.
1. Primary Authority. The Township is empowered to regulate land use
activities that affect stormwater impacts by the authority vested in
second class townships by the Second Class Township Code, 53 P.S.
§§ 65101 through 67201, and the terms and provisions of the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Code, 53 P.S. §§ 10101 through 11202, and
the Act of October 4, 1978, P.L. 864 (Act 167), 32 P.S. § 680.1 et seq., as
amended, the "Stormwater Management Act."
2. Secondary Authority. The Township also is empowered to regulate land
use activities that affect runoff by the authority of the Act of July 31,
1968, P.L. 805, No. 247, the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code,
as amended.

§ 26-108. Compatibility with Other Permit and Ordinance
Requirements. [Ord. 2012-05, 6/12/2012]
Permits and approvals issued pursuant to this Part do not relieve the
applicant of the responsibility to secure required permits or approvals for
activities regulated by any other applicable code, rule, act or ordinance.
If more-stringent requirements concerning regulation of stormwater or
erosion and sedimentation control are contained in another code, rule, act
or ordinance, the more-stringent regulations shall apply.
§ 26-109. Duty of Persons Engaged in the Development of Land.
[Ord. 2012-05, 6/12/2012]
Notwithstanding any provision(s) of this Part, including exemptions, any
landowner or any person engaged in the alteration or development of land
which may affect stormwater runoff characteristics shall implement such
measures as are reasonably necessary to prevent injury to health, safety,
or other property. Such measures also shall include actions as are required
to manage the rate, volume, direction, and quality of resulting stormwater
runoff in a manner which otherwise adequately protects health, property,
and water quality.

§ 26-131. General Requirements. [Ord. 2012-05, 6/12/2012]
1. For all regulated activities, unless preparation of an SWM site plan is
specifically exempted in § 26-132:
A. Preparation and implementation of an approved SWM site plan is
required.
B. No regulated activities shall commence until the Township issues
written approval of an SWM site plan, which demonstrates
compliance with the requirements of this Part.
2. SWM site plans approved by the Township, in accordance with
§ 26-146, shall be on site throughout the duration of the regulated
activity.
3. The Township may, after consultation with DEP, approve measures for
meeting the state water quality requirements other than those in this
Part, provided that they meet the minimum requirements of, and do not
conflict with, state law, including, but not limited to, the Clean Streams
Law. The Township shall allow DEP 30 days, from time of receipt by
DEP, to review and comment on alternative measures. If DEP does not
respond within this time period, the Township will deem the alternative
measures in concurrence with minimum requirements by DEP. The
Township shall maintain a record of consultations with DEP pursuant to
this subsection.
A. DEP is not required to be consulted for waiver of the requirements
within:
(1) § 26-136, Design Criteria.
(2) § 26-137, Regulations Governing Stormwater Management
Facilities.
(3) § 26-138, Calculation Methodology.

(6) § 26-165, Municipal Stormwater Maintenance Fund.
4. For all regulated earth disturbance activities, erosion and sediment
control BMPs shall be designed, implemented, operated, and
maintained during the regulated earth disturbance activities (e.g.,
during construction) to meet the purposes and requirements of this Part
and to meet all requirements under Title 25 of the Pennsylvania Code
and the Clean Streams Law. Various BMPs and their design standards
are listed in the Erosion and Sediment Pollution Control Program
§ 26-131 FOREWORD § 26-131
FWD:685
Manual (E&S Manual), No. 363-2134-008 (April 15, 2000), as amended
and updated.21
5. For all regulated activities, implementation of the volume controls in
§ 26-133 is required, unless specifically exempted under § 26-131,
Subsection 3, or exempted by an approved modification request as
specified in § 26-143, Subsection 2, of this Part.
6. Impervious Areas.
A. The measurement of impervious areas shall include all of the
impervious areas in the total proposed development even if
development is to take place in stages.
B. For development taking place in stages, the entire development
plan must be used in determining conformance with this Part.
C. For projects that add impervious area to a parcel, the total
impervious area on the parcel is subject to the requirements of this
Part; except that the volume controls in § 26-133 and the peak rate
controls of § 26-134 do not need to be retrofitted to existing
impervious areas that are not being altered by the proposed
regulated activity. An existing impervious area is considered to be
altered if the regulated activity changes the runoff characteristics
(flow, speed, direction, location) across and/or from the impervious
area.
7. Stormwater flows onto adjacent property shall not be created,
increased, decreased, relocated, or otherwise altered without written
notification to the adjacent property owner(s) by the developer. Such
stormwater flows shall be subject to the requirements of this Part.
8. All regulated activities shall include such measures as necessary to:
A. Protect health, safety, and property;
B. Meet the water quality goals of this Part, as stated in § 26-103,
Purpose, by implementing measures to:
(1) Minimize disturbance to floodplains, wetlands, and wooded
areas.
(2) Maintain or extend riparian buffers.
(3) Avoid erosive flow conditions in natural flow pathways.
(4) Minimize thermal impacts to waters of this commonwealth.
(5) Disconnect impervious surfaces by directing runoff to pervious
areas, wherever possible.
21.Editor's Note: See Appendix D, reference 2.
§ 26-131 MANCHESTER CODE § 26-131
FWD:686
(6) Minimize soil disturbance and compaction. Topsoil, if removed,
shall be replaced to a minimum depth equal to its depth prior
to removal or four inches, whichever is greater.
C. To the maximum extent practicable, incorporate the techniques for
low-impact development practices described in the Pennsylvania
Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual (BMP Manual).22
9. The design of all facilities within an area of karst topography and/or
carbonate geology shall include an evaluation of measures to minimize
adverse effects, including hydrogeologic studies if required by the
Township.
10. All natural streams, channels, swales, drainage systems and/or areas of
surface water concentration shall be maintained in their existing
condition unless an alteration is approved by Manchester Township. All
encroachment activities shall comply with the requirements of PA DEP,
25 Pa. Code Chapter 105 (Water Obstructions and Encroachments),
Rules and Regulations of PA DEP. Any approvals or permits issued do
not relieve compliance as referenced in § 26-108, Compatibility with
Other Permit and Ordinance Requirements.
11. All stormwater management facilities (excluding individual residential
underground infiltration facilities) are considered structures and must
comply with building setback requirements. The outside toe of slope of
the embankment in a fill condition or the top of embankment in a cut
condition shall be considered as the point that must meet the setback
requirements. Individual residential underground infiltration facilities
shall be a minimum of 10 feet from the property line. Discharge of
controlled flows can be no closer to an adjacent property than two times
the length of the required discharge rip-rap apron. This requirement
applies to discharge aprons that do not outlet to a defined waterway or
an existing storm sewer. Minimum distance is 10 feet.
12. Infiltration BMPs should be spread out, made as shallow as practicable,
and located to maximize use of natural on-site infiltration features while
still meeting the other requirements of this Part. In addition, infiltration
BMPs shall include pretreatment BMPs where appropriate.
13. All storage facilities, designed as such, shall completely drain both the
volume control and rate control capacities over a period of time not less
than 24 hours and not more than 72 hours from the end of the design
storm. However, any designed infiltration at such facilities is exempt
from the minimum twenty-four-hour standard, i.e., may infiltrate in a
shorter period of time, so long as none of the stormwater flowing into
the infiltration facility is discharged directly into the surface waters of
the commonwealth. (Inordinately rapid infiltration rates may indicate
the presence of large fractures or other conditions for which an
additional soil buffer may be required.)

§ 26-132. Exemptions. [Ord. 2012-05, 6/12/2012]
14. The design storm values to be used in the analysis of peak rates of
discharge should be obtained from the Precipitation-Frequency Atlas of
the United States, Atlas 14, Volume 2, Version 3.0, United States
Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA), National Weather Service,
Hydrometeorological Design Studies Center, Silver Spring, Maryland.
NOAA's Atlas 14 can be accessed at: http://hdsc.nws.noaa.gov/hdsc/
pfds/.23
15. For all regulated activities, SWM BMPs shall be designed,
implemented, operated, and maintained to meet the purposes and
requirements of this Part and to meet all requirements under Title 25 of
the Pennsylvania Code, the Clean Streams Law, and the Stormwater
Management Act.
16. Various BMPs and their design standards are listed in the BMP
Manual.24
17. All work shall be in accordance with the Township's Construction and
Materials Specifications.
18. The technical standards provided within this Part are considered the
baseline for the design and layout of an SWM site plan. Use of other
alternate and innovative designs for controlling stormwater runoff may
be permitted when approved by the Township Engineer.
1. Any regulated activity that meets the following exemption criteria is
exempt from the part(s) of this Part as specified herein. However, the
requirements of the Part shall otherwise remain in effect. The criteria
for exemption in this section apply to the total development proposed,
including instances in which the development is proposed to take place
in phases. The date of enactment of this Part shall be the starting point
from which future development and the respective proposed
impervious surface computations shall be cumulatively considered and
regulated. Exemption shall not relieve an applicant from implementing
such measures as necessary to meet the intent of this Part or
compliance with any NPDES permit requirements.
A. Regulated activities for residential uses: For the first 300 square
feet of new impervious area, created after the enactment date of
this Part, a credit shall be granted whereby the regulated activity is
exempt from the requirements of this Part. For the next 700 square
feet of new impervious area, created after the enactment date of
this Part, the regulated activity is subject only to the volume control
requirements of this Part; therefore, a simplified stormwater
management permit application to Manchester Township is

FWD:688
§ 26-133. Volume Controls. [Ord. 2012-05, 6/12/2012]
required. A formal application, including a plan designed by a
qualified person, is not required.
B. Regulated activities that create DIAs smaller than 1,000 square
feet are exempt from the peak rate control and the SWM site plan
preparation requirements of this Part; therefore, a simplified
stormwater management permit application to Manchester
Township is required. A formal application, including a plan
designed by a qualified person, is not required.
C. Regulated activities that create DIAs equal to or greater than 1,000
square feet and less than 5,000 square feet are exempt only from
the peak rate control requirement of this Part.
D. Agricultural activity is exempt from the rate control and SWM site
plan preparation requirements of this Part, provided the activities
are performed according to the requirements of 25 Pa. Code
Chapter 102. For regulated activities that meet this exemption
criteria, no formal application to the municipality is required.
E. Forest management and timber operations are exempt from the
rate control and SWM site plan preparation requirements of this
Part, provided the activities are performed according to the
requirements of 25 Pa. Code Chapter 102. For regulated activities
that meet this exemption criteria, no formal application to the
municipality is required.
F. The use of land for domestic (i.e., for a single individual dwelling
unit) gardening and landscaping is exempt from specific approval
and permitting under this Part so long as those activities are
associated with one, and only one, dwelling unit and the activities
comply with all other applicable ordinances and statutes.
G. Exemptions from any provisions of this Part shall not relieve the
applicant from the requirements in § 26-131, Subsections 4
through 14.
H. The applicant shall have the right to appeal to the Board of
Supervisors pursuant to § 26-187 of this Part if an exemption is
denied or revoked.
1. The low-impact development practices provided in the BMP Manual25
shall be utilized for all regulated activities to the maximum extent
practicable. Water volume controls shall be implemented using the
Design Storm Method in Subsection 1A or the Simplified Method in
Subsection 1B below. For regulated activity areas equal or less than one
acre that do not require hydrologic routing to design the stormwater
facilities, this Part establishes no preference for either methodology;
25.Editor's Note: See Appendix D, reference 1.
§ 26-132 FOREWORD § 26-133
FWD:689
§ 26-134. Rate Controls. [Ord. 2012-05, 6/12/2012]
therefore, the applicant may select either methodology, with Township
concurrence.
A. The Design Storm Method (CG-1 in the BMP Manual26) is
applicable to any size of regulated activity. This method requires
detailed modeling based on site conditions.
(1) Do not increase the post-development total runoff volume for
all storms equal to or less than the two-year, twenty-four-hour
duration precipitation.
(2) For modeling purposes:
(a) Existing (predevelopment) nonforested pervious areas
must be considered meadow.
(b) Twenty percent of existing impervious area, when present,
shall be considered meadow in the model for existing
conditions.
B. The Simplified Method (CG-2 in the BMP Manual27) provided below
is independent of site conditions and should be used if the Design
Storm Method is not followed. This method is not applicable to
regulated activities greater than one acre.
For new impervious surfaces:
(1) Stormwater facilities shall capture at least the first two inches
of runoff from all new impervious surfaces.
(2) At least the first one inch of runoff from new impervious
surfaces shall be permanently removed from the runoff flow,
i.e., it shall not be released into the surface waters of this
commonwealth. Removal options include reuse, evaporation,
transpiration, and infiltration.
(3) Wherever possible, infiltration facilities should be designed to
accommodate infiltration of the entire permanently removed
runoff; however, in all cases, at least the first 0.5 inch of the
permanently removed runoff should be infiltrated.
(4) This method is exempt from the requirements of § 26-134, Rate
Controls.
1. For computation of predevelopment peak discharge rates, 20% of
existing impervious areas, when present, shall be considered meadow.

§ 26-136. Design Criteria. [Ord. 2012-05, 6/12/2012]
2. Post-development discharge rates shall not exceed the predevelopment
discharge rates for the two-, five-, ten-, twenty-five-, fifty-, and onehundred-
year, twenty-four-hour storms. If it is shown that the peak
rates of discharge indicated by the post-development analysis are less
than or equal to the peak rates of discharge indicated by the
predevelopment analysis for the two-, five-, ten-, twenty-five-, fifty-, and
one-hundred-year, twenty-four-hour storms, then the requirements of
this section have been met. Otherwise, the applicant shall provide
additional controls as necessary to satisfy the peak rate of discharge
requirement.
1. For the purposes of the Act 167 stormwater management (plan)
elements, contained within the York County Integrated Water
Resources Plan, and this Part, design policy pertaining to stormwater
management facilities for Pennsylvania Department of Transportation
(PennDOT) and Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission (PTC) roadways
and associated facilities is provided in Section 13.7 (Antidegradation
and Post Construction Stormwater Management Policy) of PennDOT
Publication No. 13M, Design Manual Part 2 (August 2009), as
developed, updated, and amended in consultation with the
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP). As stated
in DM-2.13.7.D (Act 167 and Municipal Ordinances), PennDOT and PTC
roadways and associated facilities shall be consistent with Act 167
plans. DM-2.13.7.B (Policy on Antidegradation and Post Construction
Stormwater Management) was developed as a cooperative effort
between PennDOT and DEP. DM-2.13.7.C (Project Categories)
discusses the anticipated impact on the quality, volume and rate of
stormwater runoff.
2. Where standards in the Act 167 elements of the IWRP and this Part are
impractical, PennDOT or the PTC may request assistance from DEP, in
consultation with the county and the Township, to develop an
alternative strategy for meeting state water quality requirements and
the goals and objectives of the Act 167 elements with the IWRP.
3. For the purposes of the Act 167 elements in the IWRP and this Part,
road maintenance activities are regulated under 25 Pa. Code Chapter
102.
1. Off-Site Areas. Off-site areas which drain through a proposed
development site are not subject to release rate criteria when
determining allowable peak runoff rates. However, on-site drainage
§ 26-134 FOREWORD § 26-136
FWD:691
facilities shall be designed to safely convey off-site flows through the
development site.
2. On-Site Areas. On-site areas proposed to remain undisturbed as part of
the regulated activity, including previously developed areas, that are
not within the drainage area of the regulated activity shall be
considered as existing conditions, without considering any reductions
in cover type.
3. "Downstream Hydraulic Capacity Analysis." Any existing downstream
hydraulic capacity analysis shall be conducted in accordance with this
Part.
A. All downstream facilities impacted by the total site area of the
regulated activity shall be studied to determine if the facility has
adequate capacity to handle existing and proposed flows. An
impacted downstream facility is one to which the runoff from the
total site area of the regulated activity comprises more than 50% of
the total flow to such a facility. The study shall end at a perennial
stream. Downstream facilities include, but are not limited to, manmade
or natural swales and open channels, pipes, inlets, culverts,
bridges and roadways.
B. If any private facility is found to be undersized, the applicant shall
be responsible for updating the facility in coordination with the
regulated activity.
C. If any public facility is found to be undersized or inadequate, the
applicant shall work with the Township on upgrading the facility in
coordination with the regulated activity.
4. Regional Detention Alternatives. For certain areas within the study
area, it may be more cost-effective to provide one control facility for
more than one development site than to provide an individual control
facility for each development site. The initiative and funding for any
regional runoff control alternatives are the responsibility of prospective
developers. The design of any regional control basins must incorporate
reasonable development of the entire upstream watershed. The peak
outflow of a regional basin would be determined on a case-by-case basis
using the hydrologic model of the watershed consistent with protection
of the downstream watershed areas. "Hydrologic model" refers to the
calibrated model as developed for the stormwater management plan.
5. Capacity Improvements of Local Drainage Networks. In certain
instances, primarily within the provisional no-detention areas, local
drainage conditions may dictate more-stringent levels of runoff control
than those based upon protection of the entire watershed. In these
instances, if the developer could prove that it would be feasible to
provide capacity improvements to relieve the capacity deficiency in the
local drainage network, then the capacity improvements could be
provided by the developer in lieu of runoff controls on the development
site. Any capacity improvements would be designed based upon
§ 26-136 MANCHESTER CODE § 26-136
FWD:692
§ 26-137. Regulations Governing Stormwater Management
Facilities. [Ord. 2012-05, 6/12/2012]
development of all areas tributary to the proposed improvement and
the capacity criteria specified in § 26-138. In addition, all new
development upstream of a proposed capacity improvement shall be
assumed to implement the applicable runoff controls consistent with
this Part, except that all new development within the entire subarea(s)
within which the proposed development site is located shall be assumed
to implement the developer's proposed discharge control, if any.
6. Capacity improvements may also be provided as necessary to
implement any regional or subregional detention alternatives.
7. Where the potential for groundwater and/or surface water
contamination exists, based on the proposed use of the regulated
activity, safeguards shall be incorporated into the site.
A. For industrial or commercial sites where it is possible that toxic or
hazardous substances may come into contact with stormwater
runoff, pretreatment of the first-flush (first 1/2 inch) runoff over
areas where industrial and commercial operations take place shall
be provided. Pretreatment shall include means for separating light
and heavy nonaqueous phase liquids from the stormwater before
the stormwater is conveyed to the general stormwater
management facility(ies).
B. Infiltration systems may be used to handle runoff from commercial
or industrial working or parking areas only after the first-flush
stormwater from these areas has been pretreated for removal of
toxic and hazardous substances. This prohibition does not extend to
roof areas which are demonstrated to be suitably protected from
the effects of the commercial/industrial activities.
8. Roof drains and sump pumps shall discharge to infiltration or
vegetative BMPs and to the maximum extent practicable satisfy the
criteria for DIAs.
1. Any stormwater facility located on state highway rights-of-way shall be
subject to approval by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation
(PennDOT).
2. Any stormwater management facilities regulated by this Part that
would be located in or adjacent to waters of the commonwealth or
wetlands shall be subject to approval by PA DEP through the joint
permit application process or, where deemed appropriate by PA DEP,
the general permit process. When there is a question whether wetlands
may be involved, it is the responsibility of the developer or his agent to
show that the land in question cannot be classified as wetlands;
otherwise approval to work in the area must be obtained from PA DEP.
§ 26-136 FOREWORD § 26-137
FWD:693
3. Any stormwater management facility located within the vicinity of a
floodplain shall be subject to approval in accordance with PA DEP 25
Pa. Code Chapter 105 (Floodplain Management) of PA DEP's Rules and
Regulations.
4. All earthmoving activities must be reviewed and approved by the York
County Conservation District prior to commencing work.
5. The design of all stormwater management facilities shall incorporate
good engineering principles and practices. Manchester Township shall
reserve the right to disapprove any design that would result in the
creation or continuation of adverse hydrologic or hydraulic conditions
within the watershed.
6. The existing points of concentrated drainage that discharge onto
adjacent property shall not be altered without permission of the
adjacent property owner(s) and shall be subject to any applicable
discharge criteria specified in this Part.
7. Areas of existing diffused drainage discharge shall be subject to any
applicable discharge criteria in the general direction of existing
discharge, whether proposed to be concentrated or maintained as
diffused drainage areas, except as otherwise provided by this Part. If
diffused flow is proposed to be concentrated and discharged onto
adjacent property, the developer must document that adequate
downstream conveyance facilities exist to safely transport the
concentrated discharge, or otherwise prove that no erosion,
sedimentation, flooding or other harm will result from the concentrated
discharge.
8. Where a development site is traversed by watercourses, drainage
easements shall be provided conforming to the line of such
watercourses. The terms of the easement shall prohibit excavation, the
placing of fill or structures, and any alterations that may adversely
affect the flow of stormwater within any portion of the easement. Also,
maintaining of vegetation in a natural state within the easement shall
be required, except as approved by the appropriate governing
authority.
9. When it can be shown that, due to topographic conditions, natural
drainageways on the site cannot adequately provide for drainage, open
channels may be constructed conforming substantially to the line and
grade of such natural drainageways. Work within natural drainageways
shall be subject to approval by PA DEP through the joint permit
application process or, where deemed appropriate by PA DEP, through
the general permit process.
10. Roof drains must not be connected to streets, sanitary or storm sewers
or roadside ditches to promote overland flow and infiltration/
percolation of stormwater where advantageous to do so. When it is
more advantageous to connect directly to streets or storm sewers, then
it shall be permitted on a case-by-case basis by Manchester Township.

§ 26-138. Calculation Methodology. [Ord. 2012-05, 6/12/2012]
1. Stormwater runoff from all development sites shall be calculated using
the Rational Method, Modified Rational Method, or a Soil-Cover-
Complex methodology.
A. Any stormwater runoff calculations involving drainage areas
greater than 200 acres, including on- and off-site areas, shall use a
generally accepted calculation technique that is based on the
NRCS Soil-Cover-Complex Method. It is assumed that all methods
will be selected by the design professional based on the individual
limitations and suitability of each method for a particular site.
B. Manchester Township may allow the use of the Rational Method or
Modified Rational Method to estimate peak discharges from
drainage areas that contain less than 200 acres.
C. All calculations consistent with this Part using the Soil-Cover-
Complex Method shall use the appropriate design rainfall depths. If
a hydrologic computer model such as PSRM or HEC-RAS is used for
stormwater runoff calculations, then the duration of rainfall shall
be 24 hours. The SCS Rainfall Type II curve shall be used for the
rainfall distribution.
D. For the purposes of predevelopment flow rate determination,
undeveloped land, including disturbed areas, shall be considered
as "meadow" in good condition, unless the natural ground cover
generates a lower curve number or Rational "C" value (i.e., forest),
as listed in Tables 1 and 2, respectively.
E. All calculations using the Rational Method shall use rainfall
intensities consistent with appropriate times-of-concentration for
overland flow and return periods. Times-of-concentration for
overland flow shall be calculated using the methodology presented
in Chapter 3 of Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds, NRCS,
TR-55 (as amended or replaced from time to time by NRCS). Timeof-
concentration for channel and pipe flow shall be computed using
Manning's Equation.
F. Runoff Curve Numbers (CN) for both existing and proposed
conditions to be used in the Soil-Cover-Complex Method shall be
obtained from Table 1.
G. Runoff coefficients (c) for both existing and proposed conditions for
use in the Rational Method shall be obtained from Table 2.
H. Where uniform flow is anticipated, the Manning Equation shall be
used for hydraulic computations, such as the capacity of open
channels, pipes, and storm sewers. Values for Manning's roughness
coefficient (n) shall be consistent with Table 3.
§ 26-138 FOREWORD § 26-138
FWD:695
I. The design of any stormwater detention facilities intended to meet
the performance standards of this Part shall be verified by routing
the design storm hydrograph through these facilities, using either
manual methods or computerized routing. Routing shall be based
upon the Modified PULS Method; other routing methodologies
shall be subject to the approval of the Township Engineer.
J. The stormwater collection system shall be designed using the peak
discharge computed using the Rational Formula. A computation
table, similar to Figure 1, shall be submitted with the storm sewer
design.
2. Design Standards - Water-Carrying Facilities.
A. All storm sewer pipes, streets, and inlets (excluding detention and
retention basin outfall structures) shall be designed for a ten-year
storm event. Sole-access structures (culverts and bridges) shall be
designed to convey the twenty-five-year storm event without
overtopping the roadway.
(1) When a pipe or culvert is intended to convey the discharge
from a stormwater management facility, its required capacity
shall be computed by the Rational Method and compared to the
peak outflow from the stormwater facility for the one-hundredyear
storm event. The greater flow shall govern the design of
the pipe or culvert.
(2) When a pipe is part of a storm sewer system and crosses the
roadway, it shall be designed as a storm sewer with the same
design storm as the remainder of the drainage system.
(3) Greater design frequencies may be justified on individual
projects.
(4) A one-hundred-year storm frequency may be required for
design of the stormwater collection system to ensure that the
resultant stormwater runoff from the post-development storm
is directed into the management facility.
B. In general, inlets shall be spaced such that, based upon the
Rational Method, tc = 5 minutes and ten-year rainfall intensity, the
area contributing to the inlet shall not produce a peak runoff of
greater than 4 cfs. Also, inlets shall be spaced so that their
efficiency, based upon efficiency curves published by the
Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, is not less than 65%.
C. Inlets shall be placed on both sides of the street at low spots and at
the upper side of street intersections to prevent stormwater from
crossing an intersection. Other devices, such as high-efficiency
grates or perforated pipe, may be required if conditions warrant.
All inlets at low points along the roadway shall have a ten-inch curb
§ 26-138 MANCHESTER CODE § 26-138
FWD:696
reveal and shall be equipped with pavement base drain extending
50 feet in either direction, parallel to the center line of the roadway.
D. In all cases where drainage is picked up by means of a headwall,
the pipe shall be designed as a culvert. Inlet and outlet conditions
shall be analyzed. The minimum diameter of culvert shall be 18
inches. The procedure contained in Hydraulic Engineer Circulars
No. 5 and No. 13, as prepared by the United States Department of
Transportation, Federal Highway Administration, Washington,
D.C., shall be used for the design of culverts. All culverts shall
include concrete headwalls and endwalls.
E. Guards shall be provided on all intake and outfall structures as well
as outlet structures. The guard bars shall be one-half-inch diameter
galvanized bars on six-inch centers attached to the structure with
three-eighth-inch-diameter stainless steel anchors. Guards shall
also be provided for any pipe opening 18 inches in diameter or
larger.
F. Manholes, inlets, headwalls, and endwalls shall conform to the
requirements of PennDOT Publication 408, as modified by the
adopted Township Construction and Materials Specifications.
G. Proposed channels or swales must be able to convey the increased
runoff associated with a proposed one-hundred-year return-period
event within their banks at velocities consistent with protection of
the channels from erosion. Acceptable velocities shall be based
upon criteria included in the PA DEP Erosion and Sediment
Pollution Control Program Manual.
H. Existing natural or man-made channels or swales must be able to
convey proposed one-hundred-year return-period runoff without
creating any hazard to persons or property.
I. Stormwater runoff on roadways (i.e., gutter spread, lane
encroachment, etc.) shall be controlled in accordance with
PennDOT Publications 13M, "Design Manual, Part 2" and 584,
"Drainage Manual."
3. Design Standards - Detention and Retention Basins.
A. Permanent detention and retention basins shall be designed to
meet the following standards:
(1) The maximum permitted depth for detention or retention
basins shall be six feet, measured from the bottom of the
emergency spillway to the lowest point in the basin.
(2) The minimum top width of all basin embankments shall be
eight feet.
(3) The maximum permitted side slopes for detention or retention
basins shall be four horizontal to one vertical. In order to
§ 26-138 FOREWORD § 26-138
FWD:697
obtain a waiver for slopes steeper than 4:1, the plan must
include a planting schedule to stabilize the embankments. The
proposed vegetation shall be low-maintenance varieties.
(4) Any stormwater management facility (i.e., detention basin)
designed to store runoff and requiring a berm or earthen
embankment required or regulated by this Part shall be
designed to provide an emergency spillway to handle flow up to
and including the one-hundred-year, twenty-four-hour design
storm at post-development conditions, assuming the principal
outlet structure to be clogged. The height of embankment must
be set as to provide a minimum 0.5 foot of freeboard above the
maximum elevation computed. Should any stormwater
management facility require a dam safety permit under PA DEP
25 Pa. Code Chapter 105, the facility shall be designed in
accordance with PA DEP 25 Pa. Code Chapter 105 and meet
the regulations of PA DEP 25 Pa. Code Chapter 105 concerning
dam safety which may be required to pass storms larger than
the one-hundred-year event.
(5) A cutoff trench of impervious material shall be provided within
all basin embankments.
(6) Where a basin embankment is constructed using fill on an
existing 15% or greater slope, the basin must be keyed into the
existing grade.
(7) Fencing. Any aboveground stormwater management detention/
retention facility that is designed to store at least a three-foot
depth of runoff for more than two hours and/or has a side slope
of greater than 4:1 shall be subject to the following fencing
requirements:
(a) The stormwater facility must be completely surrounded by
a chain-link fence of not less than four feet in height.
Alternative fences and barriers may be permitted upon
request to and approval by the Township.
(b) All gates or doors opening through such enclosure shall be
equipped with a self-closing and self-latching device for
keeping the gate or door securely closed at all times when
not in actual use.
(8) All outlet structures and emergency spillways shall include a
satisfactory means of energy dissipation at their outlet to
assure conveyance and flow without endangering the safety
and integrity of the basin and the downstream drainage area.
(9) A concentrated discharge of stormwater to an adjacent
property shall be within a natural drainageway or watercourse,
or an easement shall be required. Discharge from the toe of
slope of emergency spillways can be no closer to an adjacent

§ 26-139. Carbonate Geology. [Ord. 2012-05, 6/12/2012]
property than one horizontal foot per cubic foot per second of
flow.
(10) Plans for infiltration must show the locations of existing and
proposed septic tank infiltration areas and wells. A minimum
twenty-five-foot separation from on-lot disposal systems
(OLDS) infiltration areas, including replacement areas, is
desired and will be evaluated by the Township on a case-bycase
basis. However, the separation shall not be less than the
PA DEP required 10 feet. Infiltration rates shall be based upon
infiltration tests conducted at the site of the proposed facility.
1. In areas of carbonate geology, a geologist shall certify to the following:
A. No stormwater management facility will be placed in, over, or
immediately adjacent to the following features:
(1) Closer than 100 feet from sinkholes.
(2) Closer than 100 feet from closed depressions.
(3) Closer than 100 feet from caverns, intermittent lakes, or
ephemeral streams.
(4) Closer than 50 feet from lineaments in carbonate areas as per
the map in Appendix A.
(5) Closer than 50 feet from fracture traces as determined by field
investigation.
(6) Closer than 25 feet from bedrock pinnacles (surface or
subsurface) as determined by field investigation.
B. Stormwater resulting from regulated activities shall not be
discharged into sinkholes.
C. If the developer can prove through analysis that the project site is
an area underlain by carbonate geology, and such geologic
conditions may result in sinkhole formations, then the project site
is exempt from recharge requirements as described in § 26-133,
Volume Control. However, the project site shall still be required to
meet all other standards found in this Part.
D. It shall be the developer's responsibility to verify if the project site
is underlain by carbonate geology. The following note shall be
attached to all stormwater management plans and signed and
sealed by the developer's geologist: "I, _____, certify that the
proposed stormwater management facility (circle one) is/is not
underlain by carbonate geology."
§ 26-138 FOREWORD § 26-139
FWD:699
E. Whenever a stormwater management facility will be located in an
area underlain by carbonate geology, a geological evaluation of the
proposed location by a geologist shall be conducted to determine
susceptibility to sinkhole formation. The evaluation may include the
use of impermeable liners to reduce or eliminate the separation
distances listed in the BMP Manual. Additionally, the evaluation
shall, at a minimum, address soil permeability, depth to bedrock,
seasonally high groundwater table, susceptibility for sinkhole
formation, suitability of stormwater management facilities,
subgrade stability and maximum infiltration capacity in depth of
water per unit area.
F. A detailed soils evaluation of the project site shall be performed to
determine the suitability of recharge facilities. The evaluation shall
be performed by a geologist and, at a minimum, address soil
permeability, depth to bedrock, susceptibility to sinkhole formation,
and subgrade stability. The general process for designing the
infiltration BMP shall be:
(1) Site evaluation to determine general areas of suitability for
infiltration practices.
(2) Provide field test throughout the area proposed for
development to determine appropriate percolation rate and/or
hydraulic conductivity. At least one infiltration test must be
included in each soil group, and at least one infiltration test
must be conducted for each five lots proposed for
development. Infiltration tests must be taken at the location
and depth of all proposed infiltration structures.
(3) Design the infiltration structure for required storm volume
based on all available data.
G. Extreme caution shall be exercised where infiltration is proposed in
geologically susceptible areas, such as strip mine or limestone
areas. It is also extremely important that the design professional
evaluate the possibility of groundwater contamination from the
proposed infiltration/recharge facility and recommend a
hydrogeologic justification study be performed if necessary.
Whenever a basin will be located in an area underlain by limestone,
a geological evaluation of the proposed location shall be conducted
to determine susceptibility to sinkhole formations. The design of all
facilities over carbonate formations shall include measures to
prevent groundwater contamination and, where necessary,
sinkhole formation. The infiltration requirement in high-quality/
exceptional waters shall be subject to the Department's Chapter 93
and antidegradation regulations. A detailed hydrogeologic
investigation may be required by Manchester Township, and,
where appropriate, the Township may require the installation of an
impermeable liner in detention basins.

topography are to be disturbed, such activity must be in conformance
with PA DEP 25 Pa. Code Chapter 105, Rules and Regulations, Part I,
Subpart C, Protection of Natural Resources, Article II, Water
Resources, Chapter 102, "Erosion Control," and in accordance with the
York County Conservation District.
2. It is extremely important that strict erosion and sedimentation control
measures be applied surrounding infiltration structures during
installation to prevent the infiltrative surfaces from becoming clogged.
Additional erosion and sedimentation control design standards and
criteria must be applied where infiltration BMPs are proposed and shall
include the following:
A. Areas proposed for infiltration BMPs shall be protected from
sedimentation and compaction during the construction phase, so as
to maintain their maximum infiltration capacity.
B. Infiltration BMPs shall not be constructed nor receive runoff until
the entire contributory drainage area to the infiltration BMP has
received final stabilization.
3. Fencing for sedimentation basins or traps must comply with § 26-138,
Subsection 3A(7).
4. The developer shall demonstrate that the post-development hydrograph
flows during the erosion and sedimentation control phase are less than
or equal to the predevelopment hydrograph flows to assure the rate and
volume of runoff leaving the site are controlled for the two-, five-, and
ten-year frequency storms. All calculation methodology shall be in
accordance with §§ 26-133 through 26-140.
5. Any sedimentation basins or traps must be completely surrounded by
temporary construction fencing, of not less than four feet in height,
until such time of conversion to stormwater basin or elimination of
basin.
6. During the construction phase of any development, when a basin is also
functioning as a sedimentation basin, a fence shall be constructed to
prohibit unrestricted and unauthorized entry into the facility.

§ 26-143. Plan Review. [Ord. 2012-05, 6/12/2012]
B. _____ four copies of the SWM site plan shall be submitted by the
applicant as follows:
(1) _____ one copy to the Township.
(2) _____ one copy to the Township Engineer.
(3) _____ one copy to the York County Conservation District (if
required).
(4) _____ one copy to the York County Planning Commission, when
the regulated activity is part of a subdivision or land
development.
C. Additional copies shall be submitted as requested by the Township.
D. The Township may establish a fee schedule for the review of SWM
plans, the amount of which shall be set by resolution of the
municipality's governing body.
1. SWM site plans shall be reviewed by the Township for consistency with
the provisions of this Part.
2. Modification Requests.
A. When reviewing an SWM site plan, whether or not the SWM site
plan is included in a subdivision and/or land development plan
application, the Board of Supervisors may, after consulting with
DEP as noted in § 26-131, Subsection 3, of this Part, grant a
modification of the requirements of one or more provisions of this
Part if the literal enforcement will enact undue hardship because of
peculiar conditions pertaining to the land in question, provided that
such modification will not be contrary to the public interest and
that the purpose and intent of this Part is observed.
B. All requests for a modification from an applicant shall be in writing
and shall accompany and be a part of the application for approval
of an SWM site plan and/or a subdivision or land development plan,
as applicable, accompanied by the applicable Township review fee.
The request shall state in full the grounds and facts of
unreasonableness or hardship on which the request is based, the
provision or provisions of this Part involved and the minimum
modification necessary.
C. The Township may grant a modification provided that all of the
following findings are made in a given case:
(1) That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity of lot size or shape, or exceptional
topographical or physical conditions peculiar to the particular
property, and the unnecessary hardship is due to such
§ 26-142 FOREWORD § 26-143
FWD:709
conditions, and not the circumstances or conditions generally
created by the provisions of this Part in the stormwater
management district in which the property is located;
(2) That, because of such physical circumstances or conditions,
there is no possibility that the property can be developed in
strict conformity with the provisions of this Part and that the
authorization of a modification is therefore necessary to enable
the reasonable use of the property;
(3) That such necessary hardship has not been created by the
applicant; and
(4) That the modification, if authorized, will represent the
minimum modification that will afford relief and will represent
the least modification possible of the regulation in issue.
D. In granting any modification, the Township may attach such
reasonable conditions and safeguards as it may deem necessary to
implement the purposes of the Act 167 Plan and this Part.
E. The Board of Supervisors shall keep a written record of all action
on requests for modifications. The response of any consultation
and/or review by DEP shall be included as an original report, if
available, or otherwise documented in the required written record.
3. SWM Site Plan Review and Approval Procedure.
A. If an SWM site plan does not involve a subdivision and/or land
development, the review of the SWM site, recommendations,
approval, approval with conditions, or disapproval shall occur
within 45 days of submission to the Township. However, the
municipality, in its sole discretion, may extend the review and
decision period another 45 days due to the nature of the application
and/or site conditions. If an extension of another 45 days is imposed
or granted by the municipality beyond the first forty-five-day review
and decision period designated by this subsection, the municipality
shall notify the applicant in writing and deliver such notice to said
applicant within 15 days of the decision to extend the review and
decision period by the municipality. If no extension is imposed or
granted by the municipality beyond the first forty-five-day review
and decision period, and no decision has been rendered by the
municipality within that period, the SWM site plan shall be deemed
approved. Similarly, after a forty-five-day extension of the review
and decision period has been imposed or granted by the
municipality, and no decision has been rendered by the
municipality within that period, the SWM site plan shall be deemed
approved.
B. If an SWM site plan involves a subdivision and/or land development
plan, the period of time from the submission to the Township of the
subdivision and/or land development plan application which
§ 26-143 MANCHESTER CODE § 26-143
FWD:710
includes the SWM plan and a decision rendered by the Board
of Supervisors at a public meeting to approve, approve with
conditions, or disapprove shall not exceed 90 days, in accordance
with the procedure for approval of plats in Section 508 of the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code.29
C. From the time an application for approval of a plat involving a
subdivision or land development plan, whether preliminary or final,
which includes an SWM site plan, is duly filed with the Township,
no change or amendment of this Part or other governing ordinance
or plan shall affect the decision on such application in accordance
with the provisions of the governing ordinances or plans as they
stood at the time the application was duly filed, as specified in
Section 508(4)(I) of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code.
D. The Township Engineer shall review the SWM site plan for any
submission or land development against the Township Subdivision
and Land Development Ordinance provisions not superseded by
this Part. A written review will be provided to the Township
outlining the results of the review.
E. The Township shall not approve any subdivision or land
development for regulated activities specified in § 26-104 of this
Part if the SWM site plan has been found to be inconsistent with
this Part, as determined by the Township Engineer. All required
permits from PA DEP must be obtained prior to approval of any
subdivision or land development.
F. The Township Building Permit Office shall not issue a building
permit for any regulated activity specified in § 26-104 of this Part if
the SWM site plan has been found to be inconsistent with this Part,
as determined by the Township Engineer, or without considering
the comments of the Township Engineer. All required permits from
PA DEP must be obtained prior to issuance of a building permit.
4. Decision Notification Procedure. In all cases, the decision of the
Township to approve or disapprove the SWM site plan shall be in
writing and shall be delivered to the applicant personally or mailed to
the applicant's last known address no later than 15 days following the
decision. If the SWM site plan is disapproved, the written decision by
the Township shall specify the defects in the application, describe the
requirements which were not met, and shall cite the provisions of this
Part relied upon. If the SWM site plan is approved with conditions, the
notification to the applicant shall state the acceptable conditions for
approval and the time limit for satisfying such conditions. The time limit
for satisfying such conditions or approval shall be the time limit
prescribed for conditional approval of subdivision and land
development plans as stated in the Township Subdivision and Land
Development Ordinance.

§ 26-144. Revision of Plans. [Ord. 2012-05, 6/12/2012]
A revision to a previously submitted SWM site plan that involves a change
in SWM BMPs or techniques, or that involves the relocation or redesign
of SWM BMPs, or that is necessary because soil or other conditions are
not as stated on the SWM site plan, as determined by the Township, shall
require a resubmission of the revised SWM site plan in accordance with
this Part, including applicable fees. For NPDES permitted sites, any revised
SWM site plan shall also be resubmitted to the York County Conservation
District for review. In the case of an SWM site plan which contains minor
deficiencies, such as a missing label, omission of a required note or minor
construction detail, as determined by the Township, the Township may
accept a resubmission of such SWM site plan without the requirement of a
review fee, or for a lesser fee as provided in the Township's fee schedule.
§ 26-145. Resubmission of Disapproved SWM Site Plans. [Ord.
2012-05, 6/12/2012]
A disapproved SWM site plan may be resubmitted, with the revisions
addressing the Township's concerns, to the Township in accordance with
this Part. The applicable review fee must accompany a resubmission of a
disapproved SWM site plan, unless such fee is waived by the Township (see
§ 26-144).
§ 26-146. Authorization to Construct and Term of Validity. [Ord.
2012-05, 6/12/2012]
1. SWM Site Plans Independent of Subdivision and Land Development
Plans. The Township's approval of an SWM site plan, when such plan is
submitted independent of a subdivision and/or land development plan,
authorizes the regulated activities contained in the SWM site plan for a
maximum term of validity of five years following the date of approval.
The Township may specify a term of validity shorter than five years in
the approval for any specific SWM site plan, particularly if the nature of
the proposed SWM facilities requires more-frequent maintenance and/
or short-term replacement of certain components. Terms of validity
shall commence on the date the Township signs the approval for an
SWM site plan. If an approved SWM site plan is not completed
according to § 26-147 within the term of validity, then the Township may
consider the SWM site plan disapproved and may revoke any and all
permits. SWM site plans that are considered disapproved by the
Township may be resubmitted in accordance with § 26-145 of this Part.
2. SWM Site Plans Included in a Subdivision and/or Land Development
Plan. The Township's approval of an SWM site plan which is a part of a
subdivision and/or land development plan authorizes that plan and the
regulated activities therein so that no subsequent change or
amendment in this Part or other governing ordinances or plans shall be
applied to affect adversely the right of the applicant to commence and
to complete any aspect of the approved development in accordance
§ 26-144 MANCHESTER CODE § 26-146

with the terms of such approval within five years from such approval, as
specified in Section 508(4)(ii) - (vii) of the Pennsylvania Municipalities
Planning Code.
1. The developer shall be responsible for providing as-built plans of all
SWM BMPs included in the approved SWM site plan. The as-built plans
and an explanation of any discrepancies with the construction plans
shall be submitted to the Township within six months after completion
of the facility. In no case shall the Township approve the as-built plans
until the Township receives a copy of the highway occupancy permit
from the PennDOT District Office and any applicable permits from PA
DEP.
2. The as-built submission shall include a certification of completion
signed by a qualified person verifying that all permanent SWM BMPs
have been constructed according to the approved plans and
specifications. If any licensed, qualified person contributed to the
construction plans, then a licensed, qualified person must sign the
completion certificate. Plans which are not properly documented and
certified or which do not accurately reflect correct site conditions shall
be rejected.
3. After receipt of the completion certification by the Township, the
Township may conduct a final inspection to verify compliance with, and
accuracy of, the as-built plan.
4. The financial guarantee, as discussed under § 26-163, shall not be
released by the Township until the items of this section are completed.

Construction Inspections.
§ 26-151. Schedule of Inspections. [Ord. 2012-05, 6/12/2012]
1. The Township Engineer or his municipal assignee shall inspect phases
of the installation of the permanent stormwater management facilities
as deemed appropriate by the Township Engineer. It is the
responsibility of the permittee to notify the Township Engineer 48 hours
in advance of the beginning of construction of stormwater management
facilities. Individual residential on-lot stormwater management systems
shall be inspected by Manchester Township staff.
2. During any stage of the work, if the Township Engineer determines that
the permanent stormwater management facilities are not being
installed in accordance with the approved SWM site plan, the Township
shall revoke any existing approvals issued under this Part until a
revised SWM site plan is submitted and approved, as specified in this
Part.

Operation and Maintenance.
§ 26-161. Responsibilities of Developers and Landowners. [Ord.
2012-05, 6/12/2012]
1. The Township shall make the final determination on the continuing
maintenance responsibilities prior to final approval of the SWM site
plan. The Township may require a dedication of such facilities as part of
the requirements for approval of the SWM site plan. Such a
requirement is not an indication that the Township will accept the
facilities. The Township reserves the right to accept or reject the
ownership and operating responsibility for any portion of the
stormwater management controls.
2. Facilities, areas, or structures included in the SWM site plan and used
as stormwater management BMPs shall be enumerated as permanent
real estate appurtenances and recorded in the York County Recorder of
Deeds' office as deed restrictions/protective covenants or easements
that run with the land.
3. The SWM site plan for the development site shall contain an operation
and maintenance plan prepared by the developer and approved by the
Township. The operation and maintenance plan shall outline required
routine maintenance actions and schedules necessary to ensure proper
operation of the facility(ies).
4. The SWM site plan for the development site shall establish
responsibilities for the continuing operation and maintenance of all
proposed BMPs, consistent with the following principles:
A. Maintenance by Private Entity. In cases where permanent BMPs
are owned by a private entity (such as a homeowners' association),
such entity shall be responsible for maintenance. In this case, a
legally binding agreement between the entity and Manchester
Township, as discussed under § 26-161, Subsection 5, and § 26-162,
shall be made providing for maintenance of all permanent BMPs,
including the inspection by the Township of all such facilities
deemed critical to the public welfare annually and after each major
floor event.
B. Maintenance by Township. The Township is authorized, where it is
deemed necessary for the public welfare, to enter into contracts
with persons whereby such persons will dedicate such stormwater
management facilities to the Township; provided, however, before
such stormwater management BMP is dedicated to the Township
and accepted by Manchester Township, such person shall have
deposited a sum of money with the Township as determined by
§ 26-165, "Municipal Stormwater Maintenance Fund."
§ 26-161 FOREWORD § 26-161
FWD:717
C. Maintenance of Existing Facilities. Stormwater management
facilities existing on November 13, 2016, on individual lots which
have not been accepted by the Township or for which maintenance
responsibility has not been assumed by a private entity such as a
homeowners' association shall be maintained by the individual
property owners. Such maintenance shall include, at a minimum,
those items set forth in this chapter. If the Township determines at
any time that any permanent stormwater management facility has
been eliminated, altered, blocked through the erection of
structures or the deposit of materials, or improperly maintained,
the Township may determine that such condition constitutes a
public nuisance and shall notify the property owner(s) of corrective
measures which are required, and provide for a reasonable period
of time, not to exceed 30 days, within which the property owner
shall take correction action. If the property owner(s) does not take
the required corrective action, the Township may either perform
the work or contract for the performance of the work and, in such
event, the Township shall have the right to file a municipal lien
against such property(ies) for the cost of the work carried out
under this section, plus a penalty of 10% of the costs of such work.
The Township shall, in addition to the filing of a municipal lien,
have any other remedies provided by law against any property
owner(s) who should fail to comply with the terms of this chapter.
For purposes of this subsection, property owners in an approved
subdivision and land development plan where the installation and
maintenance of the stormwater management facilities was a
requirement, shall be deemed to have collective responsibility for
the maintenance of said facilities unless otherwise set forth in the
subdivision and land development plan or the declaration, if any,
and all costs incurred under this subsection shall be assessed
against the benefitted property owners, pro rata, with other
property owners in that subdivision. [Added by Ord. 2016-05, 11/
8/2016]
D. The cost incurred in the maintenance and remediation of any
stormwater management facility shall be prorated among all
homeowners whose properties drain into the stormwater
management facility in question. In addition, all other fees and
expenses incurred, including, but not limited to, court costs and
legal fees, shall be added for each lien filed against each and every
homeowner. [Added by Ord. 2016-05, 11/8/2016]
5. The operation and maintenance (O&M) plan shall be recorded as a
restrictive deed covenant that runs with the land.
6. No person shall modify, remove, fill, landscape, or alter any SWM BMPs,
facilities, areas, or structures without the written approval of the
Township, with the exception of necessary maintenance activities, such
as moving.

For SWM site plans that involve subdivision and land development, the
applicant shall provide a financial guarantee, in an amount equal to 110%
of the estimated cost of all stormwater management BMPs, to the Township
for the timely installation and proper construction of all stormwater
management controls as required by the approved SWM site plan and
this Part in accordance with the provisions of Sections 509, 510, and 511
of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code. A line item "Public
Improvements Security Estimate" shall be submitted by the applicant or his/
her representative to assist the Township Engineer in establishing the bond
amount. Said bond shall be conditioned upon the faithful performance of the
control measures specified on the plan within the times specified or within
any extension thereof granted by the Township. Said bond shall terminate
7. The Township may take enforcement actions against an owner for any
failure to satisfy the provisions of this Part.
1. Prior to final approval of the SWM site plan, the property owner shall
sign and record an operation and maintenance (O&M) agreement (see
Appendix A)30 covering all stormwater control facilities which are to be
privately owned. The operation and maintenance plan shall be attached
to this maintenance agreement.
A. The owner, successor and assigns shall maintain all facilities in
accordance with the approved maintenance schedule in the O&M
plan.
B. The owner shall convey to the Township easements to assure
access for periodic inspections by the Township and maintenance,
as necessary.
C. The owner shall keep on file with the Township the name, address,
and telephone number of the person or company responsible for
maintenance activities; in the event of a change, new information
shall be submitted by the owner to the Township within 10 working
days of the change.
2. The owner is responsible for operation and maintenance (O&M) of the
SWM BMPs. If the owner fails to adhere to the O&M agreement, the
Township may perform the services required and charge the owner
appropriate fees. Nonpayment of fees may result in a lien against the
property, in accordance with the provisions of the Municipal Lien Law.
3. The Township is exempt from the requirement to sign and record an
operation and maintenance agreement.

when all control measures as shown on the approved plan are completed
and approved by the Township Engineer. In lieu of the required bonds, the
applicant may deposit funds or securities in an escrow account satisfactory
to the Township Solicitor. Funds deposited in this account for guaranteeing
the construction or maintenance of control measures shall be used for these
purposes only.
§ 26-164. Maintenance Guarantee. [Ord. 2012-05, 6/12/2012]
For SWM site plans that involve the dedication of all or some of the required
improvements following completion, the Township may require the posting
of financial security to secure structural integrity of said improvements as
well as the functioning of said improvements in accordance with the design
and specifications as depicted on the SWM site plan for a term not to
exceed 18 months from the date of acceptance of dedication. Said financial
security shall be of the same type as otherwise required in § 26-163 with
regard to installation of such improvements, and the amount of the financial
security shall not exceed 15% of the actual cost of installation of said
improvements in accordance with the provisions of Section 509 of the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code.
§ 26-165. Municipal Stormwater Maintenance Fund. [Ord. 2012-05,
6/12/2012]
1. Persons installing stormwater storage facilities shall be required to pay
a specified amount to the Municipal Stormwater Maintenance Fund to
help defray costs of periodic inspections and maintenance expenses.
The amount of the deposit shall be determined as follows:
A. If the storage facility is to be privately owned and maintained, the
deposit shall cover the cost of periodic inspections performed by
the Township for a period of 10 years, as estimated by the Township
Engineer. After that period of time, inspection expenses will be
assessed by the Township on an as-needed basis thereafter.
B. If the storage facility is to be owned and maintained by the
Township, the deposit shall cover the estimated costs for
maintenance and inspections for 10 years. The Township Engineer
will establish the estimated costs utilizing information submitted by
the applicant.
C. The amount of the deposit to the fund shall be converted to present
worth of the annual series values. The Township Engineer shall
determine the present-worth equivalents, which shall be subject to
the approval of the governing body.
D. The general formula for calculating the annual inspection fee shall
be as follows:
ITi x IR x Ni = ICi
ICi + ICii + . . . = IC
§ 26-163 MANCHESTER CODE § 26-165
FWD:720
.25 (IC) = AC
IC + AC = Annual Inspection Cost
Where:
ITi = Inspection time per SWM BMP (varies per BMP).
IR = Inspection rate (varies per year).
Ni = Quantity of particular SWM BMP.
ICi = Inspection cost for particular SWM BMP.
IC = Total inspection cost of all SWM BMPs.
AC = Administrative cost.

be imposed, levied or payable until the date of the determination of a
violation by the District Justice. If the defendant neither pays nor timely
appeals the judgment, the Township may enforce the judgment
pursuant to the applicable rules of civil procedure. Each day that a
violation continues shall constitute a separate violation, unless the
District Justice determining that there has been a violation further
determines that there has been a good-faith basis for the person,
partnership or corporation violating this Part to have believed that
there was no such violation, in which event there shall be deemed to
have been only one such violation. The Court of Common Pleas, upon
petition, may grant an order of stay, upon cause shown, tolling the perdiem
judgment pending a final adjudication of the violation and
judgment.

the time of connection.
B. A person is considered to be in violation of this Part if the person
connects a line conveying sewage to the MS4 or allows such a
connection to continue.
1. Suspension Due to illicit discharges in emergency situations. The
Township may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a
person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or
threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and
substantial danger to the environment or to the health or welfare of
persons or to the MS4 or waters of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
or the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension
order issued in an emergency, the Township may take such steps as
deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or waters
of the United States or to minimize danger to persons, including,
without limitation, entering onto property for the purpose of
disconnecting and/or performing emergency maintenance or repairs to
storm sewers. In the event that the Township must disconnect or
perform emergency maintenance and/or repairs, the Township may file
and attach a municipal lien on the property which is causing the illicit
discharge.
2. Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge or illicit connection.
Any person discharging to the MS4 in violation of this Part may have
their MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce
an illicit discharge or illicit connection. The Township will notify a

premises terminated pursuant to this section without the prior approval
of the township.
1. Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that have stormwater
discharges associated with industrial activity, including construction
activity.
2. Access to Facilities.
A. The Township shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities
subject to regulation under this Part as often as may be necessary
to determine compliance with this Part. If a discharger has security
measures in force which require proper identification and
clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make
the necessary arrangements to allow access to representatives of
the Township.
B. Facility operators shall allow the Township ready access to all parts
of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling,
examination and copying of records that must be kept under the
conditions of an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater and the
performance of any additional duties as defined by state and
federal law.
C. The Township shall have the right to set up on any permitted
facility such devices as are necessary, in the opinion of the
authorized enforcement agency, to conduct monitoring and/or
sampling of the facility's stormwater discharge.
D. The Township has the right to require the discharger to install
monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and
monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and
proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense.

§ 26-310. Requirement to Prevent, Control, and Reduce Stormwater
Pollutants by the Use of Best Management Practices. [Ord. 2005-11,
11/9/2005]
The Township will adopt requirements identifying best management
practices for any activity, operation or facility which may cause or
contribute to pollution or contamination of stormwater, the storm drain
system or waters of the United States. The owner or operator of a
commercial or industrial establishment shall provide, at his/her own
expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge of prohibited
materials or other wastes into the municipal storm drain system or
watercourses through the use of these structural and nonstructural BMP's.
Further, any person responsible for a property or premise which is or may
be the source of an illicit discharge may be required to implement, at said
person's expense, additional structural and nonstructural BMP's to prevent
the further discharge of pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer
system. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit
authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial activity,
to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance with the provisions of
this section. These BMP's shall be part of a stormwater pollution prevention
plan (SWPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES
permit.
§ 26-311. Watercourse Protection. [Ord. 2005-11, 11/9/2005]

person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within
the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation and other obstacles
removed by the operator at the written or oral request of Township
and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall
be borne by the operator.
F. Unreasonable delays in allowing Township access to a permitted
facility is a violation of a stormwater discharge permit and of this
Part. A person who is the operator of a facility with an NPDES
permit to discharge stormwater associated with industrial activity
commits an offense if the person denies the Township reasonable
access to the permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any
activity authorized or required by this Part.
G. If the Township has been refused access to any part of the premises
from which stormwater is discharged and it is able to demonstrate
probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this Part
or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine
inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance
with this Part or any order issued hereunder or to protect the
overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the
Township may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of
competent jurisdiction.
§ 26-309 MANCHESTER CODE § 26-311
FWD:738
that would pollute, contaminate or significantly retard the flow of water
through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain
existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse
so that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function or
physical integrity of the watercourse.
§ 26-312. Notification of Spills. [Ord. 2005-11, 11/9/2005]
Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person
responsible for a facility or operation or responsible for emergency
response for a facility or operation has information of any known or
suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in an
illicit discharge or pollutants discharging into stormwater, the storm drain
system or water of the United States, said person shall take all necessary
steps to ensure the discovery, containment and cleanup of such release.
In the event of such a release of hazardous materials, said person shall
immediately notify, emergency response agencies of the occurrence via
emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of nonhazardous
materials, said person shall notify the Township, in person or by phone
or facsimile, no later than the next business day. Notifications in person
or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed
to the Township within three business days of the phone notice. If the
discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or industrial
establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall also retain
an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent
its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three years.
§ 26-313. Enforcement. [Ord. 2005-11, 11/9/2005]
1. Notice of Violation. Whenever the Township finds that a person has
violated a prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this Part, the
Township may order compliance by written notice of violation to the
responsible person. Such notice may require, without limitation:
A. The performance of monitoring, analyses and reporting.
B. The elimination of illicit connections or illicit discharges.
C. That violating discharges, practices or operations shall cease and
desist.
D. The abatement or remediation of stormwater pollution or
contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected property.

established deadline, the work will be done by a designated
governmental agency or a contractor, and the expense thereof shall be
charged to the violator or assessed as a municipal lien on the property.
1. Within 30 days after abatement of the violation, the owner of the
property will be notified of the cost of abatement, including
administrative costs. The property owner may thereafter file a written
protest objecting to the amount of the assessment within 30 days. If the

decision of the municipal authority or by the expiration of the time in
which to file an appeal, the charges shall become a special assessment
against the property and shall constitute a municipal lien on the
property for the amount of the assessment.
2. Any person violating any of the provisions of this Part shall become
liable to the Township by reason of such violation. The liability shall be
paid in not more than 12 equal payments. Interest at the rate of 12%
per annum shall be assessed on the balance beginning on the first day
following discovery of the violation.

A-OPEN SPACE RESIDENTIAL-AGRICULTURAL DISTRICT
§ 27-301. Purpose. [Ord. 1996-1, 1/23/1996, § 300]
The purpose of the Open Space Residential-Agricultural District is to
permit, protect, and encourage the continued use of the land therein for
agricultural uses while also permitting residential development that results
in an enhanced living environment through the preservation of open space.
The provisions set forth encourage innovative and livable housing
environments within residential districts through both permanent
dedication of open space and planned reduction of individual lot area
requirements. The overall density remains the same as would be found in a
traditional development.
§ 27-302. Objectives. [Ord. 1996-1, 1/23/1996, § 301]

In the A district, it shall be unlawful to subdivide a parcel of land of 15 acres
or greater into parcels, any one of which is less than 15 acres, for residential
use, except for development as open space residential development. In
addition, open space development may occur on smaller tracts as allowed
by § 27-309.
1. The following objectives shall be considered in the review of any
application for development in an A-Agricultural District.
A. To provide for more environmentally sensitive residential
development by preserving the natural character of open fields,
stands of trees, ponds, streams, hills and similar natural features.
B. To provide a more efficient and aesthetic use of developable land by
allowing developers to reduce lot sizes while maintaining the
residential density required in the underlying zoning district.
C. To assure the permanent preservation of open space, rural lands
and natural resources.
D. To allow a more flexible and cost-effective residential layout and
street design.
E. To minimize potential adverse impacts from new residential
development on adjacent subdivisions and properties devoted to
agricultural uses.

Hearing Board that the resulting open space would serve a useful
function.
B. Utility Requirements. Public water and sewer are required to serve
an open space development.
2. Design Standards.
A. Density Requirements. The maximum number of dwelling units
permitted using open space design shall be determined by using
the following formula:
Maximum number of dwelling units = net tract area divided by
43,560 square feet.
The net tract area shall be calculated using the following formula:
Total tract area
 existing road
 50% of environmentally sensitive areas (floodplains,
wetlands, slopes > 15%)
 10% of total tract area (for future roads and
stormwater management facilities)
= Net Tract Area
B. Lot Area Requirements.
(1) Minimum lot area: 20,000 square feet.
(2) Minimum lot width: 100 feet at the lot frontage, and if along
the turnaround of a cul-de-sac, 80 feet at the lot frontage.
(3) Minimum lot depth: 150 feet.
C. Setback Requirements.
(1) Minimum Front Setback: 30 feet except when along major and
minor arterial type roadways as designated and set forth in the

or along a hedgerow or stand of trees.
(2) In locations least likely to block or interrupt scenic vistas or
view sheds, as seen from a public roadway.
§ 27-309 FOREWORD § 27-309
FWD:777
E. Dwelling Placement. Dwelling placement to the greatest extent
possible shall be planned to screen homes from off-site vantage
points, away from environmentally-sensitive areas, existing
agricultural uses, sites suitable for open space, and upwind from
areas subject to land management practices that will cause dust,
noise, smoke, odors, or similar problems. Strict geometric layout of
lots shall be avoided to the greatest extent possible and the layout
shall be designed to maximize open space access for each lot as
required by Subsection 3C.
3. Open Space.
A. Minimum Requirements.
(1) Within an open space residential development, a minimum of
45% of the parcel must remain in open space.
(2) No more than 50% of the open space shall be comprised of
wetlands, surface water bodies, floodplains, areas of slope >
15%, or detention basins.
(3) The following areas shall not be calculated as open space:
(a) Areas devoted to public or private streets or rights-of-way,
or any land that has been or is to be conveyed to a public
agency.
(b) Private yards or minimum required spacing between
buildings.
(4) A minimum of 50% of the open space must be shaped so as to
be usable for active or passive recreation or agriculture.

two acres. Developers are encouraged to set aside large
parcels of open space lands and should submit sketch plans of
proposed open space development to the Manchester
Township Planning Commission.
(6) Required open space must be in the form of large contiguous
tracts, with corridors for walkways connecting larger tracts or
parks adjacent to the open space parcel. There shall be no
more than three non-contiguous required open space areas,
except when provided in addition to the minimum required
open space.
B. In general, the required open space to be set aside shall attempt to
preserve natural areas such as wetlands, streams, scenic views,
woodlands, hedgerows, fence lines and similar areas.
C. Access to Open Space. All lots for dwelling units shall either abut
directly on open space or shall be located within 500 feet of access
to open space, if pedestrian access, such as sidewalks, is provided

may be dedicated partially or entirely to public use. The Board of
Supervisors may request the dedication of any common open space
land for public use. However, the Board of Supervisors, at its sole
discretion, shall also have the right to not accept any dedication of
open space. When common open space is not dedicated and
accepted for public use, it shall be protected by legal
arrangements, satisfactory to the Township, sufficient to assure its
maintenance and preservation for whatever purpose it is intended.
Covenants or other legal arrangements shall:
(1) Oblige purchasers to participate in a homeowners association
and to support maintenance of the open areas by paying to the
association assessment sufficient for such maintenance and
subjecting their properties to a line for enforcement of
payment of the respective assessments.
(2) Obligate such an association to maintain the open areas and
private streets and utilities.
(3) Empower the Township, as well as other purchasers in the
development, to enforce the covenants in the event of failure or
compliance.
(4) Provide for agreement that, if the Township is required to
perform any maintenance work pursuant to the item above,
such purchasers would pay the cost thereof and that the same
shall be a lien, upon their properties until such cost has been
paid; provided that the developer shall be responsible for the
formation of the homeowners association of which the
developer, or if the developer is not the owner of the
development, then such owner, shall be a member until all of
the lots of record are sold. Other equivalent provisions to
assure adequate perpetual maintenance may be permitted if
approved by the Board of Supervisors. Assurance that such
covenants or equivalent provisions will be included in the
deeds or other instruments or conveyance shall be evidenced
by the recordation in the Office of Recorder of Deeds, of a
perpetual declaration regarding maintenance of facilities as
prescribed hereinabove and identifying the tract and each lot
therein. The declaration shall be included in the deed or other
instrument of conveyance of each lot of record and shall be
made binding on all purchasers, provided that such declaration
may, as to subsequent conveyances other than the initial
conveyance of each lot of record, be incorporated by reference
in the instrument of conveyance.
§ 27-309 FOREWORD § 27-309
FWD:779
(5) Guarantee that any association formed to own and maintain
common open space will not be dissolved without the consent
of the Board of Supervisors and any other specifications
deemed necessary by the Board of Supervisors.
(6) The Township will require that a landscape plan/maintenance
plan for open space be submitted along with the preliminary
plan. The landscape plan/maintenance plan will be prepared
and maintained by the developer until 51% of the lots have
been developed, after which time the landscape plan/
maintenance plan will be the responsibility of the homeowners
association.
Such covenants or equivalent legal arrangements shall be
submitted for preliminary review with the preliminary plan and
shall be reviewed and approved by the Board of Supervisors
prior to the granting of final plan approval.
E. Future Development of Open Space. Future development,
subdivision, or sale of the required open space is prohibited.
F. Use of Open Space.
(1) Use of open space may include recreation equipment,
pavilions, benches, paths and walkways, athletic fields,
farming, passive agricultural activities, woodlands, game
preserves and similar uses.
(2) Any structure or building accessory to recreation,
conservation, or agriculture may be erected within the
dedicated open space, subject to the approved open space
plan. The accessory structures or buildings shall not exceed, in
the aggregate, 1% of the required open space area.
(3) Residential accessory structures, such as sheds, garages,
fences, etc., or any commercial use shall not be permitted in
the open space area.
4. Perimeter Greenbelts. A perimeter greenbelt shall be encouraged
around any parcel of land developed with open space development in
order to separate developments and to preserve views. However, in
order to encourage flexibility and to preserve large blocks of non-linear
open space, the extent and width of such greenbelt shall be determined
after consultation with the Manchester Township Planning Commission.
Developers submitting open space development plans are strongly
encouraged to submit sketch plans and to consult with the Manchester
Township Planning Commission and staff prior to formally submitting a
preliminary plan. Items to be considered in determining the nature,
extent, and width of any perimeter greenbelt shall include, but not be
limited to, topography, adjoining land uses, and development potential
of adjacent tracts. In no event, however, shall a perimeter greenbelt
consist of more than 30% of the required open space.

5. Age Restricted Housing. If all dwellings within an open space
residential development are limited to "age restricted housing," then
the minimum lot area shall be reduced to 12,000 square feet, the
minimum lot width shall be reduced to 80 feet, the minimum depth shall
be reduced to 120 feet, and the maximum number of dwelling units
allowed within the development shall be increased by 20%. [Ord.

§ 27-405 MANCHESTER CODE § 27-409
FWD:784
A. Minimums Parcel Size-15 Acres. Residential development of
parcels of 15 acres or greater in size must be done pursuant to the
standards of this section. In addition, open space development is
allowed as an optional form of residential development on a parcel
of greater than five but less than 15 acres if special exception
approval is granted, and if the applicant proves to the Zoning
Hearing Board that the resulting open space would serve a useful
function.
B. Utility Requirements. Public water and sewer are required to serve
an open space development.
2. Design Standards.
A. Density Requirements. The maximum number of dwelling units
permitted using open space design shall be determined by using
the following formula:
Maximum number of dwelling units = net tract area divided by
20,000 square feet.
The net tract area shall be calculated using the following formula:
Total tract area
 existing road
 50% of environmentally sensitive areas (floodplains,
wetlands, slopes > 15%)
 10% of total tract area (for future roads and
stormwater management facilities)
= Net Tract Area
B. Lot Area Requirements.
(1) Minimum lot area: 12,500 square feet.
(2) Minimum lot width: 80 feet at the lot frontage, and if along the
turnaround of a cul-de-sac, 60 feet at the lot frontage.
(3) Minimum lot depth: 125 feet.
C. Setback Requirements.
(1) Minimum Front Setback. Thirty feet except when along major
and minor arterial type roadways as designated and set forth in

setback shall be 50 feet.
(2) Minimum Side Setback. Ten feet. There shall be two side yards.
(3) Minimum Rear Setback. Thirty feet. There shall be a rear yard.
D. Location of Lots. To the greatest extent feasible, residential lots
shall be laid out according to the following:
§ 27-409 FOREWORD § 27-409
FWD:785
(1) In the least visible areas, such as at the far end of a long field
or along a hedgerow or stand of trees.
(2) In locations least likely to block or interrupt scenic vistas or
view sheds, as seen from a public roadway.
E. Dwelling Placement. Dwelling placement to the greatest extent
possible shall be planned to screen homes from off-site vantage
points, away from environmentally-sensitive areas, existing
agricultural uses, sites suitable for open space, and upwind from
areas subject to land management practices that will cause dust,
noise, smoke, odors, or similar problems. Strict geometric layout of
lots shall be avoided to the greatest extent possible and the layout
shall be designed to maximize open space access for each lot as
required by Subsection 3C.
3. Open Space.
A. Minimum Requirements.
(1) Within an open space residential development, a minimum of
35% of the parcel must remain in open space.
(2) No more than 50% of the required open space shall be
comprised of wetlands, surface water bodies, floodplains,
areas of slope > 15%, or detention basins.
(3) The following areas shall not be calculated as open space:
(a) Areas devoted to public or private streets or rights-of-way,
or any land that has been or is to be conveyed to a public
agency.

two acres. Developers are encouraged to set aside large
parcels of open space lands and should submit sketch plans of
proposed open space development to the Manchester
Township Planning Commission.
(6) Required open space must be in the form of large contiguous
tracts, with corridors for walkways connecting larger tracts or
parks adjacent to the open space parcel. There shall be no
more than three non-contiguous required open space areas,
except when provided in addition to the minimum required
open space.
§ 27-409 MANCHESTER CODE § 27-409
FWD:786
B. In general, the required open space to be set aside shall attempt to
preserve natural areas such as wetlands, streams, scenic views,
woodlands, hedgerows fence lines, and similar areas.
C. Access to Open Space. All lots for dwelling units shall either abut
directly on open space or shall be located within 500 feet of access
to open space, if pedestrian access, such as sidewalks, is provided
from such lots directly to the required open space. Accessibility
shall meet the needs of handicapped and older citizens. Pedestrian
access ways from the street to interior open space areas shall be no

open space. When common open space is not dedicated and
accepted for public use, it shall be protected by legal
arrangements, satisfactory to the Township, sufficient to assure its
maintenance and preservation for whatever purpose it is intended.
Covenants or other legal arrangements shall:
(1) Oblige purchasers to participate in a homeowners association
and to support maintenance of the open areas by paying to the
association assessment sufficient for such maintenance and
subjecting their properties to a lien for enforcement of
payment of the respective assessments.
(2) Obligate such an association to maintain the open areas and
private streets and utilities.
(3) Empower the Township, as well as other purchasers in the
development, to enforce the covenants in the event of failure or
compliance.
(4) Provide for agreement that, if the township is required to
perform any maintenance work pursuant to the item above,
such purchasers would pay the cost thereof and that the same
shall be a lien upon their properties until such cost has been
paid; provided that the developer shall be responsible for the
formation of the homeowners association of which the
developer, or if the developer is not the owner of the
development, then such owner, shall be a member until all of
the lots of record are sold. Other equivalent provisions to
assure adequate perpetual maintenance may be permitted if
approved by the Board of Supervisors. Assurance that such
covenants or equivalent provisions will be included in the
deeds or other instruments of conveyance shall be evidenced
by the recordation in the Office of Recorder of Deeds, of a
perpetual declaration regarding maintenance of facilities as
§ 27-409 FOREWORD § 27-409
FWD:787
prescribed hereinabove and identifying the tract and each lot
therein. The declaration shall be included in the deed or other
instrument of conveyance of each lot of record and shall be
made binding on all purchasers, provided that such declaration
may, as to subsequent conveyances other than the initial
conveyance of each lot of record, be incorporated by reference
in the instrument of conveyance.
(5) Guarantee that any association formed to own and maintain
common open space will not be dissolved without the consent
of the Board of Supervisors and any other specifications
deemed necessary by the Board of Supervisors.
(6) The Township will require that a landscape plan/maintenance
plan for open space be submitted along with the preliminary
plan. The landscape plan/maintenance plan will be prepared
and maintained by the developer until 51% of the lots have
been developed, after which time the landscape plan/
maintenance plan will be the responsibility of the homeowners
association.
Such covenants or equivalent legal arrangements shall be
submitted for preliminary review with the preliminary plan and
shall be reviewed and approved by the Board of Supervisors
prior to the granting of final plan approval.
E. Future Development of Open Space. Future development,
subdivision, or sale of the required open space is prohibited.
F. Use of Open Space.
(1) Use of open space may include recreation equipment,
pavilions, benches, paths and walkways, athletic fields,
farming, passive agricultural activities, woodlands, game
preserves and similar uses.
(2) Any structure or building accessory to recreation,
conservation, or agriculture may be erected within the
dedicated open space, subject to the approved open space
plan. The accessory structures or buildings shall not exceed, in
the aggregate, 1% of the required open space area.
(3) Residential accessory structures, such as sheds, garages,
fences, etc., or any commercial use shall not be permitted in
the open space area.
4. Perimeter Greenbelts. A perimeter greenbelt shall be encouraged
around any parcel of land developed with open space development in
order to separate developments and to preserve views. However, in
order to encourage flexibility and to preserve large blocks of non-linear
open space, the extent and width of such greenbelt shall be determined
after consultation with the Manchester Township Planning Commission.
§ 27-409 MANCHESTER CODE § 27-409
FWD:788
Developers submitting open space development plans are strongly
encouraged to submit sketch plans and to consult with the Manchester
Township Planning Commission and staff prior to formally submitting
a preliminary plan. Items to be considered in determining the nature,
extent, and width of any perimeter greenbelt shall include, but not be
limited to, topography, adjoining land uses, and development potential
of adjacent tracts. In no event, however, shall a perimeter greenbelt
consist of more than 30% of the required open space.
5. Age Restricted Housing. If all dwellings within an open space
residential development are limited to "age restricted housing," then
the minimum lot area shall be reduced to 10,000 square feet, the
minimum lot width shall be reduced to 70 feet, the minimum depth shall
be reduced to 110 feet, and the maximum number of dwelling units
allowed within the development shall be increased by 20%.

RM-OPEN SPACE RESIDENTIAL; MEDIUM DENSITY DISTRICT
§ 27-501. Purpose. [Ord. 1996-1, 1/23/1996, § 500]
The purpose of the RM-M Medium Density Residential District is to permit
residential development that results in an enhanced living environment
through the preservation of open space. The provisions set forth encourage
innovative and livable housing environments within residential district
through both permanent dedication of open space and a planned reduction
of individual lot area requirements. The overall density remains the same as
would be found in a traditional development.
§ 27-502. Objectives. [Ord. 1996-1, 1/23/1996, § 501]
§ 27-503. Area of Application. [Ord. 1996-1, 1/23/1996, § 502]

as amended by Ord. 2005-12, 12/13/2005, § 1, Part 8]
In the RM-Medium Density Residential District, it shall be unlawful to
subdivide a parcel of land of 10 acres or greater into parcels, any one of
which is less than 10 acres, for residential use, except for development as
open space residential development. In addition, open space development
may occur on smaller tracts as allowed by § 27-509.
1. The following objectives shall be considered in the review of any
application for development in an RM-Medium Density Residential
District:
A. To provide for more environmentally sensitive residential
development by preserving the natural character of open fields,
stands of trees, ponds, streams, hills and similar natural features.
B. To provide a more efficient and aesthetic use of developable land by
allowing developers to reduce lot sizes while maintaining the
residential density required in the underlying zoning district.
C. To assure the permanent preservation of open space, rural lands,
and natural resources.
D. To allow a more flexible and cost-effective residential layout and
street design.
E. To minimize potential adverse impacts from new residential
development on adjacent subdivisions and properties devoted to
agricultural uses.

FP-FLOODPLAIN DISTRICT
§ 27-1001. General Provisions. [Ord. 1996-1, 1/23/1996; as added by
Ord. 2009-01, 7/14/2009, § 3]
1. Purposes. The purpose of these provisions is to prevent the loss of
property and life, the creation of health and safety hazards, the
disruption of commerce and governmental services, the extraordinary
and unnecessary expenditure of public funds for flood protection and
relief, and the impairment of the tax base by:
A. Regulating uses, activities, and development which, acting alone or
in combination with other existing or future uses, activities and
development, will cause unacceptable increases in flood heights,
velocities and frequencies.
B. Restricting or prohibiting certain uses, activities, and development
from locating within areas subject to flooding.
C. Requiring all those uses, activities, and developments that do occur
in flood-prone areas to be protected and/or flood proofed against
flood damage.
D. Protecting individuals from buying lands and structures which are
unsuited for intended purposes because of flood hazards.
2. Applicability. These provisions shall apply to all lands within the
jurisdiction of Manchester Township and shown on the Official Zoning
Map and the FEMA Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM) with an
effective date of September 25, 2009, as being located within the
boundaries of any floodplain district.
3. Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be used and no
structure shall be located, relocated, constructed, reconstructed,
enlarged, or structurally altered except in full compliance with the
terms and provisions of this Part and any other applicable ordinances
and regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this
chapter.
4. Warning and Disclaimer of Liability.
A. The degree of flood protection sought by the provisions of this
chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is
based on acceptable engineering methods of study. Larger floods
may occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by
man-made or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings
restricted by debris. This chapter does not imply that areas outside
the floodplain districts will be free from flooding or flood damages.
B. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of Manchester
Township or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages

that result from reliance on this Part or any administrative decision
lawfully made there under.
1. Overlay Concept.
A. The FP-Floodplain District shall be an overlay to the existing
underlying districts as shown on the Official Zoning Map and, as
such, the provisions for the floodplain district shall serve as a
supplement to the underlying district provisions.
B. Where there happens to be any conflict between the provisions or
requirements of the FP-Floodplain District and those of any
underlying district the more restrictive provisions and/or those
pertaining to the floodplain district shall apply.
C. In the event any provision concerning a FP-Floodplain District is
declared inapplicable as a result of any legislative or administrative
actions or judicial discretion, the basic underlying district
provisions shall remain applicable.
2. Zoning Map. The boundaries of the FP-Floodplain Districts are
established as shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map, Panels

and made a part of the Official Zoning Map of Manchester Township as
amended. A copy of said maps shall be kept on file at the offices of the
Township and be available for inspection at any time.
3. District Boundary Changes. The delineation of any of the floodplain
districts may be revised by the Board of Supervisors where natural or
man-made changes have occurred and/or more detailed studies
conducted or undertaken by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the
Susquehanna River Basin Commission or other qualified agency or
individual documents the advisability for such change. However, prior
to any such change, approval must be obtained from the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
4. Interpretation of District Boundaries. Initial interpretations of the
boundaries of the FP-Floodplain District shall be made by the Zoning
Officer. Should a dispute arise concerning the boundary of the district,
the Zoning Hearing Board shall make the necessary determination. The
person questioning or contesting the location of the district boundary
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present his case to the Board
and to submit his own technical evidence if he so desires.

by Ord. 2010-11, 10/12/2010, § 2]
1. Purpose.
A. The purpose of these provisions is to limit the height of any
structure or vegetation so as not to obstruct the airspace of any
airport that has been determined to be located so that the airport's
overlay zones as determined by the Federal Aviation Administration
(FAA) fall onto lands within Manchester Township.
B. Mandated by Pennsylvania Law, Act 1984-64, Airport Zoning Act,
74 Pa.C.S.A. § 5911 et seq.
2. Applicability.
A. These provisions shall apply to all lands of Manchester Township
that have been determined to be within 9,000 feet of the Lazy B
Ranch airport located along the east side of Bull Road in Conewago
Township at Latitude = 40° 01'21- 346", Longitude = -76° 48'
59-890".
B. These provisions shall be an overlay and shall not affect the
primary function or provisions of existing, underlying zoning
districts.
3. Compliance.
A. Notwithstanding any height regulation dictated by the underlying
zoning district.
(1) No structure maybe constructed to a height greater than 100
feet from ground level or to a height, with a final elevation of or

2010-11, 10/12/2010, § 2]
5. Disclaimer of Liability. This chapter shall not create liability on
Manchester Township or any officer or employee thereof from any
damage that results from reliance on this chapter or any administrative
decision lawfully made thereunder.
1. As regulated by Act 164 and defined by 14 CFR, Part 77.13(a) (as
amended or replaced), any person who plans to erect a new structure,
to add to an existing structure, or to erect and maintain any object
(natural or man-made) that is greater than 100 feet above the existing
ground elevation or with a final elevation of or greater than 650 feet
above sea level, in the vicinity of the airport, shall first notify the
Pennsylvania Department of Transportation's Bureau of Aviation (BOA)
by submitting PennDOT Form AV-57 to obtain an obstruction review of
the proposal at least 30 days prior to commencement thereof. The BOA
response must be included with the building permit application as
required in Chapter 4 of the Manchester Township Code of Ordinances
for the application to be considered complete.
A. If the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation's BOA returns a
determination of no penetration of airspace, the permit request
should be considered in compliance with the intent of this Part.
B. If the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation's BOA returns a
determination of a penetration of airspace, the permit shall be
denied; and,
(1) The project sponsor may seek a variance from such regulations
as outlined in § 27-10A03.
1. Any request for a variance shall include documentation in compliance
with 14 CFR, Part 77, Subpart B (FAA Form 7460-1 as amended or
replaced). Determinations of whether to grant a variance will depend
on the determinations made by the FAA and the Pennsylvania
Department of Transportation's BOA as to the effect of the proposal on
the operation of air navigation facilities and the safe, efficient use of
navigable air space. In particular, the request for a variance shall
consider which of the following categories the FAA has placed the
proposed construction in:
A. No Objection. The subject construction is determined not to exceed
obstruction standards and marking/lighting is not required to
mitigate potential hazard. Under this determination a variance
shall be granted.

Ord. 2010-11, 10/12/2010, § 2]
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Part, no use shall be made
of land or water within the Airport District Overlay in such a manner
as to create electrical interference with navigational signals or radio
communications between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for pilots
to distinguish between airport lights and others, impair visibility in the
vicinity of the airport, create bird strike hazards or otherwise endanger or
interfere with the landing, takeoff or maneuvering of aircraft utilizing the
airport.

Any permit or variance granted pursuant to the provisions of this Part may
be conditioned according to the process described in § 27-10A03 to require
the owner of the structure or object of natural growth in question to permit
the municipality, at its own expense, or require the person requesting
B. Conditional Determination. The proposed construction/alteration is
determined to create some level of encroachment into an airport
hazard area, which can be effectively mitigated. Under this
determination, a variance shall be granted contingent upon
implementation of mitigating measures as described in § 27-10A06,
"Obstruction Marking and Lighting."
C. Objectionable. The proposed construction/alteration is determined
to be a hazard and is thus objectionable. A variance shall be denied
and the reasons for this determination shall be outlined to the
applicant. Such requests for variances shall be granted where it is
duly found that a literal application or enforcement of the
regulations will result in unnecessary hardship and that relief
granted will not be contrary to the public interest, will not create a
hazard to air navigation, will do substantial justice, and will be in
accordance with the intent of this Part.
1. The regulations prescribed by this chapter shall not be construed to
require the removal, lowering, or other change or alteration of any
structure or tree not conforming to the regulations as of the effective
date of this Part, or otherwise interfere with the continuance of a nonconforming
use.
A. No non-conforming use shall be structurally altered or permitted to
grow higher, so as to increase the non-conformity, and a nonconforming
use, once substantially abated (subject to the
underlying zoning ordinance), may only be reestablished consistent
with the provisions herein.

section shall not apply to a building or building addition that the
Zoning Officer knows was built after 1940. The applicant may
§ 27-1122 FOREWORD § 27-1123
FWD:843
provide evidence to the Zoning Officer that a building was built
after 1940.
B. For a building regulated by this section, all of the provisions of the
applicable underlying zoning district shall also continue to apply, in
addition to the provisions of this section. In the event there is a
direct conflict between the provisions of section and the underlying
zoning district, the provision that is most restrictive upon
development, demolition and uses shall apply.
3. General Provisions.
A. Any partial or complete demolition of a building regulated by this
section that is visible from a public street shall only occur in
compliance with this section.
B. The list of historic buildings may be adopted and revised by the
Board of Supervisors as a zoning ordinance amendment.
C. Definitions. In addition to the definitions provided in § 27-105, the
following terms shall have the following meanings for the purposes
of this section:
DEMOLITION  The dismantling, tearing down, removal or razing
of the exterior of a building, in whole or in part. This term shall
not include changes to the interior of a building, provided such
changes do not alter the structural integrity of the building.
DEMOLITION BY NEGLECT  The absence of routine
maintenance and repair which leads to structural weakness, decay
and deterioration in a building to a point that causes a need for
major repair or may cause a need for demolition.
MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR  Work that does not alter the
appearance or harm the stability of exterior features of a building.
STREETSCAPE  The overall appearance of a block along a public
street, including yards visible from a public street, the relationship
of building setbacks, the consistency of architectural styles or
features, the spacing and shapes of windows and doors and
rooflines and similar features that give the block its distinctive
visual character.
4. Approval of Demolition of Building Regulated by this Section.
A. A building regulated by this section shall not be demolished, in
whole or in part, unless the applicant proves by credible evidence
to the satisfaction of the Zoning Hearing Board as a special
exception use that one or more of the following conditions exists:
(1) The existing building cannot feasibly and reasonably be
reused, and that such situation is not the result of intentional
neglect or demolition by neglect by the owner.
§ 27-1123 MANCHESTER CODE § 27-1123
FWD:844
(2) The denial of the demolition would result in unreasonable
economic hardship to the owner, and the hardship was not selfcreated.
(3) The demolition is necessary to allow a project to occur that will
have substantial, special and unusual public benefit that would
greatly outweigh the loss of the building regulated by section,
and the project needs to occur at this location. For example, a
demolition may be needed for a necessary expansion of an
existing public building or to allow a street improvement that is
necessary to alleviate a public safety hazard.
(4) The existing building has no historical or architectural
significance and the demolition will not adversely impact a
surrounding historic village. To meet this condition, the
applicant may present information concerning the proposed
design of any replacement building or use to show that the
proposed building or use will result in a net improvement to
the streetscape.
B. For approval of a demolition, the standards of this section shall
apply in place of the special exception use standards of Part 12. In
reviewing the application, the Zoning Hearing Board shall consider
the following:
(1) The effect of the demolition on the historical significance,
streetscape and architectural integrity of neighboring historic
buildings and on the historic character of the surrounding
neighborhood.
(2) The feasibility of other alternatives to demolition.
C. An application for partial or complete demolition of a building
regulated by this section shall not be approved unless all of the
requirements of this section have been met. A partial demolition
shall include, but not be limited to: removal of an attached porch
roof, removal of porch columns and removal of architectural
features. See definition of "demolition" above.
D. A complete application for the demolition shall be submitted by the
applicant in writing. This application shall include the following:
(1) The name, address and daytime telephone number of the
owner of record and the applicant for the demolition.
(2) Recent exterior photographs of the building proposed for
demolition. If the applicant is alleging that the building cannot
be reused or rehabilitated, then interior photos and floor plans
shall be provided as needed to support the applicant's claim.
(3) A site plan drawn to scale showing existing buildings and the
proposed demolition.
§ 27-1123 FOREWORD § 27-1123

2. Powers. The Zoning Hearing Board shall have the following powers:
A. To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any
order, requirement, decision, determination or interpretation made
by an administrative official in the enforcement of this chapter or of
any ordinance adopted pursuant thereto and to determine what is a
"reasonable accommodation" of a person with a disability pursuant
to the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 and the Pennsylvania
Human Relations Act when the Zoning Officer is unable to make a
determination.
B. To hear and decide special exceptions which may be authorized in
this chapter by the Board of Supervisors. In addition to the express
standards and criteria stated in this chapter, the Zoning Hearing
Board may attach such reasonable conditions and safeguards to an
§ 27-1608 MANCHESTER CODE § 27-1608
FWD:930
approval as it may deem necessary to ensure that the approval is
consistent with the purposes and intent of this chapter.
C. The Board shall bear requests for variances where it is alleged that
the provisions of this chapter inflict unnecessary hardship upon the
applicant. The Board may by rule prescribe the form of application
and may require preliminary application to the Zoning Officer. The
board may grant a variance, provided that all of the following
findings are made where relevant in a given case:
(1) That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity, narrowness or shallowness of lot size or
shape, or exceptional topographical or other physical
conditions peculiar to the particular property and that the
unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions and not the
circumstances or conditions generally created by the
provisions of this chapter in the neighborhood or district in
which the property is located.
(2) That because of such physical circumstances or conditions,
there is no possibility that the property can be developed in
strict conformity with the provisions of this chapter and that
the authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to enable
the reasonable use of the property.
(3) That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
applicant.
(4) That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property
is located, nor substantially or permanently impair the
appropriate use or development of adjacent property, nor be
detrimental to the public welfare.
(5) That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance that will afford relief and will represent the least
modification possible of the regulation in issue.
(6) In granting any variance, the board may attach such
reasonable conditions and safeguards as it may deem
necessary to implement the purpose of the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code and this chapter.
(7) All applications for use variance shall be referred to the
Planning Commission by the Zoning Hearing Board with the
direction that the Planning Commission shall make a study
thereof and recommendations to the Zoning Hearing Board
within 40 days from the date of the receipt of said application
by the Planning Commission.
D. In exercising the above-mentioned powers, the Zoning Hearing
Board may, in conformity with the provisions of this article, reverse
§ 27-1608 FOREWORD § 27-1608
FWD:931
or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify, the order, requirement,
decision or determination appealed from, and may make such
order, requirement, decision or determination as believed proper.
Notice of such decision shall forthwith be given to all parties in
interest.
E. All applications for special exceptions and variances shall be fully
reviewed by the Township Planning Commission except that the
Zoning Officer may waive this requirement when only a fence or
single family residential use is contemplated. The Planning
Commission shall issue a report to both the applicant and the
Zoning Hearing Board as evidence. Unless expressly characterized
as "permanent" in the Zoning Hearing Board's opinion, no special
exception or variance shall create a nonconforming use or extend
to anyone other than the person seeking such special exception or
variance and their heirs, successors, or assigns.
F. The fee for appeals and permits shall be set by the Board of
Supervisors by resolution.
G. Appeals from Zoning Hearing Board Rulings: Any person aggrieved
by any decision of the Zoning Hearing Board may, within 30 days
after such decision of the Zoning Hearing Board, appeal to the
Court of Common Pleas of the County.
H. The burden of proof in any appeal whether for a variance, special
exception or otherwise shall be on the appellant.
3. Appeals to the Zoning Hearing Board.
A. Appeals to the Zoning Hearing Board may be made by any person
or by any Township official or agency aggrieved or affected by any
decision of the Zoning Officer. Such appeal shall be taken within 30
days of the decision of the Zoning Officer by filing with the Zoning
Officer and with the Zoning Hearing Board a notice of appeal,
specifying the grounds thereof. The Zoning Officer shall forthwith
transmit to the Zoning Hearing Board all the papers constituting
the record upon which the action appealed from was taken. An
appeal shall state:
(1) The name and address of the appellant.
(2) The name and address of the owner of the real estate to be
affected by such proposed exception, of variance.
(3) A brief description and location of the real estate to be affected
by such proposed change.
(4) A statement of the present zoning classification of the real
estate in question, the improvements thereon and the present
use thereof.
§ 27-1608 MANCHESTER CODE § 27-1608
FWD:932
(5) A statement of the section of this chapter under which the
variance, or exception requested, may be allowed and reasons
why it should be granted.
B. An appeal to the Zoning Hearing Board shall stay all proceedings in
furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the Zoning Officer
certifies to the Zoning Hearing Board after the notice of appeal
shall have been filed, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate
a stay would in his opinion cause imminent peril to life and
property. In such a case proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise
than by a restraining order, which may be granted by the Zoning
Officer and for due cause shown.
C. Upon receiving an appeal, the Zoning Hearing Board shall fix a
reasonable time and place for a public hearing thereon and shall
give the notice thereof:
(1) By advertising at least one week before the hearing, at least
one time in a newspaper of general circulation within the
Township.
(2) By mailing due notice at least seven days prior to the date of
the hearing to the parties in interest.
(3) By giving due notice thereof to the Township Planning
Commission, the County Planning Agency, the Zoning Officer
and such other persons who make timely request for the
notice.
(4) In addition to the published notice, the Zoning Hearing Board
shall give notice of the hearing to the owners of all properties
lying within 200 feet of the property under consideration. This
notice shall be mailed to each property owner not less than
seven days in advance of the hearing and shall be made from
the list of property owners submitted by the person making the
appeal. The failure to notify as provided in this paragraph shall
not invalidate any recommendations adopted in the hearing; it
being the intent, so far as may be possible to provide due
notice to the persons substantially interested that the
application for appeal is pending.
D. The Zoning Hearing Board shall conduct a public hearing on such
appeal at which hearing any party may appear in person, or by
agent or attorney, and all of said parties so affected shall be given
an opportunity to be heard.
E. The Zoning Hearing Board shall decide the issue involved within 45
days after the hearing or continued hearing, it shall be deemed that
such Zoning Hearing Board has decided in favor of the person or
Township official aggrieved or affected who is seeking relief. All
actions of the Zoning Hearing Board shall be by resolution and a
§ 27-1608 FOREWORD § 27-1608
FWD:933
§ 27-1609. Variances. [Ord. 1996-1, 1/23/1996, § 1608]
copy shall be furnished to the parties in interest and the Zoning
Officer as a public record.
F. If the variance is granted or the issuance of a permit is approved, or
other action by the appellant is authorized, the necessary permit
shall be secured and the authorized action begun within six months
after the date when the variance is finally granted or the issuance
of a permit is finally approved or the other action by the appellant is
authorized. For good cause the Zoning Hearing Board may, upon
application in writing stating the reasons therefore grant an
additional six-month extension.
G. Should the appellant or applicant fail to obtain the necessary
permits within said twelve-month period, or having obtained the
permit should he fail to commence work thereunder within such
twelve-month period, it shall be conclusively presumed that the
appellant or applicant has waived, withdrawn, or abandoned his
appeal or his application, and all provisions, variances and permits
granted to him shall be deemed automatically rescinded by the
Zoning Hearing Board.
H. Should the appellant or applicant commence construction or
alteration within said twelve-month period, but should he fail to
complete such construction or alteration within said twelve-month
period, the Zoning Hearing Board may upon 10 days notice in
writing, rescind or revoke the granted variance, or the issuance of
the permit, or permits, or the other action authorized to the
appellant or application, if the Zoning Hearing Board finds that a
good cause appears for the failure to complete within such twelvemonth
period, and if the Zoning Hearing Board further finds that
conditions have so altered or changed in the interval since the
granting of the variance, permit or action, that revocation or
rescission of the action is justified.
1. Referral to Planning Commission. All applications for use variance shall
be referred to the Planning Commission by the Zoning Hearing Board
with the direction that the Planning Commission shall make a study
thereof and recommendations to the Board within 40 days from the
date of the receipt of said application by the Planning Commission.
2. Standards for Variances. Where there is unnecessary hardship, the
Board may grant a variance in the application of the provisions of this
chapter only if all of the following findings are made in writing, where
relevant in a given case:
A. There are unique physical circumstances or conditions, including:
(1) Irregularity, narrowness or shallowness of lot size or shape.
§ 27-1608 MANCHESTER CODE § 27-1609
FWD:934
§ 27-1610. Zoning Officer; Powers and Duties. [Ord. 1996-1, 1/23/
1996, § 1609]
(2) Exceptional topographical or other physical conditions
peculiar to the particular property.
(3) Unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions, and not the
circumstances or conditions generally created by the
provisions of this chapter in the neighborhood or district in
which the property is located.
B. That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, the
property cannot be reasonably used in strict conformity with
provisions of this chapter and that the authorization of a variance is
therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of the property.
C. That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
appellant.
D. That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is
located, nor substantially or permanently impair the appropriate
use or development of adjacent property, not be detrimental to the
public welfare.
E. That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance that will afford relief and will represent the least
modification of the regulation in issue.
3. Conditions. In granting any variance, the Board may attach such
reasonable conditions as it may deem necessary to implement the
purposes of this chapter.
1. Appointment and Powers of Zoning Officer. For the administration of
this chapter, a Zoning Officer, who may not hold any elective office in
the Township, shall be appointed. The Zoning Officer shall administer
this chapter in accordance with its literal terms and shall not have the
power to permit any construction or any use or change of use which
does not conform to this chapter. He issues all building permits, use
certificates, certificates of nonconformance and at the discretion of the
Zoning Hearing Board, special exceptions, and variances. The Zoning
Officer may identify and register nonconforming uses, structures and
lots, together with the reasons the Zoning Officer identified them as
nonconformities.
2. Forms. The Zoning Officer must provide a form or forms prepared by
the Township Solicitor for:
A. Building permits.
B. Special Exceptions.
C. Use Certificates.
§ 27-1609 FOREWORD § 27-1610

4. Action on Building Permits. Within 15 days, except for holidays, after
receipt of an application for a building permit, the Zoning Officer must
grant or refuse the permit. If the application conforms to the applicable
requirements of the Building Permit Ordinance [Chapter 4] and this
chapter, the Zoning Officer must grant a permit. If the permit is not
granted, he must state in writing the ground of his refusal.
5. Action on Use Certificates. Within 15 days, except for holidays, after
receipt of an application for a use certificate, the Zoning Officer must
grant or refuse the certificate. If the specifications and intended use
conforms in all respects with the provisions of this chapter, he must
issue a certificate to that effect. Otherwise, he must state in writing the
grounds of his refusal.
6. Violations. Upon determining that a violation of any of the provisions of
this chapter exists, the Zoning Officer shall serve written notice on the
person committing or permitting such violation by personal service or
registered mail that he shall cease and desist such violation within 30
days from the date of such notice. If said notice is not complied with and
no appeal is filed with the Zoning Hearing Board, the Zoning Officer or
other Township officer may take, in the name of the Township, any
appropriate action or proceeding at law or in equity to prevent,
restrain, correct or abate such violation or to require the removal or
termination of the unlawful use of the structure, building, sign, or land
in violation of the provisions of this chapter or of the order or direction
made pursuant thereto.
7. Records. The Zoning Officer must keep a record of:
A. All applications for building permits, use certificates, special

with any conditions imposed by the Zoning Hearing Board;

notice. In the case of an amendment other than that prepared by the
Township Planning Commission, the Board of Supervisors shall submit
each such amendment to the Township Planning Commission at least 30
days prior to the hearing on such proposed amendment to provide the
Township Planning Commission an opportunity to submit

additional residences likely to be constructed as a result of
such changes.
(c) Whether the proposed change is in accord with any
existing or proposed plans in the vicinity.
(d) The effect of the proposed amendment upon the growth of

than 60 days nor less than seven days prior to passage.
Publication of the proposed amendment shall include either
the full text thereof or the title and brief summary, prepared by

FWD:939
displacement of the use of any structure, building, sign, and/or land
without first obtaining a permit or the use of any building, structure,

or the failure to comply with any other provisions of this chapter, are
hereby declared to be violations of this chapter.
2. The Zoning Officer shall serve a written enforcement notice of violation
or order on the person, firm or corporation, or the owner, lessee or
agent of the land upon which the violation has occurred who has
committed the violation, and such order shall direct the discontinuance
of the illegal action or condition and the abatement of the violation.
However, in no case shall the person so served abandon the premises in
such a condition so as to create a hazard or menace to the public safety,
health, morals or welfare. Said premises shall be placed in such
condition as the Zoning Officer shall direct. An enforcement notice shall
state at least the following:
A. The name of the owner of record and any other person against

§ 27-1613 MANCHESTER CODE § 27-1613
FWD:940
In any case any building, structure, landscaping or land is, or
is proposed to be, erected, constructed, reconstructed, altered,
converted, maintained or used in violation of any ordinance
enacted under the PAMPC or prior enabling laws, the Supervisors
or, with the approval of the Supervisors, an officer of the township,
or any aggrieved owner or tenant of real property who shows
that his property or person will be substantially affected by the
alleged violation, in addition to other remedies, may institute any
appropriate action or proceeding to prevent, restrain, correct or
abate such building, structure, landscaping or land, or to prevent,
in or about such premises, any act, conduct, business or use
constituting a violation. When any such action is instituted by a
landowner or tenant, notice of that action shall be served upon the
Township at least 30 days prior to the time the action is begun
by serving a copy of the complaining on the Board of Supervisors
of Manchester Township. No such action may be maintained until
such notice has been given.
3. If the notice of violation is not complied with within a period of 30 days,
the Zoning Officer or other Township officer may take, in the name of
the Township, any appropriate action or proceeding at law or in equity
to prevent, restrain, correct or abate such violation or to require the
removal or termination of the unlawful use of the structure, building
sign, and/or land in violation of the provisions of this chapter or of the
order or direction made pursuant thereto.
4. Any person, partnership or corporation who or which has violated or
permitted the violation of the provisions of this chapter enacted under

being found liable therefor in civil enforcement proceeding commenced
by the Township, pay a judgment of not more than $500 plus all court
costs, including reasonable attorney fees by the Township as a result
thereof. No judgment shall commence or be imposed, levied or payable
until the date of the determination of a violation by the district justice. If
the defendant neither pays nor timely appeals the judgment, the
Township may enforce the judgment pursuant to the applicable rules of
civil procedure. Each day that a violation, unless the district justice
determining that there has been a violation further determines that
there was a good faith basis for the person, partnership or corporation
violating the ordinance to have believed that there was no such
violation, in which event there shall be deemed to have been only one
such violation until the fifth day following the date of the determination
of a violation by the district justice and thereafter each day a violation
continues shall constitute a separate violation. All judgments, costs and
reasonable attorney fees collected for the violation of zoning
ordinances shall be paid over to the township whose ordinance has
been violated. The Court of Common Pleas, upon petition, may grant an
order of stay, upon cause shown, tolling the per diem fine pending a
final adjudication of the violation and judgment.
